bacteria arb identification method the driving mechanism for resistome accumulation in receiving environment is unclear here we took advantage of the enhanced arbs recognition by nanopore long reads

the commonly adopt blastp based method whereas the spectrum of arbs doubled that of the assembled illumina dataset totally we identified 33 arbs genera carrying 65 arg subtypes in the receiving seawater whose concentration was in general 10 times higher than clean seawater s notably we report a primary resistome intrusion caused by the revival of residual microbes survived from disinfection treatment these wwtp borne arbs including several animal human enteric pathogens contributed up to 85 of the receiving water resistome plasmids and class 1 integrons were reckoned as major vehicles

in microbial communities tyers and wright 2019 importantly args are frequently encoded on mobile genetic elements mges which facilitates its transfer and transformation between bacteria among phylogenetically distant lineages zhang et al 2018 for instance human bacterial pathogens might recruit args from microbes colonized in soil and other environments forsberg et al 2012 through horizontal gene transfer hgt therefore recognizing and identifying the host populations of args is crucial to reveal dynamic dissemination of args and prerequisite to uncover the molecular mechanism for amr accumulation in an environment the wastewater treatment plant wwtp is one of the typical hotspot for dissemination of args and proliferation of arbs hendriksen et al 2019 ju et al 2018 even though more than 98 of args could be removed after the wastewater treatment process yang et al 2014 the downstream receiving water body of the wwtp was observed as an important reservoir for transmission of pathogenic bacterial host with alarming resistance level luo et al 2010 existing knowledge regarding the risk of args dissemination from wwtp was primarily derived from the observation of human threat arg genotypes such as blandm 1 kpc 2 etc in receiving environments luo et al 2010 yang et al 2017 2016 despite confirming the release of args from wwtp these qpcr based or culture based effort focusing on specific marker gene offered little quantitative information into the influence of wwtp discharge on natural environment currently the available technique for accessing such influence is based on bayesian source tracking analysis which predicts the apportioned relative contribution of a community originating from a set of source environments chen et al 2019 however the ecological machinery underpinning the statistical results cannot be revealed without exhaustive association between args and corresponding carrying species such resistance increment could be resulted from a combined effect of chemical and biotic factors excessive nutrient wang et al 2017 residual antibiotics heavy metals di cesare et al 2016 lin et al 2019 and non antibiotic pharmaceuticals wang et al 2018 introduced by the discharged effluent reclaimed water all could induce endogenous resistome selection in the native natural community besides that arbs which had survived the disinfection treatment could be activated in the receiving environments where the inhibiting effect of residual disinfectants is minimized also attributing to the resistance accumulation zhu et al 2021 understanding the driving force shaping such resistome booming in receiving environments is essential to establish priority in mitigating args spread and evaluate health risks however this question cannot be fully elucidated without the quantitative source tracking based on precise and extensive identification of the host populations of args given the pressing need to reveal the hosts of args and their fates in diverse environmental settings researchers have tried different approaches including isolation hu et al 2008 paiva et al 2017 epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation pcr hultman et al 2018 high throughput sequencing hst ma et al 2016 isolating arb pure cultures coupled with whole genome sequencing is the standard approach for clinical resistome investigations especially focusing on pathogens however this method is not robust to study environmental resistome as only less than 1 of environmental microbes can be isolated in pure culture kaeberlein et al 2002 recent advances in epicpcr brought new possibility towards environmental bacterial resistance surveillance however the wide application of this pcr based method is constrained by the target primer sets relative low throughput as well as delicate pcr condition to ensure the connection between args and marker gene zhu et al 2013 in recent years hst based metagenomics is gradually becoming the most robust approach to uncover the diversity and abundance of args in environmental microbiomes feng et al 2018 ma et al 2017b however even though the short reads generated by illumina hst can be assembled into contigs to improve resolution in identifying args and the neighbourhood genes it is still challenging to associate args to its host populations because of the fragmented assembly of environmental metagenomes since oxford nanopore sequencing could generate long reads averaging 10 kb in length which is long enough to span most repetitive regions on bacterial genome ashton et al 2015 it provides an opportunity to bridge args and their flanking regions to circumvent the limitations aforementioned in the last five years nanopore based metagenomics has been applied to trace the args dissemination in environmental settings for example xun qian et al applied nanopore metagenomic sequencing to identify enterobacteriaceae as the dominant hosts of antibiotic resistant plasmids in cow feces samples qian et al 2021 and our previous research had found the primary attribution of plasmid enabled resistome in wwtp microbiomes che et al 2019 tools such as nanoarg arango argoty et al 2019 and nanook rt leggett et al 2019 have been developed to enable args identification in nanopore based metagenomic datasets although these pioneering works had demonstrated the feasibility of long reads metagenomics in revealing the hosts and mobility of args numerous key aspects of nanopore sequencing application in environmental resistome study such as similarity threshold for args identification remains to be evaluated and optimized at current stage taken together to elucidate the driving mechanism of resistome dissemination in receiving water body of wwtp the performance of nanopore sequencing in identifying args and corresponding host populations was rigorously evaluated in term of precision and recall in this study the algorithms optimized was wrapped up in a package named argpore2 github com sustc xylab argpore2 to provide a robust workflow to profile the args and trace the arbs in complicated environmental metagenomic samples with the aid of this improved methods chromosomal and non chromosomal encoded args were quantified in an unprecedent high throughput manner in receiving water body wwtps effluent and clean seawater to disentangle the cross linked endogenous resistome selection and exogenous arb intrusion introduced by wwtp discharge the approach adopted in this study demonstrated the value of extensive arb identification in revealing the driving machinery of multifactor coupled resistome booming in complicated environmental conditions thereby paving the way for establishing priority in surveillance of arg dissemination 2 materials and

onto flow cell versions flo min106 r9 4 spoton and sequenced for 16 h 2 6 minion data processing raw minion sequencing of fast5 files resulting from minknow were base called using guppy v4 2 2 transferred into fastq files where adapters and multiple reads were trimmed and demultiplexed with porechop 0 2 4 https github com rrwick porechop from the passed sequences to estimate the error rate of minion sequencing the resulting 1d reads were mapped to the corresponding de novo assembly of illumina sequencing via spades using last version 983 aligner after the adapter trimmed the passed sequences of receiving water samples clean seawater samples and wwtp effluent samples were polished with their respective illumina sequencing datasets via polypolish wick and holt 2021 for the following data analysis general statistical analyses and plotting of resulting data was performed and visualized using nanoplot version 1 20 1 de coster et al 2018 the passed sequences of 24 bacterial isolates were directly assembled using unicycler v0 4 8 wick et al 2017 with self polishing by pilon walker et al 2014 all the basecalled nanopore datasets were deposited into the ncbi sra database prjna753671 as for the identification of antibiotic resistance genes the 1d reads after adaptor removal were aligned to the nucleotide sequences of the sarg database using the argpore2 https github com sustc xylab argpore2 with cut off of alignment length 75 and similarity 75 fig s2 when the args containing regions of a nanopore read overlapped for 75 of their length only the arg hit with higher bit score was kept for this region the concentration of args was determined as copy number one read per copy per million reads in unit of ppm by normalizing the number of args containing reads against that of total nanopore reads the taxonomy classification of the args carrying reads were conducted using centrifuge v1 0 4 kim et al 2016 with the ncbi nonredundant nucleotide sequence database as reference to identify the args carried by plasmids from all the detected args carrying reads the raw reads were aligned to plsdb database galata et al 2019 used with cut off of alignment length 70 and similarity 70 to separate the chromosome plasmids and unclassified sequences with last tool version 983 to confirm plasmids identification next we used the frameshift sensitive mod s 2 t 0 q 0 a 1 p 60 of last tool version 983 to align args carrying reads against the protein database of the ncbi reference sequence database refseq to identify the transposons and integron and only the alignments matching 75 ruvindy et al 2016 amino acid identity over more than 70 of the marker protein transposase or integrase length were kept the completed circular genome and near finished circular genome of 24 bacterial isolates taxonomy were classified using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2020 respectively the genome assembly was annotated using prokka v 1 13 seemann 2014 and the annotated position were aligned to the protein sequences of the card database alcock et al 2020 using blastp with default parameter minimum 95 sequence identity and 90 length cut off for comparison the completed genome of e coli were aligned to each other via brig displaying sequence matches with nucleotide identity 70 alikhan et al 2011 2 7 illumina data processing in addition to nanopore sequencing the same dna was also sent out for high throughput metagenomic sequencing on illumina hiseqxten platform 150 bp paired end reads were generated at the novogen coperation beijing china each sample were targeted to generate 10 gb fastq reads and all the sequenced datasets were deposited into the ncbi sra database prjna753671 for each illumina dataset the clean data after qc by fastp v 0 20 1 chen et al 2018 was de novo assembly via spades with meta mode bankevich et al 2012 with default parameter prodigal was used to call open reading frames orfs before the args like orfs were determined via blastp against the sarg database at e value cut off of 1e 7 with a similarity cut off of 80 yang et al 2013 to compare the resistome profile with nanopore datasets in addition to the blasp searching method the assembled contigs were also subject to resistome annotation using argpore2 2 8 evaluation of argpore2 to validate the args annotation precision of argpore2 602 250 non args bacterial genes as determined by ko annotation were download from kegg database kanehisa and goto 2000 table s1 next we randomly selected 10 000 nucleotide reads from non args genes pool and 100 nucleotide reads from sarg nt database the combined dataset was used for evaluation of argpore2 only hit with identical subtype were counted as valid args identification the validation process was repeated ten times to report the average precision value fig 1 b 2 9 definition of args and arbs source in this study we focused on two types of source tracking analyses using sourcetracker knights et al 2011 since receiving water body is a mixture of clean seawater and wwtp effluent we assume it can serve as a sink in our bayesian algorithm leaving other water types as source to test the sensitivity and performance of sourcetracker ten artificial sink communities were generated containing defined proportions of different sources the evaluation result of ten configuration were conducted in r using sourcetrakcer under default parameter settings rarefaction depth 1000 alpha1 0 001 aplha2 0 01 burnin 100 nrestarts 10 each genus level community profiles were firstly sorted based on abundances and then commonly shared information was extracted and reorganized into matrix format for all samples besides community source tracking we also took args genotype profiling results in source tracking analysis for each sample predicted proportion for three potential sources cleansea wwtp and unknown across five runs was averaged and within the source tracking result of communities and resistome relative standard deviation rsd was calculated across predicted proportions in addition to the wwtp borne group the seawater populations were categorised into three different sub groups based on their shifts in prevalence after receiving wwtp effluent firstly the microbial population of receiving water increased after wwtp effluent discharge namely seawater dominant enriched containing dominant populations higher than 75 populations of clean seawater showed evident 2 fold change increase after receiving wwtp discharge secondly the microbial population of receiving water was decrease after wwtp effluent discharge namely seawater dominant reduce containing higher than 75 populations of clean seawater but dramatic decline by wwtp discharge thirdly the minority population of receiving seawater namely seawater minor for other arbs populations that either showed low abundance in clean seawater community or no strong variation after receiving wwtp discharge 3 results and discussions 3 1 error estimation and statistics of nanopore reads nine independent 24 hour minion sequencing runs resulted in a total of 43 8 gb effective base called data fastq format for the nine metagenomics libraries sequenced with n50 range from 2276 to 9184 bp average median length of 1804 bp maximum length of 69 3 kbp fig s3 based on error profile obtained by mapping nanopore reads to illumina assembly we noticed an indel size of 183 07mb in mapped 1d reads equivalent to an indel frequency of 2 17 for r9 4 1 flow cell chemistry applied in this study averagely 38 3 of these indels were deletions 70 07 mb while the insertions 112 95mb account for 61 7 indel errors despite the overall improved indel frequency compared to previous nanopore chemistry ashton et al 2015 short palindromes 6 kmer of gcgcgc showed exceptionally high insertion frequency z score 9 fig s4 the taxonomic comparison of two biological duplicates of clean seawater samples confirmed that minion based metagenomic sequencing has outstanding stability pearson s r of 0 99 for community and resistome profiling fig s2 3 2 args and arbs identification to identify args and arbs in nanopore datasets a bioinformatics framework argpore2 github com sustc xylab argpore2 was constructed and evaluated fig 1a the integrated database of args was collected from nt version of sarg database v2 yin et al 2018 in which the nucleotide reads belonging to same type of args were clustered by cd hit fu et al 2012 based on the similarity of 90 parameter c 0 9 s 0 9 d 0 with subtypes of clustered queries renamed table s2 args were identified through aligning the raw nanopore reads manually integrated args database with last version of 983 frith et al 2010 whose adaptive seeds algorithm had shown the highest sensitivity for nanopore reads alignment ashton et al 2015 a combined dataset of randomly selected non args genes downloaded from kegg database and sequences from the sarg nt database were used for the evaluation of argpore2 as shown in fig 1b args identification with a similarity cut off of 75 showed precision stably around 95 which indicates effective filtering of false positive hits at this cut off notably the value of similarity cut off increasing greater than 75 showed a minimum effect on improving precision thereafter argpore2 adopted a similarity cut off of 75 over 90 of the subject args length for args identification although similarity cut off used to determine homology is critical in resistome prediction assessment like the above is rare consequently most prior nanopore long reads based args studies applied an overly stringent similarity cut off of 90 or higher to minimize false positive rate che et al 2019 which may in return makes their conclusions suffer from biased resistome profile caused by the skewed view of resistome diversity within the community noteworthy resistome prediction based on protein sequences amino acids alignment could reach a precision more than 97 with recall around 30 at blastp similarity cut off of 80 chen et al 2021 the evaluation of argpore2 demonstrated that nanopore based dna alignment is capable to predict args at an accuracy comparable to that of this widely adopted blastp method therefore the appraisal of limited sequencing accuracy of nanopore sequencing should not diminish its importance as ground breaking framework to overcome the culture and short read assembly barrier for reliable antibiotic resistance identification and host tracking for environmental resistome investigations thanks to the long read length of nanopore sequencing genomic fragments containing args could be phylogenetically annotated with ease using modern tools to balance the trade off between computational cost including database index size ram requirement and run speed and the priority of annotating arbs down to strain level argpore2 combines taxonomic results from tools of centrifuge kim et al 2016 against its ncbi nonredundant nucleotide sequence database and last against metaphlan marker gene database v2 truong et al 2017 for phylogenetic assignment of arbs in contrast to the robust phylogenetic annotation of nanopore long reads the inherent repetitive nature of flanking regions of exogenous args obtained by horizontal gene transfer will leave numerous gaps in the assembled genomes resulting in args containing contigs too short to be phylogenetically annotated in short reads datasets in our illumina based datasets only 18 args containing contigs are identified in 10 bacterial genera affiliated to 3 classes by metagenomic assembly accounting for 0 04 of the receiving water bacterial community which constituted a very small fraction of resistome detected by unassembled short reads fig 2 a in contrast nanopore datasets detect 380 arbs with phylogenetic spectrum enlarged to 33 genera affiliated to 12 classes which was enlarged at least for 2 fold additionally culture based validation demonstrated a high degree of congruence with arbs profile revealed by nanopore sequencing which revealed that escherichia and klebsiella were predominant resistant populations whereas the escherichia carrying diverse args against beta lactam were overlooked by illumina assembly fig 2a b notably such mis leading arbs detection by illumina assembly in our water sample is likely the norm rather than an exception in environmental communities in feces samples of adult chicken over a full treatment course of chlortetracycline at a therapeutic dose only 160 args containing contigs were recovered from assembly whereas the args level was as high as 7762 gb ma et al 2016 therefore these results indicate the assembly free approach by nanopore sequencing could disclose a more thorough and unbiased arbs composition which is critical to understand the environmental spread of resistance as will be put forward the importance of exhaustive arbs detection was demonstrated in tracking the source of args pollution by identifying the key resistant groups in subsequent sections 3 3 enrichment of resistome in wwtps receiving waterbody nanopore based metagenomic sequencing was applied on three types of water samples namely three receiving seawater samples collected at three different time points 7am 14pm and 19pm of one day three parallel clean seawater samples collected 5 km upstream of the wwtp discharging point and three parallel effluent samples of the corresponding wwtp fig s5 such extensive nanopore based metagenomics detected totally 780 args carrying nanopore long reads with average length of 4471 bp table s3 and about 74 of them could be phylogenetically assigned at genus level as shown in fig 3 a totally 65 subtypes belonging to 14 types of args were detected microbial resistance against 12 classes of antibiotics were detected in receiving seawater samples while we only identified 6 types in the clean seawater samples the strong antimicrobial resistance in the receiving water could also be evidenced by prevalent of multidrug resistant isolates in the culturing test fig s1 the overall resistome concentration of receiving water community was roughly 10 times higher than of clean seawater with subtypes of tem group1 oxa group2 aac 6 i aada and dfra7 a17 being the most sharply increased chen et al 2019 ju et al 2018 luo et al 2010 yang et al 2019 beta lactam resistance genes were the most dominant resistance type in receiving water samples primarily composed of tem group and oxa group furthermore tem group beta lactamases aada aminoglycoside dfra7 a17 trimethoprim which had shown evident clinical relevancy cameron et al 2018 liu et al 2008 white et al 2000 were among the most prevalent resistance genotypes in receiving water samples 3 4 microbial mechanism driving the resistance booming in receiving water body the real time and long length capability of nanopore sequencing is substantial to rapidly identify and trace the potential antimicrobial resistant pathogens arps in receiving water according to the bayesian source tracking results wwtp showed major impact on the overall resistome prediction 85 rsd 1 98 and community prediction 70 rsd 3 90 of receiving water table s8 evidencing the strong influence by the discharge of wwtp chen et al 2019 ju et al 2018 luo et al 2010 yang et al 2019 despite the relatively small source library size the trained model showed satisfactory prediction performance with significant correlation p 0 01 observed between predicted and expected contribution in artificial configurations fig s6 and fig s7 to further disentangle the cross linked impact of endogenous selection of local arbs in seawater and exogeneous arbs input by wwtps discharge the major source of arbs was determined based on their shift of relative abundance in receiving water and clean seawater community if arb contained in the wwtp effluent showed extremely low abundance lower than 25 populations in clean seawater community while evidently dominated the receiving water community abundance higher than 75 populations it would be considered as wwtp borne in this study as shown in fig 3d despite the nonnegligible args background of clean seawater above 85 0 resistome of receiving seawater were attributed by the arbs within the wwtp borne group indicating the clear attribution of wwtp discharged exogenous resistome whose enrichment could be partly facilitated by the minimized disinfectant concentration in the receiving water table s4 worth to note is that 187 putative pathogen species were detected in the receiving seawater community among them 98 args carrying pathogens were detected with total relative abundance of 0 13 fig 3d among them four eskape pathogen species of e coli k pneumoniae a baumannii and p aeruginosa were identified in the receiving water community tem group1 sul1 and veb group1 were mainly presented in e coli and k pneumoniae which is in consistency to the resistance genotypes encoded by clinically isolated eskape strains zhang et al 2021 suggesting their phenotypic relevance to pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance these results reinforced the high risk of receiving water body as a reservoir and vehicle for arps proliferation in environment and for the first time allowed elucidation of to what extent the accumulation of exogenous arbs could drive the resistome of local natural communities 3 5 distribution of mobile args in receiving water body the potential mobility of identified args were investigated by identifying the mges associated genes localized on the same genetic fragment long nanopore read results showed that args identified in all clean seawater and receiving seawater were mostly located on bacterial chromosomes 74 rather than on plasmids which was contradictory to that observed in wwtp associated resistome including influent activated sludge and effluent che et al 2019 as for the general trend the args encoded on plasmids and chromosomes were more prevalent in receiving water samples than in clean seawater samples args types of fosmidomycin chloramphenicol mls quinolone bacitracin trimethoprim and tetracycline were only presented in receiving seawater samples fig 4 nevertheless more than half proportion 54 of args were encoded on chromosomes rather than plasmids in the receiving water samples which showed the similar trend of the whole resistome distribution in all samples it is worthy to notice that args against fosmidomycin widely disseminated via plasmids in environmental and clinical community arca 1997 martini et al 2016 were only identified on the plasmids additionally the args containing plasmids are extensively associated with clinically relevant pathogens like e coli k oxytoca k pneumoniae p aeruginosa s marcescens and b megaterium in addition to plasmids a variety of mges were identified on the chromosomes indeed 16 subtypes belonging to 6 arg types showed close genetic association with integrons transposons and recombinase implying their high tendency of hgt fig 5 the genetic organization revealed by nanopore long reads showed strong connections between aac families aad families and sul1 fig 5 which are important components of gene cassettes of class 1 integron cl1 ma et al 2017a since cl1 had been reported as clinically relevant genetic elements with the ability to transfer args conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics gillings et al 2015 these findings plus a widespread of class 1 integron integrase gene inti 1 in all receiving water samples demonstrated that cl1 have played an important role in enabling hgt of chromosomal args among bacteria of different phylogenetic lineages interestingly no mges could be detected on args carrying plasmids indicating a generally distinct transmission machinery between chromosomal and non chromosomal resistome in receiving water community 4 conclusion to understand the mechanism arousing the environmental resistome reservoir of costal receiving water communities this study audaciously applied nanopore sequencing technologies to comprehensively investigate the dissemination and enrichment of arbs a robust bioinformatic framework argpore2 was constructed and carefully tested to predict resistance and establish plasmids mge associated mobility an overall consistent resistome was observed between illumina based and nanopore based metagenomic approaches however compared to illumina assembled contigs nanopore sequencing datasets generated more reliable arb profile that resistome of beta lactamase carried by escherichia overlooked by illumina assembled approach was accurately detected by nanopore sequencing highlighting the power of assembly free long reads metagenomic approaches for assessing the mobile proportion of the resistome our results suggested the receiving costal system might be considered as a reservoir for args mediated by the robust installation of wwtp borne arb community coupled with recombination and hgt enabled by plasmids and class 1 integrons consequently in order to mitigate resistance pollution in receiving environments advanced filtration or oxidative process should be included in the disinfection step of wwtps to enable more complete disruption of pathogen cells and endospores during treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

though more than 98 of args could be removed after the wastewater treatment process yang et al 2014 the downstream receiving water body of the wwtp was observed as an important reservoir for transmission of pathogenic bacterial host with alarming resistance level luo et al 2010 existing knowledge regarding the risk of args dissemination from wwtp was primarily derived from the observation of human threat arg genotypes such as blandm 1 kpc 2 etc in receiving environments luo et al 2010 yang et al 2017 2016 despite confirming the release of args from wwtp these qpcr based or culture based effort focusing on specific marker gene offered little quantitative information into the influence of wwtp discharge on natural environment currently the available technique for accessing such influence is based on bayesian source tracking analysis which predicts the apportioned relative contribution of a community originating from a set of source environments chen et al 2019 however the ecological machinery underpinning the statistical results cannot be revealed without exhaustive association between args and corresponding carrying species such resistance increment could be resulted from a combined effect of chemical and biotic factors excessive nutrient wang et al 2017 residual antibiotics heavy metals di cesare et al 2016 lin et al 2019 and non antibiotic pharmaceuticals wang et al 2018 introduced by the discharged effluent reclaimed water all could induce endogenous resistome selection in the native natural community besides that arbs which had survived the disinfection treatment could be activated in the receiving environments where the inhibiting effect of residual disinfectants is minimized also attributing to the resistance accumulation zhu et al 2021 understanding the driving force shaping such resistome booming in receiving environments is essential to establish priority in mitigating args spread and evaluate health risks however this question cannot be fully elucidated without the quantitative source tracking based on precise and extensive identification of the host populations of args given the pressing need to reveal the hosts of args and their fates in diverse environmental settings researchers have tried different approaches including isolation hu et al 2008 paiva et al 2017 epicpcr emulsion paired isolation and concatenation pcr hultman et al 2018 high throughput sequencing hst ma et al 2016 isolating arb pure cultures coupled with whole genome sequencing is the standard approach for clinical resistome investigations especially focusing on pathogens however this method is not robust to study environmental resistome as only less than 1 of environmental microbes can be isolated in pure culture kaeberlein et al 2002 recent advances in epicpcr brought new possibility towards environmental bacterial resistance surveillance however the wide application of this pcr based method is constrained by the target primer sets relative low throughput as well as delicate pcr condition to ensure the connection between args and marker gene zhu et al 2013 in recent years hst based metagenomics is gradually becoming the most robust approach to uncover the diversity and abundance of args in environmental microbiomes feng et al 2018 ma et al 2017b however even though the short reads generated by illumina hst can be assembled into contigs to improve resolution in identifying args and the neighbourhood genes it is still challenging to associate args to its host populations because of the fragmented assembly of environmental metagenomes since oxford nanopore sequencing could generate long reads averaging 10 kb in length which is long enough to span most repetitive regions on bacterial genome ashton et al 2015 it provides an opportunity to bridge args and their flanking regions to circumvent the limitations aforementioned in the last five years nanopore based metagenomics has been applied to trace the args dissemination in environmental settings for example xun qian et al applied nanopore metagenomic sequencing to identify enterobacteriaceae as the dominant hosts of antibiotic resistant plasmids in cow feces samples qian et al 2021 and our previous research had found the primary attribution of plasmid enabled resistome in wwtp microbiomes che et al 2019 tools such as nanoarg arango argoty et al 2019 and nanook rt leggett et al 2019 have been developed to enable args identification in nanopore based metagenomic datasets although these pioneering works had demonstrated the feasibility of long reads metagenomics in revealing the hosts and mobility of args numerous key aspects of nanopore sequencing application in environmental resistome study such as similarity threshold for args identification remains to be evaluated and optimized at current stage taken together to elucidate the driving mechanism of resistome dissemination in receiving water body of wwtp the performance of nanopore sequencing in identifying args and corresponding host populations was rigorously evaluated in term of precision and recall in this study the algorithms optimized was wrapped up in a package named argpore2 github com sustc xylab argpore2 to provide a robust workflow to profile the args and trace the arbs in complicated environmental metagenomic samples with the aid of this improved methods chromosomal and non chromosomal encoded args were quantified in an unprecedent high throughput manner in receiving water body wwtps effluent and clean seawater to disentangle the cross linked endogenous resistome selection and exogenous arb intrusion introduced by wwtp discharge the approach adopted in this study demonstrated the value of extensive arb identification in revealing the driving machinery of multifactor coupled resistome booming in complicated environmental conditions thereby paving the way for establishing priority in surveillance of arg dissemination 2 materials and

onto flow cell versions flo min106 r9 4 spoton and sequenced for 16 h 2 6 minion data processing raw minion sequencing of fast5 files resulting from minknow were base called using guppy v4 2 2 transferred into fastq files where adapters and multiple reads were trimmed and demultiplexed with porechop 0 2 4 https github com rrwick porechop from the passed sequences to estimate the error rate of minion sequencing the resulting 1d reads were mapped to the corresponding de novo assembly of illumina sequencing via spades using last version 983 aligner after the adapter trimmed the passed sequences of receiving water samples clean seawater samples and wwtp effluent samples were polished with their respective illumina sequencing datasets via polypolish wick and holt 2021 for the following data analysis general statistical analyses and plotting of resulting data was performed and visualized using nanoplot version 1 20 1 de coster et al 2018 the passed sequences of 24 bacterial isolates were directly assembled using unicycler v0 4 8 wick et al 2017 with self polishing by pilon walker et al 2014 all the basecalled nanopore datasets were deposited into the ncbi sra database prjna753671 as for the identification of antibiotic resistance genes the 1d reads after adaptor removal were aligned to the nucleotide sequences of the sarg database using the argpore2 https github com sustc xylab argpore2 with cut off of alignment length 75 and similarity 75 fig s2 when the args containing regions of a nanopore read overlapped for 75 of their length only the arg hit with higher bit score was kept for this region the concentration of args was determined as copy number one read per copy per million reads in unit of ppm by normalizing the number of args containing reads against that of total nanopore reads the taxonomy classification of the args carrying reads were conducted using centrifuge v1 0 4 kim et al 2016 with the ncbi nonredundant nucleotide sequence database as reference to identify the args carried by plasmids from all the detected args carrying reads the raw reads were aligned to plsdb database galata et al 2019 used with cut off of alignment length 70 and similarity 70 to separate the chromosome plasmids and unclassified sequences with last tool version 983 to confirm plasmids identification next we used the frameshift sensitive mod s 2 t 0 q 0 a 1 p 60 of last tool version 983 to align args carrying reads against the protein database of the ncbi reference sequence database refseq to identify the transposons and integron and only the alignments matching 75 ruvindy et al 2016 amino acid identity over more than 70 of the marker protein transposase or integrase length were kept the completed circular genome and near finished circular genome of 24 bacterial isolates taxonomy were classified using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2020 respectively the genome assembly was annotated using prokka v 1 13 seemann 2014 and the annotated position were aligned to the protein sequences of the card database alcock et al 2020 using blastp with default parameter minimum 95 sequence identity and 90 length cut off for comparison the completed genome of e coli were aligned to each other via brig displaying sequence matches with nucleotide identity 70 alikhan et al 2011 2 7 illumina data processing in addition to nanopore sequencing the same dna was also sent out for high throughput metagenomic sequencing on illumina hiseqxten platform 150 bp paired end reads were generated at the novogen coperation beijing china each sample were targeted to generate 10 gb fastq reads and all the sequenced datasets were deposited into the ncbi sra database prjna753671 for each illumina dataset the clean data after qc by fastp v 0 20 1 chen et al 2018 was de novo assembly via spades with meta mode bankevich et al 2012 with default parameter prodigal was used to call open reading frames orfs before the args like orfs were determined via blastp against the sarg database at e value cut off of 1e 7 with a similarity cut off of 80 yang et al 2013 to compare the resistome profile with nanopore datasets in addition to the blasp searching method the assembled contigs were also subject to resistome annotation using argpore2 2 8 evaluation of argpore2 to validate the args annotation precision of argpore2 602 250 non args bacterial genes as determined by ko annotation were download from kegg database kanehisa and goto 2000 table s1 next we randomly selected 10 000 nucleotide reads from non args genes pool and 100 nucleotide reads from sarg nt database the combined dataset was used for evaluation of argpore2 only hit with identical subtype were counted as valid args identification the validation process was repeated ten times to report the average precision value fig 1 b 2 9 definition of args and arbs source in this study we focused on two types of source tracking analyses using sourcetracker knights et al 2011 since receiving water body is a mixture of clean seawater and wwtp effluent we assume it can serve as a sink in our bayesian algorithm leaving other water types as source to test the sensitivity and performance of sourcetracker ten artificial sink communities were generated containing defined proportions of different sources the evaluation result of ten configuration were conducted in r using sourcetrakcer under default parameter settings rarefaction depth 1000 alpha1 0 001 aplha2 0 01 burnin 100 nrestarts 10 each genus level community profiles were firstly sorted based on abundances and then commonly shared information was extracted and reorganized into matrix format for all samples besides community source tracking we also took args genotype profiling results in source tracking analysis for each sample predicted proportion for three potential sources cleansea wwtp and unknown across five runs was averaged and within the source tracking result of communities and resistome relative standard deviation rsd was calculated across predicted proportions in addition to the wwtp borne group the seawater populations were categorised into three different sub groups based on their shifts in prevalence after receiving wwtp effluent firstly the microbial population of receiving water increased after wwtp effluent discharge namely seawater dominant enriched containing dominant populations higher than 75 populations of clean seawater showed evident 2 fold change increase after receiving wwtp discharge secondly the microbial population of receiving water was decrease after wwtp effluent discharge namely seawater dominant reduce containing higher than 75 populations of clean seawater but dramatic decline by wwtp discharge thirdly the minority population of receiving seawater namely seawater minor for other arbs populations that either showed low abundance in clean seawater community or no strong variation after receiving wwtp discharge 3 results and discussions 3 1 error estimation and statistics of nanopore reads nine independent 24 hour minion sequencing runs resulted in a total of 43 8 gb effective base called data fastq format for the nine metagenomics libraries sequenced with n50 range from 2276 to 9184 bp average median length of 1804 bp maximum length of 69 3 kbp fig s3 based on error profile obtained by mapping nanopore reads to illumina assembly we noticed an indel size of 183 07mb in mapped 1d reads equivalent to an indel frequency of 2 17 for r9 4 1 flow cell chemistry applied in this study averagely 38 3 of these indels were deletions 70 07 mb while the insertions 112 95mb account for 61 7 indel errors despite the overall improved indel frequency compared to previous nanopore chemistry ashton et al 2015 short palindromes 6 kmer of gcgcgc showed exceptionally high insertion frequency z score 9 fig s4 the taxonomic comparison of two biological duplicates of clean seawater samples confirmed that minion based metagenomic sequencing has outstanding stability pearson s r of 0 99 for community and resistome profiling fig s2 3 2 args and arbs identification to identify args and arbs in nanopore datasets a bioinformatics framework argpore2 github com sustc xylab argpore2 was constructed and evaluated fig 1a the integrated database of args was collected from nt version of sarg database v2 yin et al 2018 in which the nucleotide reads belonging to same type of args were clustered by cd hit fu et al 2012 based on the similarity of 90 parameter c 0 9 s 0 9 d 0 with subtypes of clustered queries renamed table s2 args were identified through aligning the raw nanopore reads manually integrated args database with last version of 983 frith et al 2010 whose adaptive seeds algorithm had shown the highest sensitivity for nanopore reads alignment ashton et al 2015 a combined dataset of randomly selected non args genes downloaded from kegg database and sequences from the sarg nt database were used for the evaluation of argpore2 as shown in fig 1b args identification with a similarity cut off of 75 showed precision stably around 95 which indicates effective filtering of false positive hits at this cut off notably the value of similarity cut off increasing greater than 75 showed a minimum effect on improving precision thereafter argpore2 adopted a similarity cut off of 75 over 90 of the subject args length for args identification although similarity cut off used to determine homology is critical in resistome prediction assessment like the above is rare consequently most prior nanopore long reads based args studies applied an overly stringent similarity cut off of 90 or higher to minimize false positive rate che et al 2019 which may in return makes their conclusions suffer from biased resistome profile caused by the skewed view of resistome diversity within the community noteworthy resistome prediction based on protein sequences amino acids alignment could reach a precision more than 97 with recall around 30 at blastp similarity cut off of 80 chen et al 2021 the evaluation of argpore2 demonstrated that nanopore based dna alignment is capable to predict args at an accuracy comparable to that of this widely adopted blastp method therefore the appraisal of limited sequencing accuracy of nanopore sequencing should not diminish its importance as ground breaking framework to overcome the culture and short read assembly barrier for reliable antibiotic resistance identification and host tracking for environmental resistome investigations thanks to the long read length of nanopore sequencing genomic fragments containing args could be phylogenetically annotated with ease using modern tools to balance the trade off between computational cost including database index size ram requirement and run speed and the priority of annotating arbs down to strain level argpore2 combines taxonomic results from tools of centrifuge kim et al 2016 against its ncbi nonredundant nucleotide sequence database and last against metaphlan marker gene database v2 truong et al 2017 for phylogenetic assignment of arbs in contrast to the robust phylogenetic annotation of nanopore long reads the inherent repetitive nature of flanking regions of exogenous args obtained by horizontal gene transfer will leave numerous gaps in the assembled genomes resulting in args containing contigs too short to be phylogenetically annotated in short reads datasets in our illumina based datasets only 18 args containing contigs are identified in 10 bacterial genera affiliated to 3 classes by metagenomic assembly accounting for 0 04 of the receiving water bacterial community which constituted a very small fraction of resistome detected by unassembled short reads fig 2 a in contrast nanopore datasets detect 380 arbs with phylogenetic spectrum enlarged to 33 genera affiliated to 12 classes which was enlarged at least for 2 fold additionally culture based validation demonstrated a high degree of congruence with arbs profile revealed by nanopore sequencing which revealed that escherichia and klebsiella were predominant resistant populations whereas the escherichia carrying diverse args against beta lactam were overlooked by illumina assembly fig 2a b notably such mis leading arbs detection by illumina assembly in our water sample is likely the norm rather than an exception in environmental communities in feces samples of adult chicken over a full treatment course of chlortetracycline at a therapeutic dose only 160 args containing contigs were recovered from assembly whereas the args level was as high as 7762 gb ma et al 2016 therefore these results indicate the assembly free approach by nanopore sequencing could disclose a more thorough and unbiased arbs composition which is critical to understand the environmental spread of resistance as will be put forward the importance of exhaustive arbs detection was demonstrated in tracking the source of args pollution by identifying the key resistant groups in subsequent sections 3 3 enrichment of resistome in wwtps receiving waterbody nanopore based metagenomic sequencing was applied on three types of water samples namely three receiving seawater samples collected at three different time points 7am 14pm and 19pm of one day three parallel clean seawater samples collected 5 km upstream of the wwtp discharging point and three parallel effluent samples of the corresponding wwtp fig s5 such extensive nanopore based metagenomics detected totally 780 args carrying nanopore long reads with average length of 4471 bp table s3 and about 74 of them could be phylogenetically assigned at genus level as shown in fig 3 a totally 65 subtypes belonging to 14 types of args were detected microbial resistance against 12 classes of antibiotics were detected in receiving seawater samples while we only identified 6 types in the clean seawater samples the strong antimicrobial resistance in the receiving water could also be evidenced by prevalent of multidrug resistant isolates in the culturing test fig s1 the overall resistome concentration of receiving water community was roughly 10 times higher than of clean seawater with subtypes of tem group1 oxa group2 aac 6 i aada and dfra7 a17 being the most sharply increased chen et al 2019 ju et al 2018 luo et al 2010 yang et al 2019 beta lactam resistance genes were the most dominant resistance type in receiving water samples primarily composed of tem group and oxa group furthermore tem group beta lactamases aada aminoglycoside dfra7 a17 trimethoprim which had shown evident clinical relevancy cameron et al 2018 liu et al 2008 white et al 2000 were among the most prevalent resistance genotypes in receiving water samples 3 4 microbial mechanism driving the resistance booming in receiving water body the real time and long length capability of nanopore sequencing is substantial to rapidly identify and trace the potential antimicrobial resistant pathogens arps in receiving water according to the bayesian source tracking results wwtp showed major impact on the overall resistome prediction 85 rsd 1 98 and community prediction 70 rsd 3 90 of receiving water table s8 evidencing the strong influence by the discharge of wwtp chen et al 2019 ju et al 2018 luo et al 2010 yang et al 2019 despite the relatively small source library size the trained model showed satisfactory prediction performance with significant correlation p 0 01 observed between predicted and expected contribution in artificial configurations fig s6 and fig s7 to further disentangle the cross linked impact of endogenous selection of local arbs in seawater and exogeneous arbs input by wwtps discharge the major source of arbs was determined based on their shift of relative abundance in receiving water and clean seawater community if arb contained in the wwtp effluent showed extremely low abundance lower than 25 populations in clean seawater community while evidently dominated the receiving water community abundance higher than 75 populations it would be considered as wwtp borne in this study as shown in fig 3d despite the nonnegligible args background of clean seawater above 85 0 resistome of receiving seawater were attributed by the arbs within the wwtp borne group indicating the clear attribution of wwtp discharged exogenous resistome whose enrichment could be partly facilitated by the minimized disinfectant concentration in the receiving water table s4 worth to note is that 187 putative pathogen species were detected in the receiving seawater community among them 98 args carrying pathogens were detected with total relative abundance of 0 13 fig 3d among them four eskape pathogen species of e coli k pneumoniae a baumannii and p aeruginosa were identified in the receiving water community tem group1 sul1 and veb group1 were mainly presented in e coli and k pneumoniae which is in consistency to the resistance genotypes encoded by clinically isolated eskape strains zhang et al 2021 suggesting their phenotypic relevance to pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance these results reinforced the high risk of receiving water body as a reservoir and vehicle for arps proliferation in environment and for the first time allowed elucidation of to what extent the accumulation of exogenous arbs could drive the resistome of local natural communities 3 5 distribution of mobile args in receiving water body the potential mobility of identified args were investigated by identifying the mges associated genes localized on the same genetic fragment long nanopore read results showed that args identified in all clean seawater and receiving seawater were mostly located on bacterial chromosomes 74 rather than on plasmids which was contradictory to that observed in wwtp associated resistome including influent activated sludge and effluent che et al 2019 as for the general trend the args encoded on plasmids and chromosomes were more prevalent in receiving water samples than in clean seawater samples args types of fosmidomycin chloramphenicol mls quinolone bacitracin trimethoprim and tetracycline were only presented in receiving seawater samples fig 4 nevertheless more than half proportion 54 of args were encoded on chromosomes rather than plasmids in the receiving water samples which showed the similar trend of the whole resistome distribution in all samples it is worthy to notice that args against fosmidomycin widely disseminated via plasmids in environmental and clinical community arca 1997 martini et al 2016 were only identified on the plasmids additionally the args containing plasmids are extensively associated with clinically relevant pathogens like e coli k oxytoca k pneumoniae p aeruginosa s marcescens and b megaterium in addition to plasmids a variety of mges were identified on the chromosomes indeed 16 subtypes belonging to 6 arg types showed close genetic association with integrons transposons and recombinase implying their high tendency of hgt fig 5 the genetic organization revealed by nanopore long reads showed strong connections between aac families aad families and sul1 fig 5 which are important components of gene cassettes of class 1 integron cl1 ma et al 2017a since cl1 had been reported as clinically relevant genetic elements with the ability to transfer args conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics gillings et al 2015 these findings plus a widespread of class 1 integron integrase gene inti 1 in all receiving water samples demonstrated that cl1 have played an important role in enabling hgt of chromosomal args among bacteria of different phylogenetic lineages interestingly no mges could be detected on args carrying plasmids indicating a generally distinct transmission machinery between chromosomal and non chromosomal resistome in receiving water community 4 conclusion to understand the mechanism arousing the environmental resistome reservoir of costal receiving water communities this study audaciously applied nanopore sequencing technologies to comprehensively investigate the dissemination and enrichment of arbs a robust bioinformatic framework argpore2 was constructed and carefully tested to predict resistance and establish plasmids mge associated mobility an overall consistent resistome was observed between illumina based and nanopore based metagenomic approaches however compared to illumina assembled contigs nanopore sequencing datasets generated more reliable arb profile that resistome of beta lactamase carried by escherichia overlooked by illumina assembled approach was accurately detected by nanopore sequencing highlighting the power of assembly free long reads metagenomic approaches for assessing the mobile proportion of the resistome our results suggested the receiving costal system might be considered as a reservoir for args mediated by the robust installation of wwtp borne arb community coupled with recombination and hgt enabled by plasmids and class 1 integrons consequently in order to mitigate resistance pollution in receiving environments advanced filtration or oxidative process should be included in the disinfection step of wwtps to enable more complete disruption of pathogen cells and endospores during treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15411,the unstable microbial activity and unsatisfactory settling performance impede the development and implementation of microalgal wastewater treatment especially in high ammonium wastewater in the presence of free ammonia fa the shock of fa due to the nutrient fluctuation in wastewater was demonstrated as the primary stress factor suppressing microalgal activities recent study has clearly revealed the inhibition mechanism of fa at a specific high level 110 97 mg l by inhibiting the genetic information processing photosynthesis and nutrient metabolism however the effects of various fa shock concentrations on microalgal activities and settling performance remain unknown limiting the wastewater bioremediation efficiencies improvement and the process development herein a concentration dependent shock fa that was employed on microalgae during their exponential growth stages effect on microalgal growth and photosynthesis was observed results showed that the studied five fa shock concentrations ranging from 25 to 125 mg l significantly inhibited biomass production by 14 7 57 0 but sharp reductions in photosynthesis with the 36 0 49 0 decreased fv fm values were only observed when fa concentration was above 75 0 mg l on the other hand fa shock enhanced microalgal settling efficiency by 12 8 fold which was believed to be due to the stimulated intra and extracellular protein contents and thereby the enhanced extracellular polymer substances eps secretion specifically fa shock induced 40 2 2 3 higher cellular protein content at the cost of the decreased carbohydrates 22 6 1 3 and fatty acid 39 0 0 8 contents further improving the protein secretion by 1 21 fold and the eps production by 40 2 2 3 these fa shock induced variations in intra and extracellular biomolecules were supported by the up regulated protein processing and export at the assistance of excessive energy generated from fatty acid degradation and carbohydrates consumption in addition fa shock significantly decreased the biomass nutritional value as indicated by the 1 86 fold lower essential amino acid score and nearly 50 reduced essential to non essential amino acids ratio while slightly decreased the biodiesel quality this study is expected to enrich the knowledge of microalgal activities and settling performance in response to fluctuant ammonium concentrations in wastewater and to promote the development of microalgal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater free ammonia shock settling microalgae extracellular polymer substances intracellular biomolecules data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae based wastewater bioremediation is being considered as a promising alternative to conventional biological technologies e g activated sludge owing to its competitive advantages such as nutrient recovery greenhouse gas emission reduction together with value added biomass production abbew et al 2022 lu et al 2018 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 nonetheless the unstable and inefficient bioremediation performance is one of the limitations that impede its scale up which could be due to multifaceted factors such as microalgae species cultivation conditions e g temperature light intensity and wastewater characteristics e g nutrient concentration li et al 2019a nagarajan et al 2020 in particular the fluctuant wastewater quantity and quality normally occurring in the wastewater treatment plant lead to the unpredictably unstable wastewater characteristics which needs to be particularly focused on for microalgal wastewater system for instance the existence of free ammonia fa which is the product of ammonium nh4 n and ph has been demonstrated to suppress microalgal activities especially in high nh4 n wastewater shen et al 2020 however the fa shock influences on microalgal activities and system stability remain unknown on one hand to date a few relevant studies exposed microalgae to the fa contained wastewater or medium jiang et al 2021 li et al 2019b markou et al 2016 markou and muylaert 2016 but these findings were not applicable to microalgae experiencing abrupt and short term fa exposure 0 57 560 mg l in the practical wastewater environment fux et al 2006 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 our recent study firstly reported an instant inhibition and subsequent self adaptation when chlorella sp that had grown into the logarithmic stage was treated with fa injection of specific concentration 110 97 mg l and proposed the inherent mechanism based on the phycological and genetic responses chen et al 2022 for instance nutrient metabolism showed to be one of the most affected pathways specifically fa shock inhibited nh4 n uptake through repressing glutamine synthetase glutamine α oxoglutarate aminotransferase cycle and inactivating glutamate dehydrogenase pathway while the overall enhanced nutrient uptake e g cod po4 3 p promoted microalgal self adaptation activities nonetheless the fa concentration that is calculated according to equation eq 1 where c represents the nh4 n concentration mg l and kb kw e6344 273 t c kb and kw represent weak base ionization constant and ion product constant of water respectively varies with the wastewater conditions i e temperature ph nh4 n thus it still requires further investigation into the influence of various fa shock conditions on microalgal activities 1 fa mg l 17 c 1 0 ph 14 k b k w 1 0 ph on the other hand it s necessary to study microalgal settling performance exposed to fa shock as microalgal separation from wastewater is another limitation that impedes microalgal wastewater bioremediation from industrial application ge et al 2016 it is believed that microalgal harvesting would be an energy consuming process with insufficient microalgal settling efficiency se because the overall harvesting cost using conventional techniques e g centrifuge filtration typically contributes 10 35 and even up to 90 of the total energy input tu et al 2017 however limited research is available regarding the relationship between fa shock and microalgal settleability notably the underlying mechanism behind microalgal self flocculation is still obscure with no definite answer specifically extracellular polymer substances eps mainly consisting of exoprotein pn and exopolysacchrides ps has been considered as the main contributor to microbial self aggregation behavior li et al 2020 yin et al 2020 in addition it s reasonable to hypothesize that intracellular components contributing to the excretion of eps might be involved in microalgal settling as well which requires further investigation collectively obtaining insights into mutual responses of intra and extracellular biochemical components would facilitate a better understanding on microalgal aggregation behavior in response to fa shock this study aims to investigate the effects of various fa shock levels on microalgal activities as well as elucidate the potential contribution of mutual eps and intracellular biomolecules to microalgal settling performance firstly a series of fa shock was applied to wastewater born microalgae to evaluate the response of microalgal activities afterwards a typical fa shock level was selected and used to assess its effect on microalgal separation behavior from wastewater eps content and intracellular components were further determined and the potential molecular regulation mechanism was investigated through rna sequencing analysis an integrated intra and extracellular response towards fa shock was finally proposed and the potential contribution of eps and intracellular components to microalgal aggregation behavior was specifically discussed the downstream application potential of biomass was evaluated as well this fundamental research is expected to fill the knowledge gap in the response of microalgal activities and settling performance towards dynamic wastewater characteristics and further promote the development of microalgae based wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae strain and cultivation conditions a

chlorella sp was exposed to a series of fa shock concentrations i e 0 25 50 75 100 and 125 mg l which correspond to control fa25 fa50 fa75 fa100 fa125 groups respectively to evaluate the response of microalgal activities to different fa shock levels this fa shock range was determined based on both fa fluctuation levels 0 57 560 mg l in wastewater and our previous finding that microalgal growth was almost inhibited when fa level was above 110 mg l fux et al 2006 liu et al 2021 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 afterwards a representative fa shock concentration of 110 97 mg l was selected according to the responses of microalgal growth and photosynthesis to assess microalgal settling behavior microalgal biochemical compositions i e eps including pn and ps intracellular biomolecules including protein and carbohydrates contents were further determined to investigate their potential contribution to microalgal settleability rna de novo sequencing assembly and analysis were performed to elucidate the inherent molecular mechanism biomass application potential was ultimately evaluated based on fatty acid and amino acid profiles erlenmeyer flasks with working volume of 350 ml were used as photobioreactors pbrs the initial microalgal density was controlled at od680 optimal density at 680 nm around 0 1 three biological replicates were conducted for each experiment flasks were

data were exhibited as means standard deviations one way analysis of variance anova with least significant difference lsd and t test were employed to determine significance between experimental groups at a least significance level of 0 05 graphpad software inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration dependent effect of fa shock on microalgal activities fig 1 represents the variation of microalgal growth and photosynthetic activities exposed to fa shock of different levels it was obvious that the influence of fa shock on microalgal activities was concentration dependent firstly the distinctly declined tendency in microalgal growth was instantly observed after the shock injection of fa above 75 mg l while the biomass concentration continued to increase in other groups with lower fa concentrations fig 1 a this could be further confirmed by the significantly decreased growth rates as compared in table 1 p 0 05 one way anova the specific growth rate in the control was 1 63 2 60 and 3 25 fold higher than that in fa25 fa50 and fa75 groups respectively while negative values were obtained in fa100 0 04 0 02 d 1 and fa125 groups 0 09 0 03 d 1 consequently the final biomass concentrations were lower in all fa groups compared with that in the control 14 7 3 7 27 6 0 1 29 1 0 6 48 6 0 1 and 57 0 2 8 lower in fa25 fa50 fa75 fa100 and fa125 groups respectively suggesting the repressed nutrient uptake accordingly the biomass productivities were significantly reduced with the shock fa levels table 1 p 0 05 one way anova and a negative linear correlation between fa shock concentration x and biomass productivities y was observed fig s1 y 0 1902 x 37 38 r2 0 967 secondly the response of microalgal photosynthetic activities also showed to depend on the fa shock levels specifically a sharp reduction by 36 0 2 0 and 49 0 0 2 respectively and subsequently considerable enhancement in the fv fm value by 26 5 6 4 and 26 6 10 8 respectively was observed for both fa100 and fa125 groups while it gradually decreased in other groups other than fa25 group 0 6 20 4 fig 1 b this might be due to the negative response of the antioxidant enzymes activities that failed to remove the excessive reactive oxygen species ros produced under high fa levels above 75 mg l gill and tuteja 2010 further deteriorating photosynthetic activities at the end of the experiment microalgal photosynthesis was found to be severely inhibited when fa shock concentration was above 25 mg l compared with the control the fa50 fa75 fa100 and fa125 groups obtained the decreased fv fm values by 13 0 1 0 18 9 2 1 23 7 4 9 and 39 2 5 9 respectively p 0 05 one way anova it should be noted that microalgal biomass concentration was still lower than that of control in the fa25 group fig 1 a despite no significant difference was observed in photochemical activities fig 1 b this observation indicated that other metabolic processes could be the targets of fa shock as well e g nutrient metabolism which had been demonstrated in our recent study chen et al 2022 on the other hand the remarkably suppressed photosynthesis in fa100 and fa125 groups was in line with the decreased microalgal growth therefore fa concentration of 110 97 mg l that ranging between 100 and 125 mg l was then further applied to investigate microalgal settling performance under fa shock condition 3 2 influence of fa shock on microalgal settling performance related to intra and extracellular biomolecules the settleability performance of microalgae exposed to fa shock of 110 97 mg l was significantly enhanced as indicated by the 12 8 fold higher se fig 2 a t test p 0 001 it was believed that microbial aggregation behavior and settling performance largely depended on the intra and extracellular biocomposition thus the effects of fa shock on eps and intracellular biomolecules were systematically evaluated 3 2 1 variations in intra and extracellular biomolecules to defend against fa shock as shown in fig 2 b the fa shock resulted in an increase of 55 1 3 2 in the total eps content p 0 05 t test as a typical response against unfavorable environments ge et al 2016 shen et al 2020 among the increased eps pn was believed to be the primary contributor with the following considerations firstly pn ranging from 72 to 80 of the total eps showed to be the major component for both groups fig 2 b moreover the increase in pn overweighed that of ps 1 71 fold enhanced pn vs 1 13 fold higher ps this could be attributed to pn s stress defense capabilities such as generation of excess energy for microalgal activities by degrading other eps components and promotion of ros scavenging chen et al 2021 the observed enhanced pn was supported by the up regulated co translational translocation protein export fig 2 c which is the biosynthesis pathway for most secreted proteins voorhees and hegde 2016 specifically the involved genes presented elevated expressions including sec61a coding protein transport protein subunit and srpr coding signal recognition particle receptor subunit whereas transcript coding endoplasmic reticulum chaperone bip that participating in post translational translocation repressed expression of 2 86 fold which required further investigation unexpectedly only humic acid like substances ex em 224 370 nm 365 410 nm were identified through 3d eem fluorescence spectra fig 2 d and e while additional protein like substances were observed in our previous study using the same microalgal strain chen et al 2021 which could be due to the dynamic eps components xu et al 2013 on the other hand the humic acid like substances content appeared to increase upon exposure to fa shock in terms of peak fluorescence intensity 1769 vs 1479 a u in the control which was consistent with the decreased microalgal growth fig 1 a attributed to the fact that decomposition of apoptotic cells would contribute to the accumulation of humic acids qu et al 2012 with respect to the fa shock influence on intracellular biocompositions chlorella sp enhanced protein accumulation while reduced lipid and carbohydrates storage in response to fa shock firstly an increase of 40 2 2 3 in protein content was observed fig 3 a p 0 05 t test which was supported by multiple upregulated expressions of genes involved in protein processing including canx coding calnexin sar1 coding gtp binding protein and sec31 and sec24 coding protein transport proteins fig 3 b this was consistent with literature reporting that accumulation of protein was a defense behavior towards stressful environments through synthesis of stress related proteins e g proteins with protective functions such as ros scavenging detoxification enzymes etc kosova et al 2018 for instance the self adaptation of photosynthetic activities after fa shock injection as noted in section 3 1 involved series of enzymatic reactions e g antioxidase for ros scavenging oxidative phosphorylation op for energy production chen et al 2022 therefore the enhanced protein synthesis could ensure the proceeding of these metabolic processes on the other hand internal proteins were partially exported as pn under the upregulation of protein export to assist microalgal defense against fa shock stress secondly carbohydrates content was decreased by 22 6 1 3 exposed to fa shock fig 3 a p 0 05 t test considering that starch is the most abundant storage carbohydrates in microalgae cheng et al 2017 response of starch metabolic process was then evaluated through rna sequencing analysis most genes involved in starch metabolism were also found to repress expressions fig 3 c including hexokinase hk glucose 1 phosphate adenylyltransferase glgc starch synthase glga and waxy and 1 4 alphaglucan branching enzyme glgb thirdly lipid content represented as the sum of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was reduced by 39 0 0 8 in the fa group fig 3 d p 0 05 t test notably transcripts participating in tag metabolism which is the major storage lipid in most microalgae sajjadi et al 2018 exhibited different expression patterns fig 3 e for instance akr1a1 coding alcohol dehydrogenase glpk coding glycerol kinase dpp1 coding diacylglycerol diphosphate phosphatase and dgat2 coding diacylglycerol o acyltransferase 2 were highly up regulated while the expression levels of aldh coding aldehyde dehydrogenase and lpt1 coding lysophospholipid acyltransferase significantly decreased this could be attributed to the down regulated fatty acid biosynthesis but up regulation of fatty acid degradation pathway fig 3 f and 3g suggesting that fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis simultaneously took place in microalgae while the former one was more active in the presence of fa shock previous findings argued that microalgae tend to synthesize energy intensive molecules i e carbohydrates lipid under stress environments kato et al 2021 ran et al 2019 in this study possible reasons behind the reduced carbohydrates and lipid storage under fa shock condition were concluded as follows i internal carbohydrates consumption and fatty acid degradation could provide excess energy for microalgal metabolic processes our recent study further demonstrated the upregulations of downstream carbohydrates utilization pathways in the order of glycolysis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and op during the self adaptation of microalgal activities chen et al 2022 suggesting the improved energy production because op is the central energy metabolism for microbial overall activities kong et al 2018 on the other hand fatty acid degradation mainly in the form of β oxidation in microalgae could also provide energy for microalgal activities through producing excess acetyl coa kong et al 2018 which is an essential substrate for tca cycle ii the increased protein accumulation would compete the common carbon precursor with carbohydrates and lipid synthesis to be more specific mutual carbohydrates lipid and amino acid the crucial component of protein metabolisms share a common pool of three carbon molecules such as glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate chen et al 2020 therefore the enhanced protein synthesis would lead to the c3 precursor redistribution and consequently reduce the carbon partitioning for carbohydrates and lipid accumulation 3 2 2 enhanced pn secretion facilitated microalgal settling as a result of increased protein accumulation and reduced lipid and carbohydrates storage under fa shock a comprehensive response of both intra and extracellular compositions towards fa shock was proposed based on the discussions in section 3 2 1 fig 4 specifically protein accumulation was promoted not only for synthesis of intracellular stress related proteins but also acting as feedstock for pn secretion while carbohydrates and lipid storage were reduced to generate excess energy for overall microalgal activities given that eps plays a crucial role in microbial aggregation it was believed that pn which was the major component of eps in this study held dominant contribution to the enhancement of microalgal se this was in line with our previous finding that the contribution of eps to microalgal improved settling performance could be attributed to the location rearrangement and the enriched biological functions of four functional pn categories including algal cell adhesion molecules metal ion binding pn carbohydrates synthesis affiliated proteins and protease inhibitors which was supported by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory calculation chen et al 2021 it should be noted that ps could be involved in microalgal aggregation as well despite limited information is available regarding its complex structure and biological functions for instance wang et al 2020 reported that higher branching degree of ps was crucial to cellular hydrophobicity and aggregation behavior based on the outcomings of enzymatic experiment that is designed to hydrolyze ps branched chain intracellular components were believed to potentially contribute to enhanced microalgal se with the following considerations firstly eps components are transported from internal storage donot et al 2012 thus the intracellular proteins are crucial feedstock for pn production moreover considering that eps biosynthesis and transport are energy consuming zhang et al 2019b the carbohydrates consumption and fatty acid degradation could generate excess energy for these processes collectively part of the accumulated proteins was exported as pn under the upregulation of protein export with the assistance of excess energy produced from carbohydrates consumption and fatty acid degradation hence it is reasonable to conclude that variations in intracellular biomolecules also contributed to microalgal enhanced settleability through ensuring the proceeding of pn secretion 3 3 influence of fa shock on microalgal biomass quality the downstream biomass utilization partially affects the sustainability and economic efficiency of microalgal wastewater treatment system protein quality and biomass derived biodiesel properties were then evaluated as microalgal biomass has shown great application potential in food and bioenergy industries kumar et al 2021 the total amino acids i e sum of eaas and neaas were 25 2 7 2 higher in the fa group than that of control table 2 p 0 01 t test this observation was consistent with the determined protein content as noted in section 3 3 due to the fact that protein is comprised of amino acids zhang et al 2019a according to the fao who standard lys was the laa for both groups it should be noted that however fa shock decreased the nutritional value of microalgae as indicated by the 1 86 fold lower eaa score moreover nearly 50 reduction in eaas neaas ratio was also observed due to the 21 9 6 2 decreased eaas and 46 4 8 0 higher neaas contents table 2 p 0 01 t test further suggesting the decreased biological quality of protein it was believed that microalgal defense against fa shock led to the variations in amino acid profile thus decreasing the protein nutritional values firstly it could be attributed to the overall decreased eaas and increased neaas contents in particular among neaas glu ala and gaba exhibited increments of 88 0 14 0 142 1 15 7 and 1 421 230 respectively notably gaba has been reported to act as signal molecules regulating stress defense through enhancing antioxidant activities bown and shelp 2016 zhao et al 2020 while ala and glu are substrates for the synthesis of glutathione which is a non enzyme antioxidant laporte et al 2016 mao et al 2022 moreover the reduction in lysine content which was identified as the laa for both groups could be due to its transformation into other substances such as gaba to raise the stress tolerance level baum et al 1996 with respect to the property of biomass derived biodiesel it is strongly associated with the contents of saturated fatty acids monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa in microalgae rai and gupta 2017 in this study pufa took up the majority among the fatty acids 48 7 49 4 with c18 3 being the dominant component 33 0 34 7 c16 0 18 5 20 2 and c17 1 17 3 18 7 are another two abundant fatty acids in both groups fig 3 d in line with literatures reporting that c16 c18 are the predominant fatty acids in microalgae chiu et al 2015 shokravi et al 2022 notably the abundant pufa content especially c18 3 also known as omega 3 also makes chlorella sp a value added source for food supplement ferreira et al 2019 biomass derived biodiesel characteristics were then calculated based on fatty acid profile as shown in table 3 fa shock caused minor influence on the biomass derived biodiesel quality compared with that on protein nutritional value for instance comparable os lcsf cfpp kinematic viscosity and hhv values were obtained in the control and fa group notably significantly low cfpp values were observed in both groups 9 92 and 10 83 c for the control and fa group respectively compared to that of en 14 314 standard 0 25 c suggesting great flow property at low temperature the slightly higher iv value obtained in the fa group 123 39 g i2 100 g oil vs 120 g i2 100 g oil in the control implied potential increased risk of glycerides polymerization and lubricant deposition in the engine slightly increased sv value 179 36 vs 170 78 mg koh g oil in the control suggested lower biodiesel production and irregular biodiesel combustion in the engine while the decreased cn value 48 97 vs 51 23 in the control indicated reduced combustion efficiency enhanced green house gas e g nitrous oxide emission and longer ignition delay time rai and gupta 2017 3 4 environmental significance for promoting microalgal wastewater treatment this study investigated the influence of various fa shock concentrations on microalgal activities as well as microalgal settling performance under fa shock condition results suggested that microalgal response towards fa shock was concentration dependent and fa shock significantly improved microalgal settleability through the mutual contribution of intra and extracellular biomolecules these observations enhance current understanding of the influence of wastewater characteristics on microalgae based wastewater treatment and are expected to shed light on operation strategies adjustment and optimization in response to fluctuant wastewater quality e g fa shock level in order to achieve efficient and stable wastewater treatment for instance exogenous chemicals e g organic carbon source antioxidants could be employed to assist microalgal self adaptation from severe fa shock inhibition chen et al 2022 and moreover the hydraulic retention time could be shortened accordingly under fa shock condition owing to the enhanced microalgal settling efficiency 4 conclusion in this study the effects of fa shock on chlorella sp in wastewater including microalgal activities settling performance and biomass quality were systematically investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 response of microalgal activities depended on fa shock concentration fa shock ranging from 25 to 125 mg l significantly decreased biomass production while sharp reductions in photosynthesis were only observed when fa shock concentration was above 75 mg l 2 fa shock remarkably enhanced microalgal settling efficiency up to 12 8 fold and mutual intra and extracellular biomolecules were believed to be involved in microalgal aggregation behavior specifically pn taking up the majority of eps 72 80 showed to be the predominant contributor while the increased intracellular protein accumulation and reduced lipid and carbohydrates storage ensured the proceeding of pn biosynthesis 3 fa shock significantly decreased biomass nutritional value but slightly affected the biomass derived biodiesel quality the proportion of essential amino acids was largely reduced as well as the ratio of essential to non essential amino acids despite fa shock stimulated the biosynthesis of amino acid on the other hand comparable biodiesel

15411,the unstable microbial activity and unsatisfactory settling performance impede the development and implementation of microalgal wastewater treatment especially in high ammonium wastewater in the presence of free ammonia fa the shock of fa due to the nutrient fluctuation in wastewater was demonstrated as the primary stress factor suppressing microalgal activities recent study has clearly revealed the inhibition mechanism of fa at a specific high level 110 97 mg l by inhibiting the genetic information processing photosynthesis and nutrient metabolism however the effects of various fa shock concentrations on microalgal activities and settling performance remain unknown limiting the wastewater bioremediation efficiencies improvement and the process development herein a concentration dependent shock fa that was employed on microalgae during their exponential growth stages effect on microalgal growth and photosynthesis was observed results showed that the studied five fa shock concentrations ranging from 25 to 125 mg l significantly inhibited biomass production by 14 7 57 0 but sharp reductions in photosynthesis with the 36 0 49 0 decreased fv fm values were only observed when fa concentration was above 75 0 mg l on the other hand fa shock enhanced microalgal settling efficiency by 12 8 fold which was believed to be due to the stimulated intra and extracellular protein contents and thereby the enhanced extracellular polymer substances eps secretion specifically fa shock induced 40 2 2 3 higher cellular protein content at the cost of the decreased carbohydrates 22 6 1 3 and fatty acid 39 0 0 8 contents further improving the protein secretion by 1 21 fold and the eps production by 40 2 2 3 these fa shock induced variations in intra and extracellular biomolecules were supported by the up regulated protein processing and export at the assistance of excessive energy generated from fatty acid degradation and carbohydrates consumption in addition fa shock significantly decreased the biomass nutritional value as indicated by the 1 86 fold lower essential amino acid score and nearly 50 reduced essential to non essential amino acids ratio while slightly decreased the biodiesel quality this study is expected to enrich the knowledge of microalgal activities and settling performance in response to fluctuant ammonium concentrations in wastewater and to promote the development of microalgal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater free ammonia shock settling microalgae extracellular polymer substances intracellular biomolecules data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microalgae based wastewater bioremediation is being considered as a promising alternative to conventional biological technologies e g activated sludge owing to its competitive advantages such as nutrient recovery greenhouse gas emission reduction together with value added biomass production abbew et al 2022 lu et al 2018 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 nonetheless the unstable and inefficient bioremediation performance is one of the limitations that impede its scale up which could be due to multifaceted factors such as microalgae species cultivation conditions e g temperature light intensity and wastewater characteristics e g nutrient concentration li et al 2019a nagarajan et al 2020 in particular the fluctuant wastewater quantity and quality normally occurring in the wastewater treatment plant lead to the unpredictably unstable wastewater characteristics which needs to be particularly focused on for microalgal wastewater system for instance the existence of free ammonia fa which is the product of ammonium nh4 n and ph has been demonstrated to suppress microalgal activities especially in high nh4 n wastewater shen et al 2020 however the fa shock influences on microalgal activities and system stability remain unknown on one hand to date a few relevant studies exposed microalgae to the fa contained wastewater or medium jiang et al 2021 li et al 2019b markou et al 2016 markou and muylaert 2016 but these findings were not applicable to microalgae experiencing abrupt and short term fa exposure 0 57 560 mg l in the practical wastewater environment fux et al 2006 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 our recent study firstly reported an instant inhibition and subsequent self adaptation when chlorella sp that had grown into the logarithmic stage was treated with fa injection of specific concentration 110 97 mg l and proposed the inherent mechanism based on the phycological and genetic responses chen et al 2022 for instance nutrient metabolism showed to be one of the most affected pathways specifically fa shock inhibited nh4 n uptake through repressing glutamine synthetase glutamine α oxoglutarate aminotransferase cycle and inactivating glutamate dehydrogenase pathway while the overall enhanced nutrient uptake e g cod po4 3 p promoted microalgal self adaptation activities nonetheless the fa concentration that is calculated according to equation eq 1 where c represents the nh4 n concentration mg l and kb kw e6344 273 t c kb and kw represent weak base ionization constant and ion product constant of water respectively varies with the wastewater conditions i e temperature ph nh4 n thus it still requires further investigation into the influence of various fa shock conditions on microalgal activities 1 fa mg l 17 c 1 0 ph 14 k b k w 1 0 ph on the other hand it s necessary to study microalgal settling performance exposed to fa shock as microalgal separation from wastewater is another limitation that impedes microalgal wastewater bioremediation from industrial application ge et al 2016 it is believed that microalgal harvesting would be an energy consuming process with insufficient microalgal settling efficiency se because the overall harvesting cost using conventional techniques e g centrifuge filtration typically contributes 10 35 and even up to 90 of the total energy input tu et al 2017 however limited research is available regarding the relationship between fa shock and microalgal settleability notably the underlying mechanism behind microalgal self flocculation is still obscure with no definite answer specifically extracellular polymer substances eps mainly consisting of exoprotein pn and exopolysacchrides ps has been considered as the main contributor to microbial self aggregation behavior li et al 2020 yin et al 2020 in addition it s reasonable to hypothesize that intracellular components contributing to the excretion of eps might be involved in microalgal settling as well which requires further investigation collectively obtaining insights into mutual responses of intra and extracellular biochemical components would facilitate a better understanding on microalgal aggregation behavior in response to fa shock this study aims to investigate the effects of various fa shock levels on microalgal activities as well as elucidate the potential contribution of mutual eps and intracellular biomolecules to microalgal settling performance firstly a series of fa shock was applied to wastewater born microalgae to evaluate the response of microalgal activities afterwards a typical fa shock level was selected and used to assess its effect on microalgal separation behavior from wastewater eps content and intracellular components were further determined and the potential molecular regulation mechanism was investigated through rna sequencing analysis an integrated intra and extracellular response towards fa shock was finally proposed and the potential contribution of eps and intracellular components to microalgal aggregation behavior was specifically discussed the downstream application potential of biomass was evaluated as well this fundamental research is expected to fill the knowledge gap in the response of microalgal activities and settling performance towards dynamic wastewater characteristics and further promote the development of microalgae based wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae strain and cultivation conditions a

2 experiment design 2 2 1 fa shock influence on microalgal activities and settling performance microalgae that had grown into the logarithmic phase was used in the following experiments firstly chlorella sp was exposed to a series of fa shock concentrations i e 0 25 50 75 100 and 125 mg l which correspond to control fa25 fa50 fa75 fa100 fa125 groups respectively to evaluate the response of microalgal activities to different fa shock levels this fa shock range was determined based on both fa fluctuation levels 0 57 560 mg l in wastewater and our previous finding that microalgal growth was almost inhibited when fa level was above 110 mg l fux et al 2006 liu et al 2021 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 afterwards a representative fa shock concentration of 110 97 mg l was selected according to the responses of microalgal growth and photosynthesis to assess microalgal settling behavior microalgal biochemical compositions i e eps including pn and ps intracellular biomolecules including protein and carbohydrates contents were further determined to investigate their potential contribution to microalgal settleability rna de novo sequencing assembly and analysis were performed to elucidate the inherent molecular mechanism biomass application potential was ultimately evaluated based on fatty acid and amino acid profiles erlenmeyer flasks with working volume of 350 ml were used as photobioreactors pbrs the initial microalgal density was controlled at od680 optimal density at 680 nm around 0 1 three biological replicates were conducted for each experiment flasks were

microalgal settling test microalgal settling test was performed 12 h after fa shock at room temperature 25 0 2 c under ambient light irradiation according to our previous study chen et al 2021 briefly

data were exhibited as means standard deviations one way analysis of variance anova with least significant difference lsd and t test were employed to determine significance between experimental groups at a least significance level of 0 05 graphpad software inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration dependent effect of fa shock on microalgal activities fig 1 represents the variation of microalgal growth and photosynthetic activities exposed to fa shock of different levels it was obvious that the influence of fa shock on microalgal activities was concentration dependent firstly the distinctly declined tendency in microalgal growth was instantly observed after the shock injection of fa above 75 mg l while the biomass concentration continued to increase in other groups with lower fa concentrations fig 1 a this could be further confirmed by the significantly decreased growth rates as compared in table 1 p 0 05 one way anova the specific growth rate in the control was 1 63 2 60 and 3 25 fold higher than that in fa25 fa50 and fa75 groups respectively while negative values were obtained in fa100 0 04 0 02 d 1 and fa125 groups 0 09 0 03 d 1 consequently the final biomass concentrations were lower in all fa groups compared with that in the control 14 7 3 7 27 6 0 1 29 1 0 6 48 6 0 1 and 57 0 2 8 lower in fa25 fa50 fa75 fa100 and fa125 groups respectively suggesting the repressed nutrient uptake accordingly the biomass productivities were significantly reduced with the shock fa levels table 1 p 0 05 one way anova and a negative linear correlation between fa shock concentration x and biomass productivities y was observed fig s1 y 0 1902 x 37 38 r2 0 967 secondly the response of microalgal photosynthetic activities also showed to depend on the fa shock levels specifically a sharp reduction by 36 0 2 0 and 49 0 0 2 respectively and subsequently considerable enhancement in the fv fm value by 26 5 6 4 and 26 6 10 8 respectively was observed for both fa100 and fa125 groups while it gradually decreased in other groups other than fa25 group 0 6 20 4 fig 1 b this might be due to the negative response of the antioxidant enzymes activities that failed to remove the excessive reactive oxygen species ros produced under high fa levels above 75 mg l gill and tuteja 2010 further deteriorating photosynthetic activities at the end of the experiment microalgal photosynthesis was found to be severely inhibited when fa shock concentration was above 25 mg l compared with the control the fa50 fa75 fa100 and fa125 groups obtained the decreased fv fm values by 13 0 1 0 18 9 2 1 23 7 4 9 and 39 2 5 9 respectively p 0 05 one way anova it should be noted that microalgal biomass concentration was still lower than that of control in the fa25 group fig 1 a despite no significant difference was observed in photochemical activities fig 1 b this observation indicated that other metabolic processes could be the targets of fa shock as well e g nutrient metabolism which had been demonstrated in our recent study chen et al 2022 on the other hand the remarkably suppressed photosynthesis in fa100 and fa125 groups was in line with the decreased microalgal growth therefore fa concentration of 110 97 mg l that ranging between 100 and 125 mg l was then further applied to investigate microalgal settling performance under fa shock condition 3 2 influence of fa shock on microalgal settling performance related to intra and extracellular biomolecules the settleability performance of microalgae exposed to fa shock of 110 97 mg l was significantly enhanced as indicated by the 12 8 fold higher se fig 2 a t test p 0 001 it was believed that microbial aggregation behavior and settling performance largely depended on the intra and extracellular biocomposition thus the effects of fa shock on eps and intracellular biomolecules were systematically evaluated 3 2 1 variations in intra and extracellular biomolecules to defend against fa shock as shown in fig 2 b the fa shock resulted in an increase of 55 1 3 2 in the total eps content p 0 05 t test as a typical response against unfavorable environments ge et al 2016 shen et al 2020 among the increased eps pn was believed to be the primary contributor with the following considerations firstly pn ranging from 72 to 80 of the total eps showed to be the major component for both groups fig 2 b moreover the increase in pn overweighed that of ps 1 71 fold enhanced pn vs 1 13 fold higher ps this could be attributed to pn s stress defense capabilities such as generation of excess energy for microalgal activities by degrading other eps components and promotion of ros scavenging chen et al 2021 the observed enhanced pn was supported by the up regulated co translational translocation protein export fig 2 c which is the biosynthesis pathway for most secreted proteins voorhees and hegde 2016 specifically the involved genes presented elevated expressions including sec61a coding protein transport protein subunit and srpr coding signal recognition particle receptor subunit whereas transcript coding endoplasmic reticulum chaperone bip that participating in post translational translocation repressed expression of 2 86 fold which required further investigation unexpectedly only humic acid like substances ex em 224 370 nm 365 410 nm were identified through 3d eem fluorescence spectra fig 2 d and e while additional protein like substances were observed in our previous study using the same microalgal strain chen et al 2021 which could be due to the dynamic eps components xu et al 2013 on the other hand the humic acid like substances content appeared to increase upon exposure to fa shock in terms of peak fluorescence intensity 1769 vs 1479 a u in the control which was consistent with the decreased microalgal growth fig 1 a attributed to the fact that decomposition of apoptotic cells would contribute to the accumulation of humic acids qu et al 2012 with respect to the fa shock influence on intracellular biocompositions chlorella sp enhanced protein accumulation while reduced lipid and carbohydrates storage in response to fa shock firstly an increase of 40 2 2 3 in protein content was observed fig 3 a p 0 05 t test which was supported by multiple upregulated expressions of genes involved in protein processing including canx coding calnexin sar1 coding gtp binding protein and sec31 and sec24 coding protein transport proteins fig 3 b this was consistent with literature reporting that accumulation of protein was a defense behavior towards stressful environments through synthesis of stress related proteins e g proteins with protective functions such as ros scavenging detoxification enzymes etc kosova et al 2018 for instance the self adaptation of photosynthetic activities after fa shock injection as noted in section 3 1 involved series of enzymatic reactions e g antioxidase for ros scavenging oxidative phosphorylation op for energy production chen et al 2022 therefore the enhanced protein synthesis could ensure the proceeding of these metabolic processes on the other hand internal proteins were partially exported as pn under the upregulation of protein export to assist microalgal defense against fa shock stress secondly carbohydrates content was decreased by 22 6 1 3 exposed to fa shock fig 3 a p 0 05 t test considering that starch is the most abundant storage carbohydrates in microalgae cheng et al 2017 response of starch metabolic process was then evaluated through rna sequencing analysis most genes involved in starch metabolism were also found to repress expressions fig 3 c including hexokinase hk glucose 1 phosphate adenylyltransferase glgc starch synthase glga and waxy and 1 4 alphaglucan branching enzyme glgb thirdly lipid content represented as the sum of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was reduced by 39 0 0 8 in the fa group fig 3 d p 0 05 t test notably transcripts participating in tag metabolism which is the major storage lipid in most microalgae sajjadi et al 2018 exhibited different expression patterns fig 3 e for instance akr1a1 coding alcohol dehydrogenase glpk coding glycerol kinase dpp1 coding diacylglycerol diphosphate phosphatase and dgat2 coding diacylglycerol o acyltransferase 2 were highly up regulated while the expression levels of aldh coding aldehyde dehydrogenase and lpt1 coding lysophospholipid acyltransferase significantly decreased this could be attributed to the down regulated fatty acid biosynthesis but up regulation of fatty acid degradation pathway fig 3 f and 3g suggesting that fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis simultaneously took place in microalgae while the former one was more active in the presence of fa shock previous findings argued that microalgae tend to synthesize energy intensive molecules i e carbohydrates lipid under stress environments kato et al 2021 ran et al 2019 in this study possible reasons behind the reduced carbohydrates and lipid storage under fa shock condition were concluded as follows i internal carbohydrates consumption and fatty acid degradation could provide excess energy for microalgal metabolic processes our recent study further demonstrated the upregulations of downstream carbohydrates utilization pathways in the order of glycolysis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and op during the self adaptation of microalgal activities chen et al 2022 suggesting the improved energy production because op is the central energy metabolism for microbial overall activities kong et al 2018 on the other hand fatty acid degradation mainly in the form of β oxidation in microalgae could also provide energy for microalgal activities through producing excess acetyl coa kong et al 2018 which is an essential substrate for tca cycle ii the increased protein accumulation would compete the common carbon precursor with carbohydrates and lipid synthesis to be more specific mutual carbohydrates lipid and amino acid the crucial component of protein metabolisms share a common pool of three carbon molecules such as glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate chen et al 2020 therefore the enhanced protein synthesis would lead to the c3 precursor redistribution and consequently reduce the carbon partitioning for carbohydrates and lipid accumulation 3 2 2 enhanced pn secretion facilitated microalgal settling as a result of increased protein accumulation and reduced lipid and carbohydrates storage under fa shock a comprehensive response of both intra and extracellular compositions towards fa shock was proposed based on the discussions in section 3 2 1 fig 4 specifically protein accumulation was promoted not only for synthesis of intracellular stress related proteins but also acting as feedstock for pn secretion while carbohydrates and lipid storage were reduced to generate excess energy for overall microalgal activities given that eps plays a crucial role in microbial aggregation it was believed that pn which was the major component of eps in this study held dominant contribution to the enhancement of microalgal se this was in line with our previous finding that the contribution of eps to microalgal improved settling performance could be attributed to the location rearrangement and the enriched biological functions of four functional pn categories including algal cell adhesion molecules metal ion binding pn carbohydrates synthesis affiliated proteins and protease inhibitors which was supported by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory calculation chen et al 2021 it should be noted that ps could be involved in microalgal aggregation as well despite limited information is available regarding its complex structure and biological functions for instance wang et al 2020 reported that higher branching degree of ps was crucial to cellular hydrophobicity and aggregation behavior based on the outcomings of enzymatic experiment that is designed to hydrolyze ps branched chain intracellular components were believed to potentially contribute to enhanced microalgal se with the following considerations firstly eps components are transported from internal storage donot et al 2012 thus the intracellular proteins are crucial feedstock for pn production moreover considering that eps biosynthesis and transport are energy consuming zhang et al 2019b the carbohydrates consumption and fatty acid degradation could generate excess energy for these processes collectively part of the accumulated proteins was exported as pn under the upregulation of protein export with the assistance of excess energy produced from carbohydrates consumption and fatty acid degradation hence it is reasonable to conclude that variations in intracellular biomolecules also contributed to microalgal enhanced settleability through ensuring the proceeding of pn secretion 3 3 influence of fa shock on microalgal biomass quality the downstream biomass utilization partially affects the sustainability and economic efficiency of microalgal wastewater treatment system protein quality and biomass derived biodiesel properties were then evaluated as microalgal biomass has shown great application potential in food and bioenergy industries kumar et al 2021 the total amino acids i e sum of eaas and neaas were 25 2 7 2 higher in the fa group than that of control table 2 p 0 01 t test this observation was consistent with the determined protein content as noted in section 3 3 due to the fact that protein is comprised of amino acids zhang et al 2019a according to the fao who standard lys was the laa for both groups it should be noted that however fa shock decreased the nutritional value of microalgae as indicated by the 1 86 fold lower eaa score moreover nearly 50 reduction in eaas neaas ratio was also observed due to the 21 9 6 2 decreased eaas and 46 4 8 0 higher neaas contents table 2 p 0 01 t test further suggesting the decreased biological quality of protein it was believed that microalgal defense against fa shock led to the variations in amino acid profile thus decreasing the protein nutritional values firstly it could be attributed to the overall decreased eaas and increased neaas contents in particular among neaas glu ala and gaba exhibited increments of 88 0 14 0 142 1 15 7 and 1 421 230 respectively notably gaba has been reported to act as signal molecules regulating stress defense through enhancing antioxidant activities bown and shelp 2016 zhao et al 2020 while ala and glu are substrates for the synthesis of glutathione which is a non enzyme antioxidant laporte et al 2016 mao et al 2022 moreover the reduction in lysine content which was identified as the laa for both groups could be due to its transformation into other substances such as gaba to raise the stress tolerance level baum et al 1996 with respect to the property of biomass derived biodiesel it is strongly associated with the contents of saturated fatty acids monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa in microalgae rai and gupta 2017 in this study pufa took up the majority among the fatty acids 48 7 49 4 with c18 3 being the dominant component 33 0 34 7 c16 0 18 5 20 2 and c17 1 17 3 18 7 are another two abundant fatty acids in both groups fig 3 d in line with literatures reporting that c16 c18 are the predominant fatty acids in microalgae chiu et al 2015 shokravi et al 2022 notably the abundant pufa content especially c18 3 also known as omega 3 also makes chlorella sp a value added source for food supplement ferreira et al 2019 biomass derived biodiesel characteristics were then calculated based on fatty acid profile as shown in table 3 fa shock caused minor influence on the biomass derived biodiesel quality compared with that on protein nutritional value for instance comparable os lcsf cfpp kinematic viscosity and hhv values were obtained in the control and fa group notably significantly low cfpp values were observed in both groups 9 92 and 10 83 c for the control and fa group respectively compared to that of en 14 314 standard 0 25 c suggesting great flow property at low temperature the slightly higher iv value obtained in the fa group 123 39 g i2 100 g oil vs 120 g i2 100 g oil in the control implied potential increased risk of glycerides polymerization and lubricant deposition in the engine slightly increased sv value 179 36 vs 170 78 mg koh g oil in the control suggested lower biodiesel production and irregular biodiesel combustion in the engine while the decreased cn value 48 97 vs 51 23 in the control indicated reduced combustion efficiency enhanced green house gas e g nitrous oxide emission and longer ignition delay time rai and gupta 2017 3 4 environmental significance for promoting microalgal wastewater treatment this study investigated the influence of various fa shock concentrations on microalgal activities as well as microalgal settling performance under fa shock condition results suggested that microalgal response towards fa shock was concentration dependent and fa shock significantly improved microalgal settleability through the mutual contribution of intra and extracellular biomolecules these observations enhance current understanding of the influence of wastewater characteristics on microalgae based wastewater treatment and are expected to shed light on operation strategies adjustment and optimization in response to fluctuant wastewater quality e g fa shock level in order to achieve efficient and stable wastewater treatment for instance exogenous chemicals e g organic carbon source antioxidants could be employed to assist microalgal self adaptation from severe fa shock inhibition chen et al 2022 and moreover the hydraulic retention time could be shortened accordingly under fa shock condition owing to the enhanced microalgal settling efficiency 4 conclusion in this study the effects of fa shock on chlorella sp in wastewater including microalgal activities settling performance and biomass quality were systematically investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 response of microalgal activities depended on fa shock concentration fa shock ranging from 25 to 125 mg l significantly decreased biomass production while sharp reductions in photosynthesis were only observed when fa shock concentration was above 75 mg l 2 fa shock remarkably enhanced microalgal settling efficiency up to 12 8 fold and mutual intra and extracellular biomolecules were believed to be involved in microalgal aggregation behavior specifically pn taking up the majority of eps 72 80 showed to be the predominant contributor while the increased intracellular protein accumulation and reduced lipid and carbohydrates storage ensured the proceeding of pn biosynthesis 3 fa shock significantly decreased biomass nutritional value but slightly affected the biomass derived biodiesel quality the proportion of essential amino acids was largely reduced as well as the ratio of essential to non essential amino acids despite fa shock stimulated the biosynthesis of amino acid on the other hand comparable biodiesel

energy and nutrient flux in waste treatment systems as well as natural ecosystems crowther et al 2019 lin et al 2017a long et al 2021 whereas elucidating the relationship between microorganisms and the flux remains challenging due to the enormous taxonomic diversity and functional versatility of microorganisms to simplify such complexity of microorganisms prior efforts attempted to categorize microorganisms into ecological groups based on microbial phylogenies martiny et al 2015 body sizes luan et al 2020 functional traits green et al 2008 or life strategies malik et al 2020 a recent study used carbon source as feedstock to culture microorganisms and found that microbial rrna operon rrn copy numbers correlated negatively with feedstock use efficiencies but positively with microbial maximal growth rates roller et al 2016 it further reported that microbial rrn copy numbers indicate microbial life strategies in determining microbial energy allocation into metabolism versus biosynthesis polz and cordero 2016 which provides clues into how microbial life strategies are linked to the energy and nutrient flux the link would be amplified in cross feeding systems fig 1 where the primary energy resource is partially converted by some microorganisms to generate intermediates as foods for the other microorganisms to drive the energy and nutrient flux pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 this is because the flux in cross feeding systems is driven by microbial cross feeding that is heavily influenced by microbial life strategies for example microorganisms with a life strategy of low feedstock use efficiencies often extract only a part of energy from feedstock and excrete high energy intermediates as foods for the other microorganisms which facilitate the cross feeding among microorganisms fig 1 while microorganisms with a life strategy of high feedstock use efficiencies do the opposite polz and cordero 2016 therefore microorganisms with a life strategy of low feedstock use efficiencies facilitate cross feeding and thus the energy and nutrient flux in cross feeding systems the energy and nutrient flux in cross feeding systems is driven by joint efforts of microorganisms within a community and therefore exploring microbial life strategies at community level is more suitable than at individual guilds to understand the relationship between microorganisms and the flux additionally microbial cross feeding is an interaction between different guilds pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 smith et al 2019 so it makes sense to explore microbial life strategies at community level microbial community level life strategies based on the community weighted mean rrn copy number have been widely studied in ecosystems to reveal community level traits in response to environmental alterations chen et al 2021b nemergut et al 2016a wu et al 2017 however the relationship between microbial community level life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux is barely explored a high community weighted mean rrn copy number indicates a community level strategy that most microorganisms show low feedstock use efficiencies roller et al 2016 most microorganisms with low feedstock use efficiencies could excrete high energy intermediates polz and cordero 2016 which underlie the cross feeding among microorganisms a typical example is the anaerobic digestion ad food chain i e hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis where differently functional microorganisms are involved in different steps of the food chain and the products of the upstream steps feed the microorganisms involved in the downstream steps to form cross feeding ultimately driving the energy and nutrient flux lin et al 2017a fig 1 therefore a high community weighted mean rrn copy number facilitates microbial cross feeding although microorganisms are responsible for feedstock degradation feedstock characteristics in turn select for microorganisms with specific life strategies to guarantee the feedstock degradation and thus the energy and nutrient flux in systems therefore microbial life strategies and the flux interplay each other to guarantee the functioning and stability in cross feeding systems we hypothesize that the community level strategy of feedstock use efficiencies indicated by the community weighted mean rrn copy number could predict the status of the energy and nutrient flux in cross feeding systems ad is a typical cross feeding system and easily managed the ch4 is a major end product in the ad food chain fig 1 so daily ch4 production the total ch4 production per day in semi continuous ad could approximate the daily status of energy and nutrient flux in ad therefore ad provides an unique opportunity to test the hypothesis above in cross feeding systems microbial cross feeding seems a bridge between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux because microbial life strategies concerning feedstock use efficiencies affect cross feeding that drives the energy and nutrient flux pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 polz and cordero 2016 a major force driving cross feeding among microorganisms is feedstock characteristics pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 smith et al 2019 for example microorganisms would conduct cross feeding if feedstock is too complex in molecular structure and or in components to be completely degraded by a microorganism alone due to the microbial functioning deficiencies and or thermodynamic constraints contrarily if feedstock is relatively simple in molecular structure and or in components microbial cross feeding is less or not necessary thereby a modulation of the feedstock characteristics allows us to explore the roles of cross feeding in the relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux this knowledge would further improve the understanding and potential application of the relationship swine manure as a major livestock waste mainly consists of proteins lipids carbohydrates and other complex components and represents a common complex feedstock in ad apple waste as a major fruit waste mainly consists of simple sugars that also exist in swine manure as co digestion of livestock manure and fruit wastes has been increasingly applied wang et al 2018b mixing manure and fruit wastes not only provides an opportunity to modulate feedstock complexity but also increase the practical application potential of the results in ad when the total volatile solid in feedstock addition is fixed a replacement of part manure with apple waste would increase the proportion of relatively simple components i e simple sugars and simultaneously decreases the proportions of other complex components e g proteins lipids carbohydrates and other complex components in the feedstock ultimately reducing the feedstock complexity this study conducted ad of swine manure and rice straw a relatively simple and recalcitrant feedstock to address the following questions 1 whether and how microbial community weighted mean rrn copy number in digestate is related to the ch4 production 2 to explore the roles of cross feeding in the relationship feedstock complexity was reduced by replacing part manure with apple waste or fructose a simple sugar in the feedstock addition the increased proportion of simple sugars in the feedstock was assumed to reduce microbial cross feeding simple sugars are also the products during hydrolysis and or acidogenesis in ad food chain so the addition of simple sugars would not strongly affect the existing metabolic pathways in ad but could partially skip the steps of hydrolysis and or acidogenesis thereby reducing the microbial cross feeding within the both steps will the reduced cross feeding weaken the relationship between microbial community weighted mean rrn copy number and the ch4 production 3 feedstock addition supplies fresh nutrients to maintain the energy and nutrient flux in ad do microbial community weighted mean rrn copy numbers in digestate and on straw respond differently to feedstock addition besides rrn copy numbers that represent genomic traits rrn expression ratios that represent transcriptomic features and could estimate microbial potential activity campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 were also used to address the above questions 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup of anaerobic

water to contain 11 4 g vs every 3 days the fructose addition treatment fa was fed 7 2 g fructose powder vs 7 2 g and 300 ml swine manure vs 11 4 g and the control treatment was fed only 300 ml swine

feeding frequency the vs in feedstock addition temperature and digestion volume remained the same across the three periods initial period feedstock change period and recovery period and treatments the vs ratio of swine manure and apple waste in the feedstock addition in aa was determined based on a preliminary experiment that conducted a gradient of vs ratios of swine manure versus apple waste ①16

measured daily by using a water displacement method lin et al 2016 and ch4 and h2 contents in the biogas were measured by a gas chromatography system sp 2000 beifen china equipped with a thermal

added only once at the beginning of ad and not degraded completely at the end of ad which allowed consistently monitoring the dynamics of straw associated microbial communities during ad to reveal how straw associated microbial communities respond to feedstock addition rice straw samples were collected at 4 time points specifically before 2 h before and after on the first day after the first feedstock addition in the feedstock change period and before 2 h before and after on the first day after the first feedstock addition in the recovery period supplementary fig s1 after three times of

godzik 2006 the silva database version 132 quast et al 2012 was used for the taxonomic assignments of otu representative sequences absolute singletons and reads that were not affiliated to prokaryotes were removed the otutab rare function in the usearch pipeline edgar 2010 was used for random normalization of sequences to 8713 per sample supplementary fig s3 the community cohesion index that quantifies the degree of interconnection among taxa within a microbial community herren and mcmahon 2017 was calculated in total 117 samples from 3 treatments at 13 time points based on 16s rrna gene were used to calculate the cohesion index using the r script provided by herren et al https github com cherren8 cohesion with default parameters positive and negative cohesion indexes separately quantify the degrees of positive and negative interconnection among taxa within a microbial community to quantify the degree of total interconnection among taxa within a microbial community the sum of positive cohesion and the absolute value of negative cohesion was used as previous described hernandez et al 2021 higher absolute values of positive cohesion and total cohesion indicate greater degree of interconnection among taxa within a microbial community hernandez et al 2021 herren and mcmahon 2017 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds permutational multivariate analysis of variance

weighted mean rrn copy number and rrn expression ratio using a modified method based on previous studies nemergut et al 2016b wu et al 2017 rrn copy number for each otu was estimated based on the rrn database version 5 7 stoddard et al 2014 the otu representative sequence was queried by blastn with e value 10 10 and identify 80 against the rrn database only 0 4 of all otu representative sequences did not get hits e value 10 10 or identify 80 in the rrn database and their rrn copy numbers were estimated as the mean copy numbers of their parents wu et al 2017 the community weighted mean rrn copy number was calculated for each sample based on 16s rrna gene nemergut et al 2016b wu et al 2017 specifically 1 otu data were standardized by dividing by the corresponding rrn copy number and then the relative abundance for each otu was calculated based on the standardized otu data 2 the community weighted mean rrn copy number was achieved by taking the product of the relative abundance for each otu and the estimated rrn copy number and summing this value across all otus in a sample the rrn expression ratio represents a real time status of rrn expression and could estimate microbial potential activity campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 here both the microbial communities based on 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna in a sample were used to calculate the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio that could estimate overall potential activity of microbial communities specifically 4 the rrn expression ratio of each otu was calculated by 1 otu reads based on 16s rrna 1 otu reads based on 16s rrna gene as previously described campbell et al 2011 5 the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio was achieved by taking the product of the rrn expression ratio of each otu and the relative abundance for each otu based on standardized otu data achieved from the above step 1 and summing this value across all otus in a sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial community level strategies are related to the ch4 production microbial communities based on either 16s rrna gene or 16s rrna were dominated by the phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and spirochaetes and their relative abundances shifted across fermentation stages supplementary fig s4 microbial community structures significantly permanova s p 0 001 changed across fermentation stages fig 2 and supplementary table s1 microbial communities in digestate based on 16s rrna gene significantly permanova s p 0 001 0 15 r2 0 27 in three treatments changed with the shifts of the community weighted mean rrn copy number while microbial communities based on 16s rrna significantly but less closely p 0 001 0 06 r2 0 09 in three treatments changed with the shifts of the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio fig 2 and supplementary table s1 this result indicated that community weighted mean rrn copy number was more relevant than the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio to changes of microbial communities all these results were further validated by distance based redundancy analysis supplementary table s2 in the control fed only swine manure the dynamics of the community weighted mean rrn copy number was positively and significantly correlated with the dynamics of daily ch4 production during the whole ad process p 0 001 r 0 83 and 0 85 in feedstock change and recovery periods respectively pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 the detected correlations were further validated by that there were no autocorrelations breusch godfrey test s p 0 1 of residuals in the linear regression analyses between daily ch4 production and the community weighted mean rrn copy number this result answered our hypothesis that microbial community weighted mean rrn copy number could predict the status of the energy and nutrient flux in ad this result also indicated that the microbial community level strategy of low feedstock use efficiencies based on a high community weighted mean rrn copy number facilitated the ch4 production the ch4 is the end product in the energy and nutrient flux in ad so daily ch4 production in a semi continuous ad could approximate the daily status of the energy and nutrient flux as the energy and nutrient flux in ad is driven by microbial cross feeding that is based on public goods microorganisms with high rrn copy number often excrete high energy intermediates roller et al 2016 which would facilitate cross feeding polz and cordero 2016 and thus the ch4 production in ad therefore a high community weighted mean rrn copy number that implies a high level cross feeding among microorganisms facilitates the energy and nutrient flux in ad and thus the ch4 production to further support that a high value of the community weighted mean rrn copy number could imply a high level cross feeding among microorganisms we calculated the community cohesion index whose high values indicate a high level interconnection among taxa within a microbial community herren and mcmahon 2017 as cross feeding microorganisms are interacting and thus interconnected pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 a high level cross feeding within a microbial community is expected to correspond to a high level interconnection among taxa within this community the community weighted mean rrn copy number was positively and significantly correlated with the total and positive cohesion indexes p 0 001 r 0 72 and 0 79 respectively pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 4 which was in line with our expectations in the population of firmicutes and proteobacteria in the control their community weighted mean rrn copy numbers were positively and significantly p 0 01 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 5 correlated with daily ch4 production microorganisms in the two phyla especially in firmicutes are usually involved in different steps of ad food chain e g hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis long et al 2021 so there is cross feeding among these microorganisms therefore their life strategies are supposed to affect the energy and nutrient flux in ad thus the ch4 production conversely without cross feeding no correlation is expected between the community weighted mean rrn copy numbers and daily ch4 production for example methanogens were dominant in the euryarchaeota in this study and were exclusive for methane metabolism without cross feeding evans et al 2019 in line with expectation we did not find significant correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy numbers of euryarchaeota and daily ch4 production p 0 05 fig 5 on the individual microorganism level we evaluated the relevance between otu relative abundances and daily ch4 production through using coefficient in pearson correlation test by controlling fermentation days and found that otus with more rrn copies showed stronger positive relevance with daily ch4 production p 0 001 r 0 59 pearson correlation test fig 6 among the 42 otus that showed closest relevance pearson s partial correlation test s coefficient 0 6 with ch4 production 86 were from firmicutes that could not directly generate ch4 but are crucial in cross feeding in ad by excreting intermediates long et al 2021 therefore the close relevance between otus with multiple rrn copies and ch4 production was probably because these otus were crucial in cross feeding and could drive the energy and nutrient flux in ad to ultimately generate ch4 a higher community weighted mean rrn copy number also implies microbial higher maximal growth rates roller et al 2016 most of microorganisms are unlikely to reach their maximal growth rates so microbial maximal growth rates are not directly linked to their ecological roles microbial rrn expression ratio represents a real time status of rrn expression in the control the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio was positively and significantly correlated with daily ch4 production during the whole ad process p 0 001 r 0 84 and 0 72 in feedstock change and recovery periods pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 this indicated that besides rrn copy number the real time expression status of rrn was also related to the energy and nutrient flux in ad this is probably because rrn expression ratio could estimate microbial potential activity campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 which was crucial for ad functioning 3 2 reduced feedstock complexity weakens the relationship between microbial community level life strategies and methane production the value range of community weighted mean rrn copy number did not differ significantly t test p 0 05 across the three treatments however the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy number and daily ch4 production became weakened in fa p 0 001 r 0 58 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 and aa r 0 70 compared to the control r 0 83 in the feedstock change period in the recovery period when the feedstock complexity in aa and fa were recovered to the same as that in the control the strength of correlations in fa r 0 79 and aa r 0 91 were also recovered similar with the control r 0 85 this result indicated that the reduced feedstock complexity weakened the correlations between community level life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux the cross feeding seems a bridge between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux if cross feeding becomes weakened the relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux would become weakened without microbial cross feeding microbial life strategies are not related to the flux a typical example is the methanogen cultivation by simple feedstocks h2 acetate or methanol where ch4 was generated without cross feeding and rrn copy number of the methanogen was not related to ch4 production lin et al 2017b the feedstock complexity was reduced by replacing a part of swine manure with apple waste or fructose and both apple waste and fructose could directly provide simple sugars that are products of hydrolysis and or acidogenesis in ad food chain wang et al 2018a therefore the replacement partially skipped the steps of hydrolysis and or acidogenesis and reduced the degree of cross feeding especially between microorganisms responsible for hydrolysis usually involving lots of microorganisms ma et al 2013 and the downstream microorganisms these simple sugars could be completely degraded by most microorganisms alone without cross feeding although methane production in aa and fa increased due to skipping hydrolysis and or acidogenesis to speed up the energy and nutrient flux through the ad food web the reduced feedstock complexity decreased microbial cross feeding and thus weakened the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy number and ch4 production in aa and fa the addition of simple sugars probably biasedly benefited specific microorganisms with competitive advantage rather than most members within a community and thus reduced cross feeding among most microorganisms the reduced feedstock complexity also weakened the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy number and the total and positive cohesion indexes p 0 02 r 0 39 and p 0 01 r 0 45 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 4 in fa and aa p 0 01 r 0 47 and p 0 001 r 0 51 compare to the control p 0 001 r 0 72 and p 0 001 r 0 79 on the individual microorganism level the correlation between otu rrn copy number and otu relevance to daily ch4 production was also weakened in fa p 0 109 r 0 110 pearson correlation test fig 6 and aa p 0 001 r 0 284 compared to the control p 0 001 r 0 590 these results further indicated that the weakened relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux was caused by the decrease of feedstock complexity due to the difficulty of strictly manipulating the multiple different components in the real wastes e g swine manure and apple wastes this study only elucidated and compared the relationships between in high feedstock complexity and in relatively low feedstock complexity whether the strength of the relationship is linearly correlated with feedstock complexity is warranted in further studies and this study confirmed the importance of feedstock complexity in the relationship the reduced feedstock complexity also weakened the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio and daily ch4 production in fa p 0 23 r 0 31 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 and aa p 0 35 r 0 24 compared to the control p 0 001 r 0 84 in the feedstock change period in the recovery period the strength of correlations increased in fa r 0 41 and aa r 0 87 close to the control r 0 72 this result indicated the reduced feedstock complexity also weakened the correlation between the potential activity of microbial communities and the energy and nutrient flux in ad the energy and nutrient flux depends on the activity of all microorganisms in cooperation lin et al 2016 ma et al 2013 simple sugars could be accessed by most microorganisms so the addition of apple waste or fructose would reduce the substrate specificity however the addition of apple waste or fructose was unlikely to facilitate most microorganisms but probably activates only specific microorganisms with competitive advantage in accessing simple and labile feedstocks in the feedstock change period the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio decreased in fa and aa but increased in the control after feedstock addition while in the recovery period the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio increased in the three treatments digestate samples fig 7 a as the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio implies the overall potential activity of microbial communities campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 this result implied that the addition of apple waste or fructose actually reduced the potential activity of most microorganisms but only activated specific microorganisms in firmicutes in this context the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio was not necessary to be associated with the energy and nutrient flux 3 3 life strategies of microbial communities in digestate and on straw respond differently to feedstock addition the feedstock addition in semi continuous ad supplies fresh nutrients for microorganisms and maintains the energy and nutrient flux therefore exploring the responses of microbial life strategies to the feedstock addition helps to understand the relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux the community weighted mean rrn copy number increased after feedstock addition in the feedstock change period p 0 01 fold change 1 17 and recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 17 in the control increased less obviously in the feedstock change period p 0 56 fold change 1 06 than in recovery period p 0 05 fold change 1 11 in fa and increased less obviously in the feedstock change period p 0 01 fold change 1 13 than in recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 26 in aa digestate samples fig 7b therefore feedstock addition increased the community weighted mean rrn copy number but the reduced feedstock complexity weakened the magnitude of the increase prior studies reveal the community weighted mean rrn copy number increases when nutrient concentrations increase chen et al 2021a nemergut et al 2016a wu et al 2017 in this study the feedstock addition certainly increased nutrient concentrations and thus the community weighted mean rrn copy number remarkably the total nutrient vs 18 6 g in the feedstock addition was the same across the three treatments but the addition of the reduced complex feedstock in fa and aa weakened the increase of the community weighted mean rrn copy number fig 7b this phenomenon was more obviously in the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio with a decrease in feedstock change period p 0 22 fold change 0 91 but an increase in recovery period p 0 19 fold change 1 16 in fa and a decrease in feedstock change period p 0 08 fold change 0 86 but an increase in recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 28 in aa compared to the control with an increase in both feedstock change period p 0 04 fold change 1 14 and recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 23 digestate samples fig 7b swine manure is a complex feedstock consisting of multiple components and its complete degradation usually involves diverse microorganisms so its addition benefits many microorganisms while apple waste and fructose are simple feedstocks and they could be completely degraded by individual microorganisms alone so their addition probably benefits only a limited number of microorganisms collectively these results indicated that besides nutrient concentrations in line with prior studies chen et al 2021a nemergut et al 2016a wu et al 2017 nutrient complexity also affected microbial life strategy as well as microbial potential activity rice straw as another major feedstock in ad also contributed to nutrient resources unlike the microbial communities in digestate discussed above neither the community weighted mean rrn copy number nor rrn expression ratio of straw associated communities significantly changed after feedstock addition in different treatments or stages straw samples fig 7 microorganisms in digestate could freely transfer to and adapt to straw due to physiological plasticity that microorganisms shift life strategies to adapt to environmental alterations evans and wallenstein 2014 polz and cordero 2016 straw associated microbial community composition was quite different from those in digestate only 33 4 of otus were shared based on 16 s rrna gene dataset therefore the differences in responses to feedstock addition between straw associated communities and communities in digestate were probably attributed majorly to the differences in microbial community composition caused by selection filtering of feedstocks but minorly to microbial physiological plasticity straw associated microbial communities are assumed to feed mainly on straw a simple and recalcitrant feedstock li et al 2014 so straw associated communities were unlikely to adapt to the relatively complex or easily degradable feedstocks manure or manure plus apple waste or fructose at least in a short term which explained the insensitivity of straw associated communities to feedstock addition 4 conclusion this study provides novel evidence to understand ecological implication of microbial life strategies and potential activity at community level and reveals that both of them affect the energy and nutrient flux in ad and the effect could be modified by feedstock complexity to our current knowledge this is the first study to elucidate the roles of life strategies and potential activity of microbial communities in the energy and nutrient flux as the energy and nutrient flux is key for waste treatment systems and natural ecosystems our finding has important implications potential in these systems 5 authors contributions ql conceived this study conducted the experiment

15412,microbial life strategy reflected by rrna operon rrn copy number determines microbial ecological roles however the relationship between microbial life strategy and the energy and nutrient flux in anaerobic digestion ad remains elusive this study investigated microbial rrn copy number and expression ratio using amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna and monitored ch4 daily production to approximate the status of energy and nutrient flux in semi continuous ad a significantly positive correlation between the mean rrn copy number of microbial communities in digestate and ch4 daily production was detected in the control treatment fed swine manure the reduced feedstock complexity by replacing parts of swine manure with fructose or apple waste weakened the correlation when feedstock complexity was increased again the correlation was strengthened again similar results were detected in mean rrn expression ratio of microbial communities the responses of mean rrn copy number and expression ratio of communities to feedstock addition differed between the reduced feedstock complexity and the control treatment as well as between in digestate and in straw our findings reveal a novel relationship between microbial community life strategy and the energy and nutrient flux and the roles of feedstock characteristics therein in ad keywords anaerobic digestion energy and nutrient flux microbial life strategy rrna operon copy number rrna operon expression straw data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microorganisms are critical for energy and nutrient flux in waste treatment systems as well as natural ecosystems crowther et al 2019 lin et al 2017a long et al 2021 whereas elucidating the relationship between microorganisms and the flux remains challenging due to the enormous taxonomic diversity and functional versatility of microorganisms to simplify such complexity of microorganisms prior efforts attempted to categorize microorganisms into ecological groups based on microbial phylogenies martiny et al 2015 body sizes luan et al 2020 functional traits green et al 2008 or life strategies malik et al 2020 a recent study used carbon source as feedstock to culture microorganisms and found that microbial rrna operon rrn copy numbers correlated negatively with feedstock use efficiencies but positively with microbial maximal growth rates roller et al 2016 it further reported that microbial rrn copy numbers indicate microbial life strategies in determining microbial energy allocation into metabolism versus biosynthesis polz and cordero 2016 which provides clues into how microbial life strategies are linked to the energy and nutrient flux the link would be amplified in cross feeding systems fig 1 where the primary energy resource is partially converted by some microorganisms to generate intermediates as foods for the other microorganisms to drive the energy and nutrient flux pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 this is because the flux in cross feeding systems is driven by microbial cross feeding that is heavily influenced by microbial life strategies for example microorganisms with a life strategy of low feedstock use efficiencies often extract only a part of energy from feedstock and excrete high energy intermediates as foods for the other microorganisms which facilitate the cross feeding among microorganisms fig 1 while microorganisms with a life strategy of high feedstock use efficiencies do the opposite polz and cordero 2016 therefore microorganisms with a life strategy of low feedstock use efficiencies facilitate cross feeding and thus the energy and nutrient flux in cross feeding systems the energy and nutrient flux in cross feeding systems is driven by joint efforts of microorganisms within a community and therefore exploring microbial life strategies at community level is more suitable than at individual guilds to understand the relationship between microorganisms and the flux additionally microbial cross feeding is an interaction between different guilds pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 smith et al 2019 so it makes sense to explore microbial life strategies at community level microbial community level life strategies based on the community weighted mean rrn copy number have been widely studied in ecosystems to reveal community level traits in response to environmental alterations chen et al 2021b nemergut et al 2016a wu et al 2017 however the relationship between microbial community level life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux is barely explored a high community weighted mean rrn copy number indicates a community level strategy that most microorganisms show low feedstock use efficiencies roller et al 2016 most microorganisms with low feedstock use efficiencies could excrete high energy intermediates polz and cordero 2016 which underlie the cross feeding among microorganisms a typical example is the anaerobic digestion ad food chain i e hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis where differently functional microorganisms are involved in different steps of the food chain and the products of the upstream steps feed the microorganisms involved in the downstream steps to form cross feeding ultimately driving the energy and nutrient flux lin et al 2017a fig 1 therefore a high community weighted mean rrn copy number facilitates microbial cross feeding although microorganisms are responsible for feedstock degradation feedstock characteristics in turn select for microorganisms with specific life strategies to guarantee the feedstock degradation and thus the energy and nutrient flux in systems therefore microbial life strategies and the flux interplay each other to guarantee the functioning and stability in cross feeding systems we hypothesize that the community level strategy of feedstock use efficiencies indicated by the community weighted mean rrn copy number could predict the status of the energy and nutrient flux in cross feeding systems ad is a typical cross feeding system and easily managed the ch4 is a major end product in the ad food chain fig 1 so daily ch4 production the total ch4 production per day in semi continuous ad could approximate the daily status of energy and nutrient flux in ad therefore ad provides an unique opportunity to test the hypothesis above in cross feeding systems microbial cross feeding seems a bridge between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux because microbial life strategies concerning feedstock use efficiencies affect cross feeding that drives the energy and nutrient flux pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 polz and cordero 2016 a major force driving cross feeding among microorganisms is feedstock characteristics pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 smith et al 2019 for example microorganisms would conduct cross feeding if feedstock is too complex in molecular structure and or in components to be completely degraded by a microorganism alone due to the microbial functioning deficiencies and or thermodynamic constraints contrarily if feedstock is relatively simple in molecular structure and or in components microbial cross feeding is less or not necessary thereby a modulation of the feedstock characteristics allows us to explore the roles of cross feeding in the relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux this knowledge would further improve the understanding and potential application of the relationship swine manure as a major livestock waste mainly consists of proteins lipids carbohydrates and other complex components and represents a common complex feedstock in ad apple waste as a major fruit waste mainly consists of simple sugars that also exist in swine manure as co digestion of livestock manure and fruit wastes has been increasingly applied wang et al 2018b mixing manure and fruit wastes not only provides an opportunity to modulate feedstock complexity but also increase the practical application potential of the results in ad when the total volatile solid in feedstock addition is fixed a replacement of part manure with apple waste would increase the proportion of relatively simple components i e simple sugars and simultaneously decreases the proportions of other complex components e g proteins lipids carbohydrates and other complex components in the feedstock ultimately reducing the feedstock complexity this study conducted ad of swine manure and rice straw a relatively simple and recalcitrant feedstock to address the following questions 1 whether and how microbial community weighted mean rrn copy number in digestate is related to the ch4 production 2 to explore the roles of cross feeding in the relationship feedstock complexity was reduced by replacing part manure with apple waste or fructose a simple sugar in the feedstock addition the increased proportion of simple sugars in the feedstock was assumed to reduce microbial cross feeding simple sugars are also the products during hydrolysis and or acidogenesis in ad food chain so the addition of simple sugars would not strongly affect the existing metabolic pathways in ad but could partially skip the steps of hydrolysis and or acidogenesis thereby reducing the microbial cross feeding within the both steps will the reduced cross feeding weaken the relationship between microbial community weighted mean rrn copy number and the ch4 production 3 feedstock addition supplies fresh nutrients to maintain the energy and nutrient flux in ad do microbial community weighted mean rrn copy numbers in digestate and on straw respond differently to feedstock addition besides rrn copy numbers that represent genomic traits rrn expression ratios that represent transcriptomic features and could estimate microbial potential activity campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 were also used to address the above questions 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup of anaerobic digestion system the ad was initiated with a mixture of 1050 ml swine manure fresh swine manure with total solid ts content in the total mass 25 0 0 4 volatile solid vs content in ts 77 6 0 5

to the feedstock change period in this period the feedstock complexity in each feedstock addition was reduced by replacing partial swine manure with apple waste rotten apples mainly consisting of

300 ml volume were fixed across the different treatments specifically the apple waste addition treatment aa was fed 44 3 g apple waste vs 7 2 g and 300 ml swine manure swine manure was diluted with water to contain 11 4 g vs every 3 days the fructose addition treatment fa was fed 7 2 g fructose powder vs 7 2 g and 300 ml swine manure vs 11 4 g and the control treatment was fed only 300 ml swine manure vs 18 6 g as before in total the feedstock was added 5 times 3 days per time equal to one hrt in the recovery period immediately after the feedstock change period the feedstock addition in aa

feeding frequency the vs in feedstock addition temperature and digestion volume remained the same across the three periods initial period feedstock change period and recovery period and treatments the vs ratio of swine manure and apple waste in the feedstock addition in aa was determined based on a preliminary experiment that conducted a gradient of vs ratios of swine manure versus apple waste ①16

measured daily by using a water displacement method lin et al 2016 and ch4 and h2 contents in the biogas were measured by a gas chromatography system sp 2000 beifen china equipped with a thermal

added only once at the beginning of ad and not degraded completely at the end of ad which allowed consistently monitoring the dynamics of straw associated microbial communities during ad to reveal how straw associated microbial communities respond to feedstock addition rice straw samples were collected at 4 time points specifically before 2 h before and after on the first day after the first feedstock addition in the feedstock change period and before 2 h before and after on the first day after the first feedstock addition in the recovery period supplementary fig s1 after three times of

godzik 2006 the silva database version 132 quast et al 2012 was used for the taxonomic assignments of otu representative sequences absolute singletons and reads that were not affiliated to prokaryotes were removed the otutab rare function in the usearch pipeline edgar 2010 was used for random normalization of sequences to 8713 per sample supplementary fig s3 the community cohesion index that quantifies the degree of interconnection among taxa within a microbial community herren and mcmahon 2017 was calculated in total 117 samples from 3 treatments at 13 time points based on 16s rrna gene were used to calculate the cohesion index using the r script provided by herren et al https github com cherren8 cohesion with default parameters positive and negative cohesion indexes separately quantify the degrees of positive and negative interconnection among taxa within a microbial community to quantify the degree of total interconnection among taxa within a microbial community the sum of positive cohesion and the absolute value of negative cohesion was used as previous described hernandez et al 2021 higher absolute values of positive cohesion and total cohesion indicate greater degree of interconnection among taxa within a microbial community hernandez et al 2021 herren and mcmahon 2017 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds permutational multivariate analysis of variance

weighted mean rrn copy number and rrn expression ratio using a modified method based on previous studies nemergut et al 2016b wu et al 2017 rrn copy number for each otu was estimated based on the rrn database version 5 7 stoddard et al 2014 the otu representative sequence was queried by blastn with e value 10 10 and identify 80 against the rrn database only 0 4 of all otu representative sequences did not get hits e value 10 10 or identify 80 in the rrn database and their rrn copy numbers were estimated as the mean copy numbers of their parents wu et al 2017 the community weighted mean rrn copy number was calculated for each sample based on 16s rrna gene nemergut et al 2016b wu et al 2017 specifically 1 otu data were standardized by dividing by the corresponding rrn copy number and then the relative abundance for each otu was calculated based on the standardized otu data 2 the community weighted mean rrn copy number was achieved by taking the product of the relative abundance for each otu and the estimated rrn copy number and summing this value across all otus in a sample the rrn expression ratio represents a real time status of rrn expression and could estimate microbial potential activity campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 here both the microbial communities based on 16s rrna gene and 16s rrna in a sample were used to calculate the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio that could estimate overall potential activity of microbial communities specifically 4 the rrn expression ratio of each otu was calculated by 1 otu reads based on 16s rrna 1 otu reads based on 16s rrna gene as previously described campbell et al 2011 5 the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio was achieved by taking the product of the rrn expression ratio of each otu and the relative abundance for each otu based on standardized otu data achieved from the above step 1 and summing this value across all otus in a sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial community level strategies are related to the ch4 production microbial communities based on either 16s rrna gene or 16s rrna were dominated by the phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and spirochaetes and their relative abundances shifted across fermentation stages supplementary fig s4 microbial community structures significantly permanova s p 0 001 changed across fermentation stages fig 2 and supplementary table s1 microbial communities in digestate based on 16s rrna gene significantly permanova s p 0 001 0 15 r2 0 27 in three treatments changed with the shifts of the community weighted mean rrn copy number while microbial communities based on 16s rrna significantly but less closely p 0 001 0 06 r2 0 09 in three treatments changed with the shifts of the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio fig 2 and supplementary table s1 this result indicated that community weighted mean rrn copy number was more relevant than the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio to changes of microbial communities all these results were further validated by distance based redundancy analysis supplementary table s2 in the control fed only swine manure the dynamics of the community weighted mean rrn copy number was positively and significantly correlated with the dynamics of daily ch4 production during the whole ad process p 0 001 r 0 83 and 0 85 in feedstock change and recovery periods respectively pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 the detected correlations were further validated by that there were no autocorrelations breusch godfrey test s p 0 1 of residuals in the linear regression analyses between daily ch4 production and the community weighted mean rrn copy number this result answered our hypothesis that microbial community weighted mean rrn copy number could predict the status of the energy and nutrient flux in ad this result also indicated that the microbial community level strategy of low feedstock use efficiencies based on a high community weighted mean rrn copy number facilitated the ch4 production the ch4 is the end product in the energy and nutrient flux in ad so daily ch4 production in a semi continuous ad could approximate the daily status of the energy and nutrient flux as the energy and nutrient flux in ad is driven by microbial cross feeding that is based on public goods microorganisms with high rrn copy number often excrete high energy intermediates roller et al 2016 which would facilitate cross feeding polz and cordero 2016 and thus the ch4 production in ad therefore a high community weighted mean rrn copy number that implies a high level cross feeding among microorganisms facilitates the energy and nutrient flux in ad and thus the ch4 production to further support that a high value of the community weighted mean rrn copy number could imply a high level cross feeding among microorganisms we calculated the community cohesion index whose high values indicate a high level interconnection among taxa within a microbial community herren and mcmahon 2017 as cross feeding microorganisms are interacting and thus interconnected pfeiffer and bonhoeffer 2004 a high level cross feeding within a microbial community is expected to correspond to a high level interconnection among taxa within this community the community weighted mean rrn copy number was positively and significantly correlated with the total and positive cohesion indexes p 0 001 r 0 72 and 0 79 respectively pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 4 which was in line with our expectations in the population of firmicutes and proteobacteria in the control their community weighted mean rrn copy numbers were positively and significantly p 0 01 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 5 correlated with daily ch4 production microorganisms in the two phyla especially in firmicutes are usually involved in different steps of ad food chain e g hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis long et al 2021 so there is cross feeding among these microorganisms therefore their life strategies are supposed to affect the energy and nutrient flux in ad thus the ch4 production conversely without cross feeding no correlation is expected between the community weighted mean rrn copy numbers and daily ch4 production for example methanogens were dominant in the euryarchaeota in this study and were exclusive for methane metabolism without cross feeding evans et al 2019 in line with expectation we did not find significant correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy numbers of euryarchaeota and daily ch4 production p 0 05 fig 5 on the individual microorganism level we evaluated the relevance between otu relative abundances and daily ch4 production through using coefficient in pearson correlation test by controlling fermentation days and found that otus with more rrn copies showed stronger positive relevance with daily ch4 production p 0 001 r 0 59 pearson correlation test fig 6 among the 42 otus that showed closest relevance pearson s partial correlation test s coefficient 0 6 with ch4 production 86 were from firmicutes that could not directly generate ch4 but are crucial in cross feeding in ad by excreting intermediates long et al 2021 therefore the close relevance between otus with multiple rrn copies and ch4 production was probably because these otus were crucial in cross feeding and could drive the energy and nutrient flux in ad to ultimately generate ch4 a higher community weighted mean rrn copy number also implies microbial higher maximal growth rates roller et al 2016 most of microorganisms are unlikely to reach their maximal growth rates so microbial maximal growth rates are not directly linked to their ecological roles microbial rrn expression ratio represents a real time status of rrn expression in the control the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio was positively and significantly correlated with daily ch4 production during the whole ad process p 0 001 r 0 84 and 0 72 in feedstock change and recovery periods pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 this indicated that besides rrn copy number the real time expression status of rrn was also related to the energy and nutrient flux in ad this is probably because rrn expression ratio could estimate microbial potential activity campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 which was crucial for ad functioning 3 2 reduced feedstock complexity weakens the relationship between microbial community level life strategies and methane production the value range of community weighted mean rrn copy number did not differ significantly t test p 0 05 across the three treatments however the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy number and daily ch4 production became weakened in fa p 0 001 r 0 58 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 and aa r 0 70 compared to the control r 0 83 in the feedstock change period in the recovery period when the feedstock complexity in aa and fa were recovered to the same as that in the control the strength of correlations in fa r 0 79 and aa r 0 91 were also recovered similar with the control r 0 85 this result indicated that the reduced feedstock complexity weakened the correlations between community level life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux the cross feeding seems a bridge between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux if cross feeding becomes weakened the relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux would become weakened without microbial cross feeding microbial life strategies are not related to the flux a typical example is the methanogen cultivation by simple feedstocks h2 acetate or methanol where ch4 was generated without cross feeding and rrn copy number of the methanogen was not related to ch4 production lin et al 2017b the feedstock complexity was reduced by replacing a part of swine manure with apple waste or fructose and both apple waste and fructose could directly provide simple sugars that are products of hydrolysis and or acidogenesis in ad food chain wang et al 2018a therefore the replacement partially skipped the steps of hydrolysis and or acidogenesis and reduced the degree of cross feeding especially between microorganisms responsible for hydrolysis usually involving lots of microorganisms ma et al 2013 and the downstream microorganisms these simple sugars could be completely degraded by most microorganisms alone without cross feeding although methane production in aa and fa increased due to skipping hydrolysis and or acidogenesis to speed up the energy and nutrient flux through the ad food web the reduced feedstock complexity decreased microbial cross feeding and thus weakened the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy number and ch4 production in aa and fa the addition of simple sugars probably biasedly benefited specific microorganisms with competitive advantage rather than most members within a community and thus reduced cross feeding among most microorganisms the reduced feedstock complexity also weakened the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn copy number and the total and positive cohesion indexes p 0 02 r 0 39 and p 0 01 r 0 45 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 4 in fa and aa p 0 01 r 0 47 and p 0 001 r 0 51 compare to the control p 0 001 r 0 72 and p 0 001 r 0 79 on the individual microorganism level the correlation between otu rrn copy number and otu relevance to daily ch4 production was also weakened in fa p 0 109 r 0 110 pearson correlation test fig 6 and aa p 0 001 r 0 284 compared to the control p 0 001 r 0 590 these results further indicated that the weakened relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux was caused by the decrease of feedstock complexity due to the difficulty of strictly manipulating the multiple different components in the real wastes e g swine manure and apple wastes this study only elucidated and compared the relationships between in high feedstock complexity and in relatively low feedstock complexity whether the strength of the relationship is linearly correlated with feedstock complexity is warranted in further studies and this study confirmed the importance of feedstock complexity in the relationship the reduced feedstock complexity also weakened the correlations between the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio and daily ch4 production in fa p 0 23 r 0 31 pearson s partial correlation test by controlling fermentation days fig 3 and aa p 0 35 r 0 24 compared to the control p 0 001 r 0 84 in the feedstock change period in the recovery period the strength of correlations increased in fa r 0 41 and aa r 0 87 close to the control r 0 72 this result indicated the reduced feedstock complexity also weakened the correlation between the potential activity of microbial communities and the energy and nutrient flux in ad the energy and nutrient flux depends on the activity of all microorganisms in cooperation lin et al 2016 ma et al 2013 simple sugars could be accessed by most microorganisms so the addition of apple waste or fructose would reduce the substrate specificity however the addition of apple waste or fructose was unlikely to facilitate most microorganisms but probably activates only specific microorganisms with competitive advantage in accessing simple and labile feedstocks in the feedstock change period the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio decreased in fa and aa but increased in the control after feedstock addition while in the recovery period the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio increased in the three treatments digestate samples fig 7 a as the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio implies the overall potential activity of microbial communities campbell and kirchman 2013 campbell et al 2011 this result implied that the addition of apple waste or fructose actually reduced the potential activity of most microorganisms but only activated specific microorganisms in firmicutes in this context the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio was not necessary to be associated with the energy and nutrient flux 3 3 life strategies of microbial communities in digestate and on straw respond differently to feedstock addition the feedstock addition in semi continuous ad supplies fresh nutrients for microorganisms and maintains the energy and nutrient flux therefore exploring the responses of microbial life strategies to the feedstock addition helps to understand the relationship between microbial life strategies and the energy and nutrient flux the community weighted mean rrn copy number increased after feedstock addition in the feedstock change period p 0 01 fold change 1 17 and recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 17 in the control increased less obviously in the feedstock change period p 0 56 fold change 1 06 than in recovery period p 0 05 fold change 1 11 in fa and increased less obviously in the feedstock change period p 0 01 fold change 1 13 than in recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 26 in aa digestate samples fig 7b therefore feedstock addition increased the community weighted mean rrn copy number but the reduced feedstock complexity weakened the magnitude of the increase prior studies reveal the community weighted mean rrn copy number increases when nutrient concentrations increase chen et al 2021a nemergut et al 2016a wu et al 2017 in this study the feedstock addition certainly increased nutrient concentrations and thus the community weighted mean rrn copy number remarkably the total nutrient vs 18 6 g in the feedstock addition was the same across the three treatments but the addition of the reduced complex feedstock in fa and aa weakened the increase of the community weighted mean rrn copy number fig 7b this phenomenon was more obviously in the community weighted mean rrn expression ratio with a decrease in feedstock change period p 0 22 fold change 0 91 but an increase in recovery period p 0 19 fold change 1 16 in fa and a decrease in feedstock change period p 0 08 fold change 0 86 but an increase in recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 28 in aa compared to the control with an increase in both feedstock change period p 0 04 fold change 1 14 and recovery period p 0 01 fold change 1 23 digestate samples fig 7b swine manure is a complex feedstock consisting of multiple components and its complete degradation usually involves diverse microorganisms so its addition benefits many microorganisms while apple waste and fructose are simple feedstocks and they could be completely degraded by individual microorganisms alone so their addition probably benefits only a limited number of microorganisms collectively these results indicated that besides nutrient concentrations in line with prior studies chen et al 2021a nemergut et al 2016a wu et al 2017 nutrient complexity also affected microbial life strategy as well as microbial potential activity rice straw as another major feedstock in ad also contributed to nutrient resources unlike the microbial communities in digestate discussed above neither the community weighted mean rrn copy number nor rrn expression ratio of straw associated communities significantly changed after feedstock addition in different treatments or stages straw samples fig 7 microorganisms in digestate could freely transfer to and adapt to straw due to physiological plasticity that microorganisms shift life strategies to adapt to environmental alterations evans and wallenstein 2014 polz and cordero 2016 straw associated microbial community composition was quite different from those in digestate only 33 4 of otus were shared based on 16 s rrna gene dataset therefore the differences in responses to feedstock addition between straw associated communities and communities in digestate were probably attributed majorly to the differences in microbial community composition caused by selection filtering of feedstocks but minorly to microbial physiological plasticity straw associated microbial communities are assumed to feed mainly on straw a simple and recalcitrant feedstock li et al 2014 so straw associated communities were unlikely to adapt to the relatively complex or easily degradable feedstocks manure or manure plus apple waste or fructose at least in a short term which explained the insensitivity of straw associated communities to feedstock addition 4 conclusion this study provides novel evidence to understand ecological implication of

15413,due to the differences in biotic and abiotic factors between soil and sediments the predicted linkages between biotic and abiotic factors and soil carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 fluxes under warming may not be suitable for sediments additionally the combination of biotic and abiotic factors which determines sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes remains unresolved to address this issue different types of sediments including lake small river and pond sediments collected from 30 sites across the yangtze river basin were incubated under short term experimental warming during the incubating phase the sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes as well as the accompanying biotic factors organic carbon and microbial community and abiotic factors ph and dissolved oxygen do were determined and analyzed synthetically our results indicated that sediment co2 fluxes were more sensitive than ch4 fluxes to warming which might lead to a relatively large co2 contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions in a warming climate additionally temperature dependent co2 fluxes in pond sediments were more sensitive than those in lake sediments random forest analysis indicated that do greatly affected the variation in the sediment temperature dependent co2 fluxes whereas methanococcales primarily predicted the ch4 fluxes under warming do also highly affected the variation in the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes whereas ph mostly predicted the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes our findings suggest that biotic and abiotic factors especially do ph and the composition of methanogens coregulate co2 and ch4 emissions in response to climate warming therefore biotic and abiotic factors should be considered in the models for predication and investigation of sediment organic carbon dynamics under climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediments co2 and ch4 fluxes temperature sensitivity influencing factors climate change data

mendonca et al 2017 are recognized preservation sites for organic carbon oc and represent important global carbon c sinks the sequestration of oc in inland water sediments is comparable to or even higher than that in soils and marine sediments mendonca et al 2017 carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 are the main gaseous end products of oc remineralization and are two major contributors to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect yvon durocher et al 2011 rising temperatures are expected to accelerate the decomposition of sediment oc stimulating additional emissions of sediment co2 and ch4 and triggering a positive c climate feedback loop comer warner et al 2018 previous studies illustrated that the temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes in sediments was affected by multiple biotic or abiotic factors e g oc degradability gudasz et al 2010 total phosphorus gudasz et al 2010 dissolved oxygen liikanen et al 2002 water table chen et al 2021 lake type marotta et al 2014 and microbial community bertolet et al 2019 studies on temperature dependent sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes only focus on one or several driving factors and lack a comprehensive undertaking on the importance biotic or abiotic factors even though a lot of literature has alluded to the significance of biotic or abiotic factors on temperature dependent soil co2 and ch4 fluxes ding et al 2016 xu et al 2021 for instance both xu et al 2021 and ding et al 2016 examined the relative importance of substrate supply physical environment and microbial properties in regulating soil temperature dependent co2 fluxes and found that ph had the strongest total impact on the variation in co2 fluxes however whether these findings which were mostly derived from soils in terrestrial ecosystems still hold true for sediments in aquatic ecosystems remains an open question due to the characteristics of the dominant biota the structure of landforms the nature of nutrient pools and hydrologic residence time grimm et al 2003 organic matter om composition guo et al 2012 aeration statuses xiao et al 2017 microbial community composition liao et al 2019 li et al 2022 exhibit significant variability between soils and sediments these changes in soils and sediments could trigger various co2 and ch4 flux regimes yvon durocher et al 2012 given the differences in temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes and various biotic and abiotic factors of soils and sediments the predicted linkages between soil co2 and ch4 fluxes and biotic and abiotic factors under warming may not be suitable for sediments therefore it is crucial to explore how the combination of sediment biotic and abiotic factors determines sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes furthermore there is a need to explore the relative importance of these combined factors in regulating the variability in sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes exploring these combined linkages is beneficial for protecting specific biological and abiotic factors while considering reducing the effects of climate warming on the aquatic carbon cycle and for improving current model predictions of sediment oc dynamics due to climate warming laboratory incubation experiments allowing individual drivers to be investigated could provide powerful tools to assess potential rates of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes and potential relationships between warming induced co2 and ch4 fluxes and accompanying biotic and abiotic influencing factors additionally as the third longest river in the world the yangtze river originates on the qinghai tibet plateau flows through 11 provinces heading eastward across different landforms into the east china sea wang et al 2022 a route that provides an ideal large scale field area to explore sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes in aquatic ecosystems previous research has shown that small ponds with surface areas less than 0 001 km2 accounted for 8 6 of the total area of lakes and ponds in the world but accounted for 40 6 of ch4 emissions and 15 1 of co2 emissions due to shallow water frequent mixing a high perimeter to surface area ratio and high levels of sediment oc holgerson and raymond 2016 thousands of tributaries freshwater lakes and small ponds are located in the yangtze basin wang et al 2022 and these water bodies could provide the opportunity to investigate how sediment biotic factors combine with abiotic factors to determine co2 and ch4 fluxes under warming in this study we explored the co2 and ch4 fluxes in lake small river and small pond sediments at various temperatures using short term sediment sample incubation to estimate the temperature sensitivity of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes we fitted the data using the boltzmann arrhenius function and then assessed the temperature sensitivity by a linear mixing effect model we also determined the accompanying biotic factors organic carbon and microbial community and abiotic factors ph and dissolved oxygen do we then identified the major predictors driving the variation in temperature dependent sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes and their temperature sensitivities by random forest analyses 2 methods 2 1 sediment collection and incubation experiments surface sediments were collected by a beeker sediment core sampler eijkelkamp bwt2 04 23 sa netherlands ф 12 cm from six lakes three rivers and three ponds in the yangtze river basin in china in october 2021 fig 1 each day the samples were sealed and mailed to our laboratory as soon as possible and the returned samples were stored in the dark at 4 c the sediment incubation method used in this study was from comer warner et al 2018 briefly the incubation experiments were performed with 400 ml sediments 500 ml ultrapure water and 250 ml headspace in pre weighed 1150 ml amber glass jars with a double pass seal cover fig s1 five hundred millilitres of sediment free ultrapure water was also prepared as a control thirty sediment samples and a control experiment totalling 31 samples were used in addition to 3 replicates thus 93 incubation jars per temperature treatment to stabilize the microbial community at the treatment temperature after the sample was added the bottle cap was half open and placed in the climate simulation laboratory for the beginning of the 3 day incubation period at the treatment temperature the climate simulation laboratories were set to temperatures of 4 10 15 20 30 and 35 c the humidity was uniformly set at 60 and the illumination conditions were uniformly set to dark at the end of the 3 day stabilization period that is on the fourth day the 0 5 h gas collection period began before the gas collection experiment the do ph and temperature of the sediments were measured at 0 h 5 ml of 14 15 ppb raz solution was added to the jar and stirred the top space of the jar was balanced with the surrounding air and the lid of the jar was closed then the 0 h gas sample was taken from the headspace of the jars with an electric gas acquisition pump and a 50 ml gas bag 20 25 ml of gas was drawn from the jar headspace after 5 h a gas sample was again collected after the completion of the 5 h gas collection the jar was opened and 15 ml of water sediment mixture was filtered into a fluorimeter through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane to determine the concentration of rru a 20 mg sediment sample was collected to determine the composition of the microbial community this 0 5 h process was repeated for all jars totalling 558 jars 2 2 co2 and ch4 fluxes and accompanying biotic and abiotic factors the concentrations of co2 and ch4 were analysed by a 6890 agilent gas chromatograph agilent technologies equipped with tcd and fid detectors and a nickel catalyst methanizer the ch4 concentration was calculated with a standard curve from 0 1 to 100 ppm with a detection limit of 0 01 ppm chen et al 2008 the co2 concentration was calculated using a standard curve from 0 1 to 1000 ppm with a detection limit of 0 05 ppm chen et al 2008 the do ph and temperature of sediments were measured using a multichannel electrochemical tester hachhq series the method and analysis of microbial metabolic activity mma total fluorescence intensity tfi and fluorescence components c1 c3 could be found in supplementary texts 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification purification and sequence processing were performed according to yuan et al 2021 briefly the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified with the primer set 515f 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v4 hypervariable regions using a two step pcr protocol with the phasing priming technique the methyl coenzyme m reductase mcra gene was amplified using the primer pairs mlff 5ʹ ggtggtgtmggattcacacartaygc 3ʹ and mlfr 5ʹ ttcattgcrtagttwggrtagtt 3ʹ with a product length of approximately 489 bp and the partial ch4 monooxy genase pmoa gene was amplified using the primer pairs a189f 5ʹ ggngactgggacttctgg 3ʹ and mb661r 5ʹ acrtagtggtaaccttgya 3ʹ with a product length of approximately 509 bp 2 3 statistical analyses the co2 and ch4 fluxes were calculated from the following equation chen et al 2008 ai et al 2019 xu et al 2020 1 f v a δ c δ t where f is the gas flux mg m 2 h 1 v is the volume m3 of the headspace in the jar a is the cross section of the jar m2 δc refers to the concentration difference between time zero and time t mg m 3 and δt refers to the time duration between two sampling periods h to estimate the temperature sensitivity of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes based on a study by chen et al 2021 we fitted the data using the boltzmann arrhenius function and then assessed the temperature sensitivity by using a linear mixing effect model 2 ln r i t e ε e i 1 k t c 1 k t ln r t c ε r i where lnr i t represents the natural logarithm of the co2 and ch4 fluxes at absolute temperature t k for arbitrary site i e is the average apparent activation energy ev among sites which characterizes the temperature dependence of sediment ch4 e m and co2 fluxes e c where k is the boltzmann constant 8 62 10 5 ev k 1 tc 292 k 19 c is the mean temperature in the dataset therefore ln r t c corresponds to an average among sites for sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes at 19 c r tc because biotic and abiotic factors may have important effects in regulating the response of co2 and ch4 fluxes in regard to ambient temperature and may vary among sites we expected the estimates of the apparent activation energy e and the co2 and ch4 fluxes at a fixed temperature lnr tc to also vary among sites this variation was accounted for in our linear mixed effects models by treating the slopes and intercepts as random variables with averages of e and lnr tc respectively and defining site specific deviations from these averages of ε e i and ε r i for each site i the linear mixed effects modeling analysis was performed with the lme function in the nlme package in r statistical software v 4 1 2 r core team 2020 models were fit using the likelihood ratio test and the random effects structure that best described the data were assessed by comparing the akaike information criterion aic values of the null model including all potential fixed effects and only one random effect corresponding to the intercept variation and an alternative model including all potential fixed effects and both random effects that is those corresponding to the slope and the intercept supplementary table 1 perkins et al 2012 chen et al 2021 tukey s post hoc multiple comparison test was used to compare the slopes and intercepts generated from the mixed effects models corresponding to the different datasets perkins et al 2012 differences between temperature and sediment types in regard to co2 fluxes ch4 fluxes and mma were tested using anova and tukey s hsd test the statistical significance of the relationships between sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes and their temperature sensitivity and biotic or abiotic factors was assessed using the mantel test random forest regression analysis was performed with the rfpermute package in r statistical software v 4 1 2 r core team 2020 and significance was assessed using a permutation test 2 4 experimental limitations to keep the sediment free from the influence of pristine water solutes and microorganisms 500 ml ultrapure water was added to the sediment as a medium for incubation the risk of critical dilution of pore waters with ultrapure water that could have the potential to dilute the organic inorganic matter in the sediments is considered minimal fig s9 since sediment and pore water solute concentrations such as organic matter or nutrients in the investigated lakes rivers and ponds are higher than those in the ultrapure water addition and are therefore likely to cause only minimal effects on sediment and pore water solute concentrations no significant changes in the content and composition of oc with temperature and time change were observed in this study fig s9 indicating that substrate limitation did not greatly occur in the incubations as we sampled the headspaces of the incubated sediments the concentration changes of gases particularly ch4 represent a net flux inclusive of methanogenesis and methanotrophy and are assumed to include ebullitive events since the gas chromatographic test requires at least 20 ml of gas 20 25 ml gas was collected from the 250 ml headspace of the jar the risk of depressurization or dilution of the gas concentration in the headspace could have the potential to affect the temperature sensitivity of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes were considered minimal since the gas collected was only 10 of the headspace even though there was a risk of dilution each incubation jar and jar under each treatment temperature were diluted by an equal proportion the consequences of dilution may have the potential to affect temperature sensitivity but would not greatly affect our focus on the biotic or abiotic controls of carbon emissions under short term experimental warming 3 results 3 1 sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes the co2 fluxes in the sediment incubations ranged from 0 to 22 mg c m 2 h 1 mean sd 3 09 3 34 n 416 the ch4

larger than those in the lake sediments tukey post hoc test p 0 039 3 2 bacteria community the pond sediments from a small pond near lake taihu that recorded high co2 and ch4 fluxes mma and e c values were chosen as typical representatives for exploring how warming affects the bacteria community the temperature dependent ecological networks were constructed to explore the effect of temperature on bacteria structure fig 3 principal component analysis pca of the structure of networked communities for 37 topological properties showed that the 6 constructed ecological networks were far apart from each other fig 4 indicating that the structure of the bacteria community was significantly affected by temperature the networks at 10 c and 30 c contained on average 72 7 and 30 3 more links respectively than the networks at other temperatures the numbers of positive connections at 10 c and 30 c were on average 59 8 and 35 8 higher than those at other temperatures respectively the geodesic efficiency of the network had a similar variation tendency with total links and positive links under increasing temperature the networks at 10 c and 30 c had a lower proportion of isolated nodes and average path distance than the other networks and demonstrated a w shaped trend similar to the variation trend of mma the node degrees of networks at 10 c 15 c and 30 c were significantly larger than those at 4 c 20 c and 35 c tukey hsd test p 0 000 to 0 004 the clustering coefficients of networks at 4 c and 35 c were significantly smaller than those at other temperatures tukey hsd

sediments at 35 c were chosen to explore sediment types effects on bacteria communities fig 5 as the co2 and ch4 fluxes and mma values at this temperature were significantly larger than those at other temperatures significant differences in the composition of the 3 sediment type bacteria communities were not observed and they were dominated by the phyla proteobacteria 44 49 bacteroidetes 8 14 chloroflexi 7 11 and acidobacteria 3 6 significant differences in diversity including alpha diversity shannon anova p 0 04 and beta diversity nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds were observed between pond and river sediments according to the pca results which included 24 topological properties the lake river and pond sediment ecological networks were isolated from each other fig 4 indicating that the sediment type significantly affected the bacteria community structure the bacteria community structure of the river sediment had rich nodes and links compared with pond and lake sediments the river sediment bacteria community had a significantly larger node degree than the lake and pond sediments tukey hsd test p 0 000 to 0 031 the node degree of the pond sediment bacteria community was significantly larger than that of the lake sediment tukey hsd test p 0 0001 in addition the pond sediment bacteria community had a high connectedness and transitivity compared with river

were detected in the samples methanomicrobiales 36 to 51 methanosarcinales 18 to 24 methanobacteriales 1 and methanococcales 0 04 three phylogenetic orders of methanotrophs were detected in the samples methylococcales 79 to 85 rhizobiales 15 to 21 and nitrosomonadales 0 02 obvious differences in the composition of methanogens and methanotrophs under different temperatures and sediment types at 35 c were not found at the order level significant differences in the gene copy numbers of methanogens and methanotrophs under different temperatures were not found while there was significant difference in the gene copy numbers of mcra and the ratio of mcra poma among different sediment types at 35 c the gene copy numbers of mcra tukey hsd test p 0 04 and the ratio of mcra poma tukey hsd test p 0 0001 in pond sediments at 35 c were significantly lower than those in river sediments 3 4 relationships between co2 and ch4 fluxes and biotic and abiotic factors correlation analysis showed

effect on the dynamics of soil co2 release under warming among biotic and abiotic factors and can explain 25 67 of the variation in temperature dependent co2 release ding et al 2016 xu et al 2021 soil ph mainly indirectly affects the dynamics of soil co2 release via its influences on the activities of microorganisms and c acquiring enzymes e g b glucosidase which can be reduced under high or low ph conditions xu et al 2021 in the study sediment ph also had a strong effect on the dynamics of sediment co2 release under warming but this effect was not the most important factor do was the most important factor regulating sediment co2 release under warming among the biotic and abiotic factors involved in this study which was consistent with previous studies xiao et al 2020 2021 such a difference between soil and sediment implies that the major predictors of temperature dependent co2 release could vary between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in our sediment incubation do significantly decreased with short term warming in all sediment types which could be explained by the warming increasing the abundance of microbial functional genes in carbon decomposition and bacterial mineralization of oc consuming do and releasing ghgs taguchi and fujiwara 2010 additionally it is well known that microorganisms use om as a source of energy and nutrition to transfer c into the atmosphere in the form of ch4 and co2 a process that is an important part of the carbon cycle ding et al 2016 xu et al 2021 we also found that the quantity of oc and the composition of dom were positively linked with the co2 fluxes under warming and could account for 3 2 to 4 4 of co2 fluxes in addition to substrate and environmental factors we found that the co2 fluxes were related to the bacteria network structure and composition in terms of network structure co2 fluxes were mainly correlated with module parameters such as the number of large modules and the percentage of nodes in larger modules which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2021 shi et al 2022 the bacteria network at 35 c in pond sediments had more large modules and percentages of nodes in larger modules with higher co2 fluxes than those of other networks microbial populations nodes within a module may have similar ecological niches with nodes within the module being well connected but rarely connected to nodes belonging to other modules yuan et al 2021 modularity is an important topological feature representing the structural level of microbial interactions and indicating the degree of niche differentiation which can reduce the degree of microbial functional overlap depending on the independence of various biochemical functions performed by different functional groups lin et al 2017 the improvement in modularity indicates that the collaboration and parallel niches between functional groups increase which ultimately improves the functional redundancy and efficiency of the system lin et al 2017 our results indicated that high modularity and niche differentiation could benefit sediment co2 fluxes under warming in terms of bacteria community composition the co2 fluxes were mainly affected by the phyla proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and nitrospirae sun et al 2022 found that the soil bacterial communities shifted from being dominated by acidobacteria to being dominated by proteobacteria after biochar addition and the soil co2 emission rate was significantly positively correlated with the relative abundance of proteobacteria suggesting that the shift from acidobacteria to proteobacteria promoted c mineralization and enhanced soil co2 emissions the main reason for this shift might be that acidobacteria known as slow growing oligotrophic k strategist bacteria thrive in nutrient limited conditions while proteobacteria known as copiotrophic r strategist bacteria thrive in nutrient rich environments sun et al 2022 in pond sediments the relative abundances of proteobacteria were higher than those in other sediment types and the relative abundances of acidobacteria were lower than those in other sediment types which might be one reason why co2 fluxes in the pond sediments were higher than those in other sediment types picone et al 2021 isolated a verrucomicrobia methanotrophic bacterium from a geothermal region favara grande which is characterized by a high temperature 60 c and a low ph 3 5 in the top layer of the soil as well as hydrothermal gas emissions consisting mainly of co2 ch4 and hydrogen h2 these geothermal features can provide an appropriate niche for the growth of chemothermophilic and acidophilic bacteria including lanthanide dependent methanotrophic bacteria in the phylum verrucomicrobia this finding might explain our finding in which the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia was related to the rate of co2 fluxes under warming conditions we also found that the relative abundance of nitrospirae was related to the rate of co2 fluxes under warming nitrospirae is closely associated with soil nitrogen cycling sun et al 2022 and a previous study illustrated that nitrogen addition had a positive effect on co2 fluxes hu et al 2017 4 2 biotic and abiotic controls on sediment ch4 fluxes among the biotic and abiotic factors involved in this study the relative abundance of methanococcales was the most important factor regulating sediment ch4 fluxes under warming which was predicted by random forest regression analysis methanogenic strains are exclusively affiliated with the phylum euryarchaeota and distributed among the seven orders methanosarcinales methanobacteriales methanomicrobiales methanococcales methanopyrales methanocellales and methanoplasmatales paul et al 2012 hofmann et al 2016 in the present study 3 sediment types were all dominated by methanomicrobiales 36 to 51 methanosarcinales 18 to 24 methanobacteriales 1 and methanococcales 0 04 at the order level the reason for the low abundance of methanococcales being the most important factor regulating sediment ch4 fluxes under warming may be that this rare taxon may be the keystone taxon regulating methanogenesis banerjee et al 2018 illustrated that keystone taxa could drive community composition and function irrespective of their abundance and emphasized the importance of rare taxa in many biogeochemical processes including nitrification denitrification methanogenesis methanotrophy and sulfate reduction for example desulfosporosinus spp which only represent 0 06 of the total community have a pivotal role in sulfate reduction and carbon flow in peatland soils pester et al 2010 jousset et al 2017 provided an ecological overview of the rare microbial biosphere including causes of rarity and the impacts of rare species on ecosystem functioning and emphasized that rare species can drive key processes in geochemical cycles and are major players in nutrient cycling greenhouse gas emissions and pollutant degradation in terms of bacteria network structure in contrast to the effect of modules on sediment co2 fluxes under warming several properties connectedness maximal degree and proportion of positive links that indicated the complexity of a network showed strong effects on sediment temperature dependent ch4 fluxes biodiversity includes not only the number and abundance of species but also the complexity of interactions for example competition predation parasitism and symbiosis between species zhou et al 2011 within the habitat various biological species populations interact with each other through the flow of energy matter and information to form large and complex ecological networks zhou et al 2011 the diversity function relationship proposed by wagg et al 2019 demonstrates that more complex microbial networks contribute more to improving ecosystem function e g co2 and ch4 release than simpler or low diversity networks this is largely due to the increased redundancy effect of having more taxa supporting the same function and the number of microorganisms associated with different ecosystem functions wagg et al 2019 plant community experiments also provide empirical evidence for the widely accepted biodiversity insurance and redundancy hypotheses namely greater biodiversity can provide greater security for maintaining ecosystem functions under various spatiotemporal environmental conditions hector and bagchi 2007 isbell et al 2011 similar to the effects of the quality and quantity of oc on sediment co2 fluxes oc content and composition also influenced sediment ch4 fluxes under warming 4 3 biotic and abiotic controls on the temperature sensitivities of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes the results of random forest analysis showed that ph had the highest effect on the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes among the investigated variables in sediments a similar pattern was also reported in the temperature sensitivity of soil co2 fluxes where soil ph explained 67 of the variation in the temperature sensitivity of microbial respiration in north american temperate grasslands craine et al 2010 and 25 in mediterranean high mountain soils gutiérrez girón et al 2015 additionally both ding et al 2016 and xu et al 2021 found that soil ph was the most important predictor of the temperature sensitivity q 10 of soil co2 fluxes or oc decomposition in alpine meadow soils using structural equation modeling such a pattern could be explained by the fact that the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes is directly related to changes in the activities of c acquiring extracellular enzymes e g b glucosidase ding et al 2016 microbial diversity and community composition zhou et al 2020 xu et al 2021 and microbial community network structure e g complexity yang et al 2022 which are directly affected by ph xu et al 2021 in this study the relationships between the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes with bacteria diversity community composition and network structure provided evidence for this observation do had the highest effect on the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes among the investigated variables in sediments based on random forest analysis chen et al 2021 found that a lower water table is associated with a decrease in the temperature dependence of ch4 emissions and that a higher water table had the opposite effect methane fluxes are mainly a dynamic between methane production and oxidation bridgham et al 2013 methane production is a microbiological process mainly referring to methanogens which is predominantly controlled by the absence of oxygen and the amount of easily degradable matter segers 1998 methane oxidation mainly referring to methanotrophic bacteria is also a microbiological process and the major controls are oxygen and methane concentrations segers 1998 therefore do and methane archaea methanogens and methanotrophs are two indispensable factors in regulating methane emissions hou et al 2012 in the present study the composition of methanogens e g methanosarcinales and methanotrophs e g rhizobiales as well as the poma copies also had effects on the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes the comprehensive analysis of biotic and abiotic factors provides an opportunity to determine the reasons for the difference in the temperature sensitivities of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes between this study and previous studies the temperature sensitivities of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes estimated in this study e c 0 139 ev and e m 0 097 ev were much lower than those previously reported e c 0 55 ev yvon durocher et al 2012 and e m 0 96 ev yvon durocher et al 2014 two reasons may explain this discrepancy 1 from the perspective of abiotic factors the do concentration should be higher than that in the field surveys and the anaerobic incubations in the laboratory because the water depth of the incubation jar was much smaller than the in situ water depth which would facilitate oxygen in the air to enter the water body thus increasing the do concentration of the water body in the incubation jar and reducing the c fluxes and the temperature sensitivity of the sediment c fluxes 2 from the perspective of biotic factors the differences between this study and previous studies in bacteria diversity community composition and network structure induced by different biotic and abiotic factors are important factors to be considered since bacteria community also influenced the temperature sensitivity of sediment c fluxes as such the results of this study provide potential biotic and abiotic controls on sediment c fluxes and their temperature sensitivity which indicate the differences in magnitude of c fluxes between sediments of varying substrate abiotic or microbial characteristics and differences in response to climate warming due to these varying characteristics our results therefore demonstrate the importance of considering biotic and abiotic factors especially dissolved oxygen ph value and the composition of methanogens when using models to predict sediment organic carbon dynamics under climate change 5 conclusions we explored how the combination of biotic and abiotic factors determines sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes by utilizing incubation experiments our results indicated that sediment co2 fluxes were more sensitive than sediment ch4 fluxes under warming dissolved oxygen affected the variation in the sediment temperature dependent co2 fluxes the most whereas methanococcales predicted the ch4 fluxes under warming the most dissolved oxygen also affected the variation in the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes the most whereas ph predicted the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes the most declaration of competing interest the authors

15413,due to the differences in biotic and abiotic factors between soil and sediments the predicted linkages between biotic and abiotic factors and soil carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 fluxes under warming may not be suitable for sediments additionally the combination of biotic and abiotic factors which determines sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes remains unresolved to address this issue different types of sediments including lake small river and pond sediments collected from 30 sites across the yangtze river basin were incubated under short term experimental warming during the incubating phase the sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes as well as the accompanying biotic factors organic carbon and microbial community and abiotic factors ph and dissolved oxygen do were determined and analyzed synthetically our results indicated that sediment co2 fluxes were more sensitive than ch4 fluxes to warming which might lead to a relatively large co2 contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions in a warming climate additionally temperature dependent co2 fluxes in pond sediments were more sensitive than those in lake sediments random forest analysis indicated that do greatly affected the variation in the sediment temperature dependent co2 fluxes whereas methanococcales primarily predicted the ch4 fluxes under warming do also highly affected the variation in the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes whereas ph mostly predicted the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes our findings suggest that biotic and abiotic factors especially do ph and the composition of methanogens coregulate co2 and ch4 emissions in response to climate warming therefore biotic and abiotic factors should be considered in the models for predication and investigation of sediment organic carbon dynamics under climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediments co2 and ch4 fluxes temperature sensitivity influencing factors climate change data

mendonca et al 2017 are recognized preservation sites for organic carbon oc and represent important global carbon c sinks the sequestration of oc in inland water sediments is comparable to or even higher than that in soils and marine sediments mendonca et al 2017 carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 are the main gaseous end products of oc remineralization and are two major contributors to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect yvon durocher et al 2011 rising temperatures are expected to accelerate the decomposition of sediment oc stimulating additional emissions of sediment co2 and ch4 and triggering a positive c climate feedback loop comer warner et al 2018 previous studies illustrated that the temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes in sediments was affected by multiple biotic or abiotic factors e g oc degradability gudasz et al 2010 total phosphorus gudasz et al 2010 dissolved oxygen liikanen et al 2002 water table chen et al 2021 lake type marotta et al 2014 and microbial community bertolet et al 2019 studies on temperature dependent sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes only focus on one or several driving factors and lack a comprehensive undertaking on the importance biotic or abiotic factors even though a lot of literature has alluded to the significance of biotic or abiotic factors on temperature dependent soil co2 and ch4 fluxes ding et al 2016 xu et al 2021 for instance both xu et al 2021 and ding et al 2016 examined the relative importance of substrate supply physical environment and microbial properties in regulating soil temperature dependent co2 fluxes and found that ph had the strongest total impact on the variation in co2 fluxes however whether these findings which were mostly derived from soils in terrestrial ecosystems still hold true for sediments in aquatic ecosystems remains an open question due to the characteristics of the dominant biota the structure of landforms the nature of nutrient pools and hydrologic residence time grimm et al 2003 organic matter om composition guo et al 2012 aeration statuses xiao et al 2017 microbial community composition liao et al 2019 li et al 2022 exhibit significant variability between soils and sediments these changes in soils and sediments could trigger various co2 and ch4 flux regimes yvon durocher et al 2012 given the differences in temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes and various biotic and abiotic factors of soils and sediments the predicted linkages between soil co2 and ch4 fluxes and biotic and abiotic factors under warming may not be suitable for sediments therefore it is crucial to explore how the combination of sediment biotic and abiotic factors determines sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes furthermore there is a need to explore the relative importance of these combined factors in regulating the variability in sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes exploring these combined linkages is beneficial for protecting specific biological and abiotic factors while considering reducing the effects of climate warming on the aquatic carbon cycle and for improving current model predictions of sediment oc dynamics due to climate warming laboratory incubation experiments allowing individual drivers to be investigated could provide powerful tools to assess potential rates of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes and potential relationships between warming induced co2 and ch4 fluxes and accompanying biotic and abiotic influencing factors additionally as the third longest river in the world the yangtze river originates on the qinghai tibet plateau flows through 11 provinces heading eastward across different landforms into the east china sea wang et al 2022 a route that provides an ideal large scale field area to explore sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes in aquatic ecosystems previous research has shown that small ponds with surface areas less than 0 001 km2 accounted for 8 6 of the total area of lakes and ponds in the world but accounted for 40 6 of ch4 emissions and 15 1 of co2 emissions due to shallow water frequent mixing a high perimeter to surface area ratio and high levels of sediment oc holgerson and raymond 2016 thousands of tributaries freshwater lakes and small ponds are located in the yangtze basin wang et al 2022 and these water bodies could provide the opportunity to investigate how sediment biotic factors combine with abiotic factors to determine co2 and ch4 fluxes under warming in this study we explored the co2 and ch4 fluxes in lake small river and small pond sediments at various temperatures using short term sediment sample incubation to estimate the temperature sensitivity of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes we fitted the data using the boltzmann arrhenius function and then assessed the temperature sensitivity by a linear mixing effect model we also determined the accompanying biotic factors organic carbon and microbial community and abiotic factors ph and dissolved oxygen do we then identified the major predictors driving the variation in temperature dependent sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes and their temperature sensitivities by random forest analyses 2 methods 2 1 sediment collection and incubation experiments surface sediments were collected by a beeker sediment core sampler eijkelkamp bwt2 04 23 sa netherlands ф 12 cm from six lakes three rivers and three ponds in the yangtze river basin in china in october 2021 fig 1 each day the samples were sealed and mailed to our laboratory as soon as possible and the returned samples were stored in the dark at 4 c the sediment incubation method used in this study was from comer warner et al 2018 briefly the incubation experiments were performed with 400 ml sediments 500 ml ultrapure water and 250 ml headspace in pre weighed 1150 ml amber glass jars with a double pass seal cover fig s1 five hundred millilitres of sediment free ultrapure water was also prepared as a control thirty sediment samples and a control experiment totalling 31 samples were used in addition to 3 replicates thus 93 incubation jars per temperature treatment to stabilize the microbial community at the treatment temperature after the sample was added the bottle cap was half open and placed in the climate simulation laboratory for the beginning of the 3 day incubation period at the treatment temperature the climate simulation laboratories were set to temperatures of 4 10 15 20 30 and 35 c the humidity was uniformly set at 60 and the illumination conditions were uniformly set to dark at the end of the 3 day stabilization period that is on the fourth day the 0 5 h gas collection period began before the gas collection experiment the do ph and temperature of the sediments were measured at 0 h 5 ml of 14 15 ppb raz solution was added to the jar and stirred the top space of the jar was balanced with the surrounding air and the lid of the jar was closed then the 0 h gas sample was taken from the headspace of the jars with an electric gas acquisition pump and a 50 ml gas bag 20 25 ml of gas was drawn from the jar headspace after 5 h a gas sample was again collected after the completion of the 5 h gas collection the jar was opened and 15 ml of water sediment mixture was filtered into a fluorimeter through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane to determine the concentration of rru a 20 mg sediment sample was collected to determine the composition of the microbial community this 0 5 h process was repeated for all jars totalling 558 jars 2 2 co2 and ch4 fluxes and accompanying biotic and abiotic factors the concentrations of co2 and ch4 were analysed by a 6890 agilent gas chromatograph agilent technologies equipped with tcd and fid detectors and a nickel catalyst methanizer the ch4 concentration was calculated with a standard curve from 0 1 to 100 ppm with a detection limit of 0 01 ppm chen et al 2008 the co2 concentration was calculated using a standard curve from 0 1 to 1000 ppm with a detection limit of 0 05 ppm chen et al 2008 the do ph and temperature of sediments were measured using a multichannel electrochemical tester hachhq series the method and analysis of microbial metabolic activity mma total fluorescence intensity tfi and fluorescence components c1 c3 could be found in supplementary texts 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification purification and sequence processing were performed according to yuan et al 2021 briefly the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified with the primer set 515f 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 targeting the v4 hypervariable regions using a two step pcr protocol with the phasing priming technique the methyl coenzyme m reductase mcra gene was amplified using the primer pairs mlff 5ʹ ggtggtgtmggattcacacartaygc 3ʹ and mlfr 5ʹ ttcattgcrtagttwggrtagtt 3ʹ with a product length of approximately 489 bp and the partial ch4 monooxy genase pmoa gene was amplified using the primer pairs a189f 5ʹ ggngactgggacttctgg 3ʹ and mb661r 5ʹ acrtagtggtaaccttgya 3ʹ with a product length of approximately 509 bp 2 3 statistical analyses the co2 and ch4 fluxes were calculated from the following equation chen et al 2008 ai et al 2019 xu et al 2020 1 f v a δ c δ t where f is the gas flux mg m 2 h 1 v is the volume m3 of the headspace in the jar a is the cross section of the jar m2 δc refers to the concentration difference between time zero and time t mg m 3 and δt refers to the time duration between two sampling periods h to estimate the temperature sensitivity of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes based on a study by chen et al 2021 we fitted the data using the boltzmann arrhenius function and then assessed the temperature sensitivity by using a linear mixing effect model 2 ln r i t e ε e i 1 k t c 1 k t ln r t c ε r i where lnr i t represents the natural logarithm of the co2 and ch4 fluxes at absolute temperature t k for arbitrary site i e is the average apparent activation energy ev among sites which characterizes the temperature dependence of sediment ch4 e m and co2 fluxes e c where k is the boltzmann constant 8 62 10 5 ev k 1 tc 292 k 19 c is the mean temperature in the dataset therefore ln r t c corresponds to an average among sites for sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes at 19 c r tc because biotic and abiotic factors may have important effects in regulating the response of co2 and ch4 fluxes in regard to ambient temperature and may vary among sites we expected the estimates of the apparent activation energy e and the co2 and ch4 fluxes at a fixed temperature lnr tc to also vary among sites this variation was accounted for in our linear mixed effects models by treating the slopes and intercepts as random variables with averages of e and lnr tc respectively and defining site specific deviations from these averages of ε e i and ε r i for each site i the linear mixed effects modeling analysis was performed with the lme function in the nlme package in r statistical software v 4 1 2 r core team 2020 models were fit using the likelihood ratio test and the random effects structure that best described the data were assessed by comparing the akaike information criterion aic values of the null model including all potential fixed effects and only one random effect corresponding to the intercept variation and an alternative model including all potential fixed effects and both random effects that is those corresponding to the slope and the intercept supplementary table 1 perkins et al 2012 chen et al 2021 tukey s post hoc multiple comparison test was used to compare the slopes and intercepts generated from the mixed effects models corresponding to the different datasets perkins et al 2012 differences between temperature and sediment types in regard to co2 fluxes ch4 fluxes and mma were tested using anova and tukey s hsd test the statistical significance of the relationships between sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes and their temperature sensitivity and biotic or abiotic factors was assessed using the mantel test random forest regression analysis was performed with the rfpermute package in r statistical software v 4 1 2 r core team 2020 and significance was assessed using a permutation test 2 4 experimental limitations to keep the sediment free from the influence of pristine water solutes and microorganisms 500 ml ultrapure water was added to the sediment as a medium for incubation the risk of critical dilution of pore waters with ultrapure water that could have the potential to dilute the organic inorganic matter in the sediments is considered minimal fig s9 since sediment and pore water solute concentrations such as organic matter or nutrients in the investigated lakes rivers and ponds are higher than those in the ultrapure water addition and are therefore likely to cause only minimal effects on sediment and pore water solute concentrations no significant changes in the content and composition of oc with temperature and time change were observed in this study fig s9 indicating that substrate limitation did not greatly occur in the incubations as we sampled the headspaces of the incubated sediments the concentration changes of gases particularly ch4 represent a net flux inclusive of methanogenesis and methanotrophy and are assumed to include ebullitive events since the gas chromatographic test requires at least 20 ml of gas 20 25 ml gas was collected from the 250 ml headspace of the jar the risk of depressurization or dilution of the gas concentration in the headspace could have the potential to affect the temperature sensitivity of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes were considered minimal since the gas collected was only 10 of the headspace even though there was a risk of dilution each incubation jar and jar under each treatment temperature were diluted by an equal proportion the consequences of dilution may have the potential to affect temperature sensitivity but would not greatly affect our focus on the biotic or abiotic controls of carbon emissions under short term experimental warming 3 results 3 1 sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes the co2 fluxes in the sediment incubations ranged from 0 to 22 mg c m 2 h 1 mean sd 3 09 3 34 n 416 the ch4

those in the lake tukey post hoc test p 0 001 and river tukey post hoc test p 0 001 sediments the intercepts of the arrhenius relationship of ch4 fluxes in the river sediments were significantly larger than those in the lake sediments tukey post hoc test p 0 039 3 2 bacteria community the pond sediments from a small pond near lake taihu that recorded high co2 and ch4 fluxes mma and e c values were chosen as typical representatives for exploring how warming affects the bacteria community the temperature dependent ecological networks were constructed to explore the effect of temperature on bacteria structure fig 3 principal component analysis pca of the structure of networked communities for 37 topological properties showed that the 6 constructed ecological networks were far apart from each other fig 4 indicating that the structure of the bacteria community was significantly affected by temperature the networks at 10 c and 30 c contained on average 72 7 and 30 3 more links respectively than the networks at other temperatures the numbers of positive connections at 10 c and 30 c were on average 59 8 and 35 8 higher than those at other temperatures respectively the geodesic efficiency of the network had a similar variation tendency with total links and positive links under increasing temperature the networks at 10 c and 30 c had a lower proportion of isolated nodes and average path distance than the other networks and demonstrated a w shaped trend similar to the variation trend of mma the node degrees of networks at 10 c 15 c and 30 c were significantly larger than those at 4 c 20 c and 35 c tukey hsd test p 0 000 to 0 004 the clustering coefficients of networks at 4 c and 35 c were significantly smaller than those at other temperatures tukey hsd

sediments at 35 c were chosen to explore sediment types effects on bacteria communities fig 5 as the co2 and ch4 fluxes and mma values at this temperature were significantly larger than those at other temperatures significant differences in the composition of the 3 sediment type bacteria communities were not observed and they were dominated by the phyla proteobacteria 44 49 bacteroidetes 8 14 chloroflexi 7 11 and acidobacteria 3 6 significant differences in diversity including alpha diversity shannon anova p 0 04 and beta diversity nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds were observed between pond and river sediments according to the pca results which included 24 topological properties the lake river and pond sediment ecological networks were isolated from each other fig 4 indicating that the sediment type significantly affected the bacteria community structure the bacteria community structure of the river sediment had rich nodes and links compared with pond and lake sediments the river sediment bacteria community had a significantly larger node degree than the lake and pond sediments tukey hsd test p 0 000 to 0 031 the node degree of the pond sediment bacteria community was significantly larger than that of the lake sediment tukey hsd test p 0 0001 in addition the pond sediment bacteria community had a high connectedness and transitivity compared with river

were detected in the samples methanomicrobiales 36 to 51 methanosarcinales 18 to 24 methanobacteriales 1 and methanococcales 0 04 three phylogenetic orders of methanotrophs were detected in the samples methylococcales 79 to 85 rhizobiales 15 to 21 and nitrosomonadales 0 02 obvious differences in the composition of methanogens and methanotrophs under different temperatures and sediment types at 35 c were not found at the order level significant differences in the gene copy numbers of methanogens and methanotrophs under different temperatures were not found while there was significant difference in the gene copy numbers of mcra and the ratio of mcra poma among different sediment types at 35 c the gene copy numbers of mcra tukey hsd test p 0 04 and the ratio of mcra poma tukey hsd

effect on the dynamics of soil co2 release under warming among biotic and abiotic factors and can explain 25 67 of the variation in temperature dependent co2 release ding et al 2016 xu et al 2021 soil ph mainly indirectly affects the dynamics of soil co2 release via its influences on the activities of microorganisms and c acquiring enzymes e g b glucosidase which can be reduced under high or low ph conditions xu et al 2021 in the study sediment ph also had a strong effect on the dynamics of sediment co2 release under warming but this effect was not the most important factor do was the most important factor regulating sediment co2 release under warming among the biotic and abiotic factors involved in this study which was consistent with previous studies xiao et al 2020 2021 such a difference between soil and sediment implies that the major predictors of temperature dependent co2 release could vary between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in our sediment incubation do significantly decreased with short term warming in all sediment types which could be explained by the warming increasing the abundance of microbial functional genes in carbon decomposition and bacterial mineralization of oc consuming do and releasing ghgs taguchi and fujiwara 2010 additionally it is well known that microorganisms use om as a source of energy and nutrition to transfer c into the atmosphere in the form of ch4 and co2 a process that is an important part of the carbon cycle ding et al 2016 xu et al 2021 we also found that the quantity of oc and the composition of dom were positively linked with the co2 fluxes under warming and could account for 3 2 to 4 4 of co2 fluxes in addition to substrate and environmental factors we found that the co2 fluxes were related to the bacteria network structure and composition in terms of network structure co2 fluxes were mainly correlated with module parameters such as the number of large modules and the percentage of nodes in larger modules which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2021 shi et al 2022 the bacteria network at 35 c in pond sediments had more large modules and percentages of nodes in larger modules with higher co2 fluxes than those of other networks microbial populations nodes within a module may have similar ecological niches with nodes within the module being well connected but rarely connected to nodes belonging to other modules yuan et al 2021 modularity is an important topological feature representing the structural level of microbial interactions and indicating the degree of niche differentiation which can reduce the degree of microbial functional overlap depending on the independence of various biochemical functions performed by different functional groups lin et al 2017 the improvement in modularity indicates that the collaboration and parallel niches between functional groups increase which ultimately improves the functional redundancy and efficiency of the system lin et al 2017 our results indicated that high modularity and niche differentiation could benefit sediment co2 fluxes under warming in terms of bacteria community composition the co2 fluxes were mainly affected by the phyla proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and nitrospirae sun et al 2022 found that the soil bacterial communities shifted from being dominated by acidobacteria to being dominated by proteobacteria after biochar addition and the soil co2 emission rate was significantly positively correlated with the relative abundance of proteobacteria suggesting that the shift from acidobacteria to proteobacteria promoted c mineralization and enhanced soil co2 emissions the main reason for this shift might be that acidobacteria known as slow growing oligotrophic k strategist bacteria thrive in nutrient limited conditions while proteobacteria known as copiotrophic r strategist bacteria thrive in nutrient rich environments sun et al 2022 in pond sediments the relative abundances of proteobacteria were higher than those in other sediment types and the relative abundances of acidobacteria were lower than those in other sediment types which might be one reason why co2 fluxes in the pond sediments were higher than those in other sediment types picone et al 2021 isolated a verrucomicrobia methanotrophic bacterium from a geothermal region favara grande which is characterized by a high temperature 60 c and a low ph 3 5 in the top layer of the soil as well as hydrothermal gas emissions consisting mainly of co2 ch4 and hydrogen h2 these geothermal features can provide an appropriate niche for the growth of chemothermophilic and acidophilic bacteria including lanthanide dependent methanotrophic bacteria in the phylum verrucomicrobia this finding might explain our finding in which the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia was related to the rate of co2 fluxes under warming conditions we also found that the relative abundance of nitrospirae was related to the rate of co2 fluxes under warming nitrospirae is closely associated with soil nitrogen cycling sun et al 2022 and a previous study illustrated that nitrogen addition had a positive effect on co2 fluxes hu et al 2017 4 2 biotic and abiotic controls on sediment ch4 fluxes among the biotic and abiotic factors involved in this study the relative abundance of methanococcales was the most important factor regulating sediment ch4 fluxes under warming which was predicted by random forest regression analysis methanogenic strains are exclusively affiliated with the phylum euryarchaeota and distributed among the seven orders methanosarcinales methanobacteriales methanomicrobiales methanococcales methanopyrales methanocellales and methanoplasmatales paul et al 2012 hofmann et al 2016 in the present study 3 sediment types were all dominated by methanomicrobiales 36 to 51 methanosarcinales 18 to 24 methanobacteriales 1 and methanococcales 0 04 at the order level the reason for the low abundance of methanococcales being the most important factor regulating sediment ch4 fluxes under warming may be that this rare taxon may be the keystone taxon regulating methanogenesis banerjee et al 2018 illustrated that keystone taxa could drive community composition and function irrespective of their abundance and emphasized the importance of rare taxa in many biogeochemical processes including nitrification denitrification methanogenesis methanotrophy and sulfate reduction for example desulfosporosinus spp which only represent 0 06 of the total community have a pivotal role in sulfate reduction and carbon flow in peatland soils pester et al 2010 jousset et al 2017 provided an ecological overview of the rare microbial biosphere including causes of rarity and the impacts of rare species on ecosystem functioning and emphasized that rare species can drive key processes in geochemical cycles and are major players in nutrient cycling greenhouse gas emissions and pollutant degradation in terms of bacteria network structure in contrast to the effect of modules on sediment co2 fluxes under warming several properties connectedness maximal degree and proportion of positive links that indicated the complexity of a network showed strong effects on sediment temperature dependent ch4 fluxes biodiversity includes not only the number and abundance of species but also the complexity of interactions for example competition predation parasitism and symbiosis between species zhou et al 2011 within the habitat various biological species populations interact with each other through the flow of energy matter and information to form large and complex ecological networks zhou et al 2011 the diversity function relationship proposed by wagg et al 2019 demonstrates that more complex microbial networks contribute more to improving ecosystem function e g co2 and ch4 release than simpler or low diversity networks this is largely due to the increased redundancy effect of having more taxa supporting the same function and the number of microorganisms associated with different ecosystem functions wagg et al 2019 plant community experiments also provide empirical evidence for the widely accepted biodiversity insurance and redundancy hypotheses namely greater biodiversity can provide greater security for maintaining ecosystem functions under various spatiotemporal environmental conditions hector and bagchi 2007 isbell et al 2011 similar to the effects of the quality and quantity of oc on sediment co2 fluxes oc content and composition also influenced sediment ch4 fluxes under warming 4 3 biotic and abiotic controls on the temperature sensitivities of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes the results of random forest analysis showed that ph had the highest effect on the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes among the investigated variables in sediments a similar pattern was also reported in the temperature sensitivity of soil co2 fluxes where soil ph explained 67 of the variation in the temperature sensitivity of microbial respiration in north american temperate grasslands craine et al 2010 and 25 in mediterranean high mountain soils gutiérrez girón et al 2015 additionally both ding et al 2016 and xu et al 2021 found that soil ph was the most important predictor of the temperature sensitivity q 10 of soil co2 fluxes or oc decomposition in alpine meadow soils using structural equation modeling such a pattern could be explained by the fact that the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes is directly related to changes in the activities of c acquiring extracellular enzymes e g b glucosidase ding et al 2016 microbial diversity and community composition zhou et al 2020 xu et al 2021 and microbial community network structure e g complexity yang et al 2022 which are directly affected by ph xu et al 2021 in this study the relationships between the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes with bacteria diversity community composition and network structure provided evidence for this observation do had the highest effect on the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes among the investigated variables in sediments based on random forest analysis chen et al 2021 found that a lower water table is associated with a decrease in the temperature dependence of ch4 emissions and that a higher water table had the opposite effect methane fluxes are mainly a dynamic between methane production and oxidation bridgham et al 2013 methane production is a microbiological process mainly referring to methanogens which is predominantly controlled by the absence of oxygen and the amount of easily degradable matter segers 1998 methane oxidation mainly referring to methanotrophic bacteria is also a microbiological process and the major controls are oxygen and methane concentrations segers 1998 therefore do and methane archaea methanogens and methanotrophs are two indispensable factors in regulating methane emissions hou et al 2012 in the present study the composition of methanogens e g methanosarcinales and methanotrophs e g rhizobiales as well as the poma copies also had effects on the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes the comprehensive analysis of biotic and abiotic factors provides an opportunity to determine the reasons for the difference in the temperature sensitivities of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes between this study and previous studies the temperature sensitivities of sediment co2 and ch4 fluxes estimated in this study e c 0 139 ev and e m 0 097 ev were much lower than those previously reported e c 0 55 ev yvon durocher et al 2012 and e m 0 96 ev yvon durocher et al 2014 two reasons may explain this discrepancy 1 from the perspective of abiotic factors the do concentration should be higher than that in the field surveys and the anaerobic incubations in the laboratory because the water depth of the incubation jar was much smaller than the in situ water depth which would facilitate oxygen in the air to enter the water body thus increasing the do concentration of the water body in the incubation jar and reducing the c fluxes and the temperature sensitivity of the sediment c fluxes 2 from the perspective of biotic factors the differences between this study and previous studies in bacteria diversity community composition and network structure induced by different biotic and abiotic factors are important factors to be considered since bacteria community also influenced the temperature sensitivity of sediment c fluxes as such the results of this study provide potential biotic and abiotic controls on sediment c fluxes and their temperature sensitivity which indicate the differences in magnitude of c fluxes between sediments of varying substrate abiotic or microbial characteristics and differences in response to climate warming due to these varying characteristics our results therefore demonstrate the importance of considering biotic and abiotic factors especially dissolved oxygen ph value and the composition of methanogens when using models to predict sediment organic carbon dynamics under climate change 5 conclusions we explored how the combination of biotic and abiotic factors determines sediment temperature dependent co2 and ch4 fluxes by utilizing incubation experiments our results indicated that sediment co2 fluxes were more sensitive than sediment ch4 fluxes under warming dissolved oxygen affected the variation in the sediment temperature dependent co2 fluxes the most whereas methanococcales predicted the ch4 fluxes under warming the most dissolved oxygen also affected the variation in the temperature sensitivity of ch4 fluxes the most whereas ph predicted the temperature sensitivity of co2 fluxes the most declaration of competing interest the authors

15414,heavy metal loid s hms have been consistently entering the food chain imposing great harm on environment and public health however previous studies on the spatial dynamics and transport mechanism of hms have been profoundly limited by the field sampling issues such as the uneven observations of individual carriers and their spatial mismatch especially over large scale catchments with complex environment in this study a novel methodological framework for mapping hms at catchment scale was proposed and applied combining a species distribution model sdm with physical environment and human variables based on the field observations we ecologicalized hms in different carriers as different species this enabled the proposed framework to model the enrichment area of individual hms in the geographic space termed as the hm habitat and identify their hotspots peak value points within the catchment results showed the output maps of hm habitats from secondary carriers soil sediment and wet deposition well agreed with the influence of industry contaminants hydraulic sorting and precipitation washout process respectively indicating the potential of sdm in modeling the spatial distributions of the hm the derived maps of hms from secondary carriers along with the human and environmental variables were then input as explanatory variables in sdm to predict the spatial patterns of the final hm accumulation in river water which was observed to have largely improved the prediction quality these results confirmed the value of our framework to leverage sdms from ecology perspective to study hm contamination transport at catchment scale offering new insights not only to map the spatial hm habitats but also help locate the hm transport chains among different carriers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metals species distribution model catchment carriers environmental variables human variables data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metal loid s hms ubiquitous and generally persistent in the environment tend to accumulate in natural sinks and bio magnify in the food chain ali et al 2019 imposing great potential threats to human health and environmental sustainability hms have been found to actively transport within multiple environmental compartments such as the catchment hassellov and von der kammer 2008 urban system sarkar et al 2021 agriculture meite et al 2018 estuary fang et al 2016 mining sites and public transport system etc goth et al 2019 senduran et al 2018 stojic et al 2017 spreading from local regional to global scales thus understanding of hm transport mechanism and spatial dynamics is essential for conservation and resource management hassellov and von der kammer 2008 studies on hm contamination within catchment have been increasingly applied but challenged by the complex environment of catchment system which consists of multi dimensional carriers such as the atmospheric deposition soil sediment river water and biosphere etc fig 1 the river water plays as a pollutant sink for hms within a catchment which links various carriers through a series of physicochemical processes including atmospheric deposition nickel et al 2014 water rock interactions from riparian and floodplain hassellov and von der kammer 2008 and soil leaching and erosion li et al 2020 etc fig 1 to separate the carrier types we defined the river water as the primary carrier while atmospheric deposition soil and sediment as secondary carriers hm contamination and transport mechanism in catchment system have been investigated in the previous studies for addressing three main questions in the field what are the potential explanatory variables that drive hm transport where are the hm enrichment areas and should the recovery efforts be focused and how do these various carriers interact to spread hms key papers including their strength and limitations for these essential research questions are summarized in table 1 for example the pb isotopes approach and source apportionment methods have been widely used to study the water supply systems and identify hm sources within catchment cable and deng 2018 gassama et al 2021 lv 2019 multivariate receptor models were then introduced to quantify the relative contributions of different pollutant sources taiwo et al 2014 recent development of nanotechnology may offer potential solution for accurately identifying the relationships between hms and explanatory variables which yet is too expensive and not suitable for large scale study areas gajbhiye et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 additionally modern statistical methods including simple linear models and advanced machine learning as well as novel statistical method such as a flag element ratio approach hong et al 2018 have been increasingly proposed to identify the relationships between hms and explanatory variables hu et al 2020 as a result although these previous studies have made significant contributions details in the literature review of table 1 there are three important gaps in the current knowledge remain to be solved which are largely due to the spatial inconsistence and scarcity of the field observations i insufficient explanatory variables of hms were often selected to correspond with a specific carrier studied in previous research therefore comprehensive explanatory variables from separated environment and human factors are needed for a better understanding of hm contamination and transport mechanism ii current mapping methods of hms are dependent on the spatial interpolation like kriging and the results are greatly sensitive to the intensity and spatial distribution of field data sampling iii only single hm carrier was investigated in most of the previous studies because of the spatial heterogeneous sampling sites among different carriers profoundly hindering our understanding of the interactions from a multi dimension carrier perspective which play an important role in transporting the hms therefore a comprehensive framework of novel methods and datasets is needed to fill these knowledge gaps for better mapping and assessing hm contamination in large scale catchment species distribution models sdm have been widely applied in research areas such as conservation biology ecology and evolution sdm is a model of a general format which can predict the suitability of the potential habitats of different species with presence location sample data and environmental features e g climate land use soil etc in other words sdms of various algorithms can map the past current and future spatial distributions of different species which however were all designed according to the same core rule the characteristics of species thus if significant research similarities between species and certain research targets e g hms exist there would be potential in putting the targets as entries to sdms instead of species to map the spatial distributions of targets this rationality has been evidenced by the success of several previous studies such as geographical planning and design clemente et al 2019 virus spread monitoring harrigan et al 2014 and spatial distribution of human emotion li et al 2021 however sdms and hm mapping have only been developed in parallel and this study showed that sdm has potential in mapping habitats of hms due to the important research similarities between species and hms i fuzziness the spatial distributions of these species and hms can be represented by specific boundaries such as administrative regions geomorphic units etc fig 4 ii complexity both the species and hms are being influenced by multi dimensional factors such as the environment and human variables fig 4 iii spatial coexistence multiple biological species on the same trophic level can share the same habitat similarly multiple hms e g pb hg as cd etc in each carrier discussed in this study often co exist in the catchment fig 5 iv dynamics interactions always occur among multiple biological species on food chains likewise hm transport and accumulate among various carriers fig 5 in this study we developed a novel framework for mapping hm contamination at large catchment scale combining a typical species distribution model method guisan and zimmermann 2000 hijmans and elith 2013 with environmental and human variables with different hms e g pb hg as cd etc being considered as different species we were able to model the habitat of each hm enrichment area in the geographic space termed as the hm habitat along with hm hotspots hm peak value points in particular we aimed to i separate impacts from natural environment and human activities on secondary carriers e g soil sediment and atmospheric deposition ii investigate the spatial habitats and hotspots of hms where mitigation efforts should be given within various carriers iii assess spatiotemporal hm transmission patterns of river water the primary carrier across the entire catchment with modelled spatially consistent data this study proposed to leverage sdm models from ecology to map hm contamination which can effectively build the environment human hm relationships to fill the current important knowledge gaps over large scale catchment this will offer new future perspectives and directions to the field of water pollution 2 study area we applied our proposed methodological framework to the heihe river basin hrb which is a large scale catchment that has always been considered as a natural laboratory in many previous research cheng et al 2014 the hrb originates from the qilian mountains along the northeastern margin of the third pole of the world qinghai tibet plateau fig 2 a the main river flows 821 km covering an area of approximately 14 3 104 km2 with a mean annual runoff of 1 588 109 m3 ge et al 2013 it is separated into upper middle and lower stream areas by the yingluoxia and zhengyixia hydrological stations green triangles in fig 2a there are distinct environmental backgrounds within the hrb the elevation ranges from 5000 m above the sea level m asl in the headwater area to nearly 900 m asl in the terminal lakes fig 2b topographically the basin consists of the qilian mountains in the south the hexi corridor plain in the middle segment and the foothills and alxa plain in lower reaches where partly borders the badain jaran and tengger deserts the cold mountain zone climate is dominant over the upper reaches area with the mean temperature varying from 5 c december to 4 c july the average annual total precipitation of the upper reach is over 250 mm which ranges from 600 to 700 mm at higher altitudes most of rain there occurs during summer between june and september li et al 2017a the middle and lower reaches areas are typical arid temperate zone and extremely arid temperate zone with the mean annual temperature being around 6 and 8 c and the annual total precipitation less than 200 mm and 50 mm respectively yang et al 2019 the main geomorphological compartments of hrb include the glacier alpine ice snow and permafrost water conservation forest piedmont oasis and desert oasis li et al 2020 the upper reaches of the hrb owns 88 of the total annual water resources in the basin but the mainstream in the lower reaches becomes wide and sluggish or even dried up in some sections due to the extremely arid climate and over exploited water resource this strongly hinders the comprehensive water sampling in the field while the natural setting of the hrb provides a perfect research platform for the hm transport among various carriers the complexity of the basin also makes field sampling and observation rather challenging thus it is hard to use the conventional design and approach to conduct a spatially consistent sampling of carriers within this catchment the regional social economic characteristics are also distinguishable from upper to lower stream areas the upstream area is dominated by animal husbandry coupled with small scale mining these mines had been placed into operation since the 1980s for the special metallogenic conditions and resources li et al 2020 although the government had adopted the conservation policy of qilian mountain national park in june 2017 to ban mining activities yan and ding 2020 the subsequent effects of mining can last for decades the middle reaches accounting for 95 of the population and 88 7 of the economy contributions fig 2a is known for its development of agriculture nonferrous metals steel and petrochemical resources zhang et al 2020b the downstream district is a pastoral area but the tourist population had increased from 0 03 million in 2000 to 1 1 million in 2015 and the tourism income accounted for two thirds of the tertiary industry in 2015 lu et al 2021 therefore the diverse social economic conditions within the hrb provide an ideal site for extracting typical human activity patterns 3 framework design there were 4 main steps in this research fig 3 1 create spatial distribution layers of secondary carriers via sdm in order to separate human and environmental explanatory variables soil sampling sites were collected intentionally close to the human activity locations while sediment and wet deposition sites were far away from human activities see 3 2 1 the importance analysis of explanatory variables based on rda and model selection will be then performed and important variables will be used for prediction 2 select systematic explanatory variables for river water including human activity variables and environmental variables as well as the hm layers of secondary carriers that were created in step 1 3 analyze the relationships between hms in river water and explanatory variables by generalized linear models glm and generalized additive models gam 4 predict the spatial distributions of hms in river by sdm considering all the potential variables the model building process of hm mapping in this study was mainly based on a typical sdm framework guisan and zimmermann 2000 hijmans and elith 2013 including i model conceptualization ii data preparation iii model fitting iv performance assessment and outputs 3 1 model conceptualization in ecology the sdms use species presence only data and explanatory variables to assess species niches and predict their potential habitats fig 4 in other research fields the various entities are regarded as different species and the areas showing the positive relations with these research objectives were defined as habitat such as the emotional habitat li et al 2021 in this study we ecologicalized hms in these carriers as different species which enabled the proposed framework to model the enrichment area of individual hms in the geographic space termed as the hm habitat and identify their hotspots peak value points in the catchment each hm like as cd pb zn in the geographic space was regarded as the species and the spaces where show high concentrations were regarded as the heavy metal habitat fig 4 additionally the hm transport among different carriers were converted into the food chain relationships in the sdm fig 5 3 2 data preparation 3 2 1 field sampling of various carriers hms were sampled respectively in the primary carrier of river water as well as in the secondary carriers such as soil modern fluvial sediment and atmospheric deposition within the hrb fig 2b although sdm does not require sampling density and spatial consistency for field observations we tried to cover the entire catchment when collecting river water a set of river water samples were collected along the mainstream and tributaries of the hrb both in winter december 2014 january 2015 and summer july 2014 periods at the same locations all river water samples were collected in the surface stream into pre cleaned polythene bottles to further separate the influence from natural e g sediment atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic e g soil variables the hms in secondary carriers were sampled with intentions around the same hydrological year the atmospheric depositions were collected at the forest sites with an elevation of 2850 and 3050 m asl respectively in the upstream of the catchment the samples were collected after each precipitation event and then stored in polyethylene bottles that had been thoroughly cleaned with deionized water the ultrapure hno3 were added to acidify both river water and wet deposition samples and all the liquid samples were stored at 4 c until being shipped to the laboratory in terms of the solid samples the sites for collecting the soils were in typical land use types for example the mining soils in the upstream agricultural and industry soils in the middle stream and the livestock field soils in the downstream areas fig 2b to obtain representative samples approximately 1 kg of surface layer fresh soil 0 20 cm in depth was collected using a precleaned plastic dustpan and brush in contrast the modern fluvial sediment samples were collected from the subsurface below 10 cm depth at riverbed and floodplain by a pre cleaned spade all the sediment sampling sites were far from urban areas and farmland to minimize the influence of human activities fig 2b both the soil and sediment samples were stored in plastic bags and then shipped to the laboratory for further hm concentration analysis prior to hm concentration analysis the river water and atmospheric deposition samples were digested with 1 hno3 both soil and sediment samples were air dried at 20 c sorted through a 2 mm plastic sieve to remove any clasts homogenized by using an agate mortar and finally passed through a 200 mesh sieve zhang et al 2020a took 0 1 g of each solid sample and mixed 2 ml of concentrated hno3 and 1 ml of hclo4 in a polypropylene vessel the solution was heated for nearly 4 h and then the residue was re dissolved in a plastic vessel with 2 ml of 4 mol l 1 hcl and diluted to 10 ml with deionized water the blanks and standard reference materials gbw07408 gss 8 were then processed the concentrations of hms of river water wet deposition and soil were measured by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms 7500a agilent santa clara ca usa sediments by icp ms x 7 thermo elemental usa for most of the hms the corresponding relative standard deviation was below 5 finally a valid field dataset was ready for subsequent analyses including 94 samples from river water 47 in summer and 47 in winter 8 wet deposition samples 65 soil samples and 37 sediment samples 3 2 2 groups of explanatory variables we proposed two types of adequate and systematic explanatory variables for the primary carrier river water one type was the main explanatory variables including the environmental and human variables the other was the corresponding hm compositions in the secondary carriers the sets of explanatory variables were only selected in the models if i they were able to stand for typical natural and economic conditions in this catchment such as the social economy status ii they were closely related to hms transport process for example the frequent and strong erosions and iii they had been proven by previous studies to have a profound impact on the hms such as the terrains around the mining sites gross domestic product gdp luo et al 2021 night light levin et al 2020 population density trujillo gonzález et al 2016 land use and transport hong et al 2018 datasets were selected as proxies of human activities e g urbanization and or industrialization that could directly or indirectly affect the hm abundance all these datasets were extracted from the social statistical geographical information system and remote sensing products as below the explanatory variables were presented in table 2 land use terrain and meteorological data were obtained from the resources and environment data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn socioeconomic data also downloaded from the resdc include spatial distribution data of a 1 km grid gdp nightlight population density and transport data railways expressways national highways and provincial roads in total five environmental and eleven human activity variables were extracted the corresponding hm concentrations in secondary carriers were considered as the auxiliary variables to predict the hm in the primary carrier each carrier has its own sampling density during the filed collection process we first calculated the respective determinant variables for each secondary carrier according to the sdm model and then predicted their spatial distributions based on these determinant variables by sdm once the spatial distribution rasters of each carrier were created within the catchment we extracted all raster values by the river water locations by doing so all the hm values of secondary carriers can be interpolated to river water sampling sites 3 3 model fitting the choice of adequate modeling algorithms and desired model complexity should be guided by the research objective and by hypotheses regarding the specific entities variables relationship elith and franklin 2013 based on the dataset characteristics we used redundancy analysis rda glm and gam as parts of model fitting process 3 3 1 redundancy analysis rda was introduced here to deal with multicollinearity and determine which variables should be included in the model rda is a powerful methodology to produce an ordination that regresses the impact of a matrix of multiple explanatory variables the objects with similar variable values were ordinated closer together while different values were projected apart before analysis the datasets were normalized to reduce the influence of different units the qualitative variables were recorded as dummy variables legendre and anderson 1999 and they were different hms in this study then a permutation test with 1000 was conducted to examine the null hypothesis that no linear relationship exists between the response and explanatory variables we then examined the significance of constraining variables by the permutation test with 100 000 and the determinant variables with higher significant value were remained when collinearity the proportion of variance explained by each rda axis was presented by an eigenvalue considering the extreme complexity of natural environment badry et al 2019 the sum of the first two axes eigenvalues above 10 was acceptable in this study 3 3 2 generalized linear models and generalized additive models generalized linear models glm allowing the response variables to have error distribution models has been widely used as an appropriate theoretic approach glm was applied here to examine the ability of a reasonable combination of explanatory variables to explain variation of the hms after that it was applied to predict the spatial distributions of hms based on the determinant variables for the wet deposition the glm was only used for predicting spatial patterns and the important variables were selected according to previous research stankwitz et al 2012 zang et al 2021 generalized additive models gam where the response variable is not restricted to be linear in the explanatory variables were introduced to further estimate the smooth components of the glm models using smooth functions according to the characteristics of our dataset only five important variables were selected in the final models to depict the relationships between river water hms and their explanatory variables considering some of the hm concentrations were between 0 and 1 μg l mg kg we kept the negative prediction values during the gam analysis prior to model fitting procedure environmental and human variables were scaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to enhance comparability of effect sizes across variables measured in different scales the collinearity between the explanatory variables was considered and only the most significant variables were retained for further analysis 3 4 model assessment and outputs the model fitting should avoid overfitting or underfitting and achieve a low generalization error that characterizes its prediction performance in order to build such model model selection and model averaging were used here to decide which model to select from candidate model families based on performance evaluations 3 4 1 model selection when multiple model algorithms or candidate models were fitted model selection was conducted to select the top model from a set of best models the top model is the most parsimonious combination of explanatory variables using the cross validation process there are many selection criterions for model selection and akiake information criterion aic is the most commonly used criteria which is a measure of the goodness fit of an estimated statistical model the best models were then ordered by the criteria of aic the aic is a measure of fit that penalizes for the number of variables and aicc works better when the sample sizes are small 1 aicc aic 2 k k 1 n k 1 smaller values indicate better fit and thus the aicc can be used to compare models thus models with the lowest aicc are considered to be the top models highlighting the included variables and model support relative to other models within 2 aicc 3 4 2 model averaging the model averaging was proposed for addressing the issues of uncertainty in the choice of probability distribution functions and the biased regression parameters during the model selection process burnham et al 2011 with dataset and the smooth functions used in this study the selection of variables was based on a whether corresponding to the research objectives well b whether consistent with the related results in section 3 1 and 3 2 c sum of weights and d whether collinear to each other in this study only the most important five explanatory variables were retained in the final model set to predict the relationships for each hm element in river water once the relationships between individual hms and explanatory variables were established we created the spatial maps of hms in river water by projecting the model onto environmental layers the data preparation analyses and mapping in this study were achieved in arcgis 10 5 environmental systems research institute inc and r v3 5 1 r core team 2018 4 results 4 1 importance of explanatory variables for secondary carriers 4 1 1 human driven variables via soil carrier all the peak values of hm concentrations in soil were observed in the middle reach areas where the average concentration of as in middle areas was as twenty times as that in the upstream areas table 4 according to the results of rda the longer arrows mean this variable plays an important role in the response matrix the gdp and distance to road strongly drove the variation along the first axis while other explanatory variables along the second axis fig 6 the elements of as zn and pb significantly correlated with the gdp especially in the middle stream areas in contrast the distance to road was related to the hms in the downstream area cd centered in the coordination system showing a correlation with most of the explanatory variables the land use types of forest land 1 and mining land 5 3 played an important role in the hm compositions in the upstream area which consisted with the environmental and socioeconomic conditions in this area top models with low aicc values were listed in table 5 we hypothesized that the soil hm compositions might be dominated by different land use types but only the grassland showed correlation with cd from the top models while distance to road gdp and nightlight were more likely than land use types to be correlated with soil hms 4 1 2 environment driven variables via sediment carrier the triplot of fig 7 a showed that the grain sizes of 0 63 250 500 μm explained together 54 08 of the total variance of the sediment hm data the 0 63 μm size showed significant correlations with the sediment hms in the downstream area while the upstream area was related to the precipitation amounts for the lithology rda fig 7b the drivers of ilmenite garnet and magnetite were distributed along the first axis 36 54 the hm variations in the upstream showed correlative relationships with the epidote minerals while downstream was correlated to the lithologies of sphene and tourmaline the 500 2000 μm grain size mean size and temperature were the best explanatory variables for cr in the sediments table 5 and the garnet and zircon lithology strongly correlated to the cr additionally the 0 63 and 250 500 grain sizes showed strongest correlation with ni and it had the same best lithology variables as cr in contrast the grain sizes had no significant impacts on pb but the land use type of water and precipitation showed great correlations with the accumulation of pb in sediment unlike cr and ni the lithology type of magnetite and sphene were found to predict the pb best table 5 4 2 spatial hm habitats in secondary carriers the explanatory variables we used to predict the hm distribution in soil were listed in table 3 including gdp nightlight and population density as well as the terrain characteristic factors the concentrations of as pb and zn showed peak values around the big cities in middle areas especially jiuquan and jiayuguan where the typical industrial cities are located in northwestern china fig 8 according to the results of glm in table 5 the precipitation amount and temperature were selected as the explanatory variables to predict the spatial distribution of hms in the sediment and the terrain characteristics were also considered in the sdm the output maps indicated that concentrations of all the hms showed an increasing trend from upper reaches to lower reaches with pb showing the most obvious increase in the downstream areas fig 9 however high values of each element in the upstream spread out spatially reflecting the influence of the hydraulic sorting process precipitation amount rainfall intensity humidity and terrain factors were selected as the explanatory variables to predict the spatial distributions of hms in atmospheric deposition table 3 output maps showed that the high values of hms in wet deposition were distributed in the downstream areas but relatively lower in the upstream and middle stream segments fig 10 this pattern could be explained by the scavenging effect and washout process of precipitation in downstream areas where precipitation is scarce hms will be continuously accumulated in atmospheric particles so high concentrations of hms were observed during the limited precipitation events in contrast the large amount and high frequency of precipitation in the upstream areas made the concentrations of hms relatively lower 4 3 hm transmission at large scale catchment in summer period the highest values of as cd cr hg and pb in river water were all in the middle stream areas while the upstream areas had the lowest values for most of the hms table 4 4 3 1 spatiotemporal distributions of hms in river water except for cu and zn the other four elements in the middle reach were significantly higher than those in other sections as and cr in the middle reach were significantly higher in winter than in summer while cu and hg showed an opposite trend fig 11 4 3 2 importance of variables for hms in river water according to the top models of hms in river water table 5 as showed correlations with distance to road and precipitation amount the top model of cr was explained by the corresponding cr compositions from secondary carriers including the sediment and wet deposition the variation of hg was influenced by the distance to road night light most of the land use types as well as the hg accumulation process from the wet deposition table 5 additionally the hm transport and accumulation processes from sediments and wet deposition played the most important role in the river water pb compositions followed by the economic parameters including distance to road gdp land use type of agriculture and population density 4 3 3 relationships between hms in river with all explanatory variables considering the importance of the explanatory variables and our study objectives the top five significant variables were selected as the final variables to explain the hm compositions in river water table 6 the distance to road showed negative relationships with as cu hg and pb but a positive influence on zn and a non linear relationship with cr fig 12 the gdp had positive relationship with pb but negative with cr and zn while for as cu and hg the gdp showed a negative trend at first until the gdp increased to 500 then turned into positive relationships precipitation had positive relationships with as and cu but roughly negative relationships with cr and hg the influence from wet deposition showed positive relationships with as cu and pb but negative with cr and non linear relationship with hg hms from soil carrier greatly contributed to the accumulation of as pb and zn it firstly showed a positive trend but then turned into negative trend when the concentration of as and pb were around 7 5 ppm 4 3 4 hm habitats and hotspots in river water the human activity variables including gdp population density nightlight distance to road and land use types and environmental variables including ndvi precipitation temperature and erosion classification were chosen as the predictors in sdm to predict the hms in river water in order not to discount the influence of hm transport and accumulation processes among different carriers the corresponding hms from secondary carriers were also considered in our study and the output maps with considering the hms in secondary carriers were presented in fig 13 compared with the output maps without considering the hms in secondary carriers the prediction accuracy of maps in fig 13 had been significantly improved for instance there were more hotspots of as around the cities if we considered the contributions of as accumulation from soil and wet deposition fig 14 a additionally more hotspots of as and pb were predicted in the upstream areas when we added the hm compositions of secondary carriers in the sdm fig 14 the predicted intervals of pb compositions showed an increased trend when we considered the pb accumulations from soil sediment and wet deposition fig 14b 5 discussion 5 1 creation of comprehensive and consistent explanatory variables for better prediction of hms insufficient explanatory variables will greatly hinder the completeness and accuracy of investigating the hm transport and accumulation processes thus the selection of appropriate indirect and direct potential explanatory variables has been shown as a key step for identifying the hm sources and depicting the transport processes nickel et al 2014 estimating the explanatory variables has previously been undertaken using three main conventional approaches i collect samples in typical land use areas to be considered as the prevailing explanatory factor li et al 2017b liang et al 2017a 2017b sharma et al 2008 such systematic reconnaissance survey requires the evaluation of the land use types or other information before sampling sharma et al 2008 ii sample the point source pollutions around typical locations hochella et al 2005 liang et al 2017b quinton and catt 2007 the mining operations are important point sources in previous research like the waste rock and smelter waste liang et al 2017b iii monitor a series of synchronous factors by some equipment in the field for example zang et al 2021 arranged an equipment in the field to collect the synchronous rainfall amount intensity duration and wind speed etc during each precipitation event nevertheless these conventional methods are always constrained by the complex field situations leading to a lack of observation sites recently hu et al 2020 proposed that the use of geographic information system gis remote sensing products and other geographical information can help to extract comprehensive explanatory variables over large scale region however this study only used land use maps as auxiliary variables without considering other human variables species distribution models sdms can describe the relationships between species and corresponding explanatory variables and predict their responses to the changing explanatory variables kearney and porter 2009 fig 4 another important advantage of sdm is that it can superimpose and calculate many explanatory variables at the same time in this study we systematically collected comprehensive corresponding variables from the available gis and remote sensing products over the study area the prediction results of sdm in this study not only considered the environmental background information topography water flow direction etc but also took into account the influence of human activities land use gdp population density public transport etc more importantly this study also used the secondary carriers as explanatory variables to explain and predict the hms in river water comparing to the output maps without considering the secondary hm concentrations we found it may improve the prediction quality fig 13 fig 14 for example we didn t have soil samples in jiuquan and jiayuguan areas but the sdm model predicted that there were hm hotspots in this place fig 8 the spatial variations of these hm compositions were consistent with the previous studies guan et al 2018 which proved the feasibility and universal applicability of our model incorporating more data layers of influencing factors into sdm can potentially increase the accuracy of the prediction of hm distributions therefore more factors that affect hm transport should be considered in the future study when such data become available including extreme precipitation events geochemical backgrounds etc 5 2 solution to the field sampling limitations field sampling provides core scientific data for studying the interactions among various carriers with an important prerequisite of geographical continuity for establishing connections between different carriers fig 1 to ensure this the main solution of previous research was the proximity strategy during the sampling process table 1 the typical research include the proximity between the soil and river water hassellov and von der kammer 2008 quinton and catt 2007 soil and crops hu et al 2020 atmospheric deposition and soil liang et al 2017b atmospheric deposition and vegetables sharma et al 2008 flood plain and riverbed sediment hochella et al 2005 however the major challenge in current proximity methods is how to ensure the spatial match among layers of different carriers which otherwise would greatly reduce the accuracy of subsequent analysis especially over the large scale regions complex terrains harsh weather undeveloped public transport system and other constraints at the field make it challenging or even impossible to collect multi dimensional carriers at the same point li et al 2020 for the entire catchment especially with large scales different carriers collecting sites cannot distribute at the same sampling density or rate under actual circumstances a dearth of consistent data for different carriers is often credited as a major limitation for hms interaction research liu et al 2019 sdm has advantage of using the presence only data which are the field observations where the presences of the species were observed sdm thus doesn t require the normal distribution and spatial continuation of the field data fig 4 and is friendly to scientific research involves in large scale area where continuous sampling is normally impossible the sampling in this study was based on sdm requirement and collected different carriers in typical areas across the entire catchment as much as possible the output maps confirmed that the sdm worked well to map the hm distribution especially in areas that lack of field samples 5 3 ecologicalization of hm contaminants by sdm the spatial distribution of hms is an important indicator to estimate the environment pollution li et al 2017b which was mostly achieved by the kriging interpolation as one of the most prevalent spatial interpolation methods in previous studies li et al 2017b liang et al 2017a strong evidence has shown that increasing the sampling density is the main approach to improve the accuracy of predictions lv 2019 but the conventional interpolation methods ignore the influence of many determinant variables when investigating the hm transport and accumulation processes li et al 2017b lv 2019 explored to apply the geostatistical techniques to estimate the hm spatial distribution based on the factors resulting from the receptor models nickel et al 2014 proposed to combine multivariate generalized linear models with kriging interpolation to create hm maps at a high level of spatial resolution however both of these two studies had to increase the sampling density to ensure the accuracy of the hm prediction table 1 which is often challenging over large catchment in addition lots of preparatory work for these two studies was required for example the explanatory variables must be calculated and selected through the acceptor models beforehand in this study we innovatively adopt the sdm by ecologicalizing the hms in catchment as different species when studying the spatial distributions of different hms in the same carrier different hms in the same carrier were regarded as species of the same trophic level to predict their spatial distributions fig 5 similarly the hm transport among different carriers were converted into the food chain relationships in the sdm fig 5 and each carrier was assumed to have its own habitats a few research entities had been ecologicalized as different species in previous studies such as human emotions li et al 2021 visitors and hikers coppes and braunisch 2013 based on our hm output maps the prediction accuracy has been significantly improved thus we believe sdms have big potentials for mapping the hm distributions due to the scarcity of field data in this study some typical big data driven sdm models such as maxent cannot be used instead we built our own sdm framework to address the issue future work can be conducted to explore the use of different advanced sdms to further improve the heavy metal mapping research 6 conclusion the spatial inconsistence and mismatch of the field samplings for different hm carriers profoundly hinder our ability to map hms over large areas to address this issue this study developed a novel methodological framework for mapping hm contamination over the large scale catchment with a species distribution model results found that the variables of distance to road gdp and nightlight played a relatively important role in accumulation of soil hms the output maps of hms from soil sediment and wet deposition could respectively reflect the influence of industry contaminants hydraulic sorting and precipitation washout process which proved the rationality of sdm in predicting the spatial distributions of individual carriers the environment and human variables together with the hm transport from the secondary carriers were selected as explanatory variables to predict the hms in river water which helped to better predict spatial dynamics and transport mechanism of hms although future work is needed to overcome existing biases and challenges the methodological framework proposed in

15414,heavy metal loid s hms have been consistently entering the food chain imposing great harm on environment and public health however previous studies on the spatial dynamics and transport mechanism of hms have been profoundly limited by the field sampling issues such as the uneven observations of individual carriers and their spatial mismatch especially over large scale catchments with complex environment in this study a novel methodological framework for mapping hms at catchment scale was proposed and applied combining a species distribution model sdm with physical environment and human variables based on the field observations we ecologicalized hms in different carriers as different species this enabled the proposed framework to model the enrichment area of individual hms in the geographic space termed as the hm habitat and identify their hotspots peak value points within the catchment results showed the output maps of hm habitats from secondary carriers soil sediment and wet deposition well agreed with the influence of industry contaminants hydraulic sorting and precipitation washout process respectively indicating the potential of sdm in modeling the spatial distributions of the hm the derived maps of hms from secondary carriers along with the human and environmental variables were then input as explanatory variables in sdm to predict the spatial patterns of the final hm accumulation in river water which was observed to have largely improved the prediction quality these results confirmed the value of our framework to leverage sdms from ecology perspective to study hm contamination transport at catchment scale offering new insights not only to map the spatial hm habitats but also help locate the hm transport chains among different carriers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heavy metals species distribution model catchment carriers environmental variables human variables data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metal loid s hms ubiquitous and generally persistent in the environment tend to accumulate in natural sinks and bio magnify in the food chain ali et al 2019 imposing great potential threats to human health and environmental sustainability hms have been found to actively transport within multiple environmental compartments such as the catchment hassellov and von der kammer 2008 urban system sarkar et al 2021 agriculture meite et al 2018 estuary fang et al 2016 mining sites and public transport system etc goth et al 2019 senduran et al 2018 stojic et al 2017 spreading from local regional to global scales thus understanding of hm transport mechanism and spatial dynamics is essential for conservation and resource management hassellov and von der kammer 2008 studies on hm contamination within catchment have been increasingly applied but challenged by the complex environment of catchment system which consists of multi dimensional carriers such as the atmospheric deposition soil sediment river water and biosphere etc fig 1 the river water plays as a pollutant sink for hms within a catchment which links various carriers through a series of physicochemical processes including atmospheric deposition nickel et al 2014 water rock interactions from riparian and floodplain hassellov and von der kammer 2008 and soil leaching and erosion li et al 2020 etc fig 1 to separate the carrier types we defined the river water as the primary carrier while atmospheric deposition soil and sediment as secondary carriers hm contamination and transport mechanism in catchment system have been investigated in the previous studies for addressing three main questions in the field what are the potential explanatory variables that drive hm transport where are the hm enrichment areas and should the recovery efforts be focused and how do these various carriers interact to spread hms key papers including their strength and limitations for these essential research questions are summarized in table 1 for example the pb isotopes approach and source apportionment methods have been widely used to study the water supply systems and identify hm sources within catchment cable and deng 2018 gassama et al 2021 lv 2019 multivariate receptor models were then introduced to quantify the relative contributions of different pollutant sources taiwo et al 2014 recent development of nanotechnology may offer potential solution for accurately identifying the relationships between hms and explanatory variables which yet is too expensive and not suitable for large scale study areas gajbhiye et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 additionally modern statistical methods including simple linear models and advanced machine learning as well as novel statistical method such as a flag element ratio approach hong et al 2018 have been increasingly proposed to identify the relationships between hms and explanatory variables hu et al 2020 as a result although these previous studies have made significant contributions details in the literature review of table 1 there are three important gaps in the current knowledge remain to be solved which are largely due to the spatial inconsistence and scarcity of the field observations i insufficient explanatory variables of hms were often selected to correspond with a specific carrier studied in previous research therefore comprehensive explanatory variables from separated environment and human factors are needed for a better understanding of hm contamination and transport mechanism ii current mapping methods of hms are dependent on the spatial interpolation like kriging and the results are greatly sensitive to the intensity and spatial distribution of field data sampling iii only single hm carrier was investigated in most of the previous studies because of the spatial heterogeneous sampling sites among different carriers profoundly hindering our understanding of the interactions from a multi dimension carrier perspective which play an important role in transporting the hms therefore a comprehensive framework of novel methods and datasets is needed to fill these knowledge gaps for better mapping and assessing hm contamination in large scale catchment species distribution models sdm have been widely applied in research areas such as conservation biology ecology and evolution sdm is a model of a general format which can predict the suitability of the potential habitats of different species with presence location sample data and environmental features e g climate land use soil etc in other words sdms of various algorithms can map the past current and future spatial distributions of different species which however were all designed according to the same core rule the characteristics of species thus if significant research similarities between species and certain research targets e g hms exist there would be potential in putting the targets as entries to sdms instead of species to map the spatial distributions of targets this rationality has been evidenced by the success of several previous studies such as geographical planning and design clemente et al 2019 virus spread monitoring harrigan et al 2014 and spatial distribution of human emotion li et al 2021 however sdms and hm mapping have only been developed in parallel and this study showed that sdm has potential in mapping habitats of hms due to the important research similarities between species and hms i fuzziness the spatial distributions of these species and hms can be represented by specific boundaries such as administrative regions geomorphic units etc fig 4 ii complexity both the species and hms are being influenced by multi dimensional factors such as the environment and human variables fig 4 iii spatial coexistence multiple biological species on the same trophic level can share the same habitat similarly multiple hms e g pb hg as cd etc in each carrier discussed in this study often co exist in the catchment fig 5 iv dynamics interactions always occur among multiple biological species on food chains likewise hm transport and accumulate among various carriers fig 5 in this study we developed a novel framework for mapping hm contamination at large catchment scale combining a typical species distribution model method guisan and zimmermann 2000 hijmans and elith 2013 with environmental and human variables with different hms e g pb hg as cd etc being considered as different species we were able to model the habitat of each hm enrichment area in the geographic space termed as the hm habitat along with hm hotspots hm peak value points in particular we aimed to i separate impacts from natural environment and human activities on secondary carriers e g soil sediment and atmospheric deposition ii investigate the spatial habitats and hotspots of hms where mitigation efforts should be given within various carriers iii assess spatiotemporal hm transmission patterns of river water the primary carrier across the entire catchment with modelled spatially consistent data this study proposed to leverage sdm models from ecology to map hm contamination which can effectively build the environment human hm relationships to fill the current important knowledge gaps over large scale catchment this will offer new future perspectives and directions to the field of water pollution 2 study area we applied our proposed methodological framework to the heihe river basin hrb which is a large scale catchment that has always been considered as a natural laboratory in many previous research cheng et al 2014 the hrb originates from the qilian mountains along the northeastern margin of the third pole of the world qinghai tibet plateau fig 2 a the main river flows 821 km covering an area of approximately 14 3 104 km2 with a mean annual runoff of 1 588 109 m3 ge et al 2013 it is separated into upper middle and lower stream areas by the yingluoxia and zhengyixia hydrological stations green triangles in fig 2a there are distinct environmental backgrounds within the hrb the elevation ranges from 5000 m above the sea level m asl in the headwater area to nearly 900 m asl in the terminal lakes fig 2b topographically the basin consists of the qilian mountains in the south the hexi corridor plain in the middle segment and the foothills and alxa plain in lower reaches where partly borders the badain jaran and tengger deserts the cold mountain zone climate is dominant over the upper reaches area with the mean temperature varying from 5 c december to 4 c july the average annual total precipitation of the upper reach is over 250 mm which ranges from 600 to 700 mm at higher altitudes most of rain there occurs during summer between june and september li et al 2017a the middle and lower reaches areas are typical arid temperate zone and extremely arid temperate zone with the mean annual temperature being around 6 and 8 c and the annual total precipitation less than 200 mm and 50 mm respectively yang et al 2019 the main geomorphological compartments of hrb include the glacier alpine ice snow and permafrost water conservation forest piedmont oasis and desert oasis li et al 2020 the upper reaches of the hrb owns 88 of the total annual water resources in the basin but the mainstream in the lower reaches becomes wide and sluggish or even dried up in some sections due to the extremely arid climate and over exploited water resource this strongly hinders the comprehensive water sampling in the field while the natural setting of the hrb provides a perfect research platform for the hm transport among various carriers the complexity of the basin also makes field sampling and observation rather challenging thus it is hard to use the conventional design and approach to conduct a spatially consistent sampling of carriers within this catchment the regional social economic characteristics are also distinguishable from upper to lower stream areas the upstream area is dominated by animal husbandry coupled with small scale mining these mines had been placed into operation since the 1980s for the special metallogenic conditions and resources li et al 2020 although the government had adopted the conservation policy of qilian mountain national park in june 2017 to ban mining activities yan and ding 2020 the subsequent effects of mining can last for decades the middle reaches accounting for 95 of the population and 88 7 of the economy contributions fig 2a is known for its development of agriculture nonferrous metals steel and petrochemical resources zhang et al 2020b the downstream district is a pastoral area but the tourist population had increased from 0 03 million in 2000 to 1 1 million in 2015 and the tourism income accounted for two thirds of the tertiary industry in 2015 lu et al 2021 therefore the diverse social economic conditions within the hrb provide an ideal site for extracting typical human activity patterns 3 framework design there were 4 main steps in this research fig 3 1 create spatial distribution layers of secondary carriers via sdm in order to separate human and environmental explanatory variables soil sampling sites were collected intentionally close to the human activity locations while sediment and wet deposition sites were far away from human activities see 3 2 1 the importance analysis of explanatory variables based on rda and model selection will be then performed and important variables will be used for prediction 2 select systematic explanatory variables for river water including human activity variables and environmental variables as well as the hm layers of secondary carriers that were created in step 1 3 analyze the relationships between hms in river water and explanatory variables by generalized linear models glm and generalized additive models gam 4 predict the spatial distributions of hms in river by sdm considering all the potential variables the model building process of hm mapping in this study was mainly based on a typical sdm framework guisan and zimmermann 2000 hijmans and elith 2013 including i model conceptualization ii data preparation iii model fitting iv performance assessment and outputs 3 1 model conceptualization in ecology the sdms use species presence only data and explanatory variables to assess species niches and predict their potential habitats fig 4 in other research fields the various entities are regarded as different species and the areas showing the positive relations with these research objectives were defined as habitat such as the emotional habitat li et al 2021 in this study we ecologicalized hms in these carriers as different species which enabled the proposed framework to model the enrichment area of individual hms in the geographic space termed as the hm habitat and identify their hotspots peak value points in the catchment each hm like as cd pb zn in the geographic space was regarded as the species and the spaces where show high concentrations were regarded as the heavy metal habitat fig 4 additionally the hm transport among different carriers were converted into the food chain relationships in the sdm fig 5 3 2 data preparation 3 2 1 field sampling of various carriers hms were sampled respectively in the primary carrier of river water as well as in the secondary carriers such as soil modern fluvial sediment and atmospheric deposition within the hrb fig 2b although sdm does not require sampling density and spatial consistency for field observations we tried to cover the entire catchment when collecting river water a set of river water samples were collected along the mainstream and tributaries of the hrb both in winter december 2014 january 2015 and summer july 2014 periods at the same locations all river water samples were collected in the surface stream into pre cleaned polythene bottles to further separate the influence from natural e g sediment atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic e g soil variables the hms in secondary carriers were sampled with intentions around the same hydrological year the atmospheric depositions were collected at the forest sites with an elevation of 2850 and 3050 m asl respectively in the upstream of the catchment the samples were collected after each precipitation event and then stored in polyethylene bottles that had been thoroughly cleaned with deionized water the ultrapure hno3 were added to acidify both river water and wet deposition samples and all the liquid samples were stored at 4 c until being shipped to the laboratory in terms of the solid samples the sites for collecting the soils were in typical land use types for example the mining soils in the upstream agricultural and industry soils in the middle stream and the livestock field soils in the downstream areas fig 2b to obtain representative samples approximately 1 kg of surface layer fresh soil 0 20 cm in depth was collected using a precleaned plastic dustpan and brush in contrast the modern fluvial sediment samples were collected from the subsurface below 10 cm depth at riverbed and floodplain by a pre cleaned spade all the sediment sampling sites were far from urban areas and farmland to minimize the influence of human activities fig 2b both the soil and sediment samples were stored in plastic bags and then shipped to the laboratory for further hm concentration analysis prior to hm concentration analysis the river water and atmospheric deposition samples were digested with 1 hno3 both soil and sediment samples were air dried at 20 c sorted through a 2 mm plastic sieve to remove any clasts homogenized by using an agate mortar and finally passed through a 200 mesh sieve zhang et al 2020a took 0 1 g of each solid sample and mixed 2 ml of concentrated hno3 and 1 ml of hclo4 in a polypropylene vessel the solution was heated for nearly 4 h and then the residue was re dissolved in a plastic vessel with 2 ml of 4 mol l 1 hcl and diluted to 10 ml with deionized water the blanks and standard reference materials gbw07408 gss 8 were then processed the concentrations of hms of river water wet deposition and soil were measured by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms 7500a agilent santa clara ca usa sediments by icp ms x 7 thermo elemental usa for most of the hms the corresponding relative standard deviation was below 5 finally a valid field dataset was ready for subsequent analyses including 94 samples from river water 47 in summer and 47 in winter 8 wet deposition samples 65 soil samples and 37 sediment samples 3 2 2 groups of explanatory variables we proposed two types of adequate and systematic explanatory variables for the primary carrier river water one type was the main explanatory variables including the environmental and human variables the other was the corresponding hm compositions in the secondary carriers the sets of explanatory variables were only selected in the models if i they were able to stand for typical natural and economic conditions in this catchment such as the social economy status ii they were closely related to hms transport process for example the frequent and strong erosions and iii they had been proven by previous studies to have a profound impact on the hms such as the terrains around the mining sites gross domestic product gdp luo et al 2021 night light levin et al 2020 population density trujillo gonzález et al 2016 land use and transport hong et al 2018 datasets were selected as proxies of human activities e g urbanization and or industrialization that could directly or indirectly affect the hm abundance all these datasets were extracted from the social statistical geographical information system and remote sensing products as below the explanatory variables were presented in table 2 land use terrain and meteorological data were obtained from the resources and environment data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn socioeconomic data also downloaded from the resdc include spatial distribution data of a 1 km grid gdp nightlight population density and transport data railways expressways national highways and provincial roads in total five environmental and eleven human activity variables were extracted the corresponding hm concentrations in secondary carriers were considered as the auxiliary variables to predict the hm in the primary carrier each carrier has its own sampling density during the filed collection process we first calculated the respective determinant variables for each secondary carrier according to the sdm model and then predicted their spatial distributions based on these determinant variables by sdm once the spatial distribution rasters of each carrier were created within the catchment we extracted all raster values by the river water locations by doing so all the hm values of secondary carriers can be interpolated to river water sampling sites 3 3 model fitting the choice of adequate modeling algorithms and desired model complexity should be guided by the research objective and by hypotheses regarding the specific entities variables relationship elith and franklin 2013 based on the dataset characteristics we used redundancy analysis rda glm and gam as parts of model fitting process 3 3 1 redundancy analysis rda was introduced here to deal with multicollinearity and determine which variables should be included in the model rda is a powerful methodology to produce an ordination that regresses the impact of a matrix of multiple explanatory variables the objects with similar variable values were ordinated closer together while different values were projected apart before analysis the datasets were normalized to reduce the influence of different units the qualitative variables were recorded as dummy variables legendre and anderson 1999 and they were different hms in this study then a permutation test with 1000 was conducted to examine the null hypothesis that no linear relationship exists between the response and explanatory variables we then examined the significance of constraining variables by the permutation test with 100 000 and the determinant variables with higher significant value were remained when collinearity the proportion of variance explained by each rda axis was presented by an eigenvalue considering the extreme complexity of natural environment badry et al 2019 the sum of the first two axes eigenvalues above 10 was acceptable in this study 3 3 2 generalized linear models and generalized additive models generalized linear models glm allowing the response variables to have error distribution models has been widely used as an appropriate theoretic approach glm was applied here to examine the ability of a reasonable combination of explanatory variables to explain variation of the hms after that it was applied to predict the spatial distributions of hms based on the determinant variables for the wet deposition the glm was only used for predicting spatial patterns and the important variables were selected according to previous research stankwitz et al 2012 zang et al 2021 generalized additive models gam where the response variable is not restricted to be linear in the explanatory variables were introduced to further estimate the smooth components of the glm models using smooth functions according to the characteristics of our dataset only five important variables were selected in the final models to depict the relationships between river water hms and their explanatory variables considering some of the hm concentrations were between 0 and 1 μg l mg kg we kept the negative prediction values during the gam analysis prior to model fitting procedure environmental and human variables were scaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to enhance comparability of effect sizes across variables measured in different scales the collinearity between the explanatory variables was considered and only the most significant variables were retained for further analysis 3 4 model assessment and outputs the model fitting should avoid overfitting or underfitting and achieve a low generalization error that characterizes its prediction performance in order to build such model model selection and model averaging were used here to decide which model to select from candidate model families based on performance evaluations 3 4 1 model selection when multiple model algorithms or candidate models were fitted model selection was conducted to select the top model from a set of best models the top model is the most parsimonious combination of explanatory variables using the cross validation process there are many selection criterions for model selection and akiake information criterion aic is the most commonly used criteria which is a measure of the goodness fit of an estimated statistical model the best models were then ordered by the criteria of aic the aic is a measure of fit that penalizes for the number of variables and aicc works better when the sample sizes are small 1 aicc aic 2 k k 1 n k 1 smaller values indicate better fit and thus the aicc can be used to compare models thus models with the lowest aicc are considered to be the top models highlighting the included variables and model support relative to other models within 2 aicc 3 4 2 model averaging the model averaging was proposed for addressing the issues of uncertainty in the choice of probability distribution functions and the biased regression parameters during the model selection process burnham et al 2011 with dataset and the smooth functions used in this study the selection of variables was based on a whether corresponding to the research objectives well b whether consistent with the related results in section 3 1 and 3 2 c sum of weights and d whether collinear to each other in this study only the most important five explanatory variables were retained in the final model set to predict the relationships for each hm element in river water once the relationships between individual hms and explanatory variables were established we created the spatial maps of hms in river water by projecting the model onto environmental layers the data preparation analyses and mapping in this study were achieved in arcgis 10 5 environmental systems research institute inc and r v3 5 1 r core team 2018 4 results 4 1 importance of explanatory variables for secondary carriers 4 1 1 human driven variables via soil carrier all the peak values of hm concentrations in soil were observed in the middle reach areas where the average concentration of as in middle areas was as twenty times as that in the upstream areas table 4 according to the results of rda the longer arrows mean this variable plays an important role in the response matrix the gdp and distance to road strongly drove the variation along the first axis while other explanatory variables along the second axis fig 6 the elements of as zn and pb significantly correlated with the gdp especially in the middle stream areas in contrast the distance to road was related to the hms in the downstream area cd centered in the coordination system showing a correlation with most of the explanatory variables the land use types of forest land 1 and mining land 5 3 played an important role in the hm compositions in the upstream area which consisted with the environmental and socioeconomic conditions in this area top models with low aicc values were listed in table 5 we hypothesized that the soil hm compositions might be dominated by different land use types but only the grassland showed correlation with cd from the top models while distance to road gdp and nightlight were more likely than land use types to be correlated with soil hms 4 1 2 environment driven variables via sediment carrier the triplot of fig 7 a showed that the grain sizes of 0 63 250 500 μm explained together 54 08 of the total variance of the sediment hm data the 0 63 μm size showed significant correlations with the sediment hms in the downstream area while the upstream area was related to the precipitation amounts for the lithology rda fig 7b the drivers of ilmenite garnet and magnetite were distributed along the first axis 36 54 the hm variations in the upstream showed correlative relationships with the epidote minerals while downstream was correlated to the lithologies of sphene and tourmaline the 500 2000 μm grain size mean size and temperature were the best explanatory variables for cr in the sediments table 5 and the garnet and zircon lithology strongly correlated to the cr additionally the 0 63 and 250 500 grain sizes showed strongest correlation with ni and it had the same best lithology variables as cr in contrast the grain sizes had no significant impacts on pb but the land use type of water and precipitation showed great correlations with the accumulation of pb in sediment unlike cr and ni the lithology type of magnetite and sphene were found to predict the pb best table 5 4 2 spatial hm habitats in secondary carriers the explanatory variables we used to predict the hm distribution in soil were listed in table 3 including gdp nightlight and population density as well as the terrain characteristic factors the concentrations of as pb and zn showed peak values around the big cities in middle areas especially jiuquan and jiayuguan where the typical industrial cities are located in northwestern china fig 8 according to the results of glm in table 5 the precipitation amount and temperature were selected as the explanatory variables to predict the spatial distribution of hms in the sediment and the terrain characteristics were also considered in the sdm the output maps indicated that concentrations of all the hms showed an increasing trend from upper reaches to lower reaches with pb showing the most obvious increase in the downstream areas fig 9 however high values of each element in the upstream spread out spatially reflecting the influence of the hydraulic sorting process precipitation amount rainfall intensity humidity and terrain factors were selected as the explanatory variables to predict the spatial distributions of hms in atmospheric deposition table 3 output maps showed that the high values of hms in wet deposition were distributed in the downstream areas but relatively lower in the upstream and middle stream segments fig 10 this pattern could be explained by the scavenging effect and washout process of precipitation in downstream areas where precipitation is scarce hms will be continuously accumulated in atmospheric particles so high concentrations of hms were observed during the limited precipitation events in contrast the large amount and high frequency of precipitation in the upstream areas made the concentrations of hms relatively lower 4 3 hm transmission at large scale catchment in summer period the highest values of as cd cr hg and pb in river water were all in the middle stream areas while the upstream areas had the lowest values for most of the hms table 4 4 3 1 spatiotemporal distributions of hms in river water except for cu and zn the other four elements in the middle reach were significantly higher than those in other sections as and cr in the middle reach were significantly higher in winter than in summer while cu and hg showed an opposite trend fig 11 4 3 2 importance of variables for hms in river water according to the top models of hms in river water table 5 as showed correlations with distance to road and precipitation amount the top model of cr was explained by the corresponding cr compositions from secondary carriers including the sediment and wet deposition the variation of hg was influenced by the distance to road night light most of the land use types as well as the hg accumulation process from the wet deposition table 5 additionally the hm transport and accumulation processes from sediments and wet deposition played the most important role in the river water pb compositions followed by the economic parameters including distance to road gdp land use type of agriculture and population density 4 3 3 relationships between hms in river with all explanatory variables considering the importance of the explanatory variables and our study objectives the top five significant variables were selected as the final variables to explain the hm compositions in river water table 6 the distance to road showed negative relationships with as cu hg and pb but a positive influence on zn and a non linear relationship with cr fig 12 the gdp had positive relationship with pb but negative with cr and zn while for as cu and hg the gdp showed a negative trend at first until the gdp increased to 500 then turned into positive relationships precipitation had positive relationships with as and cu but roughly negative relationships with cr and hg the influence from wet deposition showed positive relationships with as cu and pb but negative with cr and non linear relationship with hg hms from soil carrier greatly contributed to the accumulation of as pb and zn it firstly showed a positive trend but then turned into negative trend when the concentration of as and pb were around 7 5 ppm 4 3 4 hm habitats and hotspots in river water the human activity variables including gdp population density nightlight distance to road and land use types and environmental variables including ndvi precipitation temperature and erosion classification were chosen as the predictors in sdm to predict the hms in river water in order not to discount the influence of hm transport and accumulation processes among different carriers the corresponding hms from secondary carriers were also considered in our study and the output maps with considering the hms in secondary carriers were presented in fig 13 compared with the output maps without considering the hms in secondary carriers the prediction accuracy of maps in fig 13 had been significantly improved for instance there were more hotspots of as around the cities if we considered the contributions of as accumulation from soil and wet deposition fig 14 a additionally more hotspots of as and pb were predicted in the upstream areas when we added the hm compositions of secondary carriers in the sdm fig 14 the predicted intervals of pb compositions showed an increased trend when we considered the pb accumulations from soil sediment and wet deposition fig 14b 5 discussion 5 1 creation of comprehensive and consistent explanatory variables for better prediction of hms insufficient explanatory variables will greatly hinder the completeness and accuracy of investigating the hm transport and accumulation processes thus the selection of appropriate indirect and direct potential explanatory variables has been shown as a key step for identifying the hm sources and depicting the transport processes nickel et al 2014 estimating the explanatory variables has previously been undertaken using three main conventional approaches i collect samples in typical land use areas to be considered as the prevailing explanatory factor li et al 2017b liang et al 2017a 2017b sharma et al 2008 such systematic reconnaissance survey requires the evaluation of the land use types or other information before sampling sharma et al 2008 ii sample the point source pollutions around typical locations hochella et al 2005 liang et al 2017b quinton and catt 2007 the mining operations are important point sources in previous research like the waste rock and smelter waste liang et al 2017b iii monitor a series of synchronous factors by some equipment in the field for example zang et al 2021 arranged an equipment in the field to collect the synchronous rainfall amount intensity duration and wind speed etc during each precipitation event nevertheless these conventional methods are always constrained by the complex field situations leading to a lack of observation sites recently hu et al 2020 proposed that the use of geographic information system gis remote sensing products and other geographical information can help to extract comprehensive explanatory variables over large scale region however this study only used land use maps as auxiliary variables without considering other human variables species distribution models sdms can describe the relationships between species and corresponding explanatory variables and predict their responses to the changing explanatory variables kearney and porter 2009 fig 4 another important advantage of sdm is that it can superimpose and calculate many explanatory variables at the same time in this study we systematically collected comprehensive corresponding variables from the available gis and remote sensing products over the study area the prediction results of sdm in this study not only considered the environmental background information topography water flow direction etc but also took into account the influence of human activities land use gdp population density public transport etc more importantly this study also used the secondary carriers as explanatory variables to explain and predict the hms in river water comparing to the output maps without considering the secondary hm concentrations we found it may improve the prediction quality fig 13 fig 14 for example we didn t have soil samples in jiuquan and jiayuguan areas but the sdm model predicted that there were hm hotspots in this place fig 8 the spatial variations of these hm compositions were consistent with the previous studies guan et al 2018 which proved the feasibility and universal applicability of our model incorporating more data layers of influencing factors into sdm can potentially increase the accuracy of the prediction of hm distributions therefore more factors that affect hm transport should be considered in the future study when such data become available including extreme precipitation events geochemical backgrounds etc 5 2 solution to the field sampling limitations field sampling provides core scientific data for studying the interactions among various carriers with an important prerequisite of geographical continuity for establishing connections between different carriers fig 1 to ensure this the main solution of previous research was the proximity strategy during the sampling process table 1 the typical research include the proximity between the soil and river water hassellov and von der kammer 2008 quinton and catt 2007 soil and crops hu et al 2020 atmospheric deposition and soil liang et al 2017b atmospheric deposition and vegetables sharma et al 2008 flood plain and riverbed sediment hochella et al 2005 however the major challenge in current proximity methods is how to ensure the spatial match among layers of different carriers which otherwise would greatly reduce the accuracy of subsequent analysis especially over the large scale regions complex terrains harsh weather undeveloped public transport system and other constraints at the field make it challenging or even impossible to collect multi dimensional carriers at the same point li et al 2020 for the entire catchment especially with large scales different carriers collecting sites cannot distribute at the same sampling density or rate under actual circumstances a dearth of consistent data for different carriers is often credited as a major limitation for hms interaction research liu et al 2019 sdm has advantage of using the presence only data which are the field observations where the presences of the species were observed sdm thus doesn t require the normal distribution and spatial continuation of the field data fig 4 and is friendly to scientific research involves in large scale area where continuous sampling is normally impossible the sampling in this study was based on sdm requirement and collected different carriers in typical areas across the entire catchment as much as possible the output maps confirmed that the sdm worked well to map the hm distribution especially in areas that lack of field samples 5 3 ecologicalization of hm contaminants by sdm the spatial distribution of hms is an important indicator to estimate the environment pollution li et al 2017b which was mostly achieved by the kriging interpolation as one of the most prevalent spatial interpolation methods in previous studies li et al 2017b liang et al 2017a strong evidence has shown that increasing the sampling density is the main approach to improve the accuracy of predictions lv 2019 but the conventional interpolation methods ignore the influence of many determinant variables when investigating the hm transport and accumulation processes li et al 2017b lv 2019 explored to apply the geostatistical techniques to estimate the hm spatial distribution based on the factors resulting from the receptor models nickel et al 2014 proposed to combine multivariate generalized linear models with kriging interpolation to create hm maps at a high level of spatial resolution however both of these two studies had to increase the sampling density to ensure the accuracy of the hm prediction table 1 which is often challenging over large catchment in addition lots of preparatory work for these two studies was required for example the explanatory variables must be calculated and selected through the acceptor models beforehand in this study we innovatively adopt the sdm by ecologicalizing the hms in catchment as different species when studying the spatial distributions of different hms in the same carrier different hms in the same carrier were regarded as species of the same trophic level to predict their spatial distributions fig 5 similarly the hm transport among different carriers were converted into the food chain relationships in the sdm fig 5 and each carrier was assumed to have its own habitats a few research entities had been ecologicalized as different species in previous studies such as human emotions li et al 2021 visitors and hikers coppes and braunisch 2013 based on our hm output maps the prediction accuracy has been significantly improved thus we believe sdms have big potentials for mapping the hm distributions due to the scarcity of field data in this study some typical big data driven sdm models such as maxent cannot be used instead we built our own sdm framework to address the issue future work can be conducted to explore the use of different advanced sdms to further improve the heavy metal mapping research 6 conclusion the spatial inconsistence and mismatch of the field samplings for different hm carriers profoundly hinder our ability to map hms over large areas to address this issue this study developed a novel methodological framework for mapping hm contamination over the large scale catchment with a species distribution model results found that the variables of distance to road gdp and nightlight played a relatively important role in accumulation of soil hms the output maps of hms from soil sediment and wet deposition could respectively reflect the influence of industry contaminants hydraulic sorting and precipitation washout process which proved the rationality of sdm in predicting the spatial distributions of individual carriers the environment and human variables together with the hm transport from the secondary carriers were selected as explanatory variables to predict the hms in river water which helped to better predict spatial dynamics and transport mechanism of hms although future work is needed to overcome existing biases and challenges the methodological framework proposed in
