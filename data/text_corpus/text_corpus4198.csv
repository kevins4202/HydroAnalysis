20990,in huang and teng 2020 the effects of the channel walls on the second order hydrodynamic characteristics of three dimensional bodies in monochromatic incident waves were investigated to ensure the high accuracy and efficiency of the calculation robust numerical algorithms have been developed to treat the troublesome integrals over the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces involved in the second order analysis in the present study huang and teng 2020 s work is extended to the cases of bichromatic incident waves and some improvements in the numerical algorithms are made the expressions of the locked potentials including both the propagating and evanescent modes are derived since the up and down wave vertical surfaces are allowed to be placed close to the body the calculation of the free surface integral can be performed in a small region and an analytical method is developed to directly evaluate the up and down wave vertical surface integrals after solving the boundary integral equation the sum and difference frequency radiation and diffraction potentials are obtained explicitly numerical results for the quadratic transfer functions of the second order free surface elevation pressure and force are given for a series of geometries in channels keywords bichromatic waves wave channel quadratic transfer function frequency domain method 1 introduction in order to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of offshore structures experiments are usually conducted in the wave channels experimental data of some first order quantities is considered to be with accepted accuracy when the frequency of the incident wave is not close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies however as for the experimental data for the second or higher order quantities it could not be directly used to estimate the results in the open sea since the effects of the side wall reflection on the second or higher order quantities are significant even when the incident wave frequency is away from the transverse tank resonant frequencies it is well known that the second order wave loads play an essential role in exciting responses of certain types of offshore structures although the natural frequency of the offshore structure is often lower or higher than the frequency range of ocean waves and the magnitudes of these second order loads are much smaller than those at the linear wave frequencies the sum or difference frequency of a pair of combing wave components could excite the resonant responses of those floating offshore structures therefore for achieving a reliable prediction of the second order wave forces and motions of the structures in the open sea by utilizing the flume experiments the effects of the side wall reflection should be clearly understood there has been considerable interest in investigating the second order interaction between waves and structures in the open sea in general the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problem is identical to that of the first order problem but at a sum or difference frequency and it is solved with no difficulty all the difficult second order effects are confined to the diffraction problem the main difficulty arising in the second order analysis is the evaluation of the free surface integral involving the inhomogeneous free surface condition for getting the second order wave loads two kinds of methods have been developed one is the alternative approach in which the fictitious assisting radiation potentials are applied lighthill 1979 molin 1979 this indirect approach is without the explicit calculation of the second order velocity potential but the difficulties associated with the free surface integral still exist and it cannot provide the results of the body surface pressure and free surface elevation the other is the direct method in which the complete second order problem can be solved for bodies of simple geometry the analytical method can be used which can provide an efficient means for predicting the second order forces and free surface elevations chau and eatock taylor 1992 huang and eatock taylor 1996 malenica et al 1999 for bodies of arbitrary geometry a boundary integral equation was frequently set up to obtain a complete solution to the second order problem kim and yue 1989 eatock taylor and chau 1992 teng and kato 1999 the above mentioned studies provided a detailed analysis for the second order diffraction of three dimensional bodies in monochromatic incident waves to generalize the second order theory to irregular waves researchers extended these works to the cases of bichromatic waves moubayed and williams 1995a considered an array of vertical cylinders in bichromatic waves and derived the semi analytical solution of the second order sum and difference frequency forces by using an eigenfunction expansion method together with a two dimensional green function for a freely floating circular cylinder moubayed and williams 1995b utilized the indirect method to calculate the sum and difference frequency wave loads and evaluated the motion responses of the structure eatock taylor and huang 1997 presented a semi analytical method for obtaining a particular solution that exactly satisfies the inhomogeneous free surface condition and developed the complete semi analytical expressions for the second order sum and difference frequency potentials in the case of wave diffraction by a vertical cylinder in bichromatic waves kim and yue 1990 used a ring source integral equation method to investigate the second order wave interaction with an axisymmetric body in the presence of bichromatic incident waves and developed an efficient manner to treat the free surface integral with the application of the method proposed by teng et al 1999 teng et al 2010 computed full quadratic transfer functions for a platform and compared the results with newman s approximations cong et al 2018 employed the indirect method to obtain a complete solution for the second order wave loads experienced by a uniform vertical cylinder in bi chromatic bi directional waves for the wave body interaction problem in a wave channel due to the fluid domain being bounded the scattering waves produced by structures will be reflected by the side walls and those reflected waves will in turn interact with the structure therefore it is crucial to have a good understanding of how the side walls affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the structures kashiwagi 1991 and chen 1994 developed the green function satisfying the linear free surface condition and impermeable channel wall condition for the case of infinite water depth and finite water depth respectively they illustrated that the side wall effects on the first order quantities are characterized by the presence of spikes at the transverse tank resonant frequencies and the second order drift loads are affected more seriously than linear forces with the application of the method of separation of variables molin et al 2007 derived the second order locked potential satisfying inhomogeneous free surface condition in a wave channel and provided a semi analytical solution for the second order wave interaction with a vertical plate with no thickness in a channel by applying the matching conditions on the imaginary fluid interfaces huang and teng 2020 developed a numerical model to investigate the effects of the channel side walls on the second order hydrodynamic forces acting on three dimensional bodies of arbitrary geometry in a wave channel for accurate and efficient calculation they provided detailed treatments of the integrations over the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces the free surface is divided into an inner region and two outer regions in which the integrals are treated differently in the inner region the free surface integral is performed numerically while in the outer regions the two dimensional free surface integrals are analytically integrated in rectangle regions the up and down wave vertical surface integrals are derived analytically by applying the locked potential excluding the evanescent modes under the assumption that the up and down wave vertical surfaces are located far from the body and the evanescent modes can be neglected eventually the integrals related to the outsides of outer regions are offset by each other and the rapidly converging up and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near field of the wave channel can be evaluated explicitly the present study can be considered as an extension of the previous work of huang and teng 2020 to the case of bichromatic incident wave fields for the high accuracy and efficiency of the calculation some improvements in the numerical algorithms are made the potentials of the locked waves including both the propagating and evanescent modes are derived since the up and down wave vertical surfaces are no longer forced to locate far from the body the free surface integral can be evaluated numerically in a small region in addition an analytical manner to the integrals over the up and down wave vertical surfaces is developed in this study after solving the boundary integral equation the sum and difference frequency radiation and diffraction potentials can be obtained explicitly numerical results for the quadratic transfer functions of the second order wave run up pressure and wave forces are given for different geometries such as bottom mounted vertical circular cylinders fixed truncated vertical circular cylinders and freely floating hemispheres 2 general formulation 2 1 governing equation and boundary condition we consider the second order interactions of plane bichromatic incident waves with a three dimensional body in a channel of width w and water depth h as shown in fig 1 two cartesian coordinate systems are employed for study of the problem o x y z is the space fixed coordinate system with the o x y plane in the quiescent free surface the o x z plane coinciding with the longitudinal symmetry of the channel and the z axis pointing vertically upward and o x y z is the body fixed coordinate system with its origin o at the center of mass of the body when the body is at its equilibrium position the two sets of coordinate systems coincide with each other we assume that the body is subjected to a train of nonlinear bichromatic incident waves propagating along the positive x direction the fluid domain is bounded by the instantaneous free surface s f z ζ the instantaneous wetted body surface s b the horizontal bottom surface s d z h and the vertical channel walls s w y w 2 under the assumption of incompressible and inviscid fluid and irrotational flow the flow can be described in terms of a velocity potential φ x y z t satisfying the laplace equation 1 2 φ x y z t 0 with the combination of the dynamic and kinematic conditions the velocity potential satisfies 2 2 φ t 2 g φ z 2 φ φ t 1 2 φ φ φ 0 on the free surface z ζ x y t where g is the acceleration of gravity and the free surface elevation ζ x y t can be obtained by the dynamic free surface boundary condition 3 ζ 1 g φ t 1 2 φ φ z ζ if the body is moving with the velocity u the boundary condition on the impermeable body surface can be generalized as 4 φ n n u where n represents the normal vector on the transient body surface on the sea bottom s d and channel walls s w the no flow conditions are written as 5 φ n 0 furthermore the suitable radiation boundary conditions at the far fields are required to ensure the correct asymptotic behavior of the scattering waves such that a unique solution can be determined 2 2 perturbation expansion assuming weak nonlinearities we express the dynamic quantities in the form of a power series with respect to the wave steepness ε k a 1 as 6 φ ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 ξ ε ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 θ

amplitudes of translational motion and ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 denote the amplitudes of rotation the superscripts 1 and 2 represent the first and second order quantities respectively as indicated by ogilvie 1983 under the assumption of the small amplitude of body motions the exact instantaneous position x and the unit normal vector n at a point on the body surface can be represented by the following transformation relationships 7 x x ε ξ 1 θ 1 x x c ε 2 ξ 2 θ 2 x x c ε 2 h x x c o ε 3 8 n n ε θ 1 n ε 2 θ 2 n ε 2 h n o ε 3 where x is the position vector to a point on the body surface in the body fixed coordinate system x c denotes the rotation center n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain and the matrix h associated with the first order amplitude of body motion has the form 9 h 1 2 θ 2 1 2 θ 3 1 2 0 0 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 1 θ 1 1 2 θ 3 1 2 0 2 θ 1 1 θ 3 1 2 θ 2 1 θ 3 1 θ 1 1 2 θ 2 1 2 we now consider a body to be placed in bichromatic waves with amplitudes a p a q and frequencies ω p ω q thus the first and second order dynamic quantities can be expressed as 10 φ 1 x t re p 1 2 φ p 1 x e i ω p t 11 ξ j 1 x t re p 1 2 ξ j p 1 x e i ω p t 12 φ 2 x t re p 1 2 q 1 2

denotes the mean term with the time the time independent term φ 2 x will henceforth be dropped in this research since it does not make any contribution to the second order wave forces we can expand the free surface and body surface boundary conditions into taylor series about its corresponding mean positions by applying the series expansions in eq 6 and the transformation relationships in eqs 7 and 8 we can collect the terms for the same order of ε and ε 2 then with substitution of eqs 10 13 into the free surface and body surface boundary conditions the boundary conditions can be specified as 14 φ p 1 x z ν p φ p 1 x 0 on z 0 15 φ p 1 x n i ω p ξ p 1 x n on s b 16 φ p 1 x n 0 on s d and s w at the first order where ν p ω p 2 g is the wave number in deep water and 17 φ p q 2 x z ν φ p q

on the wave side and lee side of the channel should be imposed at the first and second order which require that the scattering wave approaches the form of outgoing waves at the far fields the resolution of the first order problem with eqs 14 16 has been studied and discussed by many researchers kashiwagi 1991 chen 1994 and will not be elaborated in the present paper for the second order problem the sum and difference frequency potentials φ p q 2 can be decomposed into the incident potential φ i p q 2 radiation potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 6 and diffraction potential φ d p q 2 respectively as 25 φ p q x φ i p q 2 x j 1 6 i ω ξ j p q 2 φ j p q 2 φ d p q 2 x where φ j p q 2 j 1 2 6 represent the radiated waves owning to the second order body motions and yield the added mass and radiation damping coefficients and φ d p q 2 represent the diffraction potentials owning to the combination of the presence of second order incident waves and the forcing terms on the free surface and body surface and yield the exciting forces on the body the second order sum and difference frequency components of the incident potentials φ i p q 2 can be expressed in the following form bowers 1976 26a φ i p q 2 x 1 2 ϕ i p q ϕ i q p cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x 26b φ i p q 2 x 1 2 ϕ i p q ϕ i q p cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x where 27 k k p k q 28a ϕ i p q i g a p a q 2 ω p k p 2 ν p 2 2 k p

the radiation and diffraction potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 7 can be summarized as 29 φ j p q 2 z ν φ j p q 2 0 j 1 2 6 q p q 2 x y q i p q 2 x y g j 7 30 φ j p q 2 n n j j 1 2 6 φ i p q 2 n b p q 2 x j 7 on s b 31 φ j p q 2 n 0 j 1 2 7 on s d and s w for the second order sum and difference frequency radiation potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 6 the boundary conditions to be satisfied are identical to those for the first order problem while for the diffraction potentials φ d p q 2 the boundary conditions contain the forcing terms on the free surface and body surface moreover apart from the above boundary conditions the diffraction potentials should satisfy appropriate radiation conditions on the wave side and lee side of the channel which will be discussed in section 2 3 2 3 the solutions of the second order diffraction potentials at the far fields we divide the sum and difference frequency diffraction potentials φ d p q 2 into two distinct components 32 φ d p q 2 φ d f p q 2 φ d l p q 2 where φ d f p q 2 represent the free waves satisfying the homogeneous free surface conditions and sommerfeld radiation conditions at the far fields and φ d l p q 2 represent the locked waves satisfying the inhomogeneous free surface conditions and appropriate radiation conditions determined from the asymptotic form of the second order free surface boundary conditions the free waves φ d f p q 2 can be easily expressed by using the eigenfunction expansion technique which can be found in molin et al 2007 here we concentrate on the solutions of the locked potential for monochromatic waves molin et al 2007 presented the expressions of the locked potentials by applying the method of separation of variable assuming the up and down wave vertical surfaces located far from the body and the locked potentials only containing propagating wave components huang and teng 2020 used the same expressions to calculate the up and down wave vertical surface integrals for bichromatic waves li and williams 1999 presented the expressions of the locked potentials including both the propagating modes and evanescent modes for the two dimensional problems in the present paper a similar procedure is adopted to derive the locked potentials for the problem of bichromatic waves interaction with a body in a channel and the propagating and evanescent modes are both taken into account in the derivation the locked potentials φ d l p q 2 are determined from the asymptotic behavior of free surface forcing terms which are associated with the first order quantities thus it is convenient to give the following expression of the first order incident potential 33 φ i p 1 i g a p ω p e i k p x z κ p 0 z and the asymptotic forms of the first order scattering potentials φ s p 1 φ p 1 φ i p 1 of the p

represent the lee side and the wave side of the channel respectively the method for the calculation of a p m n 1 can be found in the appendix of huang and teng 2020 κ p m m 0 1 2 are the roots of the dispersion equation 35 ω p 2 g κ p m tan κ p m h 0 where κ p m m 1 are real and positive while κ p 0 i k p and k p is real and positive the eigen values α n for the transverse oscillations are defined as 36 α n n π w n 0 1 2 correspondingly the eigen values λ p m n for the longitudinal oscillations are 37 λ p m n i k p 2 α n 2 m 0 k p α n α n 2 k p 2 m 0 k p α n κ p m 2 α n 2 m 0 z κ p m z is a set of vertical eigenfunctions defined as 38 z κ p m z cos κ p m z h cos κ p m h m 0 1 2 after having the first order potential we can substitute eqs 33 and 34 into eq 21 and the free surface forcing terms can be expressed as 39 q p q 2 x y q i p q 2 x y g i g a p a q 2 ω p m n σ p q 0 2 i k p λ q m n a q m n 1 e i k p λ q m n x cos α n w 2 y i g a p a q 2 ω p m n σ p q m 2 i k q λ p m n a p m n 1

40 φ d l p q 2 1 2 ϕ d l p q 2 ϕ d l q p 2 φ p q d l 2 1 2 ϕ d l p q 2 ϕ d l q p 2 where 41a ϕ d l p q 2 i ω q a p a q 2 m n g m n a q m n 1 e i k p λ q m n x cos α n w 2 y z g m n z i ω q a p a q 2 m

locked potentials at the far fields can be evaluated analytically from eqs 42 45 it can be seen that the arguments g m n h m n e m n s t and f m n s t could be complex resulting in that the vertical eigenfunctions z could be complex therefore unlike the first order potential φ p 1 the second order incident potentials φ i p q 2 and the second order free waves φ d f p q 2 the locked potentials φ d l p q 2 will not decay to zero as the water depth goes to infinity 3 boundary integral equation in the present paper we solved the second order boundary value problem defined in eqs 29 31 based on a boundary integral equation method using a wave source green function applying the second green s theorem to the sum and difference frequency green functions g x x 0 ω and the radiation and diffraction

represent the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces enclosing the body furthermore the green functions g x x 0 ω in eqs 50 and 51 satisfy the linear free surface condition and impermeable channel wall condition namely the free surface channel green function or tank green function the efficient algorithm of this green function has been developed by many researchers in the present study the methods proposed by linton 1993 and chen 1994 are employed the integral equation in eq 50 is identical in the form to that for a linear problem but at a sum or difference frequency and it is solved with no difficulty while for the integral equation 51 the right hand side is more involved than that at the first order and contains the additional contribution from the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces the accurate and efficient calculation of the integrations over those surfaces is essential to the solution of eq 51 for the wave body interaction problem of monochromatic waves in a wave channel huang and teng 2020 presented the detailed treatment of those troublesome integrals a similar procedure is adopted in the present paper for those integrals but a direct approach to obtain the up and down wave vertical surface integrals is developed in the following sections 3 1 treatment of the free surface integral to obtain a reliable solution of the second order problem the difficulties in the evaluation of the free surface integral should be overcome for monochromatic incident waves huang and teng 2020 placed the up and down wave vertical surfaces sufficiently far from the body where the evanescent waves can be neglected such that the free surface integral will be performed in a relatively large region for the efficient computation of the free surface integral the free surface is divided into three regions one inner region and two outer rectangular regions in which the integrals are treated differently in the inner region the free surface integral is performed numerically by discretizing the free surface into planer panels and using a quadrature formula while in the outer regions the two dimensional free surface integrals are evaluated analytically by exploiting the eigenfunction expansion of the free surface channel green function as well as the first order scattering potential in the present study some improvements are made for the integrals over the up and down wave vertical surfaces such that the up and down wave vertical surfaces are allowed to be placed at any locations in the wave channel when the up and down wave surfaces are close to the body the free surface integral can be conducted in a relatively small region and performed directly by using a numerical quadrature as shown in fig 2 the free surface is bounded by the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w l x l y w 2 and two exterior boundaries γ v x l w 2 y w 2 the free surface integral is defined as 52 i f 1 2 i f p q i f q p where 53 i f p q s f g x x 0 ω q p q 2 x y q i p q 2 x y g d s the above free surface integral contains the first and second derivative of the velocity potential by exploiting the shape function the numerical differentiation is used to getting the first derivative of the velocity potential although the numerical differentiation has some error the accuracy of the results of the first derivative is acceptable if the direct numerical differentiation is still used to get the second derivative of the velocity potential it is difficult to ensure a satisfactory accuracy due to the accumulation of errors in order to obtain reasonable accuracy following the method of chau 1989 and teng 1995 the free surface integral is written as the sum of a surface integral containing only the first derivative and the line integrals along the boundary of the free surface by applying green s theorem additionally when the source point x 0 and field point x are close to each other the integrands of the above integral becomes nearly singular in order to remove the higher order singularities the free surface integral is eventually written as 54 i f p q i ω q 2 g s f g x x 0 ω ν p 2 2 ν p ν q k p 2 φ i p 1 φ

horizontal gradient operator x y and n c n cos γ with γ being the angle between the normal vector n and the horizontal plane the equation for i f p q can be obtained by replacing φ s q 1 φ q 1 and their derivatives with the corresponding complex conjugates and replacing i ω q with i ω q in addition it is noteworthy that in spite of the fact that φ s p 1 x n 0 when x is on the channel side walls the last term in eq 54 the integration along the intersection between channel side walls and clam water surface does not equal zero this is attributed to the fact that φ s p 1 x 0 n 0 when x 0 is not on the side walls of the channel 3 2 treatment of the body surface integral like the free surface integral the body surface integral also contains the second derivatives of the first order velocity potential on the body surface the order of which can be reduced by employing stokes theorem after that an alternative form which involves only the first order derivatives of velocity potentials and green function may be derived besides the green function and its derivatives behave in nearly singularity as the field point x approaches the source point x 0 following teng 1995 the difficulty associated with the singularity of the green function and its derivatives are overcome by establishing an auxiliary integral over the body surface then the final expression for the body surface integral can be given as 55 i b 1 2 i b p q i b q p where 56 i b p q 1 2 s b g x x 0 ω i ω q θ p 1 χ q 1 i ω q h p q 2 x x c n θ p 1 φ q 1 x 0 n d s 1 2 s b g x x 0 ω χ p 1 φ q 1 x φ q 1 x 0 n d s 1 2 s b g x x 0 ω φ q 1 x φ q 1 x 0 χ p 1 n d s 1 2 γ b g x x 0 ω φ q 1 x φ q 1 x 0 χ p 1 d l it can be seen that the second derivate of the velocity potential is no longer involved in eq 56 in addition the expression for i b p q can be obtained in a similar way as that of i b p q and is not shown here for brevity 3 3 treatment of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals to obtain the solution of the second order problem computational effort should also be made in the evaluations of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals these integrals can be expressed as 57 i v i v i v where each part is defined as 58 i v 1 2 i v p q i v q p 59a i v p q h 0 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 ω x ϕ d l p q 2 x g x x 0 ω ϕ d l p q 2 x x d y d z x l 59b i v p q h 0 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 ω x ϕ d l p q 2 x g x x 0 ω ϕ d l p q 2 x x d y d z x l for the problem of the interaction of bichromatic waves with a body in the open sea the integral at infinity vanishes by applying the method of stationary phase and the far field asymptotic behavior of velocity potential and green function however in a channel the wave field will look like a finite sum of plane waves at the far fields as shown in eq 41 resulting in that the integrals at the up and down wave vertical surfaces eq 59 will not decay to zero the expressions of the second order locked potential for bichromatic waves in a wave channel are shown in section 2 3 for getting the up and down wave vertical surface integrals one can discretize the up and down wave vertical surfaces into planer panels and calculate the integral by using numerical quadrature in the present study a more efficient method will be proposed and the up and down wave vertical surface integrals will be performed analytically by employing the free surface channel green function in eigenfunction expansion the green functions at the sum and difference frequency ω can be written as linton 1993 60 g x x 0 ω m n ε n e λ m n x x 0 2 w λ m n cos α n w 2 y cos α n w 2 y 0 z κ m z z κ m

is different from the definition of n given in eq 62 as z g m v z dissatisfies the homogeneous free surface condition now the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be evaluated analytically although the expressions look fairly complicated the results can be obtained quickly with satisfactory accuracy some features of eq 65 which may be remarked are the following firstly the up and down wave vertical surface integrals are related to the coordinates of the source point x 0 and the locations of the up and down wave vertical surfaces x l which can be separated from each other thus the arguments β u v l only need to be computed once for each case secondly β u v l for the wave side and lee side of the channel both consist of four terms each of which contains an exponentially decaying series when m 0 n j or m 1 n 0 where j is the number of imaginary roots of eq 37 the eigen values for the longitudinal oscillations λ p m n are real such that only several terms are required to achieve a desired accuracy thirdly the third and fourth terms of β u v l include respectively variables c v n t and c v n t which are zero for a lot of cases since the variables c v n t are the integrals of the product of trigonometric functions with eigen values of transverse oscillations fourthly only even modes of oscillations in the transverse direction are excited for a body having an axis of symmetry coinciding with the centerline of the channel and thus a p m n 1 0 n 2 k 1 k 0 1 2 based on the above features the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be obtained quickly now the right hand side of the boundary integral equation 51 can be evaluated accurately and efficiently it can be seen the free surface integral and body surface integral are calculated numerically while the up and down wave vertical surface integrals are calculated analytically when calculating the boundary integral equation 51 the locations of the up and down wave vertical surfaces need to be determined if the value of l is chosen to be close to the principal dimension of the structure along the longitudinal direction of the channel the calculation domain of the free surface would be relatively small as a result the free surface integral 52 can be obtained more quickly with relatively few discretized grids in the meantime when we evaluate the up and down wave vertical surface integrals 65 it should take more local waves into account for obtaining a convergent result and the calculation efficiency of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals will decrease if the value of l is chosen to be large a reversed trend can be found for the calculation over the free surface as well as the up and down wave vertical surfaces therefore an appropriate selection of the value of l is important to balance the calculation efficiency of the free surface integral and up and down wave vertical surface integrals for minimum computing time for monochromatic waves huang and teng 2020 presented an indirect method to obtain the up and down wave vertical surface integrals under the condition that the up and down wave vertical surfaces are located at a large distance from the body where the evanescent waves can be neglected they analytically derived the integrations over the free surface in the outer regions and up and down wave vertical surfaces after some algebra it is found that the integrals related to the outsides of outer regions are offset by each other finally the rapidly converging up and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near fields of the wave channel are obtained in the present study we present a more direct way to get the up and down wave vertical surface integrals actually the expressions of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals obtained by these two methods are essentially identical when ω p ω q the above expressions of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals eq 65 will reduce to those of huang and teng 2020 for the case of a monochromatic incident wave field since we can evaluate the behavior of the locked potentials in the vicinity of the body the up and down wave vertical surfaces can be placed at a relatively small distance from the body thus the region of the free surface would not be large and the free surface integral can be calculated directly by numerical quadrature compared to the indirect method although the expressions of the locked potentials including the evanescent modes are more complicated the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be obtained in a straightforward manner but the indirect method also provides an approach to get the up and down wave vertical surface integrals in the analysis of the second order problem in a wave channel in the numerical evaluation of eqs 50 and 51 the body surface s b and the free surface s f are divided into a number of 6 node quadratic triangular elements or 8 node quadratic quadrilateral elements which are used for modeling both geometry and variation of the potential the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w and two exterior boundaries γ v are discretized by quadratic line elements and the resulting line integrals are obtained by 3 point gaussian adaptive quadrature then a higher order boundary element method bem model is set up after solving eqs 50 and 51 the second order sum and difference frequency velocity potentials on the body surface can be determined 4 sum and difference frequency quadratic transfer functions qtf s after solving the second order sum and difference frequency potentials the associated second order forces as well as local pressure and free surface elevations can be calculated directly with perturbation series in ε the second order free surface elevation ζ 2 t pressure p 2 t and force f 2 t are given by 70 ζ 2 t p 2 t f 2 t re p 1 2 q 1 2 a p a q η p q p p q f p q e i ω t a p a q η p q p p q f p q e i ω t where η p q p p q and f p q are defined as the sum and difference frequency quadratic transfer functions for the free surface elevation pressure and force respectively the complete second order elevation qtf obtained by eq 3 and pressure qtf obtained by the bernoulli equation in general contain two separate contributions 1 that due to quadratic products of first order potentials and 2 that due to the second order potential itself these components are given by 71 η 1 p q 1 4 g φ p 1 φ q 1 ν ω p ω q 4 g 2 φ p 1 φ q 1 a p a q 72 η 2 p q i ω φ p q 2 g a p a q 73 p 1 p q ρ φ p 1 φ q 1 i ω q χ p 1 φ q 1 i ω p χ q 1 φ p 1 2 h p q 2 x x c k 4 a p a q

k is the unit vector in the z direction the expressions for the difference frequency problem are similar and are not given here for brevity if we consider the case with a fixed body the terms related to the body motion in the above equations vanish 5 numerical results before conducting the detailed numerical analysis the convergence of the numerical model are examined we first perform the convergence test for the results of the second order sum and difference frequency quantities with respect to the mesh discretization the considered case is a uniform vertical cylinder of radius a in a channel of width w 2 a 5 0 and depth h a 1 0 as the cylinder is placed at the centerline of the channel only one quarter of the body surface and free surface is discretized with the application of the simplification on its geometrical symmetry three meshes labelled as mesh a b and c are used in the test the numbers of elements on the body surface and the free surface for these meshes are listed in table 1 the locations of the up and down wave vertical surfaces are chosen as l h 2 0 the non dimensional frequencies of the pair of the incident waves are ν p a ν q a 1 0 2 0 figs 3 and 4 display the complete second order sum and difference frequency wave elevation qtf η p q together with its constituent components as a function of the azimuthal angle θ it can be seen that for the case of difference frequency potential it is hard to distinguish the results from the three different meshes for the case of sum frequency potential although the small divergence can be observed it is acceptable and it only occurs where the elevation changes rapidly along the circumference theoretically we may achieve a faster convergence for the case of difference frequency potential owing to the small wavenumber associated with the case of difference frequency potential compared to that of sum frequency potential therefore it can be concluded that converged results can be achieved by adopting an appropriate mesh discretization in the following calculations special attention has been paid to the mesh discretization to ensure that all the results are converged the results for the case of the interaction of the bichromatic waves with the same cylinder in the open sea obtained from kim and yue 1990 are plotted in figs 3 and 4 as well for the difference frequency problem the variation of η 2 p q is much milder than that of η 1 p q and the side wall effects on η 2 p q are less significant than those on η 1 p q in the difference frequency problem since the wave length is much larger than the characteristic size of the cylinder the presence of the cylinder does not impose obvious disturbance on the wave field resulting in that the waves scattered by the body and the wave reflections from the side walls are weak for the sum frequency problem the variation of the wave run up on the body varied more obviously along the circumferential direction although the influences of the channel walls are significant both η 1 p q and η 2 p q follow similar trends as those in the open sea it is also noted that the maximum and minimum surface elevations occur at neither the up wave side nor the down wave side of the cylinder for both the sum and difference frequency cases we next consider a uniform cylinder of radius a in a channel of width w 2 a 5 0 and depth h a 4 0 two pairs of bichromatic incident waves with ν p a ν q a 1 0 2 0 and 1 4 1 6 are considered figs 5 and 6 show the distribution of the second order difference frequency hydrodynamic pressure p p q and its constituent components along the vertical direction on the downstream θ 0 and upstream θ 180 of the cylinder respectively it can be seen that the variation of p 1 p q is similar to that in the open sea it attenuates rapidly as the depth z h increases and equals zero at the channel bottom this is owing to fact that φ p 1 0 at the lee side and wave side of the cylinder since p 2 p q is dominated by the second order velocity potential the variation of p 2 p q becomes small in magnitude along the water depth especially for smaller δ ν a compared with p 1 p q the depth attenuation rate along the vertical direction for p 2 p q is much milder and it does not decay to zero at the channel bottom this is owing to the behavior of the locked potential φ d p q 2 as discussed in section 2 3 for p 1 p q and p 2 p q they may be in phase resulting in that the larger value of p p q could occur at the free surface figs 7 and 8 show the distribution of the second order sum frequency hydrodynamic pressure p p q and its constituent components along the vertical direction on the downstream θ 0 and upstream θ 180 of the cylinder respectively it can be seen that the magnitude of the component p 2 p q varies greatly along the water depth especially in the vicinity of the free surface the second order sum frequency pressure p 2 p q may not decrease monotonically with depth as a result the minimum p 2 p q may not occur at the bottom of the cylinder even if p 1 p q and p 2 p q both are decrease monotonically with depth the pressure p p q may not decrease monotonically with depth due to the possible phase cancellations among the contributions moreover since p 2 p q due to the second order sum and difference frequency potentials make more contribution to the total second order pressure distribution compared with the components p 1 p q due to the quadratic products of the first order potentials it is essential to include the contribution of the second order potential in the analysis of the second order force for all curves the variations of the components of the pressure distribution are analogous to those in the open sea and they decay at the almost same rate at the deeper position the discrepancies between the results in the wave channel and open sea mainly occur near the free surface especially for the case of the sum frequency problem since with the depth decreasing or the frequency increasing the interference effects between the cylinder and channel walls become serious for evaluating the hydrodynamic interactions between the bodies and channel walls there are two alternative approaches which can be used to approximately simulate the presence of the side wall of the channel one is the simulation on a periodic array consisting of the same body placed in a line perpendicular to the incident wave direction as shown in fig 9 a and the other one is to use a pair of reflecting walls with finite length to replace the infinite length channel walls as shown in fig 9 b these two approaches can be conveniently extended by a program for an unbounded free surface and useful linear results can be achieved without paying much attention to the calculation of the free surface channel green function newman 2016 used the alternative approaches to compute the forces and motions of a ship like body in a channel gomes et al 2016 also used these two approaches to investigate the side wall effects on the performance evaluation of a wave energy converter the results show that as the number of mirror image bodies or the length of the finite long walls increases the behaviors of the middle body gradually approach those in a wave channel as expected newman 2001 showed that the practical levels of convergence for linear results are achieved with around 10 images except in the vicinity of transverse tank resonant frequencies in the present paper it is also expected that the second order results of these two alternative approaches have similar tendencies to those in the wave channel since the calculation of the free surface integral in the second order analysis in the open sea condition is computationally demanding the computed cases are limited to an array of five bodies or the vertical walls of length l w w 4 0 in the case of a body with a pair of vertical walls fig 9 b the walls should also be discretized into planar panels in newman 2016 and gomes et al 2016 it is assumed that the walls are zero thickness and are represented by dipole elements to satisfy the condition of zero normal velocity but in the second order analysis the zero thickness structure is not allowed thus the vertical walls have a finite thickness in the present calculations but the thickness is enough small to guarantee the second order results not affected by the thickness of the vertical walls moreover the results of the cases in the open sea are obtained by the method proposed by teng et al 1999 in the first approach four cases are considered for n 1 it is a single isolated cylinder of radius a h 1 0 in the open sea and for n 3 or 5 it can be considered as 2 or 4 mirror images reflected about the walls equally spacing in the transverse direction with separating distance w when n the periodic array extends to infinity and it is a limiting case that can be considered as a single isolated cylinder in a wave channel in the second approach four cases are considered as well a pair of parallel vertical walls of length l w are added at y w 2 which extend from the bottom to the free surface over the longitudinal domain l w 2 x l w 2 for l w 1 and it is the limiting cases corresponding to a single isolated cylinder in the open sea and wave channel respectively figs 10 and 11 show the horizontal second order sum and difference frequency force qtf on the middle cylinder in bichromatic incident waves with the constant frequency difference ν 2 ν 1 a 0 2 the two vertical dash lines in figures represent the first transverse tank resonant frequencies corresponding to k 2 w π and k 1 w π respectively for the difference frequency problem the horizontal wave force on a single isolated cylinder in the open sea varies slowly in the considered range of wave frequency with the number of the body increasing the variations of the difference frequency force slowly approach those of the case of a single isolated cylinder in the wave channel and the wave frequency corresponding to the maximum wave force gradually decreases until the wave frequency is close to the transverse tank resonant frequency for the case of a body with a pair of vertical walls even if the length of the vertical walls is short the difference frequency force shows the convergence to the results of the case of a single isolated cylinder in the wave channel at the low frequency but with the increase of the wave frequency the difference frequency force fluctuates around the results in the wave channel due to the serve interference between the body and vertical walls when the wave frequency is close to the transverse tank resonant frequency the wave forces on the body with finite length vertical walls may overestimate those of a single isolate body in a channel for the sum frequency problem either as the number of body increases or as the length of the vertical walls increases the sum frequency forces on the middle body rapidly move away from the results of the case without walls and gradually approach the results of the case of a single isolated cylinder in the wave channel but for a finite array of equally spaced bodies due to the significant interactions between bodies it could cause a large sum frequency force on the middle body even if the wave frequency is not close to the transverse resonant frequency of the channel for a better understanding of the effects of the channel walls on the sum and difference frequency wave exciting forces acting on a truncated circular cylinder figs 12 and 13 show the contour plots for the second order sum and difference frequency force magnification factors f p q f p q o in the range of 0 6 k p w 2 π 2 4 p 1 2 where f p q o are the second order sum and difference frequency wave forces on the same single cylinder in the open sea obtained by the method proposed by teng et al 1999 three axisymmetrical truncated cylinders with the same draft d h 0 4 but different radii 2 a w 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are placed symmetrically relative to the center plane of the channel the water depth is h w 1 0 the horizontal and vertical dash lines in figures show the wavenumbers corresponding to k p w 2 π n and n 1 2 at which the transverse tank resonances occur due to the symmetry of the flow only the symmetrical resonance modes are excited the influence of the side walls can be readily assessed by the study of the magnification factor when the factors are unity the channel walls have no confining effect as shown in fig 12 for the difference frequency problem the side wall effects gradually become more significant with the increase in the scale of the body along the diagonal ω p ω q it shows the side wall effects on the second order drift loads which can be obtained directly from the first order quantities for the second order horizontal drift force as the frequency increases the magnification factors gradually decrease until the incident wave frequency is close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies then there is a noticeable change of the variation for the second order horizontal drift force and it is considerably influenced by the tank wall reflections since one more propagating mode appears in the wave channel with distance away from the diagonal the results do not vary strongly until one of the incident wave frequencies is close to one of the transverse tank resonant frequencies for the second order vertical drift force the results in the wave channel fluctuate around the results in the open sea with distance away from the diagonal the variation of magnification factor is fairly flat and the side wall effects are insignificant until one of the frequencies is close to one of the transverse tank resonant frequencies as shown in fig 13 for the sum frequency problem the side wall effects also gradually become more serious with the increase in the scale of the body along the diagonal ω p ω q it is the special case of a single regular wave and huang and teng 2020 have presented the variation of the second order force magnification factor and it will not be elaborated in the present study for the horizontal force the side wall effects are significant in the direction k p w 2 π n p 1 2 at which the transverse tank resonance occurs for the vertical force there is a ridge along the diagonal and the magnification factors fall off rapidly with distance away from the diagonal even though both incident wave frequencies are not close to the transverse tank resonant frequency the side wall effects could be essential for a relatively large body besides for any pair of waves whose sum frequency coincides with the transverse tank resonant frequencies a so called second order transverse tank resonance occurs however for the considered wavenumber range the side wall effects are insignificant at those second order transverse tank resonant frequencies in general the results in the wave channel oscillate about the corresponding open sea solution and are strongly dependent on the incident frequency pair the side wall effects on the sum frequency forces are more significant than those on the difference frequency forces under the same frequency combination the side wall effects on the horizontal and vertical forces are different if one of the incident wave frequencies is close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies it probably gives rise to serious interference between the cylinder and channel walls at last we consider the effects of the channel width on the hydrodynamic characteristic of a floating body the cases of freely floating hemispheres of radius a placed in the center of channels with same depth h a 3 0 but different width w 2 a 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 are examined six wave frequency pairs with the constant frequency difference δ ν a 0 6 are considered also the open sea w 2 a results obtained from teng et al 1999 are included in tables tables 2 and 3 show the sum and difference frequency horizontal and vertical force qtf for different incident frequency combinations respectively again in the lower frequency range since the wavelength is much larger than the scale of the body the effects of the side wall reflections induced by the scattering waves are weak and the results in the wave channels are in general coincident with those in the open sea as the frequency increases the side wall effects appear to be greater especially when one of incident wave frequency coincides with the transverse tank resonant frequencies for all the computed cases when the channel width is w 2 a 6 0 and the incident wave frequency pair is ν p a ν q a 0 4 1 0 the side wall effects are the most serious it is probably owing to the fact that the transverse tank resonant frequency happens to be closer to the discrete frequency although the wider channel has more resonant frequencies the results in the wave channel in general converge to those in the open sea with the increase of the channel width tables 4 and 5 show the sum and difference frequency surge and heave response qtf for different incident frequency combinations respectively the behaviors of the motion amplitudes show the similar trends to those of the second order forces 6 conclusions a numerical model is developed to investigate the second order interaction of bichromatic waves with three dimensional bodies in a channel the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problems are calculated as the same as the first order radiation problems at the corresponding sum and difference frequencies for the diffraction problem the integrations over the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces are treated effectively for accurate and efficient calculation in the second order analysis the free surface integral and body integral are evaluated numerically and the integral transformations are applied to reduce the order of the derivatives of the first order velocity potential and remove the higher order singularities in the integrals for evaluating the up and down wave vertical surface integrals the locked potentials including both the propagating and evanescent modes are derived then the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be integrated analytically in the rectangle coordinate by exploiting the free surface channel green function in eigenfunction expansion the cases of wave scattering by a bottom mounted circular cylinder a fixed truncated circular cylinder and a freely floating hemisphere in a channel are examined the numerical results illustrate that the variations of the components of the wave elevation and pressure distribution are similar to those in the open sea but the side wall effects are significant near the free surface for the second order exciting forces when one of the incident wave frequencies is close to the tank resonant frequencies the side wall effects are pronounced especially for a relatively large body as the channel width increases the results in the wave channel converge to those in the open sea though the more resonant frequencies could appear for a wider channel the present numerical model may provide an efficient means for predicting the second order free surface elevation and loads for some structures in the wave channels with irregular waves

20990,in huang and teng 2020 the effects of the channel walls on the second order hydrodynamic characteristics of three dimensional bodies in monochromatic incident waves were investigated to ensure the high accuracy and efficiency of the calculation robust numerical algorithms have been developed to treat the troublesome integrals over the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces involved in the second order analysis in the present study huang and teng 2020 s work is extended to the cases of bichromatic incident waves and some improvements in the numerical algorithms are made the expressions of the locked potentials including both the propagating and evanescent modes are derived since the up and down wave vertical surfaces are allowed to be placed close to the body the calculation of the free surface integral can be performed in a small region and an analytical method is developed to directly evaluate the up and down wave vertical surface integrals after solving the boundary integral equation the sum and difference frequency radiation and diffraction potentials are obtained explicitly numerical results for the quadratic transfer functions of the

introduction in order to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of offshore structures experiments are usually conducted in the wave channels experimental data of some first order quantities is considered to be with accepted accuracy when the frequency of the incident wave is not close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies however as for the experimental data for the second or higher order quantities it could not be directly used to estimate the results in the open sea since the effects of the side wall reflection on the second or higher order quantities are significant even when the incident wave frequency is away from the transverse tank resonant frequencies it is well known that the second order wave loads play an essential role in exciting responses of certain types of offshore structures although the natural frequency of the offshore structure is often lower or higher than the frequency range of ocean waves and the magnitudes of these second order loads are much smaller than those at the linear wave frequencies the sum or difference frequency of a pair of combing wave components could excite the resonant responses of those floating offshore structures therefore for achieving a reliable prediction of the second order wave forces and motions of the structures in the open sea by utilizing the flume experiments the effects of the side wall reflection should be clearly understood there has been considerable interest in investigating the second order interaction between waves and structures in the open sea in general the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problem is identical to that of the first order problem but at a sum or difference frequency and it is solved with no difficulty all the difficult second order effects are confined to the diffraction problem the main difficulty arising in the second order analysis is the evaluation of the free surface integral involving the inhomogeneous free surface condition for getting the second order wave loads two kinds of methods have been developed one is the alternative approach in which the fictitious assisting radiation potentials are applied lighthill 1979 molin 1979 this indirect approach is without the explicit calculation of the second order velocity potential but the difficulties associated with the free surface integral still exist and it cannot provide the results of the body surface pressure and free surface elevation the other is the direct method in which the complete second order problem can be solved for bodies of simple geometry the analytical method can be used which can provide an efficient means for predicting the second order forces and free surface elevations chau and eatock taylor 1992 huang and eatock taylor 1996 malenica et al 1999 for bodies of arbitrary geometry a boundary integral equation was frequently set up to obtain a complete solution to the second order problem kim and yue 1989 eatock taylor and chau 1992 teng and kato 1999 the above mentioned studies provided a detailed analysis for the second order diffraction of three dimensional bodies in monochromatic incident waves to generalize the second order theory to irregular waves researchers extended these works to the cases of bichromatic waves moubayed and williams 1995a considered an array of vertical cylinders in bichromatic waves and derived the semi analytical solution of the second order sum and difference frequency forces by using an eigenfunction expansion method together with a two dimensional green function for a freely floating circular cylinder moubayed and williams 1995b utilized the indirect method to calculate the sum and difference frequency wave loads and evaluated the motion responses of the structure eatock taylor and huang 1997 presented a semi analytical method for obtaining a particular solution that exactly satisfies the inhomogeneous free surface condition and developed the complete semi analytical expressions for the second order sum and difference frequency potentials in the case of wave diffraction by a vertical cylinder in bichromatic waves kim and yue 1990 used a ring source integral equation method to investigate the second order wave interaction with an axisymmetric body in the presence of bichromatic incident waves and developed an efficient manner to treat the free surface integral with the application of the method proposed by teng et al 1999 teng et al 2010 computed full quadratic transfer functions for a platform and compared the results with newman s approximations cong et al 2018 employed the indirect method to obtain a complete solution for the second order wave loads experienced by a uniform vertical cylinder in bi chromatic bi directional waves for the wave body interaction problem in a wave channel due to the fluid domain being bounded the scattering waves produced by structures will be reflected by the side walls and those reflected waves will in turn interact with the structure therefore it is crucial to have a good understanding of how the side walls affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the structures kashiwagi 1991 and chen 1994 developed the green function satisfying the linear free surface condition and impermeable channel wall condition for the case of infinite water depth and finite water depth respectively they illustrated that the side wall effects on the first order quantities are characterized by the presence of spikes at the transverse tank resonant frequencies and the second order drift loads are affected more seriously than linear forces with the application of the method of separation of variables molin et al 2007 derived the second order locked potential satisfying inhomogeneous free surface condition in a wave channel and provided a semi analytical solution for the second order wave interaction with a vertical plate with no thickness in a channel by applying the matching conditions on the imaginary fluid interfaces huang and teng 2020 developed a numerical model to investigate the effects of the channel side walls on the second order hydrodynamic forces acting on three dimensional bodies of arbitrary geometry in a wave channel for accurate and efficient calculation they provided detailed treatments of the integrations over the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces the free surface is divided into an inner region and two outer regions in which the integrals are treated differently in the inner region the free surface integral is performed numerically while in the outer regions the two dimensional free surface integrals are analytically integrated in rectangle regions the up and down wave vertical surface integrals are derived analytically by applying the locked potential excluding the evanescent modes under the assumption that the up and down wave vertical surfaces are located far from the body and the evanescent modes can be neglected eventually the integrals related to the outsides of outer regions are offset by each other and the rapidly converging up and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near field of the wave channel can be evaluated explicitly the present study can be considered as an extension of the previous work of huang and teng 2020 to the case of bichromatic incident wave fields for the high accuracy and efficiency of the calculation some improvements in the numerical algorithms are made the potentials of the locked waves including both the propagating and evanescent modes are derived since the up and down wave vertical surfaces are no longer forced to locate far from the body the free surface integral can be evaluated numerically in a small region in addition an analytical manner to the integrals over the up and down wave vertical surfaces is developed in this study after solving the boundary integral equation the sum and difference frequency radiation and diffraction potentials can be obtained explicitly numerical results for the quadratic transfer functions of the second order wave run up pressure and wave forces are given for different geometries such as bottom mounted vertical circular cylinders fixed truncated vertical circular cylinders and freely floating hemispheres 2 general formulation 2 1 governing equation and boundary condition we consider the second order interactions of plane bichromatic incident waves with a three dimensional body in a channel of width w and water depth h as shown in fig 1 two cartesian coordinate systems are employed for study of the problem o x y z is the space fixed coordinate system with the o x y plane in the quiescent free surface the o x z plane coinciding with the longitudinal symmetry of the channel and the z axis pointing vertically upward and o x y z is the body fixed coordinate system with its origin o at the center of mass of the body when the body is at its equilibrium position the two sets of coordinate systems coincide with each other we assume that the body is subjected to a train of nonlinear bichromatic incident waves propagating along the positive x direction the fluid domain is bounded by the instantaneous free surface s f z ζ the instantaneous wetted body surface s b the horizontal bottom surface s d z h and the vertical channel walls s w y w 2 under the assumption of incompressible and inviscid fluid and irrotational flow the flow can be described in terms of a velocity potential φ x y z t satisfying the laplace equation 1 2 φ x y z t 0 with the combination of the dynamic and kinematic conditions the velocity potential satisfies 2 2 φ t 2 g φ z 2 φ φ t 1 2 φ φ φ 0 on the free surface z ζ x y t where g is the acceleration of gravity and the free surface elevation ζ x y t can be obtained by the dynamic free surface boundary condition 3 ζ 1 g φ t 1 2 φ φ z ζ if the body is moving with the velocity u the boundary condition on the impermeable body surface can be generalized as 4 φ n n u where n represents the normal vector on the transient body surface on the sea bottom s d and channel walls s w the no flow conditions are written as 5 φ n 0 furthermore the suitable radiation boundary conditions at the far fields are required to ensure the correct asymptotic behavior of the scattering waves such that a unique solution can be determined 2 2 perturbation expansion assuming weak nonlinearities we express the dynamic quantities in the form of a power series with respect to the wave steepness ε k a 1 as 6 φ ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 ξ ε ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 θ

amplitudes of translational motion and ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 denote the amplitudes of rotation the superscripts 1 and 2 represent the first and second order quantities respectively as indicated by ogilvie 1983 under the assumption of the small amplitude of body motions the exact instantaneous position x and the unit normal vector n at a point on the body surface can be represented by the following transformation relationships 7 x x ε ξ 1 θ 1 x x c ε 2 ξ 2 θ 2 x x c ε 2 h x x c o ε 3 8 n n ε θ 1 n ε 2 θ 2 n ε 2 h n o ε 3 where x is the position vector to a point on the body surface in the body fixed coordinate system x c denotes the rotation center n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain and the matrix h associated with the first order amplitude of body motion has the form 9 h 1 2 θ 2 1 2 θ 3 1 2 0 0 2 θ 1 1 θ 2 1 θ 1 1 2 θ 3 1 2 0 2 θ 1 1 θ 3 1 2 θ 2 1 θ 3 1 θ 1 1 2 θ 2 1 2 we now consider a body to be placed in bichromatic waves with amplitudes a p a q and frequencies ω p ω q thus the first and second order dynamic quantities can be expressed as 10 φ 1 x t re p 1 2 φ p 1 x e i ω p t 11 ξ j 1 x t re p 1 2 ξ j p 1 x e i ω p t 12 φ 2 x t re p 1 2 q 1 2

denotes the mean term with the time the time independent term φ 2 x will henceforth be dropped in this research since it does not make any contribution to the second order wave forces we can expand the free surface and body surface boundary conditions into taylor series about its corresponding mean positions by applying the series expansions in eq 6 and the transformation relationships in eqs 7 and 8 we can collect the terms for the same order of ε and ε 2 then with substitution of eqs 10 13 into the free surface and body surface boundary conditions the boundary conditions can be specified as 14 φ p 1 x z ν p φ p 1 x 0 on z 0 15 φ p 1 x n i ω p ξ p 1 x n on s b 16 φ p 1 x n 0 on s d and s w at the first order where ν p ω p 2 g is the wave number in deep water and 17 φ p q 2 x z ν φ p q

on the wave side and lee side of the channel should be imposed at the first and second order which require that the scattering wave approaches the form of outgoing waves at the far fields the resolution of the first order problem with eqs 14 16 has been studied and discussed by many researchers kashiwagi 1991 chen 1994 and will not be elaborated in the present paper for the second order problem the sum and difference frequency potentials φ p q 2 can be decomposed into the incident potential φ i p q 2 radiation potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 6 and diffraction potential φ d p q 2 respectively as 25 φ p q x φ i p q 2 x j 1 6 i ω ξ j p q 2 φ j p q 2 φ d p q 2 x where φ j p q 2 j 1 2 6 represent the radiated waves owning to the second order body motions and yield the added mass and radiation damping coefficients and φ d p q 2 represent the diffraction potentials owning to the combination of the presence of second order incident waves and the forcing terms on the free surface and body surface and yield the exciting forces on the body the second order sum and difference frequency components of the incident potentials φ i p q 2 can be expressed in the following form bowers 1976 26a φ i p q 2 x 1 2 ϕ i p q ϕ i q p cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x 26b φ i p q 2 x 1 2 ϕ i p q ϕ i q p cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x where 27 k k p k q 28a ϕ i p q i g a p a q 2 ω p k p 2 ν p 2 2 k p

the radiation and diffraction potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 7 can be summarized as 29 φ j p q 2 z ν φ j p q 2 0 j 1 2 6 q p q 2 x y q i p q 2 x y g j 7 30 φ j p q 2 n n j j 1 2 6 φ i p q 2 n b p q 2 x j 7 on s b 31 φ j p q 2 n 0 j 1 2 7 on s d and s w for the second order sum and difference frequency radiation potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 6 the boundary conditions to be satisfied are identical to those for the first order problem while for the diffraction potentials φ d p q 2 the boundary conditions contain the forcing terms on the free surface and body surface moreover apart from the above boundary conditions the diffraction potentials should satisfy appropriate radiation conditions on the wave side and lee side of the channel which will be discussed in section 2 3 2 3 the solutions of the second order diffraction potentials at the far fields we divide the sum and difference frequency diffraction potentials φ d p q 2 into two distinct components 32 φ d p q 2 φ d f p q 2 φ d l p q 2 where φ d f p q 2 represent the free waves satisfying the homogeneous free surface conditions and sommerfeld radiation conditions at the far fields and φ d l p q 2 represent the locked waves satisfying the inhomogeneous free surface conditions and appropriate radiation conditions determined from the asymptotic form of the second order free surface boundary conditions the free waves φ d f p q 2 can be easily expressed by using the eigenfunction expansion technique which can be found in molin et al 2007 here we concentrate on the solutions of the locked potential for monochromatic waves molin et al 2007 presented the expressions of the locked potentials by applying the method of separation of variable assuming the up and down wave vertical surfaces located far from the body and the locked potentials only containing propagating wave components huang and teng 2020 used the same expressions to calculate the up and down wave vertical surface integrals for bichromatic waves li and williams 1999 presented the expressions of the locked potentials including both the propagating modes and evanescent modes for the two dimensional problems in the present paper a similar procedure is adopted to derive the locked potentials for the problem of bichromatic waves interaction with a body in a channel and the propagating and evanescent modes are both taken into account in the derivation the locked potentials φ d l p q 2 are determined from the asymptotic behavior of free surface forcing terms which are associated with the first order quantities thus it is convenient to give the following expression of the first order incident potential 33 φ i p 1 i g a p ω p e i k p x z κ p 0 z and the asymptotic forms of the first order scattering potentials φ s p 1 φ p 1 φ i p 1 of the p

represent the lee side and the wave side of the channel respectively the method for the calculation of a p m n 1 can be found in the appendix of huang and teng 2020 κ p m m 0 1 2 are the roots of the dispersion equation 35 ω p 2 g κ p m tan κ p m h 0 where κ p m m 1 are real and positive while κ p 0 i k p and k p is real and positive the eigen values α n for the transverse oscillations are defined as 36 α n n π w n 0 1 2 correspondingly the eigen values λ p m n for the longitudinal oscillations are 37 λ p m n i k p 2 α n 2 m 0 k p α n α n 2 k p 2 m 0 k p α n κ p m 2 α n 2 m 0 z κ p m z is a set of vertical eigenfunctions defined as 38 z κ p m z cos κ p m z h cos κ p m h m 0 1 2 after having the first order potential we can substitute eqs 33 and 34 into eq 21 and the free surface forcing terms can be expressed as 39 q p q 2 x y q i p q 2 x y g i g a p a q 2 ω p m n σ p q 0 2 i k p λ q m n a q m n 1 e i k p λ q m n x cos α n w 2 y i g a p a q 2 ω p m n σ p q m 2 i k q λ p m n a p m n 1

40 φ d l p q 2 1 2 ϕ d l p q 2 ϕ d l q p 2 φ p q d l 2 1 2 ϕ d l p q 2 ϕ d l q p 2 where 41a ϕ d l p q 2 i ω q a p a q 2 m n g m n a q m n 1 e i k p λ q m n x cos α n w 2 y z g m n z i ω q a p a q 2 m

locked potentials at the far fields can be evaluated analytically from eqs 42 45 it can be seen that the arguments g m n h m n e m n s t and f m n s t could be complex resulting in that the vertical eigenfunctions z could be complex therefore unlike the first order potential φ p 1 the second order incident potentials φ i p q 2 and the second order free waves φ d f p q 2 the locked potentials φ d l p q 2 will not decay to zero as the water depth goes to infinity 3 boundary integral equation in the present paper we solved the second order boundary value problem defined in eqs 29 31 based on a boundary integral equation method using a wave source green function applying the second green s theorem to the sum and difference frequency green functions g x x 0 ω and the radiation and diffraction potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 7 we can obtain fredholm integral equations 50 α φ j p q 2 x 0 s b g x x 0 ω n φ j p q 2 x d s s b g x x 0 ω n j d s for the radiation potentials φ j p q 2 j 1 2 6 and 51 α

represent the up wave and down wave vertical surfaces enclosing the body furthermore the green functions g x x 0 ω in eqs 50 and 51 satisfy the linear free surface condition and impermeable channel wall condition namely the free surface channel green function or tank green function the efficient algorithm of this green function has been developed by many researchers in the present study the methods proposed by linton 1993 and chen 1994 are employed the integral equation in eq 50 is identical in the form to that for a linear problem but at a sum or difference frequency and it is solved with no difficulty while for the integral equation 51 the right hand side is more involved than that at the first order and contains the additional contribution from the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces the accurate and efficient calculation of the integrations over those surfaces is essential to the solution of eq 51 for the wave body interaction problem of monochromatic waves in a wave channel huang and teng 2020 presented the detailed treatment of those troublesome integrals a similar procedure is adopted in the present paper for those integrals but a direct approach to obtain the up and down wave vertical surface integrals is developed in the following sections 3 1 treatment of the free surface integral to obtain a reliable solution of the second order problem the difficulties in the evaluation of the free surface integral should be overcome for monochromatic incident waves huang and teng 2020 placed the up and down wave vertical surfaces sufficiently far from the body where the evanescent waves can be neglected such that the free surface integral will be performed in a relatively large region for the efficient computation of the free surface integral the free surface is divided into three regions one inner region and two outer rectangular regions in which the integrals are treated differently in the inner region the free surface integral is performed numerically by discretizing the free surface into planer panels and using a quadrature formula while in the outer regions the two dimensional free surface integrals are evaluated analytically by exploiting the eigenfunction expansion of the free surface channel green function as well as the first order scattering potential in the present study some improvements are made for the integrals over the up and down wave vertical surfaces such that the up and down wave vertical surfaces are allowed to be placed at any locations in the wave channel when the up and down wave surfaces are close to the body the free surface integral can be conducted in a relatively small region and performed directly by using a numerical quadrature as shown in fig 2 the free surface is bounded by the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w l x l y w 2 and two exterior boundaries γ v x l w 2 y w 2 the free surface integral is defined as 52 i f 1 2 i f p q i f q p where 53 i f p q s f g x x 0 ω q p q 2 x y q i p q 2 x y g d s the above free surface integral contains the first and second derivative of the velocity potential by exploiting the shape function the numerical differentiation is used to getting the first derivative of the velocity potential although the numerical differentiation has some error the accuracy of the results of the first derivative is acceptable if the direct numerical differentiation is still used to get the second derivative of the velocity potential it is difficult to ensure a satisfactory accuracy due to the accumulation of errors in order to obtain reasonable accuracy following the method of chau 1989 and teng 1995 the free surface integral is written as the sum of a surface integral containing only the first derivative and the line integrals along the boundary of the free surface by applying green s theorem additionally when the source point x 0 and field point x are close to each other the integrands of the above integral becomes nearly singular in order to remove the higher order singularities the free surface integral is eventually written as 54 i f p q i ω q 2 g s f g x x 0 ω ν p 2 2 ν p ν q k p 2 φ i p 1 φ

horizontal gradient operator x y and n c n cos γ with γ being the angle between the normal vector n and the horizontal plane the equation for i f p q can be obtained by replacing φ s q 1 φ q 1 and their derivatives with the corresponding complex conjugates and replacing i ω q with i ω q in addition it is noteworthy that in spite of the fact that φ s p 1 x n 0 when x is on the channel side walls the last term in eq 54 the integration along the intersection between channel side walls and clam water surface does not equal zero this is attributed to the fact that φ s p 1 x 0 n 0 when x 0 is not on the side walls of the channel 3 2 treatment of the body surface integral like the free surface integral the body surface integral also contains the second derivatives of the first order velocity potential on the body surface the order of which can be reduced by employing stokes theorem after that an alternative form which involves only the first order derivatives of velocity potentials and green function may be derived besides the green function and its derivatives behave in nearly singularity as the field point x approaches the source point x 0 following teng 1995 the difficulty associated with the singularity of the green function and its derivatives are overcome by establishing an auxiliary integral over the body surface then the final expression for the body surface integral can be given as 55 i b 1 2 i b p q i b q p where 56 i b p q 1 2 s b g x x 0 ω i ω q θ p 1 χ q 1 i ω q h p q 2 x x c n θ p 1 φ q 1 x 0 n d s 1 2 s b g x x 0 ω χ p 1 φ q 1 x φ q 1 x 0 n d s 1 2 s b g x x 0 ω φ q 1 x φ q 1 x 0 χ p 1 n d s 1 2 γ b g x x 0 ω φ q 1 x φ q 1 x 0 χ p 1 d l it can be seen that the second derivate of the velocity potential is no longer involved in eq 56 in addition the expression for i b p q can be obtained in a similar way as that of i b p q and is not shown here for brevity 3 3 treatment of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals to obtain the solution of the second order problem computational effort should also be made in the evaluations of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals these integrals can be expressed as 57 i v i v i v where each part is defined as 58 i v 1 2 i v p q i v q p 59a i v p q h 0 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 ω x ϕ d l p q 2 x g x x 0 ω ϕ d l p q 2 x x d y d z x l 59b i v p q h 0 w 2 w 2 g x x 0 ω x ϕ d l p q 2 x g x x 0 ω ϕ d l p q 2 x x d y d z x l for the problem of the interaction of bichromatic waves with a body in the open sea the integral at infinity vanishes by applying the method of stationary phase and the far field asymptotic behavior of velocity potential and green function however in a channel the wave field will look like a finite sum of plane waves at the far fields as shown in eq 41 resulting in that the integrals at the up and down wave vertical surfaces eq 59 will not decay to zero the expressions of the second order locked potential for bichromatic waves in a wave channel are shown in section 2 3 for getting the up and down wave vertical surface integrals one can discretize the up and down wave vertical surfaces into planer panels and calculate the integral by using numerical quadrature in the present study a more efficient method will be proposed and the up and down wave vertical surface integrals will be performed analytically by employing the free surface channel green function in eigenfunction expansion the green functions at the sum and difference frequency ω can be written as linton 1993 60 g x x 0 ω m n ε n e λ m n x x 0 2 w λ m n cos α n w 2 y cos α n w 2 y 0 z κ m z z κ m

is different from the definition of n given in eq 62 as z g m v z dissatisfies the homogeneous free surface condition now the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be evaluated analytically although the expressions look fairly complicated the results can be obtained quickly with satisfactory accuracy some features of eq 65 which may be remarked are the following firstly the up and down wave vertical surface integrals are related to the coordinates of the source point x 0 and the locations of the up and down wave vertical surfaces x l which can be separated from each other thus the arguments β u v l only need to be computed once for each case secondly β u v l for the wave side and lee side of the channel both consist of four terms each of which contains an exponentially decaying series when m 0 n j or m 1 n 0 where j is the number of imaginary roots of eq 37 the eigen values for the longitudinal oscillations λ p m n are real such that only several terms are required to achieve a desired accuracy thirdly the third and fourth terms of β u v l include respectively variables c v n t and c v n t which are zero for a lot of cases since the variables c v n t are the integrals of the product of trigonometric functions with eigen values of transverse oscillations fourthly only even modes of oscillations in the transverse direction are excited for a body having an axis of symmetry coinciding with the centerline of the channel and thus a p m n 1 0 n 2 k 1 k 0 1 2 based on the above features the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be obtained quickly now the right hand side of the boundary integral equation 51 can be evaluated accurately and efficiently it can be seen the free surface integral and body surface integral are calculated numerically while the up and down wave vertical surface integrals are calculated analytically when calculating the boundary integral equation 51 the locations of the up and down wave vertical surfaces need to be determined if the value of l is chosen to be close to the principal dimension of the structure along the longitudinal direction of the channel the calculation domain of the free surface would be relatively small as a result the free surface integral 52 can be obtained more quickly with relatively few discretized grids in the meantime when we evaluate the up and down wave vertical surface integrals 65 it should take more local waves into account for obtaining a convergent result and the calculation efficiency of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals will decrease if the value of l is chosen to be large a reversed trend can be found for the calculation over the free surface as well as the up and down wave vertical surfaces therefore an appropriate selection of the value of l is important to balance the calculation efficiency of the free surface integral and up and down wave vertical surface integrals for minimum computing time for monochromatic waves huang and teng 2020 presented an indirect method to obtain the up and down wave vertical surface integrals under the condition that the up and down wave vertical surfaces are located at a large distance from the body where the evanescent waves can be neglected they analytically derived the integrations over the free surface in the outer regions and up and down wave vertical surfaces after some algebra it is found that the integrals related to the outsides of outer regions are offset by each other finally the rapidly converging up and down wave vertical surface integrals in the near fields of the wave channel are obtained in the present study we present a more direct way to get the up and down wave vertical surface integrals actually the expressions of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals obtained by these two methods are essentially identical when ω p ω q the above expressions of the up and down wave vertical surface integrals eq 65 will reduce to those of huang and teng 2020 for the case of a monochromatic incident wave field since we can evaluate the behavior of the locked potentials in the vicinity of the body the up and down wave vertical surfaces can be placed at a relatively small distance from the body thus the region of the free surface would not be large and the free surface integral can be calculated directly by numerical quadrature compared to the indirect method although the expressions of the locked potentials including the evanescent modes are more complicated the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be obtained in a straightforward manner but the indirect method also provides an approach to get the up and down wave vertical surface integrals in the analysis of the second order problem in a wave channel in the numerical evaluation of eqs 50 and 51 the body surface s b and the free surface s f are divided into a number of 6 node quadratic triangular elements or 8 node quadratic quadrilateral elements which are used for modeling both geometry and variation of the potential the body waterline γ b the two channel side wall waterlines γ w and two exterior boundaries γ v are discretized by quadratic line elements and the resulting line integrals are obtained by 3 point gaussian adaptive quadrature then a higher order boundary element method bem model is set up after solving eqs 50 and 51 the second order sum and difference frequency velocity potentials on the body surface can be determined 4 sum and difference frequency quadratic transfer functions qtf s after solving the second order sum and difference frequency potentials the associated second order forces as well as local pressure and free surface elevations can be calculated directly with perturbation series in ε the second order free surface elevation ζ 2 t pressure p 2 t and force f 2 t are given by 70 ζ 2 t p 2 t f 2 t re p 1 2 q 1 2 a p a q η p q p p q f p q e i ω t a p a q η p q p p q f p q e i ω t where η p q p p q and f p q are defined as the sum and difference frequency quadratic transfer functions for the free surface elevation pressure and force respectively the complete second order elevation qtf obtained by eq 3 and pressure qtf obtained by the bernoulli equation in general contain two separate contributions 1 that due to quadratic products of first order potentials and 2 that due to the second order potential itself these components are given by 71 η 1 p q 1 4 g φ p 1 φ q 1 ν ω p ω q 4 g 2 φ p 1 φ q 1 a p a q 72 η 2 p q i ω φ p q 2 g a p a q 73 p 1 p q ρ φ p 1 φ q 1 i ω q χ p 1 φ q 1 i ω p χ q 1 φ p 1 2 h p q 2 x x c k 4 a p a q

k is the unit vector in the z direction the expressions for the difference frequency problem are similar and are not given here for brevity if we consider the case with a fixed body the terms related to the body motion in the above equations vanish 5 numerical results before conducting the detailed numerical analysis the convergence of the numerical model are examined we first perform the convergence test for the results of the second order sum and difference frequency quantities with respect to the mesh discretization the considered case is a uniform vertical cylinder of radius a in a channel of width w 2 a 5 0 and depth h a 1 0 as the cylinder is placed at the centerline of the channel only one quarter of the body surface and free surface is discretized with the application of the simplification on its geometrical symmetry three meshes labelled as mesh a b and c are used in the test the numbers of elements on the body surface and the free surface for these meshes are listed in table 1 the locations of the up and down wave vertical surfaces are chosen as l h 2 0 the non dimensional frequencies of the pair of the incident waves are ν p a ν q a 1 0 2 0 figs 3 and 4 display the complete second order sum and difference frequency wave elevation qtf η p q together with its constituent components as a function of the azimuthal angle θ it can be seen that for the case of difference frequency potential it is hard to distinguish the results from the three different meshes for the case of sum frequency potential although the small divergence can be observed it is acceptable and it only occurs where the elevation changes rapidly along the circumference theoretically we may achieve a faster convergence for the case of difference frequency potential owing to the small wavenumber associated with the case of difference frequency potential compared to that of sum frequency potential therefore it can be concluded that converged results can be achieved by adopting an appropriate mesh discretization in the following calculations special attention has been paid to the mesh discretization to ensure that all the results are converged the results for the case of the interaction of the bichromatic waves with the same cylinder in the open sea obtained from kim and yue 1990 are plotted in figs 3 and 4 as well for the difference frequency problem the variation of η 2 p q is much milder than that of η 1 p q and the side wall effects on η 2 p q are less significant than those on η 1 p q in the difference frequency problem since the wave length is much larger than the characteristic size of the cylinder the presence of the cylinder does not impose obvious disturbance on the wave field resulting in that the waves scattered by the body and the wave reflections from the side walls are weak for the sum frequency problem the variation of the wave run up on the body varied more obviously along the circumferential direction although the influences of the channel walls are significant both η 1 p q and η 2 p q follow similar trends as those in the open sea it is also noted that the maximum and minimum surface elevations occur at neither the up wave side nor the down wave side of the cylinder for both the sum and difference frequency cases we next consider a uniform cylinder of radius a in a channel of width w 2 a 5 0 and depth h a 4 0 two pairs of bichromatic incident waves with ν p a ν q a 1 0 2 0 and 1 4 1 6 are considered figs 5 and 6 show the distribution of the second order difference frequency hydrodynamic pressure p p q and its constituent components along the vertical direction on the downstream θ 0 and upstream θ 180 of the cylinder respectively it can be seen that the variation of p 1 p q is similar to that in the open sea it attenuates rapidly as the depth z h increases and equals zero at the channel bottom this is owing to fact that φ p 1 0 at the lee side and wave side of the cylinder since p 2 p q is dominated by the second order velocity potential the variation of p 2 p q becomes small in magnitude along the water depth especially for smaller δ ν a compared with p 1 p q the depth attenuation rate along the vertical direction for p 2 p q is much milder and it does not decay to zero at the channel bottom this is owing to the behavior of the locked potential φ d p q 2 as discussed in section 2 3 for p 1 p q and p 2 p q they may be in phase resulting in that the larger value of p p q could occur at the free surface figs 7 and 8 show the distribution of the second order sum frequency hydrodynamic pressure p p q and its constituent components along the vertical direction on the downstream θ 0 and upstream θ 180 of the cylinder respectively it can be seen that the magnitude of the component p 2 p q varies greatly along the water depth especially in the vicinity of the free surface the second order sum frequency pressure p 2 p q may not decrease monotonically with depth as a result the minimum p 2 p q may not occur at the bottom of the cylinder even if p 1 p q and p 2 p q both are decrease monotonically with depth the pressure p p q may not decrease monotonically with depth due to the possible phase cancellations among the contributions moreover since p 2 p q due to the second order sum and difference frequency potentials make more contribution to the total second order pressure distribution compared with the components p 1 p q due to the quadratic products of the first order potentials it is essential to include the contribution of the second order potential in the analysis of the second order force for all curves the variations of the components of the pressure distribution are analogous to those in the open sea and they decay at the almost same rate at the deeper position the discrepancies between the results in the wave channel and open sea mainly occur near the free surface especially for the case of the sum frequency problem since with the depth decreasing or the frequency increasing the interference effects between the cylinder and channel walls become serious for evaluating the hydrodynamic interactions between the bodies and channel walls there are two alternative approaches which can be used to approximately simulate the presence of the side wall of the channel one is the simulation on a periodic array consisting of the same body placed in a line perpendicular to the incident wave direction as shown in fig 9 a and the other one is to use a pair of reflecting walls with finite length to replace the infinite length channel walls as shown in fig 9 b these two approaches can be conveniently extended by a program for an unbounded free surface and useful linear results can be achieved without paying much attention to the calculation of the free surface channel green function newman 2016 used the alternative approaches to compute the forces and motions of a ship like body in a channel gomes et al 2016 also used these two approaches to investigate the side wall effects on the performance evaluation of a wave energy converter the results show that as the number of mirror image bodies or the length of the finite long walls increases the behaviors of the middle body gradually approach those in a wave channel as expected newman 2001 showed that the practical levels of convergence for linear results are achieved with around 10 images except in the vicinity of transverse tank resonant frequencies in the present paper it is also expected that the second order results of these two alternative approaches have similar tendencies to those in the wave channel since the calculation of the free surface integral in the second order analysis in the open sea condition is computationally demanding the computed cases are limited to an array of five bodies or the vertical walls of length l w w 4 0 in the case of a body with a pair of vertical walls fig 9 b the walls should also be discretized into planar panels in newman 2016 and gomes et al 2016 it is assumed that the walls are zero thickness and are represented by dipole elements to satisfy the condition of zero normal velocity but in the second order analysis the zero thickness structure is not allowed thus the vertical walls have a finite thickness in the present calculations but the thickness is enough small to guarantee the second order results not affected by the thickness of the vertical walls moreover the results of the cases in the open sea are obtained by the method proposed by teng et al 1999 in the first approach four cases are considered for n 1 it is a single isolated cylinder of radius a h 1 0 in the open sea and for n 3 or 5 it can be considered as 2 or 4 mirror images reflected about the walls equally spacing in the transverse direction with separating distance w when n the periodic array extends to infinity and it is a limiting case that can be considered as a single isolated cylinder in a wave channel in the second approach four cases are considered as well a pair of parallel vertical walls of length l w are added at y w 2 which extend from the bottom to the free surface over the longitudinal domain l w 2 x l w 2 for l w 1 and it is the limiting cases corresponding to a single isolated cylinder in the open sea and wave channel respectively figs 10 and 11 show the horizontal second order sum and difference frequency force qtf on the middle cylinder in bichromatic incident waves with the constant frequency difference ν 2 ν 1 a 0 2 the two vertical dash lines in figures represent the first transverse tank resonant frequencies corresponding to k 2 w π and k 1 w π respectively for the difference frequency problem the horizontal wave force on a single isolated cylinder in the open sea varies slowly in the considered range of wave frequency with the number of the body increasing the variations of the difference frequency force slowly approach those of the case of a single isolated cylinder in the wave channel and the wave frequency corresponding to the maximum wave force gradually decreases until the wave frequency is close to the transverse tank resonant frequency for the case of a body with a pair of vertical walls even if the length of the vertical walls is short the difference frequency force shows the convergence to the results of the case of a single isolated cylinder in the wave channel at the low frequency but with the increase of the wave frequency the difference frequency force fluctuates around the results in the wave channel due to the serve interference between the body and vertical walls when the wave frequency is close to the transverse tank resonant frequency the wave forces on the body with finite length vertical walls may overestimate those of a single isolate body in a channel for the sum frequency problem either as the number of body increases or as the length of the vertical walls increases the sum frequency forces on the middle body rapidly move away from the results of the case without walls and gradually approach the results of the case of a single isolated cylinder in the wave channel but for a finite array of equally spaced bodies due to the significant interactions between bodies it could cause a large sum frequency force on the middle body even if the wave frequency is not close to the transverse resonant frequency of the channel for a better understanding of the effects of the channel walls on the sum and difference frequency wave exciting forces acting on a truncated circular cylinder figs 12 and 13 show the contour plots for the second order sum and difference frequency force magnification factors f p q f p q o in the range of 0 6 k p w 2 π 2 4 p 1 2 where f p q o are the second order sum and difference frequency wave forces on the same single cylinder in the open sea obtained by the method proposed by teng et al 1999 three axisymmetrical truncated cylinders with the same draft d h 0 4 but different radii 2 a w 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are placed symmetrically relative to the center plane of the channel the water depth is h w 1 0 the horizontal and vertical dash lines in figures show the wavenumbers corresponding to k p w 2 π n and n 1 2 at which the transverse tank resonances occur due to the symmetry of the flow only the symmetrical resonance modes are excited the influence of the side walls can be readily assessed by the study of the magnification factor when the factors are unity the channel walls have no confining effect as shown in fig 12 for the difference frequency problem the side wall effects gradually become more significant with the increase in the scale of the body along the diagonal ω p ω q it shows the side wall effects on the second order drift loads which can be obtained directly from the first order quantities for the second order horizontal drift force as the frequency increases the magnification factors gradually decrease until the incident wave frequency is close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies then there is a noticeable change of the variation for the second order horizontal drift force and it is considerably influenced by the tank wall reflections since one more propagating mode appears in the wave channel with distance away from the diagonal the results do not vary strongly until one of the incident wave frequencies is close to one of the transverse tank resonant frequencies for the second order vertical drift force the results in the wave channel fluctuate around the results in the open sea with distance away from the diagonal the variation of magnification factor is fairly flat and the side wall effects are insignificant until one of the frequencies is close to one of the transverse tank resonant frequencies as shown in fig 13 for the sum frequency problem the side wall effects also gradually become more serious with the increase in the scale of the body along the diagonal ω p ω q it is the special case of a single regular wave and huang and teng 2020 have presented the variation of the second order force magnification factor and it will not be elaborated in the present study for the horizontal force the side wall effects are significant in the direction k p w 2 π n p 1 2 at which the transverse tank resonance occurs for the vertical force there is a ridge along the diagonal and the magnification factors fall off rapidly with distance away from the diagonal even though both incident wave frequencies are not close to the transverse tank resonant frequency the side wall effects could be essential for a relatively large body besides for any pair of waves whose sum frequency coincides with the transverse tank resonant frequencies a so called second order transverse tank resonance occurs however for the considered wavenumber range the side wall effects are insignificant at those second order transverse tank resonant frequencies in general the results in the wave channel oscillate about the corresponding open sea solution and are strongly dependent on the incident frequency pair the side wall effects on the sum frequency forces are more significant than those on the difference frequency forces under the same frequency combination the side wall effects on the horizontal and vertical forces are different if one of the incident wave frequencies is close to the transverse tank resonant frequencies it probably gives rise to serious interference between the cylinder and channel walls at last we consider the effects of the channel width on the hydrodynamic characteristic of a floating body the cases of freely floating hemispheres of radius a placed in the center of channels with same depth h a 3 0 but different width w 2 a 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 are examined six wave frequency pairs with the constant frequency difference δ ν a 0 6 are considered also the open sea w 2 a results obtained from teng et al 1999 are included in tables tables 2 and 3 show the sum and difference frequency horizontal and vertical force qtf for different incident frequency combinations respectively again in the lower frequency range since the wavelength is much larger than the scale of the body the effects of the side wall reflections induced by the scattering waves are weak and the results in the wave channels are in general coincident with those in the open sea as the frequency increases the side wall effects appear to be greater especially when one of incident wave frequency coincides with the transverse tank resonant frequencies for all the computed cases when the channel width is w 2 a 6 0 and the incident wave frequency pair is ν p a ν q a 0 4 1 0 the side wall effects are the most serious it is probably owing to the fact that the transverse tank resonant frequency happens to be closer to the discrete frequency although the wider channel has more resonant frequencies the results in the wave channel in general converge to those in the open sea with the increase of the channel width tables 4 and 5 show the sum and difference frequency surge and heave response qtf for different incident frequency combinations respectively the behaviors of the motion amplitudes show the similar trends to those of the second order forces 6 conclusions a numerical model is developed to investigate the second order interaction of bichromatic waves with three dimensional bodies in a channel the problem is decomposed into the radiation and diffraction problems the second order radiation problems are calculated as the same as the first order radiation problems at the corresponding sum and difference frequencies for the diffraction problem the integrations over the free surface body surface and up and down wave vertical surfaces are treated effectively for accurate and efficient calculation in the second order analysis the free surface integral and body integral are evaluated numerically and the integral transformations are applied to reduce the order of the derivatives of the first order velocity potential and remove the higher order singularities in the integrals for evaluating the up and down wave vertical surface integrals the locked potentials including both the propagating and evanescent modes are derived then the up and down wave vertical surface integrals can be integrated analytically in the rectangle coordinate by exploiting the free surface channel green function in eigenfunction expansion the cases of wave scattering by a bottom mounted circular cylinder a fixed truncated circular cylinder and a freely floating hemisphere in a channel are examined the numerical results illustrate that the variations of the components of the wave elevation and pressure distribution are similar to those in the open sea but the side wall effects are significant near the free surface for the second order exciting forces when one of the incident wave frequencies is close to the tank resonant frequencies the side wall effects are pronounced especially for a relatively large body as the channel width increases the results in the wave channel converge to those in the open sea though the more resonant frequencies could appear for a wider channel the present numerical model may provide an efficient means for predicting the second order free surface elevation and loads for some structures in the wave channels with irregular waves

recapitulated and discussed païdoussis 1998 2003 ibrahim 2010 dai et al 2016 gayen et al 2019 the functionally graded materials fgms whose properties vary smoothly and continuously though the thickness are usually composed of metal and ceramic they have been becoming a promising advanced material in many applications due to more advantages of high strength lightweight lower stress concentrations and withstanding high temperature gradient environments with the developments and applications of micro nano electronic mechanical systems m nems micro scale structures including functionally graded micro scale shells tubes interacting with flowing fluid have been a popular topic since the later 1980s stone and kim 2001 the mechanical analysis of fluid conveying pipe shell at micro scale level is one of the most important research areas which has received more attentions from researchers in recent years farajpour et al 2018a b however the existed classical continuum based theory is not suitable for formulations of micro scale structures the molecular dynamical simulations used for studying such problems create expensive computational cost hosseini hashemi et al 2016 therefore the higher order elasticity theories are adopted to capture the size dependency during the past years babaei and eslami 2020a b different types of higher order elasticity theories such as the strain gradient elasticity the surface energy theory the stress gradient theory couple stress theory the modified couple stress theory have been developed to describe size dependent behaviors of such structures the modified couple stress theory yang et al 2002 which has been proven to interpret and capture size dependent phenomena for microstructures kim et al 2019 salehipour et al 2017 is effective and simply by comparing with other modified theories by using the beam model wang and ni 2010 employed the differential quadrature method to study vibration characteristics of fluid conveying microtubes based on the modified couple stress theory they found that the critical flow velocities predicted by the modified coupled stress theory are higher than those predicted by the classical beam theory because of the small size effect where the critical flow velocity refers to the lowest flow velocity of losing stability zeighampour and beni 2014 also drawn similar conclusions ghayesh et al 2019 considered the global dynamics of fluid conveying nanotubes based on the nonlocal strain gradient model of beams moreover size effects of micro flow on vibration characteristics of such microsystem were considered by wang et al 2013 the further studies on such vibrations were extended to shells pipes composed of fgms it was found that the length scale parameter plays a considerable role in vibration frequency responses beni et al 2015 which might be modulated by the volume fraction exponent representing the content of different components in fgms deng et al 2017 based on the modified couple stress theory hu et al 2016 extended the linear analysis for fluid conveying micropipe to the nonlinear theory they also confirmed that the small length scale parameter indeed improves the stability of micropipe and chaotic vibrations could occur when one end of the micropipe was supported by a loosely medium she et al 2018 studied on the nonlinear bending and vibration behaviors of porous fgms nanotubes based on the nonlocal strain gradient theory the nonlinear stability vibrations of micropipe conveying fluid were also studied based on the modified couple stress theory and by using the beam model dehrouyeh semnani et al 2017a 2017b the principle finding of these researches is that such microsystem loses stability via the pitchfork bifurcation and creates the hardening type nonlinear resonant behavior the similar work was also performed by arani et al 2013 based on the modified coupled stress theory furthermore the effects of the viscoelastic medium and fluid viscosity on the nonlinear free vibration and instability of fluid conveying double walled boron nitride nanotubes were conducted to elucidate in addition the initial geometric imperfection and surface stress influence of a fluid conveying nanopipe made of functionally graded fg materials were taken into consideration liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 stability and dynamics of nanotubes conveying viscous fluid were also studied by means of the beam theory they found that the effect of viscosity of flowing fluid on the vibration and instability of nanotubes can be ignored wang and ni 2009 khodami maraghi et al 2013 some other studies jannesari et al 2012 liang and su 2013 showed that the fluid viscosity has a strong stabilization effect for 40 nm diameters single wall carbon nanotube swcnts conveying internal fluid but it may be ignored for sub 7nm diameters swcnts besides hydrodynamical loads the stability of micro shell is often affected by other multi loads including thermal loads electromagnetic loads based on the modified couple stress theory babaei and eslami 2020a b revealed the effects of length scale parameter porosity distribution parameter nonlinear elastic foundation temperature dependence on the thermally vibrations of fg porous micro tube arani et al 2015 reported the effect of thermal load on instability of fluid conveying functionally graded materials nanoshells they pointed out that the greater temperature difference renders such system instability at lower critical flow velocity the nonlinear thermo resonant behavior of fluid conveying fg pipes was presented dehrouyeh semnani et al 2019 while ansari et al 2016 found that for fluid conveying carbon nanotubes the temperature changes increase the threshold of critical flow velocity arani et al 2014 confirmed that the imposed magical field might control the stability of micro shell conveying fluid which was useful in design of nano micro electronic mechanical systems n mems in addition under magneto electro thermo mechanical loadings complex dynamical behaviors of fluid conveying micro shell were investigated by mohammadimehr and mehrabi 2017 and mohammadimehr and mehrabi 2018 they pointed out that the effects of temperature rise ratio of length to radius knusen number and carbon nanotubes volume fraction on the stability of tube interacting with fluid the more detailed reviews on mechanics of nanoscale and microscale structures farajpour et al 2018a b ghayesh and farajpour 2019 have been presented it is well known that the size dependence characterized by the material length scale parameter in the modified couple stress theory plays a crucial role for a micro nano system khorshidi 2018 performed a series of experiments to show that the material length scale parameter is always changing in different geometry dimensions of structures the experimental method for determining the value of material length scale parameter was given by li et al 2018 according to existed literatures dynamics and stability of microscale shells pipes tubes in axial flow have been extensively studied on the contrary dynamics and stability of micro shells subjected to an annular flow are rarely studied so far layeghi and seyf 2008 pointed out that there is a great importance for analysis of flowing fluid passage an annulus in design and utilization of microfluidic devices which have been used in many areas of engineering the typical examples are micromixers and annular microheat pipes where the flow in annulus might be turbulent because of relative higher reynolds number here to the best of the authors knowledge there is no study on the stability analysis for a micro shell conveying fluid with an axial flow velocity component and an angular flow velocity component in the annular space between the inner shell and outer shell moreover the coupling effect of fluid rotation and the material length scale parameter on the stability of micro shell cannot be elucidated up to now therefore dynamics and stability analysis for a micro shell subjected to swirling annular flow based on the modified coupled stress theory will be investigated in this paper the zero level contour method and travelling wave type displacements will be applied to solve the motion equations by the aid of the programmed software matlab to obtain critical flow velocities it will be shown that the fluid rotation effect the fluid viscosity effect the size effect on dynamical behaviors of the shell here for the first time the viscous forces induced by fluid viscosity which has been developed for macroscale shells are introduced into microscale shell motion equations 2 theoretical development in this section an ideal fluid is only considered the turbulent flow considering viscous forces will be discussed in section 3 2 1 the definition of the problem the geometry of the annulus between the two coaxially micro shells is shown in fig 1 where the two shells are composed of the same functionally graded materials the inner shell has the length l radius r i and wall thickness h i while the corresponding quantities of the outer shell are the same length l radius r o and wall thickness h o the fluid shell system with micro dimensions is defined in a cylindrical coordinate system o r θ x where the origin o is located on the left end at the middle point of the inner shell x θ and r are in the axial circumferential and radial directions respectively a helical fluid with the density ρ f flowing though the annular space between the two shells is considered incompressible and its flow velocity components in a time mean sense are denoted by the axial mean flow velocity u o and the angular mean flow velocity ω o some assumptions in this paper need to be raised 1 the shell motion is so small that the linear theory can be used 2 the annular flow is the continuum flow and the non slip condition may be imposed 3 the gap between the two shells is relative larger and thus the depletion layer effect is not considered 2 2 perturbation pressure the present flow is presumed to be irrotational and inviscid from the kelvin s theorem a flow velocity can be expressed in terms of the grade of velocity potential 1 v δφ the velocity potential φ consists of the steady state potential of the fluid φ s associated with the two mean flow velocities and the corresponding perturbation potential φ u associated with the shell motion so 2 φ φ s φ u u o x v o θ φ u in which the tangential mean velocity v o ω o r through the expressions 1 and 2 the flow velocity components are given by 3 v x u o φ u x v θ v o φ u r θ v r φ u r from the bernoulli equation the perturbation pressure can be given 4 φ u t 1 2 v 2 p ρ f p s ρ f 5 p p p in which p s p 1 2 ρ f u o 2 v o 2 p and p are the time mean pressure and the perturbation pressure associated with the shell motions respectively substituting the flow velocity components into eq 4 and through eq 5 one obtains 6 φ u t 1 2 u o 2 v o 2 2 u o φ u x v 0 φ u r θ φ u x 2 φ u r 2 φ u r θ 2 p p ρ f p s ρ f because the motions of the shell are small enough we can neglect the second order terms φ u 2 induced by the shell motions eq 6 yields 7 p ρ f φ u t v o r φ u θ u o φ u x now the perturbation potential φ u must meet the laplace equations due to small shell motions 8 δ 2 φ u 0 here the laplace operator δ 2 1 r r r r 1 r 2 2 θ 2 2 x 2 the separable type solution of the eq 8 is given 9 φ u φ r exp i λ x n θ ω t where i 2 1 λ n and ω are the order of the axial vibration model the circumferential wavenumber and the circular frequency t denotes time substituting the express 9 into the eq 8 then performing certain mathematical operations we can obtain the bessel equation 10 2 φ r r 2 1 r φ r r n 2 r 2 λ 2 φ r 0 the solution of eq 10 can be expressed by 11 φ r a i n λ r b k n λ r where i n k n are the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind of n and a b are constants to be determined the non penetration condition can be imposed into the interface between the fluid and the shell walls in other words the radial velocity of the flow must be equal to the radial velocity of the shell wall one can arrive at 12a v ri φ u r d w i d t w i t v o r w i θ u o w i x r r i 12b v ro φ u r d w o d t w o t v o r w o θ u o w o x r r o where v r is a radial fluid flow velocity d d indicates the material derivative the subscripts i o pertain to the inner shell and outer shell w is the displacement of the middle surface point of a shell along r direction inserting the eqs 9 and 11 into eq 12 we get 13a a 1 i n λ r i b 1 k n λ r i w i t v o r w i θ u o w i x 13b a 1 i n λ r o b 1 k n λ r o w o t v o r w o θ u o w o x in which a 1 a exp i λ x

expressions in eqs 16 and 17 include the flexural restoring force the centrifugal force the coriolis force the inertial force respectively and those forces might control the fluidelastic instability of such fluid shell system 2 3 functionally graded cylindrical shells the fgms shells are made from a mixture of metal and ceramic where the volume fractions of metal and ceramic is assumed to follow the sigmoid power law distribution loy et al 1999 18 v c v c z 2 z h 2 h n v m v c 1 in which n is the power law exponent presenting the metal variation along the shell thickness z presents a displacement variable of the radius direction the subscripts m c denote the aluminum and ceramic constituents respectively it should to be noted that there are other accurate methods to estimate the effective elastic parameters of composite materials one of these is the mori tanaka method which evaluates the material parameters may be more reasonable and accurate than other the sigmoid power law method due to its advantages such problem deserves further study in the future from the sigmoid power law the effective elastic modulus e poission ratio υ and the mass density ρ can be written in the form 19a e z e m v m e c v c e m e c e m 2 z h 2 h n 19b υ z υ m v m υ c v c υ m υ c υ m 2 z h 2 h n 19c ρ z ρ m v m ρ c v c ρ m ρ c ρ m 2 z h 2 h n from above expressions we can see that the inner surface is fully metal and the outer shell surface is fully ceramic 2 4 the governing equations of motion with using the classical donnell shell theory the displacement field for an fgms micro shell can be expressed by amabili 2008 20 u 1 u z w x v 1 v z w r θ u 3 w where u v and w are the x θ and r directions displacements of points on the middle surface of a shell respectively by expanding displacement components in the form of the travelling wave the displacements u v and w of the inner or outer shell with simply supported boundary conditions can be expressed as follows zhang et al 2001 21 u i o v i o w i o u m n exp i λ x n θ ω t v m n exp i λ x n θ ω t w m n exp i λ x n θ ω t π 2 λ m π l the simply supported boundary conditions of the fgms micro shell are considered in present

polynomial of the variable of dimensionless frequency setting the two fluid velocities and the model m n to be parameters for a given shell and fluid the frenquency can be determined provided that these parameters are known when the viscous forces are considered there appear to be the two possible approaches at least to obtain the relation of the frequency fluid velocity in the first approach we would necessitate the iterative solution of the navier stokes equation by numerical means to obtain the steady forces and we will obtain the relation of the frequency fluid velocity the iterative method would spend very expensive in the second approach the viscous forces would be determined separately in a time averaged sense based on the time mean navier stokes equations after obtaining the steady viscous forces and the perturbation pressure we will obtain the relation of the frequency fluid velocity by means of the so called zero level contour method the zero level contour method would be used to directly draw the close curve representing the dispersion relation of ω u o v o v o u o is given by the aid of the software package matlab from the feature points of the contour curve we can find the frequencies and the critical velocities associated with modes as shown in fig 2 to obtain the critical flow velocity and the corresponding mode the flow velocities with different modes m n are calculated by the zero level contour method based on the results we can find the lowest velocity the critical velocity associated with the mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the present method though fluid microstructure systems have emerged in many industrial applications few detailed reports on stability and dynamics of an fgms cylindrical micro shell subjected to annular flow are available in the literature therefore it is difficult to perform an exact comparison between the present results and existed results in order to test the validity and accuracy of the zero level contour method we firstly calculated the natural frequency of an fgms micro shell without fluid where the fgm shell is composed of ceramic at the inner surface and aluminum at out surface in the case the fgms shell with simply supported boundary conditions adopts the following geometric parameters and material properties l r 1 h r 0 1 r 1 nm l h e m 7 10 10 p a e c 4 27 10 11 p a υ m 0 3 υ c 0 17 ρ m 2707 kgm 3 ρ c 3100 kgm 3 ρ f 1000 kgm 3 the hydrodynamic pressure vanishes and λ c equals 1 because such shell is single vacant shell the obtained results are listed in table 1 it is clear that the present results have a good agreement with the existed results second to verify the critical velocities obtained by the present algorithm an fgms cylindrical shell can be simplified to a homogenous shell subjected to the internal flow with an axial velocity the relevant geometric and material parameters for the homogenous micro shell with simply supported conditions are as follows zhou and wang 2012 l 100 μ m r 10 μ m h 0 1 μ m e 1 44 10 11 p a υ 0 38 ρ s 1000 kgm 3 ρ f 1000 kgm 3 l 17 6 μ m the perturbation pressure exerted on the inwall of the shell by internal fluid is given by 40 p i i ρ f l m π i n λ i n λ t u o x w the entries ζ i j in the matrix ζ of the eq 38 are correspondingly rewritten as ζ 11 λ 2 1 υ 2 n 2 l 2 1 υ 4 λ 2 n 2 l 2 1 υ 4 n 4 ω 2 ζ 12 ζ 21 1 υ 2 λ n l

zhou and wang though the two different theories are summarized in table 2 we found that the maximum error is 5 91 as can be seen from the comparison the present results agree well with existed results the zero level contour method is effective furthermore the effects of size on the critical velocity are quite obvious it should to be noted that the two modes are different 3 2 dynamical stability analysis in this study we only consider the case of elastic outer and perfectly stiff inner shells the size dependent stability analysis for the outer shell subjected to an annular fluid with the axial and or circumferential velocity components will be conducted in the next calculation the shell and fluid parameters are given by l 100 μ m r o 10 μ m k r o r i r i r i 9 0901 μ m k 0 1 h h i h o 0 1 μ m l h e m 7 10 10 p a e c 4 27 10 11 p a υ m 0 3 υ c 0 17 ρ m 2707 kgm 3 ρ c 3100 kgm 3 ρ f 1000 kgm 3 we can use the zero level contour method to obtain different flow velocities when the modes m n composed of axial and circumferential wavenumbers are set to be certain numbers and the angular velocity is given the typical result showing the variation of the dimensionless frequency against the dimensionless axial flow velocity is shown in fig 2 it is observed that the backward travelling wave crosses the zero frequency line at point b representing the loss of the system stability in the form of divergence when the forward and the backward travelling frequencies coalesce at nose point c where the point is considered to represent the coupled mode flutter instability in the system beyond the point c the dynamical post divergence behavior of the system may be further studied in the future by means of the nonlinear theory to obtain the critical flow velocity the flow velocities with combinations of different modes m n are calculated as plotted in fig 3 where we can find the critical axial flow velocity by divergence u o 0 0104 and the corresponding mode 2 1 by proceeding in an analogous manner we can obtain others critical flow velocities for example when the angular velocity component is only considered the critical annular velocity ω o 0 0126 by flutter associated with the mode 1 2 are found 3 2 1 effects of small size the material length scale parameter l in the modified couple stress theory is used to capture size effects the length scale parameter is usually not constant for different materials to reveal the effect of the material length scale parameter on critical velocities the eq 39 is solved with different l these results showing the variation of the total flow velocities with the dimensionless length scale parameter are displayed in fig 4 where we define the total flow velocity v t u o 2 v o 2 it is clear that the critical velocities undergo an increase of 0 01118 when the material length scale parameter l increases from zero to 0 022 indicating that the material length scale parameter leads to the stiffening of shell when the length radius ratio thickness radius ratio and gap ratio keep unchangeable the relative radius of micro shell r o r o r o i r o 10 changes from 1 to 100 the variation curve of the critical velocities with different relative radii is plotted in fig 5 it is observed that with increasing of the radius of micro shell the critical velocity first degrades rapidly slowly diminishes afterwards until it almost crosses the line l 0 which indicating the size effect is negligible for macro scale structures 3 2 2 effects of fluid rotation fig 6 illustrates the change of form of stability loss of the micro shell under the combined action of the axial flow velocity and angular flow velocity it is clear that the critical axial velocity by divergence decreases obviously with the increase of the rotating speed of fluid with further increasing of the angular flow velocity the form of instability of system begins to change from the fig 6 i e the compound form of divergence and flutter transforming into the single form of the couple flutter the possible physical explanations the fluid rotation effect renders the system damping bigger in quantity the fluidelastic instability of the system is controlled by the only flutter under the bigger system damping based on the solution of eq 39 we use the stepwise iterative method to obtain the dimensionless critical angular velocity 0 0014915 at the transition point where the critical axial flow by divergence becomes zero it should be pointed out that the influence of the fluid rotation on the mechanism of stability loss for micro shells is not essentially different from the instability mechanism for macro shells under the same simply supported boundary condition fig 7 further illustrates the fluid rotation effect quantificationally for the given parameters here as can be seen there is a more than 10 percent decline in the critical total fluid velocity when the ratio of the tangential velocity to the axial velocity increases about 1 5 percent it seems to be concluded that the fluid rotation lowers the stability of the system the mathematical explanation for the phenomenon is that the value of the axial vibration model λ is smaller than that of the circumferential wavenumber n for a slender shell which renders the system stability to be sensitive to the tangential velocity changes at the same time the stability boundary by way of setting a fixed value to the angular velocity component then searching for the critical value of the axial velocity component is displayed in the figure 3 2 3 couple effects of fluid rotation and small size to better evaluate the coupling effects of the fluid rotation and small size we define the new dimensionless parameter r l v l v τ which is similar to the rossby number typical results are depicted in fig 8 by the sensitivity analyses as can be seen from fig 8 the coupling effects of the fluid rotation and small size on stability behaviors of micro shell are different under different dimensionless parameters r l v when the dimensionless ratio r l v becomes bigger enough a certain increase in the fluid rotation speed do not tend to destabilize the system in other words the stability of such system is more sensitive to the material length scale parameter changes for a big enough dimensionless parameter r l v which might give us some insights into designs of microfluidic system 3 2 4 effects of material property to understand the effect of the material property on stability behaviors of shell we summarize the critical flow velocities with different volume fraction exponents n in table 3 from the table 3 we find that the critical flow velocities decrease with the increase of n where n 0 is for ceramic shell with higher stiffness compared to the fully aluminum shell for n 3 2 5 effects of fluid viscosity the flow in present subsection is an incompressible fully developed turbulent flow which can occur at lower reynolds number for microscale structures peng and peterson 1996 calculations proved that the macro scale system subjected to an annular flow loses stability induced primarily by inviscid and steady viscous forces chebair et al 1990 based on the

friction factor r m is the radius value at which the mean velocity u o reaches the maximum value the reynolds number of annular flow here is within the range of turbulent flow and the annular gap is

annular flow which may be expressed as d 2 r o r i and r e is the reynolds number by introducing the fluid viscosity and the relative roughness of cylindrical shell the geometric and material

kgm 3 l h ν 1 0 10 6 by implementing the zero level contour method the characteristic equation can be solved by the aid of the galerkin s method where the weighted function satisfies the simply supported boundary conditions i e g x sin m π x l 49 the effects of steady viscous forces on the divergence instability of macro micro shell are shown in fig 9 a b for the macro shell the values of above geometry parameters are unchangeable while they will be measured by millimeter fig 9 a shows that the critical flow velocity obtained by the viscous theory reduces about 73 percent compared with the corresponding value visa the non viscous theory in parallel the critical flow velocity for micro shell obtained by the viscous theory goes down as well 66 percent as shown in fig 9 b it may be inferred that the fluid viscosity has an immense destabilizing effect for whether the micro shell or macro shell similar to the figs 2 and 10 displays the variation of the dimensionless frequency with the dimensionless flow velocity in the version of viscous theory by way of comparisons it is found that the steady forces do not modify the general stability character of the system the steady forces however do change the critical flow velocities of the system quantitatively it is also found that the fluid rotation lowers the critical axial velocity whether or not the steady forces are taken into account consequently we may give the possible physical explanation that the pre load q 3 produced by the fluid viscosity reduces the shell stiffness thus lowering the critical flow velocity the pre load q 3 being a compressive hoop stress and a dominant factor 4 conclusions the size dependent stability of an outer cylindrical shell subjected to an annular flow with the axial and angular flow velocity components is firstly investigated in this paper where the shell is an fgms shell with metal ceramic lays an analytical model has been developed based on the modified couple stress theory by the aid of the hamilton s principle adopting the zero level contour method we obtain the travelling wave type solutions for the simply supported outer shell the calculated results have been presented in the frame of both inviscid and viscous theories here the mathematical model of steady viscous forces is first introduced to analyze the annular flow it is found that the small size effect characterized by the material length scale parameter l renders the fluid micro shell system more stable with increasing of the characteristic size the relative radius of fgms micro shell the size dependent stability behavior of fgms micro shell is not obvious as previously stated the small size effect can be negligible for normal scale shells it is found that in all cases the presence of fluid rotation tends to lower the stability of fluid shell system furthermore when the fluid rotation speed reaches a certain value it modifies the stability behavior of the system qualitatively that is the compound type of the stability loss becomes the single couple model flutter the physical reason is that for the bigger system damping the fluidelastic instability of the system is controlled by the only flutter it is deduced that the stability behavior of the system is sensitive to the fluid rotation effect in addition we introduce the new physical coefficient r l v to better assess the coupling influence of small size and fluid rotation on the stability of system for a higher value of r l v the effect of the fluid rotation on stability of the system is not important compared to the small size effect it is found that the steady forces induced by the fluid viscosity do not qualitatively change the general character of system but it has an immense destabilizing effect the pre load q 3 is a dominant factor which can be the effective mean to regulate such system stability it is important to note that when the gap is relative bigger enough the fluid viscosity play a strong destabilizing role in such system it is also found that with the increase of power law index n the critical flow velocities decrease accordingly credit authorship contribution statement wen bo ning

20991,in this paper the stability and dynamics of a functionally graded materials fgms cylindrical micro shell subjected to swirling annular fluid through the annulus between the inner shell and the outer shell are firstly investigated the fluid perturbation pressure related to the shell vibration is determined by the potential flow theory the steady viscous forces are derived based on the fully developed turbulent flow the shell motion equations are established on the basis of the hamilton s principle along with the donnell shell theory to capture the size effect of micro shell the zero level contour method is adopted to obtain the solutions of shell motion equations first the system subjected to an ideal annular flow is studied the results show effects of the fluid rotation material length scale parameter and material properties on the fluid micro shell system stability furthermore the coupling effect of the fluid rotation and the material length scale parameter on the dynamical stability of the system is evaluated second the system subjected to a viscous annular flow is further studied a more impressive result is observed that the fluid viscosity effect renders the system subjected to an annular flow more unstable and the physical explanation for the phenomenon is presented graphical abstract coupling effect of the fluid rotation and small size on the total stability of system the new dimensionless parameter r t v l v τ is defined the stability of such shell is more sensitive to changes of the material length scale parameter for a big enough dimensionless parameter r t v which might give us some insights into designs of microfluidic system image 1 keywords functionally graded materials size effect annular flow fluid rotation fluid viscosity modified coupled stress 1 introduction circular cylindrical shell is one of the most fundamental structural elements which is commonly found in many engineering applications such as those applied in nuclear reactor plants jet pumps heat exchangers and so on the continuum theories of shells are given in the form of monographs yamaki 1984 amabili 2008 where dynamics and stability of shells are discussed in detail in engineering applications many of dramatic structural failures were found to be caused by the fluid forces induced by the fluid structure interaction the fluidelastic forces may be modeled by the aid of the bessel function kozarov and mladenov 1981 thousands of studies on the fluid conveying shells tubes have been performed and researchers have obtained many outstanding outcomes in different aspects of the topic including stability and dynamics païdoussis et al 1984 1985 chebair et al 1990 amabili and garziera 2002 rahmanian et al 2017 nonlinear responses karagiozis et al 2007

1971 bochkarev and matveenko 2013 ning et al 2017 several comprehensive literature reviews have been published where different aspects of dynamical behaviors of shells interacting with fluid flow were recapitulated and discussed païdoussis 1998 2003 ibrahim 2010 dai et al 2016 gayen et al 2019 the functionally graded materials fgms whose properties vary smoothly and continuously though the thickness are usually composed of metal and ceramic they have been becoming a promising advanced material in many applications due to more advantages of high strength lightweight lower stress concentrations and withstanding high temperature gradient environments with the developments and applications of micro nano electronic mechanical systems m nems micro scale structures including functionally graded micro scale shells tubes interacting with flowing fluid have been a popular topic since the later 1980s stone and kim 2001 the mechanical analysis of fluid conveying pipe shell at micro scale level is one of the most important research areas which has received more attentions from researchers in recent years farajpour et al 2018a b however the existed classical continuum based theory is not suitable for formulations of micro scale structures the molecular dynamical simulations used for studying such problems create expensive computational cost hosseini hashemi et al 2016 therefore the higher order elasticity theories are adopted to capture the size dependency during the past years babaei and eslami 2020a b different types of higher order elasticity theories such as the strain gradient elasticity the surface energy theory the stress gradient theory couple stress theory the modified couple stress theory have been developed to describe size dependent behaviors of such structures the modified couple stress theory yang et al 2002 which has been proven to interpret and capture size dependent phenomena for microstructures kim et al 2019 salehipour et al 2017 is effective and simply by comparing with other modified theories by using the beam model wang and ni 2010 employed the differential quadrature method to study vibration characteristics of fluid conveying microtubes based on the modified couple stress theory they found that the critical flow velocities predicted by the modified coupled stress theory are higher than those predicted by the classical beam theory because of the small size effect where the critical flow velocity refers to the lowest flow velocity of losing stability zeighampour and beni 2014 also drawn similar conclusions ghayesh et al 2019 considered the global dynamics of fluid conveying nanotubes based on the nonlocal strain gradient model of beams moreover size effects of micro flow on vibration characteristics of such microsystem were considered by wang et al 2013 the further studies on such vibrations were extended to shells pipes composed of fgms it was found that the length scale parameter plays a considerable role in vibration frequency responses beni et al 2015 which might be modulated by the volume fraction exponent representing the content of different components in fgms deng et al 2017 based on the modified couple stress theory hu et al 2016 extended the linear analysis for fluid conveying micropipe to the nonlinear theory they also confirmed that the small length scale parameter indeed improves the stability of micropipe and chaotic vibrations could occur when one end of the micropipe was supported by a loosely medium she et al 2018 studied on the nonlinear bending and vibration behaviors of porous fgms nanotubes based on the nonlocal strain gradient theory the nonlinear stability vibrations of micropipe conveying fluid were also studied based on the modified couple stress theory and by using the beam model dehrouyeh semnani et al 2017a 2017b the principle finding of these researches is that such microsystem loses stability via the pitchfork bifurcation and creates the hardening type nonlinear resonant behavior the similar work was also performed by arani et al 2013 based on the modified coupled stress theory furthermore the effects of the viscoelastic medium and fluid viscosity on the nonlinear free vibration and instability of fluid conveying double walled boron nitride nanotubes were conducted to elucidate in addition the initial geometric imperfection and surface stress influence of a fluid conveying nanopipe made of functionally graded fg materials were taken into consideration liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 stability and dynamics of nanotubes conveying viscous fluid were also studied by means of the beam theory they found that the effect of viscosity of flowing fluid on the vibration and instability of nanotubes can be ignored wang and ni 2009 khodami maraghi et al 2013 some other studies jannesari et al 2012 liang and su 2013 showed that the fluid viscosity has a strong stabilization effect for 40 nm diameters single wall carbon nanotube swcnts conveying internal fluid but it may be ignored for sub 7nm diameters swcnts besides hydrodynamical loads the stability of micro shell is often affected by other multi loads including thermal loads electromagnetic loads based on the modified couple stress theory babaei and eslami 2020a b revealed the effects of length scale parameter porosity distribution parameter nonlinear elastic foundation temperature dependence on the thermally vibrations of fg porous micro tube arani et al 2015 reported the effect of thermal load on instability of fluid conveying functionally graded materials nanoshells they pointed out that the greater temperature difference renders such system instability at lower critical flow velocity the nonlinear thermo resonant behavior of fluid conveying fg pipes was presented dehrouyeh semnani et al 2019 while ansari et al 2016 found that for fluid conveying carbon nanotubes the temperature changes increase the threshold of critical flow velocity arani et al 2014 confirmed that the imposed magical field might control the stability of micro shell conveying fluid which was useful in design of nano micro electronic mechanical systems n mems in addition under magneto electro thermo mechanical loadings complex dynamical behaviors of fluid conveying micro shell were investigated by mohammadimehr and mehrabi 2017 and mohammadimehr and mehrabi 2018 they pointed out that the effects of temperature rise ratio of length to radius knusen number and carbon nanotubes volume fraction on the stability of tube interacting with fluid the more detailed reviews on mechanics of nanoscale and microscale structures farajpour et al 2018a b ghayesh and farajpour 2019 have been presented it is well known that the size dependence characterized by the material length scale parameter in the modified couple stress theory plays a crucial role for a micro nano system khorshidi 2018 performed a series of experiments to show that the material length scale parameter is always changing in different geometry dimensions of structures the experimental method for determining the value of material length scale parameter was given by li et al 2018 according to existed literatures dynamics and stability of microscale shells pipes tubes in axial flow have been extensively studied on the contrary dynamics and stability of micro shells subjected to an annular flow are rarely studied so far layeghi and seyf 2008 pointed out that there is a great importance for analysis of flowing fluid passage an annulus in design and utilization of microfluidic devices which have been used in many areas of engineering the typical examples are micromixers and annular microheat pipes where the flow in annulus might be turbulent because of relative higher reynolds number here to the best of the authors knowledge there is no study on the stability analysis for a micro shell conveying fluid with an axial flow velocity component and an angular flow velocity component in the annular space between the inner shell and outer shell moreover the coupling effect of fluid rotation and the material length scale parameter on the stability of micro shell cannot be elucidated up to now therefore dynamics and stability analysis for a micro shell subjected to swirling annular flow based on the modified coupled stress theory will be investigated in this paper the zero level contour method and travelling wave type displacements will be applied to solve the motion equations by the aid of the programmed software matlab to obtain critical flow velocities it will be shown that the fluid rotation effect the fluid viscosity effect the size effect on dynamical behaviors of the shell here for the first time the viscous forces induced by fluid viscosity which has been developed for macroscale shells are introduced into microscale shell motion equations 2 theoretical development in this section an ideal fluid is only considered the turbulent flow considering viscous forces will be discussed in section 3 2 1 the definition of the problem the geometry of the annulus between the two coaxially micro shells is shown in fig 1 where the two shells are composed of the same functionally graded materials the inner shell has the length l radius r i and wall thickness h i while the corresponding quantities of the outer shell are the same length l radius r o and wall thickness h o the fluid shell system with micro dimensions is defined in a cylindrical coordinate system o r θ x where the origin o is located on the left end at the middle point of the inner shell x θ and r are in the axial circumferential and radial directions respectively a helical fluid with the density ρ f flowing though the annular space between the two shells is considered incompressible and its flow velocity components in a time mean sense are denoted by the axial mean flow velocity u o and the angular mean flow velocity ω o some assumptions in this paper need to be raised 1 the shell motion is so small that the linear theory can be used 2 the annular flow is the continuum flow and the non slip condition may be imposed 3 the gap between the two shells is relative larger and thus the depletion layer effect is not considered 2 2 perturbation pressure the present flow is presumed to be irrotational and inviscid from the kelvin s theorem a flow velocity can be expressed in terms of the grade of velocity potential 1 v δφ the velocity potential φ consists of the steady state potential of the fluid φ s associated with the two mean flow velocities and the corresponding perturbation potential φ u associated with the shell motion so 2 φ φ s φ u u o x v o θ φ u in which the tangential mean velocity v o ω o r through the expressions 1 and 2 the flow velocity components are given by 3 v x u o φ u x v θ v o φ u r θ v r φ u r from the bernoulli equation the perturbation pressure can be given 4 φ u t 1 2 v 2 p ρ f p s ρ f 5 p p p in which p s p 1 2 ρ f u o 2 v o 2 p and p are the time mean pressure and the perturbation pressure associated with the shell motions respectively substituting the flow velocity components into eq 4 and through eq 5 one obtains 6 φ u t 1 2 u o 2 v o 2 2 u o φ u x v 0 φ u r θ φ u x 2 φ u r 2 φ u r θ 2 p p ρ f p s ρ f because the motions of the shell are small enough we can neglect the second order terms φ u 2 induced by the shell motions eq 6 yields 7 p ρ f φ u t v o r φ u θ u o φ u x now the perturbation potential φ u must meet the laplace equations due to small shell motions 8 δ 2 φ u 0 here the laplace operator δ 2 1 r r r r 1 r 2 2 θ 2 2 x 2 the separable type solution of the eq 8 is given 9 φ u φ r exp i λ x n θ ω t where i 2 1 λ n and ω are the order of the axial vibration model the circumferential wavenumber and the circular frequency t denotes time substituting the express 9 into the eq 8 then performing certain mathematical operations we can obtain the bessel equation 10 2 φ r r 2 1 r φ r r n 2 r 2 λ 2 φ r 0 the solution of eq 10 can be expressed by 11 φ r a i n λ r b k n λ r where i n k n are the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind of n and a b are constants to be determined the non penetration condition can be imposed into the interface between the fluid and the shell walls in other words the radial velocity of the flow must be equal to the radial velocity of the shell wall one can arrive at 12a v ri φ u r d w i d t w i t v o r w i θ u o w i x r r i 12b v ro φ u r d w o d t w o t v o r w o θ u o w o x r r o where v r is a radial fluid flow velocity d d indicates the material derivative the subscripts i o pertain to the inner shell and outer shell w is the displacement of the middle surface point of a shell along r direction inserting the eqs 9 and 11 into eq 12 we get 13a a 1 i n λ r i b 1 k n λ r i w i t v o r w i θ u o w i x 13b a 1 i n λ r o b 1 k n λ r o w o t v o r w o θ u o w o x in which a 1 a exp i λ x

expressions in eqs 16 and 17 include the flexural restoring force the centrifugal force the coriolis force the inertial force respectively and those forces might control the fluidelastic instability of such fluid shell system 2 3 functionally graded cylindrical shells the fgms shells are made from a mixture of metal and ceramic where the volume fractions of metal and ceramic is assumed to follow the sigmoid power law distribution loy et al 1999 18 v c v c z 2 z h 2 h n v m v c 1 in which n is the power law exponent presenting the metal variation along the shell thickness z presents a displacement variable of the radius direction the subscripts m c denote the aluminum and ceramic constituents respectively it should to be noted that there are other accurate methods to estimate the effective elastic parameters of composite materials one of these is the mori tanaka method which evaluates the material parameters may be more reasonable and accurate than other the sigmoid power law method due to its advantages such problem deserves further study in the future from the sigmoid power law the effective elastic modulus e poission ratio υ and the mass density ρ can be written in the

can be expressed by amabili 2008 20 u 1 u z w x v 1 v z w r θ u 3 w where u v and w are the x θ and r directions displacements of points on the middle surface of a shell respectively by expanding displacement components in the form of the travelling wave the displacements u v and w of the inner or outer shell with simply supported boundary conditions can be expressed as follows zhang et al

polynomial of the variable of dimensionless frequency setting the two fluid velocities and the model m n to be parameters for a given shell and fluid the frenquency can be determined provided that these parameters are known when the viscous forces are considered there appear to be the two possible approaches at least to obtain the relation of the frequency fluid velocity in the first approach we would necessitate the iterative solution of the navier stokes equation by numerical means to obtain the steady forces and we will obtain the relation of the frequency fluid velocity the iterative method would spend very expensive in the second approach the viscous forces would be determined separately in a time averaged sense based on the time mean navier stokes equations after obtaining the steady viscous forces and the perturbation pressure we will obtain the relation of the frequency fluid velocity by means of the so called zero level contour method the zero level contour method would be used to directly draw the close curve representing the dispersion relation of ω u o v o v o u o is given by the aid of the software package matlab from the feature points of the contour curve we can find the frequencies and the critical velocities associated with modes as shown in fig 2 to obtain the critical flow velocity and the corresponding mode the flow velocities with different modes m n are calculated by the zero level contour method based on the results we can find the lowest velocity the critical velocity associated with the mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the present method though fluid microstructure systems have emerged in many industrial applications few detailed reports on stability and dynamics of an fgms cylindrical micro shell subjected to annular flow are available in the literature therefore it is difficult to perform an exact comparison between the present results and existed results in order to test the validity and accuracy of the zero level contour method we firstly calculated the natural frequency of an fgms micro shell without fluid where the fgm shell is composed of ceramic at the inner surface and aluminum at out surface in the case the fgms shell with simply supported boundary conditions adopts the following geometric parameters and material properties l r 1 h r 0 1 r 1 nm l h e m 7 10 10 p a e c 4 27 10 11 p a υ m 0 3 υ c 0 17 ρ m 2707 kgm 3 ρ c 3100 kgm 3 ρ f 1000 kgm 3 the hydrodynamic pressure vanishes and λ c equals 1 because such shell is single vacant shell the obtained results are listed in table 1 it is clear that the present results have a good agreement with the existed results second to verify the critical velocities obtained by the present algorithm an fgms cylindrical shell can be simplified to a homogenous shell subjected to the internal flow with an axial velocity the relevant geometric and material parameters for the homogenous micro shell with simply supported conditions are as follows zhou and wang 2012 l 100 μ m r 10 μ m h 0 1 μ m e 1 44 10 11 p a υ 0 38 ρ s 1000 kgm 3 ρ f 1000 kgm 3 l 17 6 μ m the perturbation pressure exerted on the inwall of the shell by internal fluid is given by 40 p i i ρ f l m π i n λ i n λ t u o x w the entries ζ i j in the matrix ζ of the eq 38 are correspondingly rewritten as ζ 11 λ 2 1 υ 2 n 2 l 2 1 υ 4 λ 2 n 2 l 2 1 υ 4 n 4 ω 2 ζ 12 ζ 21 1 υ 2 λ n l

zhou and wang though the two different theories are summarized in table 2 we found that the maximum error is 5 91 as can be seen from the comparison the present results agree well with existed results the zero level contour method is effective furthermore the effects of size on the critical velocity are quite obvious it should to be noted that the two modes are different 3 2 dynamical stability analysis in this study we only consider the case of elastic outer and perfectly stiff inner shells the size dependent stability analysis for the outer shell subjected to an annular fluid with the axial and or circumferential velocity components will be conducted in the next calculation the shell and fluid parameters are given by l 100 μ m r o 10 μ m k r o r i r i r i 9 0901 μ m k 0 1 h h i h o

m n composed of axial and circumferential wavenumbers are set to be certain numbers and the angular velocity is given the typical result showing the variation of the dimensionless frequency against the dimensionless axial flow velocity is shown in fig 2 it is observed that the backward travelling wave crosses the zero frequency line at point b representing the loss of the system stability in the form of divergence when the forward and the backward travelling frequencies coalesce at nose point c where the point is considered to represent the coupled mode flutter instability in the system beyond the point c the dynamical post divergence behavior of the system may be further studied in the future by means of the nonlinear theory to obtain the critical flow velocity the flow velocities with combinations of different modes m n are calculated as plotted in fig 3 where we can find the critical axial flow velocity by divergence u o 0 0104 and the corresponding mode 2 1 by proceeding in an analogous manner we can obtain others critical flow velocities for example when the angular velocity component is only considered the critical annular velocity ω o 0 0126 by flutter associated with the mode 1 2 are found 3 2 1 effects of small size the material length scale parameter l in the modified couple stress theory is used to capture size effects the length scale parameter is usually not constant for different materials to reveal the effect of the material length scale parameter on critical velocities the eq 39 is solved with different l these results showing the variation of the total flow velocities with the dimensionless length scale parameter are displayed in fig 4 where we define the total flow velocity v t u o 2 v o 2 it is clear that the critical velocities undergo an increase of 0 01118 when the material length scale parameter l increases from zero to 0 022 indicating that the material length scale parameter leads to the stiffening of shell when the length radius ratio thickness radius ratio and gap ratio keep unchangeable the relative radius of micro shell r o r o r o i r o 10 changes from 1 to 100 the variation curve of the critical velocities with different relative radii is plotted in fig 5 it is observed that with increasing of the radius of micro shell the critical velocity first degrades rapidly slowly diminishes afterwards until it almost crosses the line l 0 which indicating the size effect is negligible for macro scale structures 3 2 2 effects of fluid rotation fig 6 illustrates the change of form of stability loss of the micro shell under the combined action of the axial flow velocity and angular flow velocity it is clear that the critical axial velocity by divergence decreases obviously with the increase of the rotating speed of fluid with further increasing of the angular flow velocity the form of instability of system begins to change from the fig 6 i e the compound form of divergence and flutter transforming into the single form of the couple flutter the possible physical explanations the fluid rotation effect renders the system damping bigger in quantity the fluidelastic instability of the system is controlled by the only flutter under the bigger system damping based on the solution of eq 39 we use the stepwise iterative method to obtain the dimensionless critical angular velocity 0 0014915 at the transition point where the critical axial flow by divergence becomes zero it should be pointed out that the influence of the fluid rotation on the mechanism of stability loss for micro shells is not essentially different from the instability mechanism for macro shells under the same simply supported boundary condition fig 7 further illustrates the fluid rotation effect quantificationally for the given parameters here as can be seen there is a more than 10 percent decline in the critical total fluid velocity when the ratio of the tangential velocity to the axial velocity increases about 1 5 percent it seems to be concluded that the fluid rotation lowers the stability of the system the mathematical explanation for the phenomenon is that the value of the axial vibration model λ is smaller than that of the circumferential wavenumber n for a slender shell which renders the system stability to be sensitive to the tangential velocity changes at the same time the stability boundary by way of setting a fixed value to the angular velocity component then searching for the critical value of the axial velocity component is displayed in the figure 3 2 3 couple effects of fluid rotation and small size to better evaluate the coupling effects of the fluid rotation and small size we define the new dimensionless parameter r l v l v τ which is similar to the rossby number typical results are depicted in fig 8 by the sensitivity analyses as can be seen from fig 8 the coupling effects of the fluid rotation and small size on stability behaviors of micro shell are different under different dimensionless parameters r l v when the dimensionless ratio r l v becomes bigger enough a certain increase in the fluid rotation speed do not tend to destabilize the system in other words the stability of such system is more sensitive to the material length scale parameter changes for a big enough dimensionless parameter r l v which might give us some insights into designs of microfluidic system 3 2 4 effects of material property to understand the effect of the material property on stability behaviors of shell we summarize the critical flow velocities with different volume fraction exponents n in table 3 from the table 3 we find that the critical flow velocities decrease with the increase of n where n 0 is for ceramic shell with higher stiffness compared to the fully aluminum shell for n 3 2 5 effects of fluid viscosity the flow in present subsection is an incompressible fully developed turbulent flow which can occur at lower reynolds number for microscale structures peng

supported boundary conditions i e g x sin m π x l 49 the effects of steady viscous forces on the divergence instability of macro micro shell are shown in fig 9 a b for the macro shell the values of above geometry parameters are unchangeable while they will be measured by millimeter fig 9 a shows that the critical flow velocity obtained by the viscous theory reduces about 73 percent compared with the corresponding value visa the non viscous theory in parallel the critical flow velocity for micro shell obtained by the viscous theory goes down as well 66 percent as shown in fig 9 b it may be inferred that the fluid viscosity has an immense destabilizing effect for whether the micro shell or macro shell similar to the figs 2 and 10 displays the variation of the dimensionless frequency with the dimensionless flow velocity in the version of viscous theory by way of comparisons it is found that the steady forces do not modify the general stability character of the system the steady forces however do change the critical flow velocities of the system quantitatively it is also found that the fluid rotation lowers the critical axial velocity whether or not the steady forces are taken into account consequently we may give the possible physical explanation that the pre load q 3 produced by the fluid viscosity reduces the shell stiffness thus lowering the critical flow velocity the pre load q 3 being a compressive hoop stress and a dominant factor 4 conclusions the size dependent stability of an outer cylindrical shell subjected to an annular flow with the axial and angular flow velocity components is firstly investigated in this paper where the shell is an fgms shell with metal ceramic lays an analytical model has been developed based on the modified couple stress theory by the aid of the hamilton s principle adopting the zero level contour method we obtain the travelling wave type solutions for the simply supported outer shell the calculated results have been presented in the frame of both inviscid and viscous theories here the mathematical model of steady viscous forces is first introduced to analyze the annular flow it is found that the small size effect characterized by the material length scale parameter l renders the fluid micro shell system more stable with increasing of the characteristic size the relative radius of fgms micro shell the size dependent stability behavior of fgms micro shell is not obvious as previously stated the small size effect can be negligible for normal scale shells it is found that in all cases the presence of fluid rotation tends to lower the stability of fluid shell system furthermore when the fluid rotation speed reaches a certain value it modifies the stability behavior of the system qualitatively that is the compound type of the stability loss becomes the single couple model flutter the physical reason is that for the bigger system damping the fluidelastic instability of the system is controlled by the only flutter it is deduced that the stability behavior of the system is sensitive to the fluid rotation effect in addition we introduce the new physical coefficient r l v to better assess the coupling influence of small size and fluid rotation on the stability of system for a higher value of r l v the effect of the fluid rotation on stability of the system is not important compared to the small size effect it is found that the steady forces induced by the fluid viscosity do not qualitatively change the general character of system but it has an immense destabilizing effect the pre load q 3 is a dominant factor which can be the effective mean to regulate such system stability it is important to note that when the gap is relative bigger enough the fluid viscosity play a strong destabilizing role in such system it is also found that with the increase of power law index n the critical flow velocities decrease accordingly credit authorship contribution statement wen bo ning

20992,unlike traditional rotary turbines the flapping hydrofoil energy harvesters can capture kinetic energy from flowing fluids by undergoing combined heaving and pitching motions in this paper a new type of flapping hydrofoil energy harvester whose trailing edge can deflect upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke has been proposed the energy extraction

influences of various characteristic parameters including deflection angle amplitude flap length gap width on the energy extraction efficiency of the proposed flapping hydrofoil were analyzed the present results show that the heaving force is the most dominant contributor to total power output of the flapping hydrofoil and it can be greatly increased due to the deflection of tef it is also found that there exist optimal deflection angle amplitude and tef length which can significantly improve the energy extraction efficiency at moderate to high values of reduced frequency moreover the smaller the gap width the higher the efficiency can be achieved as a result the maximum energy extraction efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil with optimized tef can be increased by approximately 23 5

gases accelerate the global energy transition to low carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power as a new method of harvesting the kinetic energy in the ocean current the flapping hydrofoil has demonstrated great potential for practical application due to its advantages over the conventional hydrokinetic turbines with rotary blades such as structural robustness low noise generation and the ability of operating effectively in relatively shallow waters young et al 2014 wu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 lahooti and kim 2019 the early concept of extracting energy from fluids by a flapping foil undergoing combined heaving and pitching motion originates from studied by wu et al wu 1972 mckinney and delaurier mckinney and delaurier 1981 first experimentally used the flapping airfoil to harvest energy from wind they found that the flapping foil could generate power with 17 efficiency and the foil heaving force dominated in the power extraction jones et al jones and platzer 1997 found that power extraction is possible if the pitching amplitude exceeds the induced angle of attack and phase angle between heave and pitch motion is near 90 based on the numerical results a 2 kw flapping foil hydrokinetic turbine was designed by kinsey et al 2011 and was then experimentally tested the result is promising that the net efficiency can reach up to 40 demonstrating the flapping hydrofoil is an excellent candidate for use in energy harvesting applications recently an increasing number of parametric studies on the power generation performance of the flapping foil were conducted by both numerical and experimental methods xiao et al 2012 lu et al 2014 zhu 2011 karbasian et al 2016 chen et al 2017 ashraf et al 2011 kinsey and dumas 2008 kim et al 2017 su et al 2019 su and breuer 2019 recently various flow control methods have been studied and developed to further enhance the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil system wu et al 2015 gerontakos and lee 2008 lee and gerontakos 2016 le et al 2013 vennell 2011 dabiri 2010 akhtar et al 2007 lehmann 2010 zhu et al 2018 xie et al 2016 and the foil feasibility has been an active area of research shyy et al 2010 the deformable wing is designed to generate higher lift or thrust by manipulating the evolution of leading edge vortex lev shoele and qiang 2013 bo and luo 2010 research liu et al 2013 has shown that the flexible structure is advantageous in improvement of energy extraction of a flapping foil by enhancing lift and resulting in a favorable adjustment of the phase difference between velocity and force however the benefits of such deformation highly depends on the development of robust and reliable sensors actuators and controllers which are combined together to facilitate the operation of a flexible flapping foil the trailing edge flaps tef are traditionally used in aircraft structures with the aim of improving their takeoff and landing aerodynamic performance and is a high efficient and easy implementation method to enhance lift lee and su 2011 troldborg 2005 recently some researchers have begun to examine the effectiveness of tef on the energy extraction performance of traditional rotary turbines xiao et al 2013 numerically studied the performance of an improved vertical axis tidal turbine using fixed and oscillating tef the results turn out that the oscillating tef offers possibility of a maximum power coefficient rise about 28 and the stall phenomenon can be suppressed yang et al 2017 conducted two dimensional cfd simulations of flow around a vertical axis wind turbine via an active tef numerical results indicate that the performance condition developed by the oscillating flap can be satisfied in a larger range the energy extraction performance of an oscillating plate with a passively actuated trailing edge was experimentally investigated by siala et al siala and liburdy 2015 it is found that an apparent increase in the power coefficient of the plate can be achieved however its optimal operation conditions could be limited like many other passive control methods in the present study we have focused on the potential of using an adaptive tef to enhance the energy extraction efficiency of a flapping hydrofoil energy harvester which has not yet been studied due to the periodic motion that flapping foil undergoes the pressure and suction sides of the foil would alternate depending on the direction of foil motion thus the proposed foil s trailing edge is designed to actively deflects upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke to increase camber thereby increasing lift the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the physical problem the mathematical model and the numerical algorithm in section 3 an investigation of effects of geometrical parameters of the tef such as deflection angle amplitudes lengths and gap widths on the hydrodynamics performance of the flapping foil energy harvester are carried out by means of cfd simulations the results obtained then are compared and analyzed hence the optimal combination of the tef parameters for the maximum efficiency enhancement is determined finally main conclusions from the study are summarized in section 4 2 problem description and numerical method 2 1 kinematics of flapping hydrofoil with tef the flapping motion can be simplified to a periodic motion combined by heaving h t and pitching θ t as shown in fig 1 fixing to a pitching axis located at position x p from the leading edge the foil undergoes the combined heave pitch motion with the following governing equations 1 h t h 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ v y t 2 π f h 0 cos 2 π f t ϕ 2 θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t ω t 2 π f θ 0 cos 2 π f t where h 0 and θ 0 are the heaving and pitching amplitudes respectively v y is the heaving velocity ω is the pitching angular velocity f is the flapping frequency and ϕ is the phase shift between two motions in the present study ϕ is kept constant at 90 the non dimensional frequency reduced frequency f is defined as f c u where c is the chord length and u is the freestream velocity far upstream of the flapping hydrofoil the instantaneous power obtained from the fluid is computed by the sum of power contributed by the heaving and pitching which are given by respectively 3 p y t y t v y t 4 p θ t m t ω t where p y is the heaving contribution to instantaneous total power p θ is the pitching contribution to instantaneous total power y is the heaving force m is the pitching moment the average overall power coefficient over one cycle can be thus computed in non dimensional form 5 c p p 1 2 ρ u 3 c where ρ is the fluid density therefore the average overall power coefficient over one cycle can be computed as the contribution of two motions which is expressed as 6 c p c p y c p θ 0 1 c y t v y t u c m t ω t c u d t t where c p y and c p θ are the average overall power coefficient contributed by heaving force and pitching moment respectively c y and c m are the heaving force coefficient and pitching moment coefficient c y t y t 0 5 ρ u 2 c and c m t m t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 the energy extraction efficiency η can be further defined as the ratio of the mean total power output p to the total power available in the area swept by the foil 7 η p p a p y p θ 1 2 ρ u 3 d c p c d where d is the overall displacement of the foil in vertical direction which is illustrated in fig 1 the schematic diagram of the plain airfoil and the foil with tef are shown in fig 2 for the tef it performs the oscillating motion by pitching at its own axis with the following specified equation where β t is the instantaneous deflection angle of the tef β 0 is the deflection angle amplitude l is the flap length w is the gap width between main foil and tef ω t is the pitching angular velocity of the tef f is consistent with the main airfoil of the flapping hydrofoil so as to always deflects upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke the patterns of flap s movement during the flapping motion of flapping hydrofoil is sketched in fig 3 obviously the tef undergoes not only the same heave pitch motion as the main foil but also an additional pitching motion caused by its own deflection so the part of output which measures the contribution of the additional pitching motion of tef we define it as c p β here should also be included 9 c p β t c m t t ω t t c u where c m t is the pitching moment coefficient caused by the tef deflection c m t t m t t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 m t t is the pitching moment caused by the flap deflection so for the case of flapping hydrofoil with tef the total power coefficient and energy extraction efficiency can be measured by following equation 10 c p c p y c p θ c p β 11 η c p c d here the c p y and c p θ are contributed by both main foil and tef while the c p β is only generated by tef 2 2 numerical methodology in this paper the two dimensional and unsteady incompressible flow field around the foil is simulated using the computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys fluent the dynamic mesh strategy is employed in an absolute reference to perform heaving and pitching motions of the flapping hydrofoil the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model is adopted and pressure velocity coupling method is based on simple segregated algorithm all spatial and time term are discretized using second order schemes and computed by double precision the default of monitor check convergence absolute criteria is set as 10 6 as is sketched in fig 4 a the computational domain contains the following two subdomains connected by an interface the inner zone is 3 chords in diameter as shown in fig 4 b an unstructured triangular mesh is adopted in the inner zone for ease of mesh generation since the control strategy of trailing edge flap is applied by dynamic mesh method and the detailed mesh around the foil is depicted in fig 4 c the outside region is a sufficiently large circular domain with diameter of 30 chords to eliminate the boundary effect bos et al 2006 a constant upstream velocity of 2 m s is set for inlet and a static gauge pressure is applied to outlet and the no slip boundary condition is applied to the flapping foil surface 2 3 sensitivity study and cfd validation to validate the simulation results a sensitivity study on cells and time steps for the plain naca0015 airfoil were carried out with liquid water as working fluid the model validation were conducted under the specific working condition of c 0 24 m x p c 3 u 2 m s re 4 7 10 5 h 0 c θ 0 75 and ϕ 90 the average energy extraction efficiency η horizontal force coefficient c x the peak heaving force coefficient c ˆ y and pitching moment coefficient c ˆ m over one flapping cycle at different reduced frequencies f 0 10 0 14 0 20 are presented in table 1 in consideration of computing time and resource required it is indicated that case of 200 000 cells with 1500 time steps per flapping cycle is sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the results which is employed in the subsequent simulations of the present study to verify the accuracy of proposed model a further validation against the existing experimental data kinsey et al 2011 and numerical results kinsey and dumas 2012 were performed before the detailed investigation which is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the two dimensional simulation result of this paper is close to the previous study and it is larger than the three dimensional results and experimental data which is due to the three dimensional effect caused by the finite length of the airfoil in conclusion it is believed that the available accuracy is acceptable and the results of the model presented is reliable 3 results and discussions in the following section effects of both motion and geometric parameters of the tef on the energy extraction performance of a flapping hydrofoil are analyzed these parameters are the deflection angle amplitudes β 0 the flap lengths l the gap widths w and the reduced frequencies f that varied in the range from 0 08 to 0 22 as shown in table 2 the numerical simulations in this section are based on the naca0015 profile with a constant reynolds number of re 4 7 10 5 heaving amplitude of h 0 c pitching amplitude of θ 0 75 and pitching axis position of x p c 1 3 3 1 effect of deflection angle amplitudes on energy extraction efficiency fig 6 shows the effect of deflection angle amplitudes β 0 on energy extraction efficiency η the corresponding parameters are l c 0 23 w c 0 030 and f within the range from 0 08 to 0 22 as shown in figure the efficiency for lower deflection angles β 0 5 10 15 shows slight difference compared with that for the larger deflections β 0 30 45 60 at the low frequencies 0 08 f 0 14 for the cases at high frequencies 0 16 f 0 22 the increasing β 0 leads to increased η when β 0 is in the range of 5 to 30 however an excessive deflection β 0 45 60 is found to be harmful to improving efficiency under such condition in order to analyze the effect of β 0 on η at high frequency the case at f 0 20 is selected and the force behavior is examined in detail below as mentioned above the total power extraction by the flapping hydrofoil with tef derives from the sum of the heaving contribution and the two types of pitching contribution see equation 10 so we check the evolution of instantaneous heaving force two types of pitching moment and their contributions for power extraction for the cases of different deflection angle amplitudes which are illustrated in fig 7 we note that the c y shows a growth trend when β 0 30 while a value of β 0 greater than 30 provides a low c y especially at t t 0 20 0 70 it is worth noting that with the greater deflection amplitude the heaving force contributes less negative power near t t 0 45 0 95 indicating that the variation of deflections has an effect on the synchronism between heaving force and heaving velocity as for the pitching motion the direction of pitching moment and angular velocity is observed to be exactly opposite over the entire flapping period which resulting a continuous negative contribution to power extraction and c p θ declines monotonously with the increase of deflection amplitudes during the first half period t t 0 to 0 25 and t t 0 50 to 0 75 and then increases for the rest of time moreover c p β illustrates the power consumption caused by the flap deflection and the results show that the consumption rises as the deflection amplitude increases however in terms of proportion c p β actually is a very few fraction when considering the whole output of the flapping hydrofoil system since a distinct difference of heaving contribution can be measured at t t 0 20 0 70 the instant of t t 0 20 is selected and the flow field is investigated in the following text a comparison of vortex and pressure distributions of three different deflection angle amplitudes β 0 10 30 60 at t t 0 20 is shown in fig 8 from the instantaneous vorticity fields we note that no significant vortex near the te is observed for the case of β 0 10 while the vortex formed near trailing surface appears at β 0 30 60 the pressure contour also serves to illustrate some apparent effects of the deflection angle amplitude on the energy extraction performance with the help of tef the pressure of fluid increases along ps pressure side and the velocity decreases simultaneously so a proper deflection angle amplitude β 0 30 benefits the increase of pressure difference around the foil and thus improves the energy extraction efficiency however two separation vortices form near the tef at the larger deflection amplitude β 0 60 which results a local negative pressure region above the foil trailing edge in particular the low pressure distribution above the foil have an adverse impact on the downward heaving force moreover the positive pressure region at β 0 60 significantly shrinks because of a large deflection angle amplitude with the above points we can infer that a too large deflection angle is adverse for the energy extraction improvement of the flapping hydrofoil meanwhile as depicted in fig 7 the greater the flap deflects the more negative pitching contribution generates thus the optimized deflection angle amplitude is β 0 30 and the largest deflection case shows the worst energy extraction performance 3 2 effect of tef length on energy extraction efficiency the effect of flap length l on the η is analyzed in this section as shown in fig 9 the simulations are carried out at β 0 15 w c 0 030 0 08 f 0 22 by varying l c from 0 13 to 0 43 from the figure we note that two peak values occur at a low frequency f 0 12 and a high frequency f 0 16 respectively at low frequencies the energy extraction efficiency slightly declines with the increase of flap length but as the frequency goes up the results show that the efficiency increases with l when l c grows to 0 33 the energy extraction efficiency gradually levels off at the most of reduced frequencies fig 10 presents the variations of instantaneous c y c m c m t c p y c p θ and c p β in a flapping cycle for different flap lengths at f 0 16 as can be seen the heaving force and two types of pitching moment all increase with the increasing flap length when l c grows to 0 38 c y and c m achieve at the same level although c m t tends to keep increasing when the flap length increases c p β counts for much less in power output because it is relatively small in addition while the heaving force of l c 0 33 is less than the case of l c 0 38 the pitching moment provides less negative contribution for the case of l c 0 33 this helps to explain why the efficiency at l c 0 33 is close to the case at l c 0 38 and 0 43 as mentioned early the positive contribution by heaving motion is generally larger than the negative pitching contribution so the heaving force basically plays the dominated role in power extraction in order to closely investigate the variation of c y it is necessary to check the flow field around the airfoil fig 11 presents the instantaneous vorticity and pressure contours for different flap lengths at t t 0 20 instant of one flapping period denoted in fig 10 it can be seen from the figure that for the case of a short length l c 0 13 a local negative region induced by a vortex forms on the ss suction side of trailing edge as the flap length increases the camber of airfoil equivalently increases consequently the vortex attaching to the flap scales down and the local negative region decreases thus the distribution of low pressure region moves downward apparently the force direction induced by such kind of pressure distribution is beneficial to enhancing heaving contribution as a result the cases of l c 0 28 and l c 0 43 generate a considerable lift augmentation at t t 0 20 3 3 effect of gap width on energy extraction efficiency in the manufacture process of flap structure the gap between main airfoil and flap may be produced inevitably besides the deflection angle amplitude and the flap length the gap width also plays a significant role in energy extraction performance of the foil to demonstrate the effect of gap width on energy extraction performance the efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil with different gap width 0 001 w c 0 060 are depicted in fig 12 the corresponding parameters are β 0 15 and l c 0 23 within a selected range of 0 08 f 0 22 as can be seen in figure the efficiencies overall go up as the gap width decreases and an optimum value of w c 0 001 is obtained for the best power extraction performance we note that a point of relatively low efficiency is obtained at f 0 14 for the cases of 0 015 w c 0 060 fig 13 presents the evolution of instantaneous heaving force two types of pitching moment and power coefficient under different gap width at f 0 14 it can be seen from the figure that with decreasing w the peak heaving force increases and the two pitching moments decrease which are all beneficial to energy extraction enhancement the instantaneous heaving force reaches the maximum at t t 0 20 0 70 for all cases and the case of w c 0 001 presents a significantly high heaving force compared with others to demonstrated the effect of gap width on energy extraction efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil the instantaneous vorticity and pressure distributions for w c 0 001 0 030 0 060 are presented in fig 14 to check the flow field near the flapping hydrofoil for the case of w c 0 001 we note that the fluid along the upper and lower side can hardly mix with each other for the case of w c 0 030 0 060 the average angle between the direction of fluid outflow and the suction side of the flap also increases and the disturbance to the boundary layer increases leading to a large change in the flow field it can be seen that through the gap the high energy flux flows from ps to ss and with the increasing w the inflows get increased which resulting a weaken heaving force 3 4 energy extraction performance of flapping hydrofoil with optimized tef the variation of energy extraction efficiency η versus reduced frequency f for the flapping hydrofoil with a plain airfoil and an optimized tef β 0 30 l c 0 33 w c 0 001 is depicted in fig 15 as can be seen from the diagram the η for both plain airfoil and tef increase sharply at first and then reach equilibrium later with the increase of f however the efficiency of the tef shows a better performance than the plain airfoil especially at high f overall by utilizing the tef an increases of up to 10 9 at f 0 14 and a 23 5 increase at f 0 20 in efficiency can be observed consequently these two values of f will be analyzed as feature points in the following section as mentioned above the contribution of c p β to total power extraction is very few and the influence of tef on energy consumption actually is more obvious on c p θ so in this section c m t and c p β will not be further discussed to investigate the mechanism of energy extraction behavior of the airfoil with the tef we examined the individual contributions from the heaving motion and the pitching motion fig 16 shows the variations of the instantaneous c y c m c p y and c p θ over a flapping period as shown for a frequency f 0 14 the heaving forces of both plain airfoil and tef correspond well with the direction of the heaving velocity which leading to positive power extraction over most of the periodic cycle from the perspective of pitching moment we note that the it is not consistent with the pitching angular velocity as a result the pitching moment mostly gives negative contribution to power extraction by utilizing the tef an overall enhancement in heaving force can be measured and the differences are sensibly significant at t t 0 20 0 70 nevertheless the flap substantially leads to an increments in pitching moment within the range of time near around of t t 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 while the negative work caused by the pitching moment is weakened for the other occasions in order to better understand the energy extraction improvement mechanisms of the tef it is necessary to check the flow structure around the flapping hydrofoil fig 17 depicts the instantaneous vorticity and pressure contours of the flapping hydrofoil with and without tef at several time steps when f 0 14 as shown in figure at instantaneous time t t 0 10 the vortex forms near the leading edge and moves down towards the trailing edge along the airfoil surface the vortex gradually grows up and eventually sheds into wake during this downstroke motion a notable peak value of heaving velocity occurs at t t 0 25 thus resulting a maximum heaving contribution to the instantaneous total power the addition of tef blocks the fluid on the ps and a vortex can be apparently observed near the te generating a local negative pressure distribution as a result the pressure difference between ps and ss enlarges and the velocity circulation around the foil increases as well hence producing a much higher heaving force after the foil reached its lowest heaving position it begins to move upward from the horizontal position in this case the lev moves backward along the airfoil surface inducing a negative pressure distribution near the te as shown at t t 0 55 which is benign for the clockwise pitching movement therefore much more positive pitching contribution can be made however the addition of the tef has an unexpected effect on the evolution of vortex and changes the pressure distribution near the trailing edge which weakens the ability to produce positive pitching moment power at this moment to check the results above we also present the pressure coefficient distribution along the surface of two types airfoil at t t 0 25 as depicted in fig 18 apparently it is indicated that an increased heaving force is obtained for the flapping hydrofoil with a tef and for the flap part an obvious separation vortex appears below the flap resulting in the development of a local low pressure region in fig 17 moreover another vortex is observed in the slot and thus a low pressure distribution forms since the instantaneous pitching angle of the flap exceed 90 the pressure distribution around the tef dramatically changes in the horizontal direction due to the slot which is illustrated by the descent near x x min x max x min 0 75 in fig 18 fig 19 shows the evolution of the instantaneous c y c m c p y and c p θ over one periodic cycle at f 0 20 under this condition the well synchronized performance of the heaving force and the heaving velocity generate a positive contribution to power over most of the periodic cycle however we note that the slight negative contribution by heaving motion is generated at t t 0 45 0 95 which indicates that the synchronization between the heaving force and the velocity is specially sensitive to the frequency on the other hand the instantaneous evolution of c p θ implies poor synchronization between m and ω resulting a considerable negative contribution over most of a cycle overall the power extraction shows a quite high efficiency because the value of heaving contribution is much greater than the pitching contribution which suggests the heaving force substantially plays a dominant role in power extraction similarly the heaving force is immensely improved over almost the entire cycle with the use of tef the results show considerable enhancements of more than 1 in c p y can be measured at the instant of t t 0 25 0 75 which is probably due to the better synchronization between motion and force is achieved by the use of tef on the other side notable peak values of c m occur at t t 0 1 0 6 with addition of the tef resulting more negative pitching contribution to instantaneous total power the difference of instantaneous heaving force and pitching moment obtained by two types of flapping hydrofoil can be illustrated with the help of fig 20 unlike the case of f 0 14 only a slight lev can be measured at the early stage of downstroke motion when f 0 20 this type of vortex which is always attached on the airfoil surface is favorable to constantly generate a high lift as can be clearly seen from the local pressure distribution at t t 0 10 subsequently the lev is observed to steadily attached on the foil surface at t t 0 25 providing a high heaving force which is similar to the case of low frequency however both the extent and intensity of pressure distribution are well above the condition in the case at f 0 14 combined with the increased velocity the heaving force can hence make a greater positive contribution during the whole downstroke at high frequency adding a tef to the ps increases the effect foil camber which leads to a decrease in velocity along the ps and an increase along the ss that is to say the pressure difference between ps and ss enlarges thus improving the heaving contribution for the case of at t t 0 55 we note that the vortex on the lower surface moves towards te along the surface with no apparent separation which is quite different from the evolution pattern of lev at lower frequency as shown in the instantaneous variations of c y and c p y although this sort of vortex which steadily attaches to the foil surface is proved to be favorable for lift augmentation the heaving contribution is actually very slight because the heaving velocity is near zero under this condition from the perspective of pressure contours the distribution of pressure difference at trailing edge generate a pitching moment which is actually opposite to the pitching angular velocity ω in direction therefore a peak value of pitching contribution occurs as ω reaches its maximum at this moment particularly compared to the case of plain airfoil the installation of the tef significantly increases the intensity of vorticity and pressure which correspondingly results an increment in pitching contribution at the same time fig 21 demonstrates the pressure coefficient distribution around the foil surface at t t 0 25 similar to the case of f 0 14 the vast majority of heaving force enhancement for the tef case is due to the larger pressure difference around the foil surfacey moreover a much higher negative pressure distribution along the entire lower surface is measured in this condition as a result the utilization of the tef generates much more heaving contribution in this condition in conclusion the heaving contribution primarily govern the energy extraction performance at f 0 14 0 20 the installation of tef has a favorable effect on increasing pressure difference around the foil surface which correspondingly improves the heaving contribution over most of the cycle period however the pitching moment keep increasing until the foil meets pitching amplitude t t 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 and then goes down later consequently the effect of the tef on efficiency enhancement of the flapping hydrofoil mainly embodies during the process after the foil meets pitching amplitude moreover as the heaving velocity becomes higher under this operating condition the foil with tef thus can achieve a better energy extraction performance at high frequencies 4 conclusions a novel flapping hydrofoil energy harvester with trailing edge flap which can be gradually deflected upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke was proposed in this paper and its energy extraction performance was analyzed with the help of cfd simulation the main findings of the current study may be summarized as follows 1 the present results indicate that the efficiency enhancement of the flapping hydrofoil with the tef is mainly attributed to the increase of peak heaving force and the improved temporal synchronization between foil kinematics and force production as a result more energy can be harvested from the wind or water current in addition an increase in effective camber due to the tef can lead to an increase in a greater pressure difference between the two sides of the foil resulting in a significant lift increase in this study a good combination of tef parameters namely β 0 30 l c 0 33 and w c 0 001 for optimum performance of the flapping hydrofoil energy harvester has been identified in general the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil with the optimized tef is greatly improved as compared to the conventional flapping hydrofoil energy harvester and a maximum increase of about 23 5 is achieved when the reduced frequency f 0 20 2 it is found that the energy extraction efficiency of the proposed flapping hydrofoil with tef initially increases to a maximum value and then decreases with increasing the deflection angle of tef the optimal deflection angle β 0 of tef causing largest gain in lift is 30 3 the effect of tef length l on the energy extraction efficiency η is most apparent at medium and high frequencies the energy extraction efficiency η of the flapping hydrofoil with tef increases with the increase of tef length at first and reaches a maximum at l c 0 33 beyond which further increase in l no longer improves the η 4 the gap width between the tef and the airfoil main body is proven to be responsible for causing a decrease in the pressure difference across the airfoil although a small gap width conduces to a higher heaving force it simultaneously induces a reduction in the pitching moment as well overall the results from the present study indicate that the optimal ratio of gap width to chord length w c is 0 001 at which the energy extraction efficiency of the proposed flapping hydrofoil can be increased apparently over the entire frequency range studied the proposed flapping hydrofoil energy harvester can achieve a relatively higher net power efficiency compared to its conventional counterpart and thus show great promise of practical application the results of the present study provide basic information for developing a scaled model to be experimentally tested in the next stage of the study as future works specific quantitative analysis will be performed by using optimization techniques such as genetic algorithm or orthogonal array design to optimize the flapping foil with tef considering multiple factors and further validations will also be carried out by using high resolution 3d numerical simulations more detailed flow information and vortex structures around the proposed flapping hydrofoil with tef could then be revealed so as to gain a deep understanding of the physical mechanism behind lift enhancement by trailing edge flap credit authorship contribution statement daming

20992,unlike traditional rotary turbines the flapping hydrofoil energy harvesters can capture kinetic energy from flowing fluids by undergoing combined heaving and pitching motions in this paper a new type of flapping hydrofoil energy harvester whose trailing edge can deflect upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke has been proposed the energy extraction

influences of various characteristic parameters including deflection angle amplitude flap length gap width on the energy extraction efficiency of the proposed flapping hydrofoil were analyzed the present results show that the heaving force is the most dominant contributor to total power output of the flapping hydrofoil and it can be greatly increased due to the deflection of tef it is also found that there exist optimal deflection angle amplitude and tef length which can significantly improve the energy extraction efficiency at moderate to high values of reduced frequency moreover the smaller the gap width the higher the efficiency can be achieved as a result the maximum energy extraction efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil with optimized tef can be increased by approximately 23 5

gases accelerate the global energy transition to low carbon renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power as a new method of harvesting the kinetic energy in the ocean current the flapping hydrofoil has demonstrated great potential for practical application due to its advantages over the conventional hydrokinetic turbines with rotary blades such as structural robustness low noise generation and the ability of operating effectively in relatively shallow waters young et al 2014 wu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 lahooti and kim 2019 the early concept of extracting energy from fluids by a flapping foil undergoing combined heaving and pitching motion originates from studied by wu et al wu 1972 mckinney and delaurier mckinney and delaurier 1981 first experimentally used the flapping airfoil to harvest energy from wind they found that the flapping foil could generate power with 17 efficiency and the foil heaving force dominated in the power extraction jones et al jones and platzer 1997 found that power extraction is possible if the pitching amplitude exceeds the induced angle of attack and phase angle between heave and pitch motion is near 90 based on the numerical results a 2 kw flapping foil hydrokinetic turbine was designed by kinsey et al 2011 and was then experimentally tested the result is promising that the net efficiency can reach up to 40 demonstrating the flapping hydrofoil is an excellent candidate for use in energy harvesting applications recently an increasing number of parametric studies on the power generation performance of the flapping foil were conducted by both numerical and experimental methods xiao et al 2012 lu et al 2014 zhu 2011 karbasian et al 2016 chen et al 2017 ashraf et al 2011 kinsey and dumas 2008 kim et al 2017 su et al 2019 su and breuer 2019 recently various flow control methods have been studied and developed to further enhance the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping airfoil system wu et al 2015 gerontakos and lee 2008 lee and gerontakos 2016 le et al 2013 vennell 2011 dabiri 2010 akhtar et al 2007 lehmann 2010 zhu et al 2018 xie et al 2016 and the foil feasibility has been an active area of research shyy et al 2010 the deformable wing is designed to generate higher lift or thrust by manipulating the evolution of leading edge vortex lev shoele and qiang 2013 bo and luo 2010 research liu et al 2013 has shown that the flexible structure is advantageous in improvement of energy extraction of a flapping foil by enhancing lift and resulting in a favorable adjustment of the phase difference between velocity and force however the benefits of such deformation highly depends on the development of robust and reliable sensors actuators and controllers which are combined together to facilitate the operation of a flexible flapping foil the trailing edge flaps tef are traditionally used in aircraft structures with the aim of improving their takeoff and landing aerodynamic performance and is a high efficient and easy implementation method to enhance lift lee and su 2011 troldborg 2005 recently some researchers have begun to examine the effectiveness of tef on the energy extraction performance of traditional rotary turbines xiao et al 2013 numerically studied the performance of an improved vertical axis tidal turbine using fixed and oscillating tef the results turn out that the oscillating tef offers possibility of a maximum power coefficient rise about 28 and the stall phenomenon can be suppressed yang et al 2017 conducted two dimensional cfd simulations of flow around a vertical axis wind turbine via an active tef numerical results indicate that the performance condition developed by the oscillating flap can be satisfied in a larger range the energy extraction performance of an oscillating plate with a passively actuated trailing edge was experimentally investigated by siala et al siala and liburdy 2015 it is found that an apparent increase in the power coefficient of the plate can be achieved however its optimal operation conditions could be limited like many other passive control methods in the present study we have focused on the potential of using an adaptive tef to enhance the energy extraction efficiency of a flapping hydrofoil energy harvester which has not yet been studied due to the periodic motion that flapping foil undergoes the pressure and suction sides of the foil would alternate depending on the direction of foil motion thus the proposed foil s trailing edge is designed to actively deflects upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke to increase camber thereby increasing lift the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the physical problem the mathematical model and the numerical algorithm in section 3 an investigation of effects of geometrical parameters of the tef such as deflection angle amplitudes lengths and gap widths on the hydrodynamics performance of the flapping foil energy harvester are carried out by means of cfd simulations the results obtained then are compared and analyzed hence the optimal combination of the tef parameters for the maximum efficiency enhancement is determined finally main conclusions from the study are summarized in section 4 2 problem description and numerical method 2 1 kinematics of flapping hydrofoil with tef the flapping motion can be simplified to a periodic motion combined by heaving h t and pitching θ t as shown in fig 1 fixing to a pitching axis located at position x p from the leading edge the foil undergoes the combined heave pitch motion with the following governing equations 1 h t h 0 sin 2 π f t ϕ v y t 2 π f h 0 cos 2 π f t ϕ 2 θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t ω t 2 π f θ 0 cos 2 π f t where h 0 and θ 0 are the heaving and pitching amplitudes respectively v y is the heaving velocity ω is the pitching angular velocity f is the flapping frequency and ϕ is the phase shift between two motions in the present study ϕ is kept constant at 90 the non dimensional frequency reduced frequency f is defined as f c u where c is the chord length and u is the freestream velocity far upstream of the flapping hydrofoil the instantaneous power obtained from the fluid is computed by the sum of power contributed by the heaving and pitching which are given by respectively 3 p y t y t v y t 4 p θ t m t ω t where p y is the heaving contribution to instantaneous total power p θ is the pitching contribution to instantaneous total power y is the heaving force m is the pitching moment the average overall power coefficient over one cycle can be thus computed in non dimensional form 5 c p p 1 2 ρ u 3 c where ρ is the fluid density therefore the average overall power coefficient over one cycle can be computed as the contribution of two motions which is expressed as 6 c p c p y c p θ 0 1 c y t v y t u c m t ω t c u d t t where c p y and c p θ are the average overall power coefficient contributed by heaving force and pitching moment respectively c y and c m are the heaving force coefficient and pitching moment coefficient c y t y t 0 5 ρ u 2 c and c m t m t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 the energy extraction efficiency η can be further defined as the ratio of the mean total power output p to the total power available in the area swept by the foil 7 η p p a p y p θ 1 2 ρ u 3 d c p c d where d is the overall displacement of the foil in vertical direction which is illustrated in fig 1 the schematic diagram of the plain airfoil and the foil with tef are shown in fig 2 for the tef it performs the oscillating motion by pitching at its own axis with the following specified equation where β t is the instantaneous deflection angle of the tef β 0 is the deflection angle amplitude l is the flap length w is the gap width between main foil and tef ω t is the pitching angular velocity of the tef f is consistent with the main airfoil of the flapping hydrofoil so as to always deflects upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke the patterns of flap s movement during the flapping motion of flapping hydrofoil is sketched in fig 3 obviously the tef undergoes not only the same heave pitch motion as the main foil but also an additional pitching motion caused by its own deflection so the part of output which measures the contribution of the additional pitching motion of tef we define it as c p β here should also be included 9 c p β t c m t t ω t t c u where c m t is the pitching moment coefficient caused by the tef deflection c m t t m t t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 m t t is the pitching moment caused by the flap deflection so for the case of flapping hydrofoil with tef the total power coefficient and energy extraction efficiency can be measured by following equation 10 c p c p y c p θ c p β 11 η c p c d here the c p y and c p θ are contributed by both main foil and tef while the c p β is only generated by tef 2 2 numerical methodology in this paper the two dimensional and unsteady incompressible flow field around the foil is simulated using the computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys fluent the dynamic mesh strategy is employed in an absolute reference to perform heaving and pitching motions of the flapping hydrofoil the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model is adopted and pressure velocity coupling method is based on simple segregated algorithm all spatial and time term are discretized using second order schemes and computed by double precision the default of monitor check convergence absolute criteria is set as 10 6 as is sketched in fig 4 a the computational domain contains the following two subdomains connected by an interface the inner zone is 3 chords in diameter as shown in fig 4 b an unstructured triangular mesh is adopted in the inner zone for ease of mesh generation since the control strategy of trailing edge flap is applied by dynamic mesh method and the detailed mesh around the foil is depicted in fig 4 c the outside region is a sufficiently large circular domain with diameter of 30 chords to eliminate the boundary effect bos et al 2006 a constant upstream velocity of 2 m s is set for inlet and a static gauge pressure is applied to outlet and the no slip boundary condition is applied to the flapping foil surface 2 3 sensitivity study and cfd validation to validate the simulation results a sensitivity study on cells and time steps for the plain naca0015 airfoil were carried out with liquid water as working fluid the model validation were conducted under the specific working condition of c 0 24 m x p c 3 u 2 m s re 4 7 10 5 h 0 c θ 0 75 and ϕ 90 the average energy extraction efficiency η horizontal force coefficient c x the peak heaving force coefficient c ˆ y and pitching moment coefficient c ˆ m over one flapping cycle at different reduced frequencies f 0 10 0 14 0 20 are presented in table 1 in consideration of computing time and resource required it is indicated that case of 200 000 cells with 1500 time steps per flapping cycle is sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the results which is employed in the subsequent simulations of the present study to verify the accuracy of proposed model a further validation against the existing experimental data kinsey et al 2011 and numerical results kinsey and dumas 2012 were performed before the detailed investigation which is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the two dimensional simulation result of this paper is close to the previous study and it is larger than the three dimensional results and experimental data which is due to the three dimensional effect caused by the finite length of the airfoil in conclusion it is believed that the available accuracy is acceptable and the results of the model presented is reliable 3 results and discussions in the following section effects of both motion and geometric parameters of the tef on the energy extraction performance of a flapping hydrofoil are analyzed these parameters are the deflection angle amplitudes β 0 the flap lengths l the gap widths w and the reduced frequencies f that varied in the range from 0 08 to 0 22 as shown in table 2 the numerical simulations in this section are based on the naca0015 profile with a constant reynolds number of re 4 7 10 5 heaving amplitude of h 0 c pitching amplitude of θ 0 75 and pitching axis position of x p c 1 3 3 1 effect of deflection angle amplitudes on energy extraction efficiency fig 6 shows the effect of deflection angle amplitudes β 0 on energy extraction efficiency η the corresponding parameters are l c 0 23 w c 0 030 and f within the range from 0 08 to 0 22 as shown in figure the efficiency for lower deflection angles β 0 5 10 15 shows slight difference compared with that for the larger deflections β 0 30 45 60 at the low frequencies 0 08 f 0 14 for the cases at high frequencies 0 16 f 0 22 the increasing β 0 leads to increased η when β 0 is in the range of 5 to 30 however an excessive deflection β 0 45 60 is found to be harmful to improving efficiency under such condition in order to analyze the effect of β 0 on η at high frequency the case at f 0 20 is selected and the force behavior is examined in detail below as mentioned above the total power extraction by the flapping hydrofoil with tef derives from the sum of the heaving contribution and the two types of pitching contribution see equation 10 so we check the evolution of instantaneous heaving force two types of pitching moment and their contributions for power extraction for the cases of different deflection angle amplitudes which are illustrated in fig 7 we note that the c y shows a growth trend when β 0 30 while a value of β 0 greater than 30 provides a low c y especially at t t 0 20 0 70 it is worth noting that with the greater deflection amplitude the heaving force contributes less negative power near t t 0 45 0 95 indicating that the variation of deflections has an effect on the synchronism between heaving force and heaving velocity as for the pitching motion the direction of pitching moment and angular velocity is observed to be exactly opposite over the entire flapping period which resulting a continuous negative contribution to power extraction and c p θ declines monotonously with the increase of deflection amplitudes during the first half period t t 0 to 0 25 and t t 0 50 to 0 75 and then increases for the rest of time moreover c p β illustrates the power consumption caused by the flap deflection and the results show that the consumption rises as the deflection amplitude increases however in terms of proportion c p β actually is a very few fraction when considering the whole output of the flapping hydrofoil system since a distinct difference of heaving contribution can be measured at t t 0 20 0 70 the instant of t t 0 20 is selected and the flow field is investigated in the following text a comparison of vortex and pressure distributions of three different deflection angle amplitudes β 0 10 30 60 at t t 0 20 is shown in fig 8 from the instantaneous vorticity fields we note that no significant vortex near the te is observed for the case of β 0 10 while the vortex formed near trailing surface appears at β 0 30 60 the pressure contour also serves to illustrate some apparent effects of the deflection angle amplitude on the energy extraction performance with the help of tef the pressure of fluid increases along ps pressure side and the velocity decreases simultaneously so a proper deflection angle amplitude β 0 30 benefits the increase of pressure difference around the foil and thus improves the energy extraction efficiency however two separation vortices form near the tef at the larger deflection amplitude β 0 60 which results a local negative pressure region above the foil trailing edge in particular the low pressure distribution above the foil have an adverse impact on the downward heaving force moreover the positive pressure region at β 0 60 significantly shrinks because of a large deflection angle amplitude with the above points we can infer that a too large deflection angle is adverse for the energy extraction improvement of the flapping hydrofoil meanwhile as depicted in fig 7 the greater the flap deflects the more negative pitching contribution generates thus the optimized deflection angle amplitude is β 0 30 and the largest deflection case shows the worst energy extraction performance 3 2 effect of tef length on energy extraction efficiency the effect of flap length l on the η is analyzed in this section as shown in fig 9 the simulations are carried out at β 0 15 w c 0 030 0 08 f 0 22 by varying l c from 0 13 to 0 43 from the figure we note that two peak values occur at a low frequency f 0 12 and a high frequency f 0 16 respectively at low frequencies the energy extraction efficiency slightly declines with the increase of flap length but as the frequency goes up the results show that the efficiency increases with l when l c grows to 0 33 the energy extraction efficiency gradually levels off at the most of reduced frequencies fig 10 presents the variations of instantaneous c y c m c m t c p y c p θ and c p β in a flapping cycle for different flap lengths at f 0 16 as can be seen the heaving force and two types of pitching moment all increase with the increasing flap length when l c grows to 0 38 c y and c m achieve at the same level although c m t tends to keep increasing when the flap length increases c p β counts for much less in power output because it is relatively small in addition while the heaving force of l c 0 33 is less than the case of l c 0 38 the pitching moment provides less negative contribution for the case of l c 0 33 this helps to explain why the efficiency at l c 0 33 is close to the case at l c 0 38 and 0 43 as mentioned early the positive contribution by heaving motion is generally larger than the negative pitching contribution so the heaving force basically plays the dominated role in power extraction in order to closely investigate the variation of c y it is necessary to check the flow field around the airfoil fig 11 presents the instantaneous vorticity and pressure contours for different flap lengths at t t 0 20 instant of one flapping period denoted in fig 10 it can be seen from the figure that for the case of a short length l c 0 13 a local negative region induced by a vortex forms on the ss suction side of trailing edge as the flap length increases the camber of airfoil equivalently increases consequently the vortex attaching to the flap scales down and the local negative region decreases thus the distribution of low pressure region moves downward apparently the force direction induced by such kind of pressure distribution is beneficial to enhancing heaving contribution as a result the cases of l c 0 28 and l c 0 43 generate a considerable lift augmentation at t t 0 20 3 3 effect of gap width on energy extraction efficiency in the manufacture process of flap structure the gap between main airfoil and flap may be produced inevitably besides the deflection angle amplitude and the flap length the gap width also plays a significant role in energy extraction performance of the foil to demonstrate the effect of gap width on energy extraction performance the efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil with different gap width 0 001 w c 0 060 are depicted in fig 12 the corresponding parameters are β 0 15 and l c 0 23 within a selected range of 0 08 f 0 22 as can be seen in figure the efficiencies overall go up as the gap width decreases and an optimum value of w c 0 001 is obtained for the best power extraction performance we note that a point of relatively low efficiency is obtained at f 0 14 for the cases of 0 015 w c 0 060 fig 13 presents the evolution of instantaneous heaving force two types of pitching moment and power coefficient under different gap width at f 0 14 it can be seen from the figure that with decreasing w the peak heaving force increases and the two pitching moments decrease which are all beneficial to energy extraction enhancement the instantaneous heaving force reaches the maximum at t t 0 20 0 70 for all cases and the case of w c 0 001 presents a significantly high heaving force compared with others to demonstrated the effect of gap width on energy extraction efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil the instantaneous vorticity and pressure distributions for w c 0 001 0 030 0 060 are presented in fig 14 to check the flow field near the flapping hydrofoil for the case of w c 0 001 we note that the fluid along the upper and lower side can hardly mix with each other for the case of w c 0 030 0 060 the average angle between the direction of fluid outflow and the suction side of the flap also increases and the disturbance to the boundary layer increases leading to a large change in the flow field it can be seen that through the gap the high energy flux flows from ps to ss and with the increasing w the inflows get increased which resulting a weaken heaving force 3 4 energy extraction performance of flapping hydrofoil with optimized tef the variation of energy extraction efficiency η versus reduced frequency f for the flapping hydrofoil with a plain airfoil and an optimized tef β 0 30 l c 0 33 w c 0 001 is depicted in fig 15 as can be seen from the diagram the η for both plain airfoil and tef increase sharply at first and then reach equilibrium later with the increase of f however the efficiency of the tef shows a better performance than the plain airfoil especially at high f overall by utilizing the tef an increases of up to 10 9 at f 0 14 and a 23 5 increase at f 0 20 in efficiency can be observed consequently these two values of f will be analyzed as feature points in the following section as mentioned above the contribution of c p β to total power extraction is very few and the influence of tef on energy consumption actually is more obvious on c p θ so in this section c m t and c p β will not be further discussed to investigate the mechanism of energy extraction behavior of the airfoil with the tef we examined the individual contributions from the heaving motion and the pitching motion fig 16 shows the variations of the instantaneous c y c m c p y and c p θ over a flapping period as shown for a frequency f 0 14 the heaving forces of both plain airfoil and tef correspond well with the direction of the heaving velocity which leading to positive power extraction over most of the periodic cycle from the perspective of pitching moment we note that the it is not consistent with the pitching angular velocity as a result the pitching moment mostly gives negative contribution to power extraction by utilizing the tef an overall enhancement in heaving force can be measured and the differences are sensibly significant at t t 0 20 0 70 nevertheless the flap substantially leads to an increments in pitching moment within the range of time near around of t t 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 while the negative work caused by the pitching moment is weakened for the other occasions in order to better understand the energy extraction improvement mechanisms of the tef it is necessary to check the flow structure around the flapping hydrofoil fig 17 depicts the instantaneous vorticity and pressure contours of the flapping hydrofoil with and without tef at several time steps when f 0 14 as shown in figure at instantaneous time t t 0 10 the vortex forms near the leading edge and moves down towards the trailing edge along the airfoil surface the vortex gradually grows up and eventually sheds into wake during this downstroke motion a notable peak value of heaving velocity occurs at t t 0 25 thus resulting a maximum heaving contribution to the instantaneous total power the addition of tef blocks the fluid on the ps and a vortex can be apparently observed near the te generating a local negative pressure distribution as a result the pressure difference between ps and ss enlarges and the velocity circulation around the foil increases as well hence producing a much higher heaving force after the foil reached its lowest heaving position it begins to move upward from the horizontal position in this case the lev moves backward along the airfoil surface inducing a negative pressure distribution near the te as shown at t t 0 55 which is benign for the clockwise pitching movement therefore much more positive pitching contribution can be made however the addition of the tef has an unexpected effect on the evolution of vortex and changes the pressure distribution near the trailing edge which weakens the ability to produce positive pitching moment power at this moment to check the results above we also present the pressure coefficient distribution along the surface of two types airfoil at t t 0 25 as depicted in fig 18 apparently it is indicated that an increased heaving force is obtained for the flapping hydrofoil with a tef and for the flap part an obvious separation vortex appears below the flap resulting in the development of a local low pressure region in fig 17 moreover another vortex is observed in the slot and thus a low pressure distribution forms since the instantaneous pitching angle of the flap exceed 90 the pressure distribution around the tef dramatically changes in the horizontal direction due to the slot which is illustrated by the descent near x x min x max x min 0 75 in fig 18 fig 19 shows the evolution of the instantaneous c y c m c p y and c p θ over one periodic cycle at f 0 20 under this condition the well synchronized performance of the heaving force and the heaving velocity generate a positive contribution to power over most of the periodic cycle however we note that the slight negative contribution by heaving motion is generated at t t 0 45 0 95 which indicates that the synchronization between the heaving force and the velocity is specially sensitive to the frequency on the other hand the instantaneous evolution of c p θ implies poor synchronization between m and ω resulting a considerable negative contribution over most of a cycle overall the power extraction shows a quite high efficiency because the value of heaving contribution is much greater than the pitching contribution which suggests the heaving force substantially plays a dominant role in power extraction similarly the heaving force is immensely improved over almost the entire cycle with the use of tef the results show considerable enhancements of more than 1 in c p y can be measured at the instant of t t 0 25 0 75 which is probably due to the better synchronization between motion and force is achieved by the use of tef on the other side notable peak values of c m occur at t t 0 1 0 6 with addition of the tef resulting more negative pitching contribution to instantaneous total power the difference of instantaneous heaving force and pitching moment obtained by two types of flapping hydrofoil can be illustrated with the help of fig 20 unlike the case of f 0 14 only a slight lev can be measured at the early stage of downstroke motion when f 0 20 this type of vortex which is always attached on the airfoil surface is favorable to constantly generate a high lift as can be clearly seen from the local pressure distribution at t t 0 10 subsequently the lev is observed to steadily attached on the foil surface at t t 0 25 providing a high heaving force which is similar to the case of low frequency however both the extent and intensity of pressure distribution are well above the condition in the case at f 0 14 combined with the increased velocity the heaving force can hence make a greater positive contribution during the whole downstroke at high frequency adding a tef to the ps increases the effect foil camber which leads to a decrease in velocity along the ps and an increase along the ss that is to say the pressure difference between ps and ss enlarges thus improving the heaving contribution for the case of at t t 0 55 we note that the vortex on the lower surface moves towards te along the surface with no apparent separation which is quite different from the evolution pattern of lev at lower frequency as shown in the instantaneous variations of c y and c p y although this sort of vortex which steadily attaches to the foil surface is proved to be favorable for lift augmentation the heaving contribution is actually very slight because the heaving velocity is near zero under this condition from the perspective of pressure contours the distribution of pressure difference at trailing edge generate a pitching moment which is actually opposite to the pitching angular velocity ω in direction therefore a peak value of pitching contribution occurs as ω reaches its maximum at this moment particularly compared to the case of plain airfoil the installation of the tef significantly increases the intensity of vorticity and pressure which correspondingly results an increment in pitching contribution at the same time fig 21 demonstrates the pressure coefficient distribution around the foil surface at t t 0 25 similar to the case of f 0 14 the vast majority of heaving force enhancement for the tef case is due to the larger pressure difference around the foil surfacey moreover a much higher negative pressure distribution along the entire lower surface is measured in this condition as a result the utilization of the tef generates much more heaving contribution in this condition in conclusion the heaving contribution primarily govern the energy extraction performance at f 0 14 0 20 the installation of tef has a favorable effect on increasing pressure difference around the foil surface which correspondingly improves the heaving contribution over most of the cycle period however the pitching moment keep increasing until the foil meets pitching amplitude t t 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 and then goes down later consequently the effect of the tef on efficiency enhancement of the flapping hydrofoil mainly embodies during the process after the foil meets pitching amplitude moreover as the heaving velocity becomes higher under this operating condition the foil with tef thus can achieve a better energy extraction performance at high frequencies 4 conclusions a novel flapping hydrofoil energy harvester with trailing edge flap which can be gradually deflected upwards during downstroke flapping cycle and downwards during the upstroke was proposed in this paper and its energy extraction performance was analyzed with the help of cfd simulation the main findings of the current study may be summarized as follows 1 the present results indicate that the efficiency enhancement of the flapping hydrofoil with the tef is mainly attributed to the increase of peak heaving force and the improved temporal synchronization between foil kinematics and force production as a result more energy can be harvested from the wind or water current in addition an increase in effective camber due to the tef can lead to an increase in a greater pressure difference between the two sides of the foil resulting in a significant lift increase in this study a good combination of tef parameters namely β 0 30 l c 0 33 and w c 0 001 for optimum performance of the flapping hydrofoil energy harvester has been identified in general the energy extraction efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil with the optimized tef is greatly improved as compared to the conventional flapping hydrofoil energy harvester and a maximum increase of about 23 5 is achieved when the reduced frequency f 0 20 2 it is found that the energy extraction efficiency of the proposed flapping hydrofoil with tef initially increases to a maximum value and then decreases with increasing the deflection angle of tef the optimal deflection angle β 0 of tef causing largest gain in lift is 30 3 the effect of tef length l on the energy extraction efficiency η is most apparent at medium and high frequencies the energy extraction efficiency η of the flapping hydrofoil with tef increases with the increase of tef length at first and reaches a maximum at l c 0 33 beyond which further increase in l no longer improves the η 4 the gap width between the tef and the airfoil main body is proven to be responsible for causing a decrease in the pressure difference across the airfoil although a small gap width conduces to a higher heaving force it simultaneously induces a reduction in the pitching moment as well overall the results from the present study indicate that the optimal ratio of gap width to chord length w c is 0 001 at which the energy extraction efficiency of the proposed flapping hydrofoil can be increased apparently over the entire frequency range studied the proposed flapping hydrofoil energy harvester can achieve a relatively higher net power efficiency compared to its conventional counterpart and thus show great promise of practical application the results of the present study provide basic information for developing a scaled model to be experimentally tested in the next stage of the study as future works specific quantitative analysis will be performed by using optimization techniques such as genetic algorithm or orthogonal array design to optimize the flapping foil with tef considering multiple factors and further validations will also be carried out by using high resolution 3d numerical simulations more detailed flow information and vortex structures around the proposed flapping hydrofoil with tef could then be revealed so as to gain a deep understanding of the physical mechanism behind lift enhancement by trailing edge flap credit authorship contribution statement daming

20993,the impulse turbine is one of the most important devices of oscillating water column wave energy the air through the rotor blades passage drives the rotor rotating and does work thus reasonable rotor blade parameters directly determine the performance of the impulse turbine this paper uses a computational fluid dynamics technique to analyze the influence of three rotor blade parameters including rotor blade thickness rotor blade rotation angle and rotor blade incident angle on the efficiency of impulse turbine the results show that the blade thickness is insensitive to the efficiency although the torque coefficient increases with the rising of thickness the efficiency of the turbine increases with the decrease of the rotation angle or the increase of the incident angle the efficient peak value of 57 is achieved at w 16 1 mm α 6 and λ 30 at the flow coefficient of 1 0 changing the structural parameters of the blade can not only change the pressure distribution of the blade but also affect the velocity distribution and vortex formed the energy loss is mainly attributed that the impulse loss at the initial segment and the energy dissipation at the trailing edge wake fields of the blade and downstream guide vane keywords oscillating water column impulse turbine efficiency blade thickness blade rotation angle blade incident angle 1 introduction the ocean covers more than 70 of the earth s surface and concentrates 97 of the water it contains a great deal of renewable energy including wave energy drew et al 2009 tidal energy khan et al 2017 ocean current

high power density wide distribution no pollution and as a floating or pile supported breakwater he et al 2013 2019 and using wave energy to generate electricity can effectively alleviate the energy crisis global warming and environmental pollution in the world japan the united kingdom ireland norway spain sweden denmark india the united states and other countries have successively built many wave energy converters wecs heath 2012 at present there are numerous kinds of wave energy generation technologies the wec consists of a wave energy collecting section an energy transferring and transforming section and an energy generating section according to the working principle of the wec it can be divided into the oscillating water column owc wave energy converter oscillating floating wave energy converter and others falcão 2010 the owc is considered to be one of the most promising wecs and widely used because of its simple structure high conversion efficiency and low cost the owc system mainly involves three parts the air chamber the air turbine and the electrical generator the principle behind owc is to convert the oscillating motion of the wave into the airflow through the turbine sea or ocean waves oscillate up and down in a plenum chamber the oscillating water surface compresses the air when it moves upward and withdraws air when it moves downward the air turbine at the top of the chamber rotates to transform the wave energy into mechanical energy shaaban and hafiz 2012 finally the generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy to date there are many researches on owc mainly focusing on how to increase the efficiency of the device prasad et al 2017 ning et al 2018 elhanafi et al 2018 the air turbine is part of the most important equipment in the energy conversion process of the owc system improving air turbine performance is significant for increasing the conversion efficiency of the whole wec at present there are the wells turbine impulse turbine and other forms used in owc technology at first most owc prototypes use wells turbines which were invented in mid 1970s the wells turbine has a simple structure relatively low cost and high efficiency peak efficiency of wells turbine under laboratory conditions was found to reach about 70 falcão and henriques 2016 but the wells turbine also has numerous disadvantages a narrow operating range the low or negative torque for small flow rates poor starting performance big noise and high axial thrust lopez et al 2013 these are determined by the structure of the turbine itself the current research on wells turbine is mainly focused on how to improve wells turbine performance and efficiency information on wells turbine performance has been published in numerous papers for instance a variable thickness blade vtb of a wells turbine is discussed mohammad and esmail 2018 the results reveal that a 63 37 increase in torque coefficient and a 72 8 increase in efficiency are achieved by the vtb compared with the original blade in the deep stall condition moreover the main sources of losses of wells turbine are due to blade profile and secondary flows tip clearance also has a strong impact on flow patterns around the turbine blade which determines the turbine performance thus zahari et al 2011 used the computational fluid dynamics cfd method to study turbine performance under different non uniform tip clearance and found that the boundary layers separation of the turbine with uniform tip clearance was much more serious than that with non uniform tip clearance at the same time shaaban and hafiz 2012 achieved the wells turbine s power by 14 and efficiency by 9 through optimizing the geometry of the pipes halder et al 2018 constructed a surrogate approximation model was constructed to find an optimal design they concluded that the optimal design delayed the flow separation and the peak efficiency dropped by 3 1 halder and samad 2017 halder et al 2018 considered blade profile thickness and sweep modifications along with and without grooved casing and then draw the conclusion that the reference blade with gc performs better in terms of torque coefficient and efficiency if the flow is attached shehata et al 2018 investigated the blade with an optimum angle of the slot it found that the optimum slot angle is 10 clockwise another more popular is the impulse turbine patented by babintsev 1975 the incident wave causes a vertical oscillatory movement of the free surface inside the chamber which generates a variable reciprocating airflow through a duct where a turbine is installed under reciprocating airflow the traditional turbine can not make full use of the airflow so a bidirectional impulse turbine is first invented as the power take off system to owc which is a self rectifying air turbine and rotates in one direction independently of the airflow direction hence it is called a bidirectional impulse turbine or self rectifying impulse turbine the most favorable character of the bidirectional impulse turbine is a wide operating range and better starting characteristics compared to the wells turbine the most common type is the bidirectional impulse turbine which is equipped with a set of rotor blades on the hub and two sets of guide vans each row of guide vanes can be alternately used as upstream or downstream guide vanes depending on whether the airflow is centripetal inhalation mode or centrifugal exhalation mode the guide vanes can be fixed or variable to achieve greater efficiency but the variable guide vanes need a more complex structure more parts and high precision due to their mechanical complexity impulse turbines with variable guide vanes has not caught the attention of developers in order to reduce the energy loss of impulse turbine setoguchi et al 2001 found that the efficiency of the rotor blade with an elliptic shape on the suction side and a circular arc shape on the pressure side was higher than that of a simple type although the operational flow range of the impulse turbine is wider than the wells turbine its peak efficiency rarely exceeds about 50 therefore it is necessary to find the optimal design to make the impulse turbine with higher efficiency to overcome this problem different methods to optimize the geometric parameters have been attempted for example badhurshah et al 2018 used the hybrid genetic algorithm to search for the most designed points and improved the relative mean efficiency of the wide range of flow coefficient by about 24 and the maximum efficiency point by 28 ezhilsabareesh et al 2018 believe that optimizing the hub and tip thickness of the rotor blade would improve the shaft power and reduce the pressure drop through the turbine therefore the rotor blade profiles optimization is carried out by using a multi substitution assisted multi objective evolutionary algorithm the results indicate that the turbine efficiency enhancement is about 10 4 gomes et al 2012 describe a two step method for optimizing the blade profile of a two dimensional impulse turbine multi point aerodynamic optimization of the rotor blade sections of an axial flow impulse air turbine is presented to verify the method validity falcão et al 2019 also use the two dimensional flow method as a preliminary design tool and utilized cfd code to obtain numerical simulation results for flow details through the turbine and for the turbine overall performance under several working conditions these methods are very useful for finding the optimal solution but before this you need to determine an objective function however constructing the objective function is very difficult mainly because numerous parameters are involved in the optimization process and these parameters are dependent of each other elatife et al 2019 halder et al 2017 carried out multiple design variables modifications for a bidirectional flow turbine to enhance its performance by maximizing the peak torque coefficient and the corresponding efficiency halder and madhan kumar 2020 also developed and implemented a coupled cad cfd fully automated optimization approach to improve impulse turbine performance the results showed that relative peak efficiency and torque coefficient were respectively enhanced by 3 4 and 2 in the optimized design meanwhile the effect of guide vane lean as well as the combined rotor and guide vane lean on the performance of the turbine were discussed in detail ranjith et al 2019 reasonable blade parameters directly determine the performance of the impulse turbine some scholars investigate the influence of geometric parameters on performance under steady flow conditions rotor blade solidity cui and liu 2015 tip clearance pereiras et al 2011 rotor blade setting angle liu et al 2016 number of rotor blades and guide vans badhurshah and samad 2015 guide vane shape thakker et al 2005 hub to tip ratio and reynolds number thakker et al 2006 etc for impulse turbine it is one of the most important wave energy transmission devices cui et al 2015 study the mean efficiency of a staggered impulse turbine under different amplitude velocity ratios by using quasi steady state analysis numerical simulation results show that the performance of the staggered impulse turbine is better than that of the conventional impulse turbine under the condition of asymmetric flow moreover a constant current test rig is established to explore the steady state performance of the impulse turbine by them by changing the incident flow velocities and prescribed rotation speed it is found that when the flow coefficient is 1 0 the peak turbine efficiency is 0 48 liu et al 2017 in addition to these above widely studied parameters it is also attention in engineering practices that the rotor blade thickness the rotor blade rotation angle and the rotor blade incident angle also have an evident influence on the performance of the impulse turbine however research of these blade parameters of the impulse turbine is relatively less and these factors how affect the turbine performance are still unclear therefore in this paper the three dimensional steady numerical simulation is used implemented for performance analysis of the impulse turbine different rotor blade shape w rotor blade rotation angle α and rotor blade incident angle λ are studied to analyze how they affect the efficiency input coefficient and torque coefficient under the same conditions three blade shapes were selected from original w 16 1 mm to w 15 1 mm and w 14 1 mm four rotation angles are selected from original α 0 to α 3 α 3 and α the incident angle is changed from original λ 30 to λ 15 and λ 45 the influence of these factors on the aerodynamic performance of the impulse turbine is revealed by analyzing the pressure and velocity distribution of the rotor blade conclusions of this paper provide an important basis for further structural design of the impulse turbine 2 numerical methodology 2 1 turbine geometric geometry and computational domain in this paper the impulse turbine is used as the research object the rotor blade geometry of the original turbine used in the present numerical simulation is the same as setoguchia s 2001 the basic parameters of the impulse turbine are shown in fig 1 the turbine consists of three parts the upstream stator the rotor and the downstream stator the rotor consists of 30 blades with 30 fixed angle mirror image guide vanes on both sides of the rotor the guide vanes inlet and outlet angle is fixed at 30 for the rotor blade a circular arc is used on the pressure side and an elliptical arc is used on the suction side while a straight line circular arc is used for guide vane the chord lengths of the rotor and guide vane are 54 mm and 70 mm respectively the turbine has a hub to tip ratio of 0 7 consequently the hub diameter is 210 mm the gap between rotor blades and guide vanes is 20 mm see table 1 for additional parameters 2 2 grid generation and boundary conditions the computation domain was divided into three parts the upstream and downstream guide vane domains are stationary and the rotor blade domain is rotational the computational domain is extended to ten times of blade chord lengths along upstream and downstream respectively to achieve a fully developed flow for the boundary conditions the velocity inlet and pressure outlet are imposed on the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively no slip condition is used for all stationary or rotating walls as three different domains were modeled two interfaces are connected to transfer flow information between the rotating and stationary domain the detailed boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 the grid used in this simulation is generated by icem cfd software fig 3 depicts the meshes employed in the computational domain the structured grid is used and o type mapping grids are applied surrounding the turbine rotor blade and guide vanes the meshes are refined for the near wall treatment which was expected to better handle the complex turbulent flow around these areas and enhance the computational accuracy the first layer grid near wall is 0 0002 mm and the y is about equal to one the total number of grids is approximately 10 million the rotor blade domain is 4 million and the number of upstream and downstream of the rotor is about 6 million 2 3 solving method the governing equations for viscous incompressible fluid are continuity equation 1 u i x i 0 and the reynolds average navier stokes rans equation 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f i where u i is the average velocity p is the time averaged pressure ρ is the air density μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity f i is the body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress during the steady state tests the inlet velocity of constant airflow varies between 10 m s and 50 m s the turbine rotational speed was kept a constant of 2000 rpm the equation is discretized by the finite volume method and then the discrete equation is solved by the simplec algorithm for the spatial discretization the second order is used for pressure and the second order upwind scheme is used for momentum and turbulent kinetic energy terms then the second order implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretization turbulence is modeled using the sst shear stress transport model which is likely to provide superior performance for complex flows the rotor is modeled using the moving reference frame mrf method the convergence of the solution is monitored by checking the residuals of the numerically solved governing equations the convergence criterion for velocity is 1 0 10 4 2 4 numerical model validation the performance of the impulse turbine is computed by the following non dimensional parameters 3 torque coefficient c t 2 t 0 ρ v a 2 u r 2 b l r z r r 4 input coefficient c a 2 δ p q ρ v a 2 u r 2 b l r z v a 5 flow coefficient φ v a u r 6 efficiency η t 0 ω δ p q c t c a φ where δ p representing the total pressure drop of the impulse turbine q is the incident air flow rate v a and t 0 are the converted incident axial velocity of the air flow and the output torque respectively r r ω u r b and z represent the mean radius the angular velocity of the turbine the circumferential velocity at r r the blade height and the number of rotor blades respectively comparisons between cfd results and experiment results setoguchia et al 2001 are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the trend of experimental and numerical test is consistent although there is a little difference between the two sets of data because the compressibility of air and the energy loss caused by friction are ignored in this numerical simulation which will cause some errors to consequences simonetti et al 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of blade shape the rotor blade of the impulse turbine is the main working part if the thickness of the blade is too large the air in the turbine passage will be compressed and the thickness of the blade is too small torque made by the blade will be decreased which will also affect the turbine performance the shape of the pressure surface of the rotor blade is circular and the suction surface is elliptical when changing the blade shapes the suction surface is moved to the pressure surface by 1 mm and 2 mm then blade shapes of w 15 1 mm and w 14 1 mm are obtained the main dimensions of the blade surface remain unchanged therefore three different blade shapes are selected to study namely w 16 1 mm w 15 1 mm and w 14 1 mm respectively as showed in fig 5 the effect of blade shape on the dimensionless coefficient of the impulse turbine is shown in fig 6 on the whole when the flow coefficient is less than 1 0 the input coefficient and efficiency change increased rapidly with the rising of the flow coefficient while when the flow coefficient is higher than 1 0 the input coefficient and efficiency change slowly as can be seen in fig 6 a and b when φ 0 4 the blade shape is insensitive on to the input coefficient and torque coefficient when φ 0 4 the larger the w is the higher the input coefficient and torque coefficient are as shown in fig 6 c when φ 0 4 the difference of efficiency among different rotor blade shape is slight when 0 4 φ 1 2 the greater the w of the rotor blade the smaller the efficiency when φ 1 2 the result reverses the peak value of the efficiency of 0 43 is achieved at the flow coefficient of 1 0 with w 16 1 mm the pressure distribution on the rotor blade surface at different blade height is shown in fig 7 where the x represents the chord length from the leading edge h is the height from the bottom of the blade the area formed by the curves of pressure between the pressure surface ps and suction surface ss of the blade in fig 7 can nearly reflect the work done by airflow at this position case fig 7 a d and g show the pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 10 blade height under different flow coefficients it can be seen that the pressure on ps gradually increases along the axial direction and then decreases sharply near the trailing edge of the blade it is also illustrated that the pressure on ss firstly decreased rapidly until near x l 0 5 and then the pressure gradually increases along the axial direction until the trailing edge we also noticed that the larger the w is the higher the pressure is whether the ps or ss of the blade according to the area enclosed by the pressure curves of ps and ss when x l is less than 0 2 or so the negative work is done by the airflow when x l is larger than 0 2 the positive work is done by the airflow moreover the area of negative work is far less than that of positive work and the maximum of pressure difference is achieved at near x l 0 5 fig 7 b e and fig 7 h show the pressure distribution of rotor blade surface pressure at 50 blade height under different flow coefficients it can be seen that the pressure at the leading edge of ss is positive and same under three blade shapes this shows that the energy loss at ss leading edge is independent of the blade shape at 50 blade height with the decrease of w the area of negative work at the leading edge of ps gradually decreases which indicates that the energy loss caused by air dashed near the leading edge is gradually reduced moreover it is shown that the area of negative work declines and that of positive work increases with the rising of flow coefficient which is verified the torque coefficient always increases with the rising of flow coefficient shown in fig 6 b fig 7 c f and fig 7 i show the static pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 90 blade height under different flow coefficients the pressure distribution is consistent with that at 10 and 50 positions in this paper the non dimensional pressure coefficient c p is selected to show the pressure distribution on the rotor blade surface the pressure coefficient c p is defined as following 7 c p p p a v e 0 5 ρ v a 2 where p is static pressure p a v e is average static pressure the pressure coefficient distribution on one blade surface of the impulse turbine with different rotor blade shapes is shown in fig 8 similarly due to the periodic distribution of the rotor blade only one blade is selected for analysis the direction of airflow is from left to right it can be seen from fig 8 a b and fig 8 c that the static pressure on ps shows an increasing trend from hub to rim three conditions forms a high pressure region at the trailing edge of ps which is mainly concentrated on the upper part blade with the decrease of w the area of this high pressure increases in addition it can also be observed that the high pressure area gradually diffuses from tip to hub with a decrease of w this shows that the work capacity increases from tip to hub along the rotor blade height the main work areas concentrated on the upper part of the rotor blade pressure distribution on the rotor blade ss of the impulse turbine is shown in fig 8 d e and fig 8 f it can be seen that a high pressure region forms at the leading edge and a minimum negative pressure region lies in the middle of the ss with the decrease of w the area of negative pressure area gradually decreases which is verified the torque coefficient of w 16 1 mm is higher than other ones it can be seen that the larger the w the greater the pressure gradient the back flow on ss is inclined to occur which has a harmful influence on the efficiency fig 9 shows the velocity distribution at the mid spanwise section of the blade it can be seen that after the adjustment of upstream guide vanes the air flows into the impeller at a speed higher than the inlet speed then a higher velocity distribution region is formed at the initial segment of the ps and a low velocity region is formed in the ss corresponding position therefore a pressure difference occurs at the initial segment of the blade which is prone to do negative work which causes an efficient reduction it is also illustrated that there is a low velocity stripe at the trailing edge of the blade as well as the trailing edge of downstream guide vane which is prone to vortex formed and lead to dissipation with the decrease of the w the velocity difference decreases gradually at the initial segment of the blade moreover the smaller the w the less the low velocity distribution area at the trailing edge of the downstream guide vane velocity distribution at streamwise section x l 0 5 for different blade shapes is shown in fig 10 it illustrates that velocity distribution is symmetrical along the circumference the velocity near ss is larger than that near ps with the decrease of rotor blade shapes the area of high velocity decreases and the area of low velocity increases 3 2 effect of rotation angle to study the influence of different rotor blade rotation angles on the performance of the impulse turbine four different rotor blade rotation angles are obtained by changing the rotor blade rotation angle only as shown in fig 11 the blade rotation angles of α 3 α 0 α 3 and α 6 are selected to compare the flow direction is from down to up it can be seen from fig 12 a that generally speaking with the increase of the rotor blade rotation angle the input coefficient increases in the whole flow coefficient range when the rotation angle is negative there is a little different in the input coefficient when the rotation angle is positive the input coefficient increases significantly the input coefficient peak value of α 3 is found to be 2 98 at the flow coefficient of 1 5 it can be seen from fig 12 b that the torque coefficient will increase with the decrease of the rotation angle it can be seen from fig 12 c that the efficiency increases with the decrease of the rotation angle the efficient peak value of α 6 is found to be 0 57 at the flow coefficient of 1 0 fig 13 a fig 13 d and 13 g show the pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 10 blade height under different flow coefficients it can be seen that the smaller the blade rotation angle the higher the pressure at the leading edge of ps however the pressure at the trailing edge of the ss decreases with the decrease of the blade rotation angle with the increase of blade rotation angle the negative work area at the leading edge also increases therefore decreasing the rotation angle is beneficial to improve the efficiency of the turbine fig 13 b e and fig 13 h show the pressure distribution of rotor blade surface load at 50 blade height it can be seen that when the rotation angle is positive the work done by the blade is mainly concentrated in the middle of the rotor blade and when the rotation angle is negative the work done by the blade is mainly concentrated on the middle rear part of the rotor blade with the decrease of the rotation angle the force distribution on the blade surface becomes more and more uniform which is beneficial to prolong the service life of the blade fig 13 c f and fig 13 i show the static pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 90 blade height compared with the 10 position and 50 position of the blade more work is done in the upper part of the blade surface moreover the work done by the airflow at the upper of the rotor blade also increases with the decreasing of rotating angle the larger the rotation angle the more intense the pressure fluctuation on ss which will consume a lot of kinetic energy in the air and then cause energy losses the pressure coefficient distribution on ps of the rotor blade with different rotation angles is shown in fig 14 a fig 14 b and 14 c it can be seen that when the rotation angle is negative a large area of ps is exposed to incident airflow which leads to a large higher pressure area of ps than that at the positive blade rotation angle the smaller the rotation angle is the more uniform pressure distribution on the ps is which is helpful to improve the efficiency it can be seen from fig 14 d e and fig 14 f that there is a high pressure region at the leading edge and a large negative pressure region in the middle of the ss when the rotation angle is negative the low pressure region also appears in the trailing edge except in the middle of the ss with the decrease of the rotation angle the area of the negative pressure region in the middle of the ss gradually decreases however the area of the low pressure region at the trailing edge becomes larger when the rotation angle is positive the ss of the rotor blade will block airflow resulting in an obvious low pressure zone at the leading edge of ps and a high pressure zone at the leading edge of ss which is harmful to do work of airflow fig 15 shows the velocity distribution at spanwise section h b 0 5 for different rotation angles it can be seen that with the decrease of the blade rotation angle the high velocity area of ps decreases so the pressure differences between the ps and ss at the initial segment of blade decreases it is helpful to decrease the energy loss due to negative work of the pressure difference however the smaller the rotation angle the larger the area of low velocity region at the outlet of downstream guide vanes reducing the rotation angle makes it possible to produce vortexes here which will cause energy dissipation the velocity distribution on the x l 0 5 cross section for different rotation angles is shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the high velocity region is close to the ss while the low velocity region is mainly concentrated near the ps with the decrease of rotor blade rotation angle the area of high velocity region also decreases the low velocity region which originally concentrated on the pressure surface of the blade gradually disappeared and the velocity distribution in the passage is more uniform this is beneficial to reduce flow separation and energy loss 3 3 effect of incident angle to improve the pressure distribution on the surface of the rotor blade and improve the efficiency of the impulse turbine the influence of different rotor blade incident angles on the performance of the impulse turbine is explored three blade incident angles of λ 15 λ 30 and λ 45 are chose and compared which is shown in fig 17 fig 18 shows the influence of different incident angles on the performance of the impulse turbine as shown in fig 18 a generally speaking the input coefficient increases with the decrease of the incidence angle of the rotor blade in the whole flow coefficient range the reason is that the smaller incidence angle of the rotor blade has an obvious blocking effect on airflow which will result in a larger pressure difference between the ps and ss it can be seen from fig 18 b that in the whole flow coefficient range the smaller the incidence angle the higher the torque coefficient it can be seen from fig 18 c that when the flow coefficient is small the impact of the incidence angle on the turbine efficiency is small when φ 0 6 the efficiency of the turbine increases with the increase of the incident angle the maximum efficiency of 0 45 is achieved at λ 45 and φ 0 96 fig 19 a fig 19 d and 19 g show the pressure distribution on the blade surface at 10 blade height it can be seen that the larger the blade incidence angle the higher the pressure at the leading edge also with the increase of blade incidence angle the pressure difference between ps and ss of blade root decreases so decreasing the incidence angle harms the efficiency of the turbine because of the negative work fig 19 b e and fig 19 h show the pressure distribution on the blade surface at 50 blade height it can be seen that the pressure gradient on ss decreases with the increase of the incident angle therefore increasing the incident angle is beneficial to reduce backflows with the increase of the incident angle the negative area of the blade leading edge decreases thus energy loss also decreases when the incident angle is 45 the energy loss of the blade leading edge is the lowest fig 19 c f and fig 19 i show the static pressure distribution on the blade surface at 90 blade height it can be seen that the pressure gradient in the upper of the ps gradually decreases with the increase of the incident angle when the incident angle is increased the pressure curve fluctuates violently which is easy to cause backflow and energy loss with the increase of blade incidence angle the airflow work capacity at the top of the rotor blade increases the pressure coefficient distribution with different incident angles is shown in fig 20 it can be seen from fig 20 a b and fig 20 c that the pressure from the leading edge to the trailing edge of λ 15 and λ 30 increases gradually and the pressure from the hub to the rim also increases with the increase of the incident angle the area of low pressure region at the leading edge of ps decreases gradually so the energy loss at the blade leading edge caused by airflow impact decreases gradually however the pressure first increases and then decreases from the leading edge to the trailing edge of λ 45 moreover the high pressure region on the ps appears at the top of the trailing edge of λ 15 and λ 30 and it appears in the middle and upper part of the blade ps of λ 45 as shown in fig 20 d e and fig 20 f for three incident angles the pressure on ss first decreases and then increases from the leading edge to the trailing edge the high pressure region formed at the leading edge is caused by the direct impact of airflow with the increase of the incident angle the high pressure area of the leading edge decreases first and then increases this means that the energy loss of the leading edge decreases first and then increases the low pressure region formed in the middle of the ss will cause flow separation and energy loss with the increase of the incident angle the area of low pressure region in the middle of ss decreases gradually for the model with λ 15 a small low pressure region appears at the trailing edge of the ss this will result in a flow separation of the trailing edge resulting in energy losses with the increase of the blade incidence angle the low pressure region of the trailing edge gradually disappears fig 21 shows the velocity distribution at the spanwise section h b 0 5 of the blade it can be seen that with the increase of the incident angle the area of high velocity on the ps decreases obviously and the low speed stripe at the trailing edge of the blade tends to diffuse to the inlet of the downstream guide vane it can also be observed that with the increase of blade incidence angle the low speed region originally concentrated at the trailing edge of the guide vane gradually transfers to the suction side of the downstream guide vane moreover the velocity distribution at the trailing edge of λ 45 is more uniform and there is no obvious low speed region this shows that the flow structure is sensitive to the incident angle so that it changes the space distribution energy loss the velocity distribution of the impulse turbine with different incident angles at the x l 0 5 cross section is shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the area of high velocity region and low velocity area both decrease with the increase of rotor blade incident angle the velocity gradient in the passage decreases with the increase of the incident angle and the turbulent kinetic energy decreases gradually which helps to improve the flow separation phenomenon in the passage with the increase of the incident angle of the rotor blade the velocity distribution in the passage of the impulse turbine is more uniform and the energy loss in the passage is reduced 4 conclusions this paper mainly analyzes the influence of different rotor blade geometric parameters including rotor blade shapes rotor blade rotation angle and rotor blade incident angle on impulse turbine performance the main conclusions are as following changing the blade shape of impeller rotation angle α and incidence angle λ can find the appropriate parameters to improve the turbine efficiency the efficient peak value of 57 is achieved at w 16 1 mm α 6 and λ 30 the impulse turbine with w 16 1 mm has the largest input coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency as the w decreases the area of the negative pressure region at the leading edge of the rotor blade also decreases therefore reducing the w of the rotor blade is beneficial to reduce the energy loss at the leading edge although it is a little sensitive to the blade shape with the increase of α the input coefficient increases and the torque coefficient decreases the efficiency of the turbine increases with the decrease of the rotation angle because the rotor blade with a larger rotation angle will obviously increase the dash loss of the blade initial segment in the whole flow coefficient range the smaller the λ the larger the input coefficient and torque coefficient the turbine efficiency increases with the increase of λ it is contributed that it can improve the pressure difference between the ps and ss changing the structural parameters of the impeller can not only change the pressure distribution of the blade but also affect the speed of the airflow in the passage the energy loss is mainly attributed that the impulse loss at the initial segment and the energy dissipation at the trailing edge wake fields as well as the downstream guide vane so more research work is worthy to do

20993,the impulse turbine is one of the most important devices of oscillating water column wave energy the air through the rotor blades passage drives the rotor rotating and does work thus reasonable rotor blade parameters directly determine the performance of the impulse turbine this paper uses a computational fluid dynamics technique to analyze the influence of three rotor blade parameters including rotor blade thickness rotor blade rotation angle and rotor blade incident angle on the efficiency of impulse turbine the results show that the blade thickness is insensitive to the efficiency although the torque coefficient increases with the rising of thickness the efficiency of the turbine increases with the decrease of the rotation angle or the increase of the incident angle the efficient peak value of 57 is achieved at w 16 1 mm α 6 and λ 30 at the flow coefficient of 1 0 changing the structural parameters of the blade can not only change the pressure distribution of the blade but also affect the velocity distribution and vortex formed the energy loss is mainly attributed that the impulse loss at the initial segment and the energy dissipation at the trailing edge wake fields of the blade and downstream guide vane keywords oscillating water column impulse turbine efficiency blade thickness blade rotation angle blade incident angle 1 introduction the ocean covers more than 70 of the earth s surface and concentrates 97 of the water it contains a great deal of renewable energy including wave energy drew et al 2009 tidal energy khan et al 2017 ocean current energy fraenkel 2007 ocean thermal energy liu et al 2020 and salinity gradient energy alvarez silva et al 2016 among them wave energy attracts more and more interest by virtue of high energy density high power density wide distribution no pollution and as a floating or pile supported breakwater he et al 2013 2019 and using wave energy to generate electricity can effectively alleviate the energy crisis global warming and environmental pollution in the world japan the united kingdom ireland norway spain sweden denmark india the united states and other countries have successively built many wave energy converters wecs heath 2012 at present there are numerous kinds of wave energy generation technologies the wec consists of a wave energy collecting section an energy transferring and transforming section and an energy generating section according to the working principle of the wec it can be divided into the oscillating water column owc wave energy converter oscillating floating wave energy converter and others falcão 2010 the owc is considered to be one of the most promising wecs and widely used because of its simple structure high conversion efficiency and low cost the owc system mainly involves three parts the air chamber the air turbine and the electrical generator the principle behind owc is to convert the oscillating motion of the wave into the airflow through the turbine sea or ocean waves oscillate up and down in a plenum chamber the oscillating water surface compresses the air when it moves upward and withdraws air when it moves downward the air turbine at the top of the chamber rotates to transform the wave energy into mechanical energy shaaban and hafiz 2012 finally the generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy to date there are many researches on owc mainly focusing on how to increase the efficiency of the device prasad et al 2017 ning et al 2018 elhanafi et al 2018 the air turbine is part of the most important equipment in the energy conversion process of the owc system improving air turbine performance is significant for increasing the conversion efficiency of the whole wec at present there are the wells turbine impulse turbine and other forms used in owc technology at first most owc prototypes use wells turbines which were invented in mid 1970s the wells turbine has a simple structure relatively low cost and high efficiency peak efficiency of wells turbine under laboratory conditions was found to reach about 70 falcão and henriques 2016 but the wells turbine also has numerous disadvantages a narrow operating range the low or negative torque for small flow rates poor starting performance big noise and high axial thrust lopez et al 2013 these are determined by the structure of the turbine itself the current research on wells turbine is mainly focused on how to improve wells turbine performance and efficiency information on wells turbine performance has been published in numerous papers for instance a variable thickness blade vtb of a wells turbine is discussed mohammad and esmail 2018 the results reveal that a 63 37 increase in torque coefficient and a 72 8 increase in efficiency are achieved by the vtb compared with the original blade in the deep stall condition moreover the main sources of losses of wells turbine are due to blade profile and secondary flows tip clearance also has a strong impact on flow patterns around the turbine blade which determines the turbine performance thus zahari et al 2011 used the computational fluid dynamics cfd method to study turbine performance under different non uniform tip clearance and found that the boundary layers separation of the turbine with uniform tip clearance was much more serious than that with non uniform tip clearance at the same time shaaban and hafiz 2012 achieved the wells turbine s power by 14 and efficiency by 9 through optimizing the geometry of the pipes halder et al 2018 constructed a surrogate approximation model was constructed to find an optimal design they concluded that the optimal design delayed the flow separation and the peak efficiency dropped by 3 1 halder and samad 2017 halder et al 2018 considered blade profile thickness and sweep modifications along with and without grooved casing and then draw the conclusion that the reference blade with gc performs better in terms of torque coefficient and efficiency if the flow is attached shehata et al 2018 investigated the blade with an optimum angle of the slot it found that the optimum slot angle is 10 clockwise another more popular is the impulse turbine patented by babintsev 1975 the incident wave causes a vertical oscillatory movement of the free surface inside the chamber which generates a variable reciprocating airflow through a duct where a turbine is installed under reciprocating airflow the traditional turbine can not make full use of the airflow so a bidirectional impulse turbine is first invented as the power take off system to owc which is a self rectifying air turbine and rotates in one direction independently of the airflow direction hence it is called a bidirectional impulse turbine or self rectifying impulse turbine the most favorable character of the bidirectional impulse turbine is a wide operating range and better starting characteristics compared to the wells turbine the most common type is the bidirectional impulse turbine which is equipped with a set of rotor blades on the hub and two sets of guide vans each row of guide vanes can be alternately used as upstream or downstream guide vanes depending on whether the airflow is centripetal inhalation mode or centrifugal exhalation mode the guide vanes can be fixed or variable to achieve greater efficiency but the variable guide vanes need a more complex structure more parts and high precision due to their mechanical complexity impulse turbines with variable guide vanes has not caught the attention of developers in order to reduce the energy loss of impulse turbine setoguchi et al 2001 found that the efficiency of the rotor blade with an elliptic shape on the suction side and a circular arc shape on the pressure side was higher than that of a simple type although the operational flow range of the impulse turbine is wider than the wells turbine its peak efficiency rarely exceeds about 50 therefore it is necessary to find the optimal design to make the impulse turbine with higher efficiency to overcome this problem different methods to optimize the geometric parameters have been attempted for example badhurshah et al 2018 used the hybrid genetic algorithm to search for the most designed points and improved the relative mean efficiency of the wide range of flow coefficient by about 24 and the maximum efficiency point by 28 ezhilsabareesh et al 2018 believe that optimizing the hub and tip thickness of the rotor blade would improve the shaft power and reduce the pressure drop through the turbine therefore the rotor blade profiles optimization is carried out by using a multi substitution assisted multi objective evolutionary algorithm the results indicate that the turbine efficiency enhancement is about 10 4 gomes et al 2012 describe a two step method for optimizing the blade profile of a two dimensional impulse turbine multi point aerodynamic optimization of the rotor blade sections of an axial flow impulse air turbine is presented to verify the method validity falcão et al 2019 also use the two dimensional flow method as a preliminary design tool and utilized cfd code to obtain numerical simulation results for flow details through the turbine and for the turbine overall performance under several working conditions these methods are very useful for finding the optimal solution but before this you need to determine an objective function however constructing the objective function is very difficult mainly because numerous parameters are involved in the optimization process and these parameters are dependent of each other elatife et al 2019 halder et al 2017 carried out multiple design variables modifications for a bidirectional flow turbine to enhance its performance by maximizing the peak torque coefficient and the corresponding efficiency halder and madhan kumar 2020 also developed and implemented a coupled cad cfd fully automated optimization approach to improve impulse turbine performance the results showed that relative peak efficiency and torque coefficient were respectively enhanced by 3 4 and 2 in the optimized design meanwhile the effect of guide vane lean as well as the combined rotor and guide vane lean on the performance of the turbine were discussed in detail ranjith et al 2019 reasonable blade parameters directly determine the performance of the impulse turbine some scholars investigate the influence of geometric parameters on performance under steady flow conditions rotor blade solidity cui and liu 2015 tip clearance pereiras et al 2011 rotor blade setting angle liu et al 2016 number of rotor blades and guide vans badhurshah and samad 2015 guide vane shape thakker et al 2005 hub to tip ratio and reynolds number thakker et al 2006 etc for impulse turbine it is one of the most important wave energy transmission devices cui et al 2015 study the mean efficiency of a staggered impulse turbine under different amplitude velocity ratios by using quasi steady state analysis numerical simulation results show that the performance of the staggered impulse turbine is better than that of the conventional impulse turbine under the condition of asymmetric flow moreover a constant current test rig is established to explore the steady state performance of the impulse turbine by them by changing the incident flow velocities and prescribed rotation speed it is found that when the flow coefficient is 1 0 the peak turbine efficiency is 0 48 liu et al 2017 in addition to these above widely studied parameters it is also attention in engineering practices that the rotor blade thickness the rotor blade rotation angle and the rotor blade incident angle also have an evident influence on the performance of the impulse turbine however research of these blade parameters of the impulse turbine is relatively less and these factors how affect the turbine performance are still unclear therefore in this paper the three dimensional steady numerical simulation is used implemented for performance analysis of the impulse turbine different rotor blade shape w rotor blade rotation angle α and rotor blade incident angle λ are studied to analyze how they affect the efficiency input coefficient and torque coefficient under the same conditions three blade shapes were selected from original w 16 1 mm to w 15 1 mm and w 14 1 mm four rotation angles are selected from original α 0 to α 3 α 3 and α the incident angle is changed from original λ 30 to λ 15 and λ 45 the influence of these factors on the aerodynamic performance of the impulse turbine is revealed by analyzing the pressure and velocity distribution of the rotor blade conclusions of this paper provide an important basis for further structural design of the impulse turbine 2 numerical methodology 2 1 turbine geometric geometry and computational domain in this paper the impulse turbine is used as the research object the rotor blade geometry of the original turbine used in the present numerical simulation is the same as setoguchia s 2001 the basic parameters of the impulse turbine are shown in fig 1 the turbine consists of three parts the upstream stator the rotor and the downstream stator the rotor consists of 30 blades with 30 fixed angle mirror image guide vanes on both sides of the rotor the guide vanes inlet and outlet angle is fixed at 30 for the rotor blade a circular arc is used on the pressure side and an elliptical arc is used on the suction side while a straight line circular arc is used for guide vane the chord lengths of the rotor and guide vane are 54 mm and 70 mm respectively the turbine has a hub to tip ratio of 0 7 consequently the hub diameter is 210 mm the gap between rotor blades and guide vanes is 20 mm see table 1 for additional parameters 2 2 grid generation and boundary conditions the computation domain was divided into three parts the upstream and downstream guide vane domains are stationary and the rotor blade domain is rotational the computational domain is extended to ten times of blade chord lengths along upstream and downstream respectively to achieve a fully developed flow for the boundary conditions the velocity inlet and pressure outlet are imposed on the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively no slip condition is used for all stationary or rotating walls as three different domains were modeled two interfaces are connected to transfer flow information between the rotating and stationary domain the detailed boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 the grid used in this simulation is generated by icem cfd software fig 3 depicts the meshes employed in the computational domain the structured grid is used and o type mapping grids are applied surrounding the turbine rotor blade and guide vanes the meshes are refined for the near wall treatment which was expected to better handle the complex turbulent flow around these areas and enhance the computational accuracy the first layer grid near wall is 0 0002 mm and the y is about equal to one the total number of grids is approximately 10 million the rotor blade domain is 4 million and the number of upstream and downstream of the rotor is about 6 million 2 3 solving method the governing equations for viscous incompressible fluid are continuity equation 1 u i x i 0 and the reynolds average navier stokes rans equation 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f i where u i is the average velocity p is the time averaged pressure ρ is the air density μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity f i is the body force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress during the steady state tests the inlet velocity of constant airflow varies between 10 m s and 50 m s the turbine rotational speed was kept a constant of 2000 rpm the equation is discretized by the finite volume method and then the discrete equation is solved by the simplec algorithm for the spatial discretization the second order is used for pressure and the second order upwind scheme is used for momentum and turbulent kinetic energy terms then the second order implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretization turbulence is modeled using the sst shear stress transport model which is likely to provide superior performance for complex flows the rotor is modeled using the moving reference frame mrf method the convergence of the solution is monitored by checking the residuals of the numerically solved governing equations the convergence criterion for velocity is 1 0 10 4 2 4 numerical model validation the performance of the impulse turbine is computed by the following non dimensional parameters 3 torque coefficient c t 2 t 0 ρ v a 2 u r 2 b l r z r r 4 input coefficient c a 2 δ p q ρ v a 2 u r 2 b l r z v a 5 flow coefficient φ v a u r 6 efficiency η t 0 ω δ p q c t c a φ where δ p representing the total pressure drop of the impulse turbine q is the incident air flow rate v a and t 0 are the converted incident axial velocity of the air flow and the output torque respectively r r ω u r b and z represent the mean radius the angular velocity of the turbine the circumferential velocity at r r the blade height and the number of rotor blades respectively comparisons between cfd results and experiment results setoguchia et al 2001 are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the trend of experimental and numerical test is consistent although there is a little difference between the two sets of data because the compressibility of air and the energy loss caused by friction are ignored in this numerical simulation which will cause some errors to consequences simonetti et al 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of blade shape the rotor blade of the impulse turbine is the main working part if the thickness of the blade is too large the air in the turbine passage will be compressed and the thickness of the blade is too small torque made by the blade will be decreased which will also affect the turbine performance the shape of the pressure surface of the rotor blade is circular and the suction surface is elliptical when changing the blade shapes the suction surface is moved to the pressure surface by 1 mm and 2 mm then blade shapes of w 15 1 mm and w 14 1 mm are obtained the main dimensions of the blade surface remain unchanged therefore three different blade shapes are selected to study namely w 16 1 mm w 15 1 mm and w 14 1 mm respectively as showed in fig 5 the effect of blade shape on the dimensionless coefficient of the impulse turbine is shown in fig 6 on the whole when the flow coefficient is less than 1 0 the input coefficient and efficiency change increased rapidly with the rising of the flow coefficient while when the flow coefficient is higher than 1 0 the input coefficient and efficiency change slowly as can be seen in fig 6 a and b when φ 0 4 the blade shape is insensitive on to the input coefficient and torque coefficient when φ 0 4 the larger the w is the higher the input coefficient and torque coefficient are as shown in fig 6 c when φ 0 4 the difference of efficiency among different rotor blade shape is slight when 0 4 φ 1 2 the greater the w of the rotor blade the smaller the efficiency when φ 1 2 the result reverses the peak value of the efficiency of 0 43 is achieved at the flow coefficient of 1 0 with w 16 1 mm the pressure distribution on the rotor blade surface at different blade height is shown in fig 7 where the x represents the chord length from the leading edge h is the height from the bottom of the blade the area formed by the curves of pressure between the pressure surface ps and suction surface ss of the blade in fig 7 can nearly reflect the work done by airflow at this position case fig 7 a d and g show the pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 10 blade height under different flow coefficients it can be seen that the pressure on ps gradually increases along the axial direction and then decreases sharply near the trailing edge of the blade it is also illustrated that the pressure on ss firstly decreased rapidly until near x l 0 5 and then the pressure gradually increases along the axial direction until the trailing edge we also noticed that the larger the w is the higher the pressure is whether the ps or ss of the blade according to the area enclosed by the pressure curves of ps and ss when x l is less than 0 2 or so the negative work is done by the airflow when x l is larger than 0 2 the positive work is done by the airflow moreover the area of negative work is far less than that of positive work and the maximum of pressure difference is achieved at near x l 0 5 fig 7 b e and fig 7 h show the pressure distribution of rotor blade surface pressure at 50 blade height under different flow coefficients it can be seen that the pressure at the leading edge of ss is positive and same under three blade shapes this shows that the energy loss at ss leading edge is independent of the blade shape at 50 blade height with the decrease of w the area of negative work at the leading edge of ps gradually decreases which indicates that the energy loss caused by air dashed near the leading edge is gradually reduced moreover it is shown that the area of negative work declines and that of positive work increases with the rising of flow coefficient which is verified the torque coefficient always increases with the rising of flow coefficient shown in fig 6 b fig 7 c f and fig 7 i show the static pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 90 blade height under different flow coefficients the pressure distribution is consistent with that at 10 and 50 positions in this paper the non dimensional pressure coefficient c p is selected to show the pressure distribution on the rotor blade surface the pressure coefficient c p is defined as following 7 c p p p a v e 0 5 ρ v a 2 where p is static pressure p a v e is average static pressure the pressure coefficient distribution on one blade surface of the impulse turbine with different rotor blade shapes is shown in fig 8 similarly due to the periodic distribution of the rotor blade only one blade is selected for analysis the direction of airflow is from left to right it can be seen from fig 8 a b and fig 8 c that the static pressure on ps shows an increasing trend from hub to rim three conditions forms a high pressure region at the trailing edge of ps which is mainly concentrated on the upper part blade with the decrease of w the area of this high pressure increases in addition it can also be observed that the high pressure area gradually diffuses from tip to hub with a decrease of w this shows that the work capacity increases from tip to hub along the rotor blade height the main work areas concentrated on the upper part of the rotor blade pressure distribution on the rotor blade ss of the impulse turbine is shown in fig 8 d e and fig 8 f it can be seen that a high pressure region forms at the leading edge and a minimum negative pressure region lies in the middle of the ss with the decrease of w the area of negative pressure area gradually decreases which is verified the torque coefficient of w 16 1 mm is higher than other ones it can be seen that the larger the w the greater the pressure gradient the back flow on ss is inclined to occur which has a harmful influence on the efficiency fig 9 shows the velocity distribution at the mid spanwise section of the blade it can be seen that after the adjustment of upstream guide vanes the air flows into the impeller at a speed higher than the inlet speed then a higher velocity distribution region is formed at the initial segment of the ps and a low velocity region is formed in the ss corresponding position therefore a pressure difference occurs at the initial segment of the blade which is prone to do negative work which causes an efficient reduction it is also illustrated that there is a low velocity stripe at the trailing edge of the blade as well as the trailing edge of downstream guide vane which is prone to vortex formed and lead to dissipation with the decrease of the w the velocity difference decreases gradually at the initial segment of the blade moreover the smaller the w the less the low velocity distribution area at the trailing edge of the downstream guide vane velocity distribution at streamwise section x l 0 5 for different blade shapes is shown in fig 10 it illustrates that velocity distribution is symmetrical along the circumference the velocity near ss is larger than that near ps with the decrease of rotor blade shapes the area of high velocity decreases and the area of low velocity increases 3 2 effect of rotation angle to study the influence of different rotor blade rotation angles on the performance of the impulse turbine four different rotor blade rotation angles are obtained by changing the rotor blade rotation angle only as shown in fig 11 the blade rotation angles of α 3 α 0 α 3 and α 6 are selected to compare the flow direction is from down to up it can be seen from fig 12 a that generally speaking with the increase of the rotor blade rotation angle the input coefficient increases in the whole flow coefficient range when the rotation angle is negative there is a little different in the input coefficient when the rotation angle is positive the input coefficient increases significantly the input coefficient peak value of α 3 is found to be 2 98 at the flow coefficient of 1 5 it can be seen from fig 12 b that the torque coefficient will increase with the decrease of the rotation angle it can be seen from fig 12 c that the efficiency increases with the decrease of the rotation angle the efficient peak value of α 6 is found to be 0 57 at the flow coefficient of 1 0 fig 13 a fig 13 d and 13 g show the pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 10 blade height under different flow coefficients it can be seen that the smaller the blade rotation angle the higher the pressure at the leading edge of ps however the pressure at the trailing edge of the ss decreases with the decrease of the blade rotation angle with the increase of blade rotation angle the negative work area at the leading edge also increases therefore decreasing the rotation angle is beneficial to improve the efficiency of the turbine fig 13 b e and fig 13 h show the pressure distribution of rotor blade surface load at 50 blade height it can be seen that when the rotation angle is positive the work done by the blade is mainly concentrated in the middle of the rotor blade and when the rotation angle is negative the work done by the blade is mainly concentrated on the middle rear part of the rotor blade with the decrease of the rotation angle the force distribution on the blade surface becomes more and more uniform which is beneficial to prolong the service life of the blade fig 13 c f and fig 13 i show the static pressure distribution of the rotor blade surface load at 90 blade height compared with the 10 position and 50 position of the blade more work is done in the upper part of the blade surface moreover the work done by the airflow at the upper of the rotor blade also increases with the decreasing of rotating angle the larger the rotation angle the more intense the pressure fluctuation on ss which will consume a lot of kinetic energy in the air and then cause energy losses the pressure coefficient distribution on ps of the rotor blade with different rotation angles is shown in fig 14 a fig 14 b and 14 c it can be seen that when the rotation angle is negative a large area of ps is exposed to incident airflow which leads to a large higher pressure area of ps than that at the positive blade rotation angle the smaller the rotation angle is the more uniform pressure distribution on the ps is which is helpful to improve the efficiency it can be seen from fig 14 d e and fig 14 f that there is a high pressure region at the leading edge and a large negative pressure region in the middle of the ss when the rotation angle is negative the low pressure region also appears in the trailing edge except in the middle of the ss with the decrease of the rotation angle the area of the negative pressure region in the middle of the ss gradually decreases however the area of the low pressure region at the trailing edge becomes larger when the rotation angle is positive the ss of the rotor blade will block airflow resulting in an obvious low pressure zone at the leading edge of ps and a high pressure zone at the leading edge of ss which is harmful to do work of airflow fig 15 shows the velocity distribution at spanwise section h b 0 5 for different rotation angles it can be seen that with the decrease of the blade rotation angle the high velocity area of ps decreases so the pressure differences between the ps and ss at the initial segment of blade decreases it is helpful to decrease the energy loss due to negative work of the pressure difference however the smaller the rotation angle the larger the area of low velocity region at the outlet of downstream guide vanes reducing the rotation angle makes it possible to produce vortexes here which will cause energy dissipation the velocity distribution on the x l 0 5 cross section for different rotation angles is shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the high velocity region is close to the ss while the low velocity region is mainly concentrated near the ps with the decrease of rotor blade rotation angle the area of high velocity region also decreases the low velocity region which originally concentrated on the pressure surface of the blade gradually disappeared and the velocity distribution in the passage is more uniform this is beneficial to reduce flow separation and energy loss 3 3 effect of incident angle to improve the pressure distribution on the surface of the rotor blade and improve the efficiency of the impulse turbine the influence of different rotor blade incident angles on the performance of the impulse turbine is explored three blade incident angles of λ 15 λ 30 and λ 45 are chose and compared which is shown in fig 17 fig 18 shows the influence of different incident angles on the performance of the impulse turbine as shown in fig 18 a generally speaking the input coefficient increases with the decrease of the incidence angle of the rotor blade in the whole flow coefficient range the reason is that the smaller incidence angle of the rotor blade has an obvious blocking effect on airflow which will result in a larger pressure difference between the ps and ss it can be seen from fig 18 b that in the whole flow coefficient range the smaller the incidence angle the higher the torque coefficient it can be seen from fig 18 c that when the flow coefficient is small the impact of the incidence angle on the turbine efficiency is small when φ 0 6 the efficiency of the turbine increases with the increase of the incident angle the maximum efficiency of 0 45 is achieved at λ 45 and φ 0 96 fig 19 a fig 19 d and 19 g show the pressure distribution on the blade surface at 10 blade height it can be seen that the larger the blade incidence angle the higher the pressure at the leading edge also with the increase of blade incidence angle the pressure difference between ps and ss of blade root decreases so decreasing the incidence angle harms the efficiency of the turbine because of the negative work fig 19 b e and fig 19 h show the pressure distribution on the blade surface at 50 blade height it can be seen that the pressure gradient on ss decreases with the increase of the incident angle therefore increasing the incident angle is beneficial to reduce backflows with the increase of the incident angle the negative area of the blade leading edge decreases thus energy loss also decreases when the incident angle is 45 the energy loss of the blade leading edge is the lowest fig 19 c f and fig 19 i show the static pressure distribution on the blade surface at 90 blade height it can be seen that the pressure gradient in the upper of the ps gradually decreases with the increase of the incident angle when the incident angle is increased the pressure curve fluctuates violently which is easy to cause backflow and energy loss with the increase of blade incidence angle the airflow work capacity at the top of the rotor blade increases the pressure coefficient distribution with different incident angles is shown in fig 20 it can be seen from fig 20 a b and fig 20 c that the pressure from the leading edge to the trailing edge of λ 15 and λ 30 increases gradually and the pressure from the hub to the rim also increases with the increase of the incident angle the area of low pressure region at the leading edge of ps decreases gradually so the energy loss at the blade leading edge caused by airflow impact decreases gradually however the pressure first increases and then decreases from the leading edge to the trailing edge of λ 45 moreover the high pressure region on the ps appears at the top of the trailing edge of λ 15 and λ 30 and it appears in the middle and upper part of the blade ps of λ 45 as shown in fig 20 d e and fig 20 f for three incident angles the pressure on ss first decreases and then increases from the leading edge to the trailing edge the high pressure region formed at the leading edge is caused by the direct impact of airflow with the increase of the incident angle the high pressure area of the leading edge decreases first and then increases this means that the energy loss of the leading edge decreases first and then increases the low pressure region formed in the middle of the ss will cause flow separation and energy loss with the increase of the incident angle the area of low pressure region in the middle of ss decreases gradually for the model with λ 15 a small low pressure region appears at the trailing edge of the ss this will result in a flow separation of the trailing edge resulting in energy losses with the increase of the blade incidence angle the low pressure region of the trailing edge gradually disappears fig 21 shows the velocity distribution at the spanwise section h b 0 5 of the blade it can be seen that with the increase of the incident angle the area of high velocity on the ps decreases obviously and the low speed stripe at the trailing edge of the blade tends to diffuse to the inlet of the downstream guide vane it can also be observed that with the increase of blade incidence angle the low speed region originally concentrated at the trailing edge of the guide vane gradually transfers to the suction side of the downstream guide vane moreover the velocity distribution at the trailing edge of λ 45 is more uniform and there is no obvious low speed region this shows that the flow structure is sensitive to the incident angle so that it changes the space distribution energy loss the velocity distribution of the impulse turbine with different incident angles at the x l 0 5 cross section is shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the area of high velocity region and low velocity area both decrease with the increase of rotor blade incident angle the velocity gradient in the passage decreases with the increase of the incident angle and the turbulent kinetic energy decreases gradually which helps to improve the flow separation phenomenon in the passage with the increase of the incident angle of the rotor blade the velocity distribution in the passage of the impulse turbine is more uniform and the energy loss in the passage is reduced 4 conclusions this paper mainly analyzes the influence of different rotor blade geometric parameters including rotor blade shapes rotor blade rotation angle and rotor blade incident angle on impulse turbine performance the main conclusions are as following changing the blade shape of impeller rotation angle α and incidence angle λ can find the appropriate parameters to improve the turbine efficiency the efficient peak value of 57 is achieved at w 16 1 mm α 6 and λ 30 the impulse turbine with w 16 1 mm has the largest input coefficient torque coefficient and efficiency as the w decreases the area of the negative pressure region at the leading edge of the rotor blade also decreases therefore reducing the w of the rotor blade is beneficial to reduce the energy loss at the leading edge although it is a little sensitive to the blade shape with the increase of α the input coefficient increases and the torque coefficient decreases the efficiency of the turbine increases with the decrease of the rotation angle because the rotor blade with a larger rotation angle will obviously increase the dash loss of the blade initial segment in the whole flow coefficient range the smaller the λ the larger the input coefficient and torque coefficient the turbine efficiency increases with the increase of λ it is contributed that it can improve the pressure difference between the ps and ss changing the structural parameters of the impeller can not only change the pressure distribution of the blade but also affect the speed of the airflow in the passage the energy loss is mainly attributed that the impulse loss at the initial segment and the energy dissipation at the trailing edge wake fields as well as the downstream guide vane so more research work is worthy to do

20994,to improve the propulsive performance of unmanned underwater vehicles with flapping foils a new three degree of freedom motion trajectory for flapping foils named infinity sign motion is proposed in this study the propulsive performances of the infinity sign motion are investigated and compared with that of other motion trajectories using computational fluid dynamics cfd based on the finite volume method fvm two dimensional unsteady incompressible navier stokes simulations were conducted to investigate the fluid foil interaction and determine the optimal parameters the effects of the relative flapping frequency the ratio of surging and heaving amplitude as well as the phase difference between surge and heave motion were systematically studied numerical results demonstrate that the hydrodynamic performance of the proposed motion is better than that of the other motions and it can obtain more thrust force and higher propulsive efficiency specifically the motion of flapping foils can generate three positive thrust peaks in one flapping cycle while the other motions can only produce one or two positive thrust peaks moreover the motion can achieve four times as much thrust force as that of the two degree of freedom traditional motion and the increase of propulsive efficiency is up to 29 47 keywords flapping foil uuvs motion trajectory hydrodynamic performance propulsive

engineering such as wave energy recovery huang et al 2017 ji and huang 2017 turbine power generation kinsey and dumas 2012 ship propulsion belibassakis and politis 2013 and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs propulsion etc the traditional propulsion systems of ships and uuvs mostly use propeller propellers but it is difficult to make a big breakthrough in propulsion efficiency bradley et al 2001 as a new type of propulsion flapping foils show great promise and prospects for improving the propulsion performance of uuvs chu et al 2007 tian et al 2012a and more and more investigations on flapping foils were completed by both experiments and numerical simulations a large number of studies triantafyllou et al 2004 have proved that the flap foil system is one of the most valuable means that can be used to enhance the propulsion performance and stability of ships and uuvs in recent decades to improve the propulsive efficiency of flapping foils a great deal of effort has been devoted to the effect of motion parameters on the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils most of it is mainly about the shape and movement of the hydrofoil lee et al lee and lee 2013 lee et al 2015 studied the principle of the flapping foil movement the results illustrate that the symmetric hydrofoil has a more stable propulsive performance than the asymmetric hydrofoil furthermore compared with delayed and advanced rotation symmetrical rotation generates a better propulsive speed with less fluctuation and then ashraf et al 2011 studied the effect of hydrofoil thickness and camber on its propulsion performance and concluded that the hydrofoil with camber has almost no advantages compared to symmetric hydrofoils and thin hydrofoils can bring more thrust force than thick hydrofoils to sum up in terms of the hydrofoil shape a thinner symmetrical hydrofoil can generate more thrust and enhance propulsion efficiency subsequently with further research on the propulsion performance of the flapping foil the movement mode of the flapping foil has gradually become the focus sarkar and venkatraman 2006 investigated the effects of sinusoidal motion asymmetric sinusoidal motion and constant heave rate oscillations on the propulsive performance of the heaving hydrofoil they concluded that the asymmetrical motion achieves more thrust and higher propulsive efficiency than that of the sinusoidal motion similarly lu et al 2013a 2013b studied the impact of large amplitude and nonsinusoidal motions on the propulsion performance of flapping foil the results showed that the thrust force increases with increasing amplitude but as the amplitude further increases the thrust will decrease and the propulsion efficiency will be significantly reduced after that xiao et al xiao and zhu 2014 xiao and liao 2009 xiao et al 2012 implemented numerical research to study the effect of asymmetric sinusoidal trajectory on the thrust and propulsion performances of the symmetric hydrofoil the results illustrate that the thrust increases with the enhancement of the reverse kármán vortex street and the reverse kármán vortex street increases with the higher asymmetry motion so the symmetric trajectory is conducive to the generation of thrust besides they combined a sinusoidal heave motion and a trapezoid like pitch motion to obtain a non sinusoidal trajectory the results showed that the non sinusoidal motion can achieve a 50 increase in thrust and propulsion efficiency within the corresponding test parameters up to now great progress has been made in the propulsive performances of flapping foils however one should not oversimplify relative biological motions into the single degree of freedom or two degrees of freedom motions and the motion modes of a flapping foil should be closer to the biomimetic movement in nature animals such as penguins and turtles can add other similar translational motion to the vertical motion of their wings to enhance propulsive performance singh et al 2004 izraelevitz and triantafyllou 2014 xu et al 2009 furthermore the conclusion that the combination of lateral movement and vertical movement can improve the propulsion performance and efficiency of the flapping wing has been verified in the experiment of licht et al 2010 besides font et al 2011 designed a three degree of freedom sea turtle flapping wing device based on a ball hinged tandem mechanism and conducted pool tests for the impact of different motion trajectories on propulsive performance tian et al 2012b proposed a novel strategy by adding a surge motion to the heave and pitch motion of a flapping foil it was found that the larger thrust and propulsive efficiency could be achieved compared with traditional motion subsequently esfahani et al 2015 proved that the elliptical motion trajectory can significantly influence the hydrodynamics and performance of either heaving or pitching heaving foil yang et al 2017 and amiralaei et al 2011 performed a modified figure of eight like 8 flapping pattern they pointed out that the figure of eight motion trajectory is conducive to the improvement of thrust and propulsion efficiency and can increase lift under specific parameters as mentioned above flapping foils with a biomimetic three degrees of freedom motion trajectory were proved to achieve better propulsion performance which will provide an important guide for the design of uuv propulsive devices therefore to further explore propulsive performances of flapping foils with a biomimetic three degree of freedom movement this paper proposes a new motion trajectory named the infinity sign motion motion and compared it with other biomimetic motion trajectories i e figure of eight like 8 motion elliptical motion and traditional two degrees of freedom motion the effects of the proposed motion on the propulsive performances of flapping foils were studied the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the motion modes and propulsive parameters of a flapping foil are described in section 2 the numerical methods and theoretical review are introduced in section 3 subsequently using numerical simulations the effects of the relative flapping frequency k the ratio of surging amplitude and heaving amplitude β as well as the phase difference between surge and heave motion ϕ on the hydrodynamic performance are evaluated and analyzed in section 4 the final section provides conclusions 2 problem description and methodology 2 1 problem description the biomimetic flapping foil uuvs rely on flapping foil propulsion mechanisms to provide power to realize various underwater movements of the entire uuvs which has the advantages of high propulsion efficiency and better maneuverability the mechanism of uuvs with flapping foils designed by zhang et al 2017 is shown in fig 1 a the flapping foil thruster is mainly composed of drive motors 1 and 6 wing holder 2 flapping foil 3 hook hinge 4 lead screw transmission and gear transmission as shown in fig 1 b taking the movement of the forelimbs of a sea turtle as an example its spatial movement can be decomposed into three parts the upward downward heave movement the forward backward surge movement and the pitch movement around the front edge of the forelimb the three kinds of motions are coupled with each other to form a complex flapping foil 3dof spatial motion in this paper the complex 3dof spatial motion of the flapping foil is simplified into the 3dof motion of a two dimensional plane and considering the periodic characteristics of the flapping foil motion simple harmonic motion is used to simulate the periodic motion of the flapping foil in previous researches the flapping foil performs a traditional movement of two degrees of freedom that is a combination of heave motion and pitch motion which can be explained as follows 1 θ t θ 0 sin ω t ψ 2 y t y 0 sin ω t where θ t and y t are the transient rotational displacement and vertical displacement of the flapping foil respectively θ 0 and y 0 are the corresponding pitching amplitude and heaving amplitude ω is the angular velocity i e ω 2 π f and f is the flapping frequency ψ is the phase difference between pitch and heave and it is set to π 2 in this work isogai et al 1997 the value of the pitching amplitude is set to 45 in this study yang et al 2017 the pitch axis is located at 1 3 of the chord from the leading edge according to related research by hover et al hover et al 2004 read et al 2003 in a recent study the surge motion parallel to oncoming flow is added to the traditional two degrees of freedom motion as a result flapping foils will perform the three degrees of freedom motion mode and then the three degrees of freedom motion trajectory can be obtained the surge motion can be described as follows 3 x t x 0 sin k ω t ϕ where x t is the instantaneous horizontal displacement and x 0 is the surging amplitude ϕ is the phase difference between the surge motion and heave motion k is the relative flapping frequency an adjustment parameter used to modify the frequency of surge motion in a horizontal direction in our study four values of k are considered i e k 0 0 5 1 and 2 different k may produce different motion trajectories as shown in fig 2 a c traditional motion elliptical motion and 8 motion trajectories are obtained by modifying k of 0 1 and 2 yang et al 2017 respectively in fig 2 d the new motion trajectory proposed by this paper can be obtained by defining k of 0 5 besides two dimensionless parameters are used to characterize the propulsive performances of the flapping foils according to the research of anderson et al 1998 the reduced frequency f is redefined as f f c u in this paper to simplify the calculation the dimensionless parameter β β x 0 y 0 is defined as the ratio of surging amplitude x 0 to heaving amplitude y 0 chen et al 2018 as studied by hover et al hover et al 2004 read et al 2003 table 1 lists the detailed information of all the parameters in this research 2 2 propulsion performances during the movement the hydrofoil undergoes the instantaneous thrust force f x t lift force f y t and torque m t respectively the instantaneous thrust force coefficient c t lift force coefficient c l and moment coefficient c m can be described as follows chen et al 2018 4 c t t f x t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 5 c l t f y t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 6 c m t m t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 the consumed power p i n and its corresponding coefficient c p i n can be described as follows 7 p i n f x t d x t d t f y t d y t d t m t d θ t d t 8 c p i n c p t c p l c p m 1 u c t t d x t d t c l t d y t d t c m t d θ t d t c consequently the propulsive efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil can be defined as 9 η c t c p where c t is the mean thrust force coefficient and c p is the mean power coefficient 3 simulation 3 1 governing equations and solver a two dimensional 2d plane flapping foil is selected to investigate the effect of the motion trajectory on the propulsion performance consequently the governing equations for the unsteady incompressible flow around the flapping hydrofoil are the 2d navier stokes equations the unsteady flow field around the hydrofoil was simulated using the software ansys fluent17 2 the governing equations were discretized based on the finite volume method fvm a pressure based separation method was applied to solve the 2d unsteady incompressible navier stokes the unsteady formulation is based on a second order upwind strategy and a second order method is used for the momentum and pressure discretization the coupling algorithm coupled was used for pressure velocity coupling according to the research of xiao and zhu 2014 to approach the actual situation of the uuv flapping hydrofoil movement in the project the reynolds number of 40000 is selected 3 2 computational domain and boundaries conditions in this study the symmetrical profile naca0012 foil is placed in two dimensional turbulent flow and executes synchronous periodic pitch heave and added surge motion an overview of the computational domain and the boundary conditions is presented in fig 3 the domain is divided into an overset zone and a background zone the overset zone performs synchronized surge heave and pitch motions like the hydrofoil consequently to accurately capture the characteristics of the flow field around the hydrofoil surface the overset zone is segmented by a fine structured mesh as for the background zone to improve calculation efficiency it is meshed with a coarser structured grid to reduce the number of cells the connection between the two zones is achieved using the overset mesh interface boudis bayeul lainé benzaoui oualli guerri coutier delgosha the overset mesh technique is used to simulate the combined surge heave and pitch motions without remeshing which is a good way to avoid simulation failures due to numerical divergences besides at the velocity inlet the freestream velocity parallel to the x direction is determined based on the desired reynolds number at the pressure outlet the pressure depends on the freestream velocity the upper and lower boundaries are set as symmetrical boundaries 3 3 grid and time step independence validation a sensitivity study is performed to determine the grid refinement and time step required to ensure that the results do not depend on these numerical settings before conducting a detailed investigation these simulations are performed with the following parameters θ 0 45 y 0 1 c and f 0 125 under the 2d traditional motion at re 40000 the details of the parameters used can be found in table 2 first the verification experiment is carried out using three grids with different mesh densities that is the total number of cells is 26 849 for the coarse grid 345 500 for the medium grid and 545 200 for the fine grid the time step is set to δ t t 200 in all cases fig 4 a b shows the periodic variation of the lift force coefficients c l and the moment coefficient c m over one flapping cycle obtained with the three grids it is shown that the difference between the simulation results obtained with the medium grid and the fine grid is insignificant indeed the mean error between the mean lift coefficient c l and the mean moment coefficient c m is 3 57 and 3 64 respectively in table 2 which is within 5 therefore the fine grid can be replaced by a medium grid to reduce unnecessary power consumption of computer equipment subsequently the independent study of the time step size on the computed results is executed using four different time steps t 100 t 200 t 400 and t 1000 the medium grid is applied to these simulations fig 4 c d displays the time variation of the lift force coefficients c l and the moment coefficient c m over one swing cycle computed with the different time steps this figure shows that the results obtained with δ t t 200 are close to those obtained with δ t t 1000 the mean error between the mean lift coefficient c l and the mean moment coefficient c m are 1 81 and 1 72 respectively in table 2 which is within 5 thus the time step δ t t 400 and the medium grid are used in the subsequent simulation experiments to save time finally the overset mesh method adopted in this work has been well validated and applied for simulation of flapping foil problems in this study the size of the computational domain is 80c 40c after verification of grid and time independence the time step δ t t 400 and the medium grid are used in the following simulations besides the simulation data after ten flapping periods of the flapping foil is selected as the final calculation result 4 results and discussion the main objective of this study is to propose a new motion trajectory named the infinity sign motion motion and compared its effects on propulsion performances with other biomimetic motion trajectories i e elliptical motion 8 motion and traditional motion and the effects of different motion parameters i e the relative flapping frequency k the ratio of surging amplitude and heave amplitude β and the phase difference between surge and heave motion ϕ on hydrodynamic performances of flapping foils are also analyzed 4 1 effects of the relative flapping frequency k in this section the effect of the relative flapping frequency k on the propulsion performance of flapping foils is studied at first since k is an adjustable parameter that is concerned with the relative frequency of surging motion different k produces different motion trajectories in this paper we conduct a performance comparison study between the proposed motion trajectory and other existing motion trajectories that is only the four motion trajectories in fig 2 are studied therefore the value of k is limited to 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 as shown in fig 5 there is a significant discrepancy in the variation trend of the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l for different biomimetic motion trajectories fig 5 shows the evolution of the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l of the above three motion modes in a flapping cycle it can be observed from fig 5 a that the c t changes three times in the motion of the flapping foil and three thrust peaks c t m a x c t 0 appear for the elliptical motion only a thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 appears in one cycle however for the 8 motion the c t changes two times two thrust peaks c t m a x c t 0 and a drag peak c t m i n c t 0 appear and c t m a x c t 0 c t m i n c t 0 overall results illustrate that the motion of a flapping foil can produce larger thrust force than that of the other three kinds of movements in fig 5 b it is shown that the c l changes two times for the three kinds of motion modes and two lift peaks c l m a x c l 0 appear moreover the lift peaks for the motion and 8 motion are further higher than that of the other two motions illustrating that more lift force can be obtained when the surge motion and heave motion have a different flapping frequency as shown in fig 6 the mean thrust coefficient c t mean power coefficient c p and thrust efficiency η t for the motion are compared with the other motions at f 0 125 β 1 ϕ 0 and θ 0 45 the results demonstrate that the values of c t and η t with k 0 5 are higher than that of the other three motions illustrating that the motion has better propulsive performance and efficiency aiming to further investigate the effect of different motion trajectories on the hydrodynamic performance of the flapping hydrofoil fig 7 a d show the pressure contours of hydrofoils with four motion trajectories at different moments corresponding to the motion elliptical motion 8 motion and traditional motion in fig 5 from the comparison of fig 7 a d it can be seen that the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the hydrofoil for the motion is the largest in fig 7 a moreover at t t 1 4 t t 1 2 and t t 3 4 the direction of motion of the hydrofoil is the same as the direction of thrust force that is a positive thrust is generated which is consistent with the three positive thrust peaks in the instantaneous thrust coefficient in fig 5 a from fig 7 c the pressure difference of the 8 motion is almost equivalent to that of the motion but it is a negative pressure difference at t t 1 2 and only two positive thrust peaks are produced at t t 1 4 and t t 3 4 in addition in fig 7 b d the pressure difference changes of elliptical motion and traditional motion in one cycle are similar they are both much smaller than that of the motion which are consistent with the lower thrust coefficients c t in fig 5 a overall the motion of flapping foils can generate three positive thrust peaks c t m a x in one flapping cycle while the elliptical and 8 motions can only produce one or two positive thrust peaks c t m a x the results illustrate that the proposed motion of a flapping foil can generate larger thrust force and obtain higher propulsive efficiency η t compared with the other three motions 4 2 effect of the ratio of surge and heave amplitude β to investigate the influence of the ratio of the surge and heave amplitude on the hydrodynamic performance c t and η t of a flapping foil for the proposed motion a dimensionless parameter β ranging from 0 0 to 2 0 with an interval of 0 25 is selected to describe the amplitude ratio at y 0 1 c f 0 125 ϕ 0 and θ 0 45 4 2 1 effect on hydrodynamic performance to study the effect of the amplitude ratio β on the hydrodynamic performance for the proposed motion the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l are determined at first figs 8 10 display c t and c l in one cycle for the three motion trajectories for different β as seen from figs 8 a 9 a and 10 a in all cases the variations trends of c t is similar to different β for the three three degree of freedom motion trajectories namely the thrust peak c t m a x increases gradually with the increase of β the variation of c t is that the motion has three apparent positive thrust peak c t m a x while the elliptical motion or the 8 motion only has one or two indicating that the motion can produce larger thrust force than the other two three degree of freedom motions in one flapping cycle in figs 8 b 9 b and 10 b it is shown that the c l for the three three degree of freedom motions all have two positive lift peaks c l m a x c l 0 and two negative lift peaks c l m i n c l 0 moreover for the motion all curves of c l have lightly variation with the increase of β but for the other two three degree of freedom motions the variation trends of c l is significant the results demonstrate that the amplitude ratio β has a slight effect on the lift coefficient for the motion compared to the other two three degree of freedom movements 4 2 2 effect on mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency to further investigate the propulsion performance of the hydrofoil the mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency are studied based on the above mentioned instantaneous hydrodynamic performance fig 11 a c shows the results of the mean thrust coefficient c t mean power coefficient c p and propulsive efficiency η t for these motion trajectories with different β respectively in fig 11 a the c t of the motion and 8 motion all increase with the increase of β explaining that c t for the and 8 motions all increase with higher surging amplitude x 0 while the c t of elliptical motion exhibits an initial large rate of increase with increasing β and then decreases at β 0 75 furthermore each value on the c t curve of the motion is further greater than that of the other two motions illustrating that the motion of a flapping foil can generate larger thrust force as shown in fig 11 b the changing trend of c p is the same as that of c t for the motion and the value of c p is much larger than that of traditional motion however the values of c p for the 8 and elliptical motion exhibit nearly the same as that of the traditional motion trajectory with increasing β and then increases rapidly with a further increase of β moreover the growth rate of c p for the 8 motion is gradually increasing and the growth rate of c p for the elliptical motion gradually decreases consequently in fig 11 c the result shows that when the value of β is in the range of 0 5 1 the η t for the 8 motion trajectory is much lower than that of the elliptical motion trajectory the more specific conclusion that can be drawn is that the highest propulsive efficiency appears under the condition of β 0 5 for the 8 motion and β 0 75 for the elliptical motion respectively besides the η t of the motion increase with the increase of β and each value of it is further greater than that of the other three motions illustrating that the motion of a flapping foil has higher propulsive efficiency and better propulsive performance as shown in fig 11 c it is worth noting that the η t curve for the motion keeps rising without a turning point when the value of β is in the range of 0 1 to further investigate the optimal value of β for the motion achieving the best efficiency the values of β ranging from 1 0 to 2 0 with an interval of 0 25 were added to study the best efficiency of the motion the result is shown in fig 12 the variations of c t and c p in one cycle for β ranging from 0 to 1 are similar and they grow at almost the same rate however when β is in the range of 1 2 the growth rate of c p has increased significantly while the growth rate of c t has remained unchanged consequently the η t curve first increases and then decreases with β ranging from 0 to 2 and the highest propulsive efficiency appears under the condition of β 1 for the motion 4 3 effect of the phase difference between heave and surge ϕ as mentioned from section 4 2 such optimal parameter of β 1 for the motion β 0 5 for the 8 motion and β 0 75 for the elliptical motion is selected to investigate the effect of the phase difference ϕ between heave and surge motion on the hydrodynamic performance mean thrust coefficient c t and propulsive efficiency η t of a flapping foil for the proposed motion besides eight values of ϕ 135 90 45 0 45 90 135 and 180 are fixed at f 0 125 and θ 0 45 4 3 1 effect on hydrodynamic performance to study the effect of the phase difference ϕ on the hydrodynamic performance of a flapping foil the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l are determined at first figs 13 15 display c t and c l in one cycle for the three three degree of freedom motion trajectories with different ϕ as seen in fig 13 a and b for the motion it is found that the second positive thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 gradually decreases with the increasing of ϕ and a negative thrust peak c t m i n c t 0 may appear at ϕ 90 while the first and third c t m a x may increase or decrease but both are positive values the results demonstrate that the motion can generate more thrust force at a smaller ϕ in fig 13 b all curves of c l show the same trend with different ϕ for the motion at t 0 1 2 t a negative lift peak c l m i n c l 0 appears at first and then a positive peak c l m a x c l 0 occurs however at t 1 2 t t the result is exactly the opposite for the elliptical motion similar variation trends are observed in fig 14 a and b but there is only one or two thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 in addition in all cases the thrust peak c t m a x decreases with the increase of ϕ and may produce a smaller second positive thrust peak than that of the first one at ϕ 45 therefore the overall c t will decrease with the increasing ϕ as shown in fig 14 b the trends in the c l variations in all different ϕ are similar to that of the motion for the 8 motion in fig 15 a and b at t 0 1 2 t in all cases of ϕ 0 a negative thrust peak c t m i n c t 0 is generated at first and then a positive thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 is obtained at t 1 2 t t and the positive peak of c t is much larger than that of the negative one on the contrary in all cases of ϕ 0 a positive thrust peak c t m a x is generated firstly at t 0 1 2 t and then a negative thrust peak c t m i n is obtained at t 1 2 t t and c t m a x c t 0 c t m i n c t 0 the results demonstrate that the variation in the direction of the 8 motion determines the sequence of thrust force generation or drag force generation in a flapping cycle in fig 15 b with the increase of ϕ a positive lift peak c t m a x decreases significantly at t 0 1 2 t and then a negative lift peak c t m i n start to product at t 1 2 t t indicating that the increase of ϕ for the 8 motion is not conducive to generate lift force 4 3 2 effect on mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency to further investigate the propulsion performance of the hydrofoil the mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency are studied based on the above mentioned instantaneous hydrodynamic performance fig 16 plots the variations of c t c p and η t with different ϕ for different movements in fig 16 a the trends of the c t variations in the motion and the elliptical motion are the same for all different ϕ namely the values of c t on both sides of ϕ 0 show an almost symmetrical trend under the same value of ϕ and a maximum value gets at ϕ 0 in addition the c t curve for the 8 motion achieves two peaks at ϕ 45 and ϕ 90 respectively in general the flapping foil with the motion has a much higher mean thrust coefficient c t compared to the other two three degree of freedom motions as seen in fig 16 b c the behaviors of the c p and η t with different ϕ show significant variations for different kinds of motions specifically the η t of the motion is always higher than that of traditional motion with any ϕ and the maximum η t occurs at ϕ 45 the η t for the elliptical motion is always higher than that of traditional motion under the condition of ϕ 90 and the maximum η t occurs at ϕ 45 the η t under the 8 motion is always higher than that of traditional motion with 100 ϕ 100 and the maximum η t occurs at ϕ 90 in general the overall conclusion that can be drawn is that the flapping foils with the motion can obtain higher thrust force and propulsive efficiency than the comparable motions the calculated c t and η t of the proposed three degree of freedom motion are listed in table 3 under the optimal motion parameter configuration of different motion trajectories the proposed motion improves the propulsion efficiency by nearly 10 compared with the elliptical motion and the 8 motion similarly it has achieved four times as much thrust force as that of the traditional two degree of freedom motion and the increase of propulsive efficiency is up to 29 47 5

other biomimetic motion trajectories i e figure of eight like 8 motion elliptical motion and two degree of freedom traditional motion under the combination of different parameters the four kinds of motion trajectories were investigated using a cfd implementation respectively after that the systematic simulation of flapping foils for different motion trajectories was performed based on the numerical results some valuable conclusions can be obtained and they are listed as follows 1 the proposed motion has a positive effect on the mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency the results demonstrate that the motion can generate more thrust force and obtain higher propulsive efficiency η t in comparison to other kinds of motions specifically the motion of flapping foils can generate three positive thrust peaks in one flapping cycle while the elliptical and 8 motions can only produce one or two positive thrust peaks 2 the motion can achieve more thrust force and higher efficiency with a smaller phase difference ϕ and higher amplitude ratio β and the highest thrust force and propulsive efficiency appear at ϕ 0 and ϕ 45 for β 1 respectively 3 under the optimal motion

engineering such as wave energy recovery huang et al 2017 ji and huang 2017 turbine power generation kinsey and dumas 2012 ship propulsion belibassakis and politis 2013 and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs propulsion etc the traditional propulsion systems of ships and uuvs mostly use propeller propellers but it is difficult to make a big breakthrough in propulsion efficiency bradley et al 2001 as a new type of propulsion flapping foils show great promise and prospects for improving the propulsion performance of uuvs chu et al 2007 tian et al 2012a and more and more investigations on flapping foils were completed by both experiments and numerical simulations a large number of studies triantafyllou et al 2004 have proved that the flap foil system is one of the most valuable means that can be used to enhance the propulsion performance and stability of ships and uuvs in recent decades to improve the propulsive efficiency of flapping foils a great deal of effort has been devoted to the effect of motion parameters on the hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils most of it is mainly about the shape and movement of the hydrofoil lee et al lee and lee 2013 lee et al 2015 studied the principle of the flapping foil movement the results illustrate that the symmetric hydrofoil has a more stable propulsive performance than the asymmetric hydrofoil furthermore compared with delayed and advanced rotation symmetrical rotation generates a better propulsive speed with less fluctuation and then ashraf et al 2011 studied the effect of hydrofoil thickness and camber on its propulsion performance and concluded that the hydrofoil with camber has almost no advantages compared to symmetric hydrofoils and thin hydrofoils can bring more thrust force than thick hydrofoils to sum up in terms of the hydrofoil shape a thinner symmetrical hydrofoil can generate more thrust and enhance propulsion efficiency subsequently with further research on the propulsion performance of the flapping foil the movement mode of the flapping foil has gradually become the focus sarkar and venkatraman 2006 investigated the effects of sinusoidal motion asymmetric sinusoidal motion and constant heave rate oscillations on the propulsive performance of the heaving hydrofoil they concluded that the asymmetrical motion achieves more thrust and higher propulsive efficiency than that of the sinusoidal motion similarly lu et al 2013a 2013b studied the impact of large amplitude and nonsinusoidal motions on the propulsion performance of flapping foil the results showed that the thrust force increases with increasing amplitude but as the amplitude further increases the thrust will decrease and the propulsion efficiency will be significantly reduced after that xiao et al xiao and zhu 2014 xiao and liao 2009 xiao et al 2012 implemented numerical research to study the effect of asymmetric sinusoidal trajectory on the thrust and propulsion performances of the symmetric hydrofoil the results illustrate that the thrust increases with the enhancement of the reverse kármán vortex street and the reverse kármán vortex street increases with the higher asymmetry motion so the symmetric trajectory is conducive to the generation of thrust besides they combined a sinusoidal heave motion and a trapezoid like pitch motion to obtain a non sinusoidal trajectory the results showed that the non sinusoidal motion can achieve a 50 increase in thrust and propulsion efficiency within the corresponding test parameters up to now great progress has been made in the propulsive performances of flapping foils however one should not oversimplify relative biological motions into the single degree of freedom or two degrees of freedom motions and the motion modes of a flapping foil should be closer to the biomimetic movement in nature animals such as penguins and turtles can add other similar translational motion to the vertical motion of their wings to enhance propulsive performance singh et al 2004 izraelevitz and triantafyllou 2014 xu et al 2009 furthermore the conclusion that the combination of lateral movement and vertical movement can improve the propulsion performance and efficiency of the flapping wing has been verified in the experiment of licht et al 2010 besides font et al 2011 designed a three degree of freedom sea turtle flapping wing device based on a ball hinged tandem mechanism and conducted pool tests for the impact of different motion trajectories on propulsive performance tian et al 2012b proposed a novel strategy by adding a surge motion to the heave and pitch motion of a flapping foil it was found that the larger thrust and propulsive efficiency could be achieved compared with traditional motion subsequently esfahani et al 2015 proved that the elliptical motion trajectory can significantly influence the hydrodynamics and performance of either heaving or pitching heaving foil yang et al 2017 and amiralaei et al 2011 performed a modified figure of eight like 8 flapping pattern they pointed out that the figure of eight motion trajectory is conducive to the improvement of thrust and propulsion efficiency and can increase lift under specific parameters as mentioned above flapping foils with a biomimetic three degrees of freedom motion trajectory were proved to achieve better propulsion performance which will provide an important guide for the design of uuv propulsive devices therefore to further explore propulsive performances of flapping foils with a biomimetic three degree of freedom movement this paper proposes a new motion trajectory named the infinity sign motion motion and compared it with other biomimetic motion trajectories i e figure of eight like 8 motion elliptical motion and traditional two degrees of freedom motion the effects of the proposed motion on the propulsive performances of flapping foils were studied the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the motion modes and propulsive parameters of a flapping foil are described in section 2 the numerical methods and theoretical review are introduced in section 3 subsequently using numerical simulations the effects of the relative flapping frequency k the ratio of surging amplitude and heaving amplitude β as well as the phase difference between surge and heave motion ϕ on the hydrodynamic performance are evaluated and analyzed in section 4 the final section provides conclusions 2 problem description and methodology 2 1 problem description the biomimetic flapping foil uuvs rely on flapping foil propulsion mechanisms to provide power to realize various underwater movements of the entire uuvs which has the advantages of high propulsion efficiency and better maneuverability the mechanism of uuvs with flapping foils designed by zhang et al 2017 is shown in fig 1 a the flapping foil thruster is mainly composed of drive motors 1 and 6 wing holder 2 flapping foil 3 hook hinge 4 lead screw transmission and gear transmission as shown in fig 1 b taking the movement of the forelimbs of a sea turtle as an example its spatial movement can be decomposed into three parts the upward downward heave movement the forward backward surge movement and the pitch movement around the front edge of the forelimb the three kinds of motions are coupled with each other to form a complex flapping foil 3dof spatial motion in this paper the complex 3dof spatial motion of the flapping foil is simplified into the 3dof motion of a two dimensional plane and considering the periodic characteristics of the flapping foil motion simple harmonic motion is used to simulate the periodic motion of the flapping foil in previous researches the flapping foil performs a traditional movement of two degrees of freedom that is a combination of heave motion and pitch motion which can be explained as follows 1 θ t θ 0 sin ω t ψ 2 y t y 0 sin ω t where θ t and y t are the transient rotational displacement and vertical displacement of the flapping foil respectively θ 0 and y 0 are the corresponding pitching amplitude and heaving amplitude ω is the angular velocity i e ω 2 π f and f is the flapping frequency ψ is the phase difference between pitch and heave and it is set to π 2 in this work isogai et al 1997 the value of the pitching amplitude is set to 45 in this study yang et al 2017 the pitch axis is located at 1 3 of the chord from the leading edge according to related research by hover et al hover et al 2004 read et al 2003 in a recent study the surge motion parallel to oncoming flow is added to the traditional two degrees of freedom motion as a result flapping foils will perform the three degrees of freedom motion mode and then the three degrees of freedom motion trajectory can be obtained the surge motion can be described as follows 3 x t x 0 sin k ω t ϕ where x t is the instantaneous horizontal displacement and x 0 is the surging amplitude ϕ is the phase difference between the surge motion and heave motion k is the relative flapping frequency an adjustment parameter used to modify the frequency of surge motion in a horizontal direction in our study four values of k are considered i e k 0 0 5 1 and 2 different k may produce different motion trajectories as shown in fig 2 a c traditional motion elliptical motion and 8 motion trajectories are obtained by modifying k of 0 1 and 2 yang et al 2017 respectively in fig 2 d the new motion trajectory proposed by this paper can be obtained by defining k of 0 5 besides two dimensionless parameters are used to characterize the propulsive performances of the flapping foils according to the research of anderson et al 1998 the reduced frequency f is redefined as f f c u in this paper to simplify the calculation the dimensionless parameter β β x 0 y 0 is defined as the ratio of surging amplitude x 0 to heaving amplitude y 0 chen et al 2018 as studied by hover et al hover et al 2004 read et al 2003 table 1 lists the detailed information of all the parameters in this research 2 2 propulsion performances during the movement the hydrofoil undergoes the instantaneous thrust force f x t lift force f y t and torque m t respectively the instantaneous thrust force coefficient c t lift force coefficient c l and moment coefficient c m can be described as follows chen et al 2018 4 c t t f x t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 5 c l t f y t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 6 c m t m t 0 5 ρ u 2 c 2 the consumed power p i n and its corresponding coefficient c p i n can be described as follows 7 p i n f x t d x t d t f y t d y t d t m t d θ t d t 8 c p i n c p t c p l c p m 1 u c t t d x t d t c l t d y t d t c m t d θ t d t c consequently the propulsive efficiency of the flapping hydrofoil can be defined as 9 η c t c p where c t is the mean thrust force coefficient and c p is the mean power coefficient 3 simulation 3 1 governing equations and solver a two dimensional 2d plane flapping foil is selected to investigate the effect of the motion trajectory on the propulsion performance consequently the governing equations for the unsteady incompressible flow around the flapping hydrofoil are the 2d navier stokes equations the unsteady flow field around the hydrofoil was simulated using the software ansys fluent17 2 the governing equations were discretized based on the finite volume method fvm a pressure based separation method was applied to solve the 2d unsteady incompressible navier stokes the unsteady formulation is based on a second order upwind strategy and a second order method is used for the momentum and pressure discretization the coupling algorithm coupled was used for pressure velocity coupling according to the research of xiao and zhu 2014 to approach the actual situation of the uuv flapping hydrofoil movement in the project the reynolds number of 40000 is selected 3 2 computational domain and boundaries conditions in this study the symmetrical profile naca0012 foil is placed in two dimensional turbulent flow and executes synchronous periodic pitch heave and added surge motion an overview of the computational domain and the boundary conditions is presented in fig 3 the domain is divided into an overset zone and a background zone the overset zone performs synchronized surge heave and pitch motions like the hydrofoil consequently to accurately capture the characteristics of the flow field around the hydrofoil surface the overset zone is segmented by a fine structured mesh as for the background zone to improve calculation efficiency it is meshed with a coarser structured grid to reduce the number of cells the connection between the two zones is achieved using the overset mesh interface boudis bayeul lainé benzaoui oualli guerri coutier delgosha the overset mesh technique is used to simulate the combined surge heave and pitch motions without remeshing which is a good way to avoid simulation failures due to numerical divergences besides at the velocity inlet the freestream velocity parallel to the x direction is determined based on the desired reynolds number at the pressure outlet the pressure depends on the freestream velocity the upper and lower boundaries are set as symmetrical boundaries 3 3 grid and time step independence validation a sensitivity study is performed to determine the grid refinement and time step required to ensure that the results do not depend on these numerical settings before conducting a detailed investigation these simulations are performed with the following parameters θ 0 45 y 0 1 c and f 0 125 under the 2d traditional motion at re 40000 the details of the parameters used can be found in table 2 first the verification experiment is carried out using three grids with different mesh densities that is the total number of cells is 26 849 for the coarse grid 345 500 for the medium grid and 545 200 for the fine grid the time step is set to δ t t 200 in all cases fig 4 a b shows the periodic variation of the lift force coefficients c l and the moment coefficient c m over one flapping cycle obtained with the three grids it is shown that the difference between the simulation results obtained with the medium grid and the fine grid is insignificant indeed the mean error between the mean lift coefficient c l and the mean moment coefficient c m is 3 57 and 3 64 respectively in table 2 which is within 5 therefore the fine grid can be replaced by a medium grid to reduce unnecessary power consumption of computer equipment subsequently the independent study of the time step size on the computed results is executed using four different time steps t 100 t 200 t 400 and t 1000 the medium grid is applied to these simulations fig 4 c d displays the time variation of the lift force coefficients c l and the moment coefficient c m over one swing cycle computed with the different time steps this figure shows that the results obtained with δ t t 200 are close to those obtained with δ t t 1000 the mean error between the mean lift coefficient c l and the mean moment coefficient c m are 1 81 and 1 72 respectively in table 2 which is within 5 thus the time step δ t t 400 and the medium grid are used in the subsequent simulation experiments to save time finally the overset mesh method adopted in this work has been well validated and applied for simulation of flapping foil problems in this study the size of the computational domain is 80c 40c after verification of grid and time independence the time step δ t t 400 and the medium grid are used in the following simulations besides the simulation data after ten flapping periods of the flapping foil is selected as the final calculation result 4 results and discussion the main objective of this study is to propose a new motion trajectory named the infinity sign motion motion and compared its effects on propulsion performances with other biomimetic motion trajectories i e elliptical motion 8 motion and traditional motion and the effects of different motion parameters i e the relative flapping frequency k the ratio of surging amplitude and heave amplitude β and the phase difference between surge and heave motion ϕ on hydrodynamic performances of flapping foils are also analyzed 4 1 effects of the relative flapping frequency k in this section the effect of the relative flapping frequency k on the propulsion performance of flapping foils is studied at first since k is an adjustable parameter that is concerned with the relative frequency of surging motion different k produces different motion trajectories in this paper we conduct a performance comparison study between the proposed motion trajectory and other existing motion trajectories that is only the four motion trajectories in fig 2 are studied therefore the value of k is limited to 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 as shown in fig 5 there is a significant discrepancy in the variation trend of the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l for different biomimetic motion trajectories fig 5 shows the evolution of the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l of the above three motion modes in a flapping cycle it can be observed from fig 5 a that the c t changes three times in the motion of the flapping foil and three thrust peaks c t m a x c t 0 appear for the elliptical motion only a thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 appears in one cycle however for the 8 motion the c t changes two times two thrust peaks c t m a x c t 0 and a drag peak c t m i n c t 0 appear and c t m a x c t 0 c t m i n c t 0 overall results illustrate that the motion of a flapping foil can produce larger thrust force than that of the other three kinds of movements in fig 5 b it is shown that the c l changes two times for the three kinds of motion modes and two lift peaks c l m a x c l 0 appear moreover the lift peaks for the motion and 8 motion are further higher than that of the other two motions illustrating that more lift force can be obtained when the surge motion and heave motion have a different flapping frequency as shown in fig 6 the mean thrust coefficient c t mean power coefficient c p and thrust efficiency η t for the motion are compared with the other motions at f 0 125 β 1 ϕ 0 and θ 0 45 the results demonstrate that the values of c t and η t with k 0 5 are higher than that of the other three motions illustrating that the motion has better propulsive performance and efficiency aiming to further investigate the effect of different motion trajectories on the hydrodynamic performance of the flapping hydrofoil fig 7 a d show the pressure contours of hydrofoils with four motion trajectories at different moments corresponding to the motion elliptical motion 8 motion and traditional motion in fig 5 from the comparison of fig 7 a d it can be seen that the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the hydrofoil for the motion is the largest in fig 7 a moreover at t t 1 4 t t 1 2 and t t 3 4 the direction of motion of the hydrofoil is the same as the direction of thrust force that is a positive thrust is generated which is consistent with the three positive thrust peaks in the instantaneous thrust coefficient in fig 5 a from fig 7 c the pressure difference of the 8 motion is almost equivalent to that of the motion but it is a negative pressure difference at t t 1 2 and only two positive thrust peaks are produced at t t 1 4 and t t 3 4 in addition in fig 7 b d the pressure difference changes of elliptical motion and traditional motion in one cycle are similar they are both much smaller than that of the motion which are consistent with the lower thrust coefficients c t in fig 5 a overall the motion of flapping foils can generate three positive thrust peaks c t m a x in one flapping cycle while the elliptical and 8 motions can only produce one or two positive thrust peaks c t m a x the results illustrate that the proposed motion of a flapping foil can generate larger thrust force and obtain higher propulsive efficiency η t compared with the other three motions 4 2 effect of the ratio of surge and heave amplitude β to investigate the influence of the ratio of the surge and heave amplitude on the hydrodynamic performance c t and η t of a flapping foil for the proposed motion a dimensionless parameter β ranging from 0 0 to 2 0 with an interval of 0 25 is selected to describe the amplitude ratio at y 0 1 c f 0 125 ϕ 0 and θ 0 45 4 2 1 effect on hydrodynamic performance to study the effect of the amplitude ratio β on the hydrodynamic performance for the proposed motion the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l are determined at first figs 8 10 display c t and c l in one cycle for the three motion trajectories for different β as seen from figs 8 a 9 a and 10 a in all cases the variations trends of c t is similar to different β for the three three degree of freedom motion trajectories namely the thrust peak c t m a x increases gradually with the increase of β the variation of c t is that the motion has three apparent positive thrust peak c t m a x while the elliptical motion or the 8 motion only has one or two indicating that the motion can produce larger thrust force than the other two three degree of freedom motions in one flapping cycle in figs 8 b 9 b and 10 b it is shown that the c l for the three three degree of freedom motions all have two positive lift peaks c l m a x c l 0 and two negative lift peaks c l m i n c l 0 moreover for the motion all curves of c l have lightly variation with the increase of β but for the other two three degree of freedom motions the variation trends of c l is significant the results demonstrate that the amplitude ratio β has a slight effect on the lift coefficient for the motion compared to the other two three degree of freedom movements 4 2 2 effect on mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency to further investigate the propulsion performance of the hydrofoil the mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency are studied based on the above mentioned instantaneous hydrodynamic performance fig 11 a c shows the results of the mean thrust coefficient c t mean power coefficient c p and propulsive efficiency η t for these motion trajectories with different β respectively in fig 11 a the c t of the motion and 8 motion all increase with the increase of β explaining that c t for the and 8 motions all increase with higher surging amplitude x 0 while the c t of elliptical motion exhibits an initial large rate of increase with increasing β and then decreases at β 0 75 furthermore each value on the c t curve of the motion is further greater than that of the other two motions illustrating that the motion of a flapping foil can generate larger thrust force as shown in fig 11 b the changing trend of c p is the same as that of c t for the motion and the value of c p is much larger than that of traditional motion however the values of c p for the 8 and elliptical motion exhibit nearly the same as that of the traditional motion trajectory with increasing β and then increases rapidly with a further increase of β moreover the growth rate of c p for the 8 motion is gradually increasing and the growth rate of c p for the elliptical motion gradually decreases consequently in fig 11 c the result shows that when the value of β is in the range of 0 5 1 the η t for the 8 motion trajectory is much lower than that of the elliptical motion trajectory the more specific conclusion that can be drawn is that the highest propulsive efficiency appears under the condition of β 0 5 for the 8 motion and β 0 75 for the elliptical motion respectively besides the η t of the motion increase with the increase of β and each value of it is further greater than that of the other three motions illustrating that the motion of a flapping foil has higher propulsive efficiency and better propulsive performance as shown in fig 11 c it is worth noting that the η t curve for the motion keeps rising without a turning point when the value of β is in the range of 0 1 to further investigate the optimal value of β for the motion achieving the best efficiency the values of β ranging from 1 0 to 2 0 with an interval of 0 25 were added to study the best efficiency of the motion the result is shown in fig 12 the variations of c t and c p in one cycle for β ranging from 0 to 1 are similar and they grow at almost the same rate however when β is in the range of 1 2 the growth rate of c p has increased significantly while the growth rate of c t has remained unchanged consequently the η t curve first increases and then decreases with β ranging from 0 to 2 and the highest propulsive efficiency appears under the condition of β 1 for the motion 4 3 effect of the phase difference between heave and surge ϕ as mentioned from section 4 2 such optimal parameter of β 1 for the motion β 0 5 for the 8 motion and β 0 75 for the elliptical motion is selected to investigate the effect of the phase difference ϕ between heave and surge motion on the hydrodynamic performance mean thrust coefficient c t and propulsive efficiency η t of a flapping foil for the proposed motion besides eight values of ϕ 135 90 45 0 45 90 135 and 180 are fixed at f 0 125 and θ 0 45 4 3 1 effect on hydrodynamic performance to study the effect of the phase difference ϕ on the hydrodynamic performance of a flapping foil the instantaneous thrust coefficient c t and lift coefficient c l are determined at first figs 13 15 display c t and c l in one cycle for the three three degree of freedom motion trajectories with different ϕ as seen in fig 13 a and b for the motion it is found that the second positive thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 gradually decreases with the increasing of ϕ and a negative thrust peak c t m i n c t 0 may appear at ϕ 90 while the first and third c t m a x may increase or decrease but both are positive values the results demonstrate that the motion can generate more thrust force at a smaller ϕ in fig 13 b all curves of c l show the same trend with different ϕ for the motion at t 0 1 2 t a negative lift peak c l m i n c l 0 appears at first and then a positive peak c l m a x c l 0 occurs however at t 1 2 t t the result is exactly the opposite for the elliptical motion similar variation trends are observed in fig 14 a and b but there is only one or two thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 in addition in all cases the thrust peak c t m a x decreases with the increase of ϕ and may produce a smaller second positive thrust peak than that of the first one at ϕ 45 therefore the overall c t will decrease with the increasing ϕ as shown in fig 14 b the trends in the c l variations in all different ϕ are similar to that of the motion for the 8 motion in fig 15 a and b at t 0 1 2 t in all cases of ϕ 0 a negative thrust peak c t m i n c t 0 is generated at first and then a positive thrust peak c t m a x c t 0 is obtained at t 1 2 t t and the positive peak of c t is much larger than that of the negative one on the contrary in all cases of ϕ 0 a positive thrust peak c t m a x is generated firstly at t 0 1 2 t and then a negative thrust peak c t m i n is obtained at t 1 2 t t and c t m a x c t 0 c t m i n c t 0 the results demonstrate that the variation in the direction of the 8 motion determines the sequence of thrust force generation or drag force generation in a flapping cycle in fig 15 b with the increase of ϕ a positive lift peak c t m a x decreases significantly at t 0 1 2 t and then a negative lift peak c t m i n start to product at t 1 2 t t indicating that the increase of ϕ for the 8 motion is not conducive to generate lift force 4 3 2 effect on mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency to further investigate the propulsion performance of the hydrofoil the mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency are studied based on the above mentioned instantaneous hydrodynamic performance fig 16 plots the variations of c t c p and η t with different ϕ for different movements in fig 16 a the trends of the c t variations in the motion and the elliptical motion are the same for all different ϕ namely the values of c t on both sides of ϕ 0 show an almost symmetrical trend under the same value of ϕ and a maximum value gets at ϕ 0 in addition the c t curve for the 8 motion achieves two peaks at ϕ 45 and ϕ 90 respectively in general the flapping foil with the motion has a much higher mean thrust coefficient c t compared to the other two three degree of freedom motions as seen in fig 16 b c the behaviors of the c p and η t with different ϕ show significant variations for different kinds of motions specifically the η t of the motion is always higher than that of traditional motion with any ϕ and the maximum η t occurs at ϕ 45 the η t for the elliptical motion is always higher than that of traditional motion under the condition of ϕ 90 and the maximum η t occurs at ϕ 45 the η t under the 8 motion is always higher than that of traditional motion with 100 ϕ 100 and the maximum η t occurs at ϕ 90 in general the overall conclusion that can be drawn is that the flapping foils with the motion can obtain higher thrust force and propulsive efficiency than the comparable motions the calculated c t and η t of the proposed three degree of freedom motion are listed in table 3 under the optimal motion parameter configuration of different motion trajectories the proposed motion improves the propulsion efficiency by nearly 10 compared with the elliptical motion and the 8 motion similarly it has achieved four times as much thrust force as that of the traditional two degree of freedom motion and the increase of propulsive efficiency is up to 29 47 5 conclusions this paper proposes a new three degree of freedom motion trajectory named the infinity sign motion motion to enhance thrust force and propulsive efficiency of uuvs and compared it with other biomimetic motion trajectories i e figure of eight like 8 motion elliptical motion and two degree of freedom traditional motion under the combination of different parameters the four kinds of motion trajectories were investigated using a cfd implementation respectively after that the systematic simulation of flapping foils for different motion trajectories was performed based on the numerical results some valuable conclusions can be obtained and they are listed as follows 1 the proposed motion has a positive effect on the mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency the results demonstrate that the motion can generate more thrust force and obtain higher propulsive efficiency η t in comparison to other kinds of motions specifically the motion of flapping foils can generate three positive thrust peaks in one flapping cycle while the elliptical and 8 motions can only produce one or two positive thrust peaks 2 the motion can achieve more thrust force and higher efficiency with a smaller phase difference ϕ and higher amplitude ratio β and the highest thrust force and propulsive efficiency appear at ϕ 0 and ϕ 45 for β 1 respectively 3 under the optimal motion parameter configuration the proposed motion had achieved four times as much thrust force as that of the two degree of freedom traditional motion and the propulsive efficiency increase of 29 47
