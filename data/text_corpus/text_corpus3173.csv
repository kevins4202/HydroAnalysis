microplastics in wastewater i e typically polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp pe and ps during biological hydrogen production from macro to micro perspective the changes of physical characteristics eps structure hydrogen production activity and microbial community of ahpg were comprehensively characterized when acutely exposed to different levels of coexisting microplastics the

system and the possible toxic mechanisms of microplastics were specifically elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics and ahpgs in this work four types of microplastics typically co existing in wastewater i e pet pp pe and ps particle sizes 150 μm were obtained from zhongcheng co ltd china the seed ahpgs as the inocula for hydrogen production were harvested from a laboratory up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb the uasb treated synthetic wastewater containing sucrose of 5 3 g cod l with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 18 h at 38 1 c the volatile suspended solid total suspended solid vss tss value in the ahpg was 88 2 2 2 experiments of acute microplastics exposure to ahpgs the acute exposure experiments were assayed with three groups of serum bottles the ahpg of 2 g tss l was inoculated in each serum bottle and cultured with the synthetic wastewater using glucose as carbon source the compositions of the synthetic wastewater used mg l in miliq water were cod 8000 glucose nh4hco3 1196 k2hpo4 3h2o 312 mgcl2 6h2o 100 cacl2 50 fecl2 25 cocl2 6h2o 5 nacl 10 mncl2 4h2o 5 nh4 6mo7o24 15 alcl3 2 5 h3bo4 5 cucl2 5h2o 5 nicl2 6h2o 5 and zncl2 5 the coexisting microplastics with typical fraction in wastewater pet 36 pp 8 pe 42 and ps 15 were then added into three groups of reactors at three levels of 0 40 and 80 mg l respectively these four types of microplastics at these proportions are commonly detected in the real wastewater such as in the influents of wastewater treatment plants in sydney australia ziajahromi et al 2017 hence these microplastics were used to perform this work one group without microplastics exposure was used as control while the other two groups with the presence of microplastics at a low and a high level were served as experimental groups for comparison each group was repeated in triplicate all serum bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas to ensure anaerobic condition and sealed tightly and then placed in an incubator at temperature of 37 1 during the experiments the ph in each bottle was constantly stabilized at 4 5 to completely inhibit methanogens activity for facilitating hydrogen production the volume and proportion of gasses i e h2 co2 and n2 produced were periodically monitored for about 15 days till hydrogen production dropped to a negligible level 1 2 3 granules characterization and microplastics observation microplastics bearing ahpg samples through the whole acute exposure period were withdrawn from each reactor and conducted a series of analysis and characterization scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f japan was applied to visually characterize the surface and interior morphology of granules as detailed in the si particle size distribution of granules was measured by a laser particle size analyzer after microplastics were washed out using sodium chloride solution li et al 2018 the live and dead microbial cells in granules were visualized and counted according to hao et al 2009 briefly live dead baclight bacterial viability kit was used to stain the live and dead cells granules were washed three times using phosphate buffer solution and frozen at 20 c after 24 h the granules were sectioned into 10 μm sections and placed in a plastic tube nucleic acid stain sytor 9 green fluorescence for live cells and propidium iodide red fluorescence for dead cells were then added in the plastic tube to cover granule sections these sections were incubated in dark 15 min for staining and then placed on a slide a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 with no 09 and no 15 fluorescence microscope filters was employed to observe the live and dead microbial cells respectively simultaneously an annex digital camera was used to record the images observed the ratio of green red fluorescence to the total fluorescence in the photo was analysed using axiovision software which indicated the ratio of live dead cells to the total cells fluorescence tagging method was applied to characterize the accumulation and distribution of microplastics on granules as detailed in erni cassola et al 2017 granules were stained with nile red n3013 methanol solution 1 μg ml and incubated in dark 10 min 60 c after washing a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 was employed to observe at 460 525 nm excitation emission wavelength the observed image was photographed by an annex digital camera to demonstrate the full shape of granule in the fluorescence images nucleic acid stain sytor 9 was used to stain live cells in ahpg as detailed above 2 4 eps extraction and visualization at the end of acute exposure experiments the ahpg samples were collected from each group the modified oscillation ultrasound combing cationic exchange resin method liu et al 2010 as detailed in si was used to extract the secretory eps on ahpg samples the components i e protein polysaccharide dna humic acid and lipid and concentrations of eps extractions were determined using the standard methods to characterize the eps structures multicolor fluorescent probes with different excitation and emission wavelengths shown in table s1 were used to label protein α d and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in the cross sections of ahpg the distributions of eps components were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm 2 5 biotoxicity tests of oxidative stress and leachates firstly the final reactive oxygen species ros in each group after acute exposure experiment was determined to assess the extent of oxidative stress the detailed information about the measurements of ros level can be found in si secondly to further access the influence of induced ros on ahpg activity additional acute exposure tests as in section 2 2 were conducted except that the ros scavengers superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat messina et al 2014 were initially added with microplastics to remove the ros induced by microplastics during hydrogen production process over the 15 days fermentation the ros level and cumulative hydrogen production were examined and compared to the control group in order to investigate the toxicity of microplastic leachates toward ahpg the leaching experiments were also performed as the acute exposure tests in section 2 2 except that ahpg was not inoculated in the reactor over 15 days the microplastic leachates solution was obtained after removing microplastics by filtration then 2 g tss l of ahpg was inoculated in the collected leachates solution to conduct another group of acute exposure tests as in section 2 2 but without microplastics addition the cumulative hydrogen production through 15 days was determined 2 6 analytical methods the biogas volume in each reactor was determined according to the previous work wei et al 2019b as detailed in si the gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector was employed to analyze the percentage of biogas components hydrogen accumulation was calculated through multiplying total volume with the hydrogen percentage the microbial community of ahpg samples withdrawn from the reactor was analysed by illumina miseq sequencing method which was detailed in si statistical analysis was done according to the method presented in si 3 results 3 1 microplastics accumulation and distribution on ahpg granules to observe microplastics accumulation and distribution on granules the ahpg from the control and experimental reactor 80 mg l of microplastics were dyed and the fluorescence images of the whole granule were shown in fig 1 obviously many microplastics with red fluorescence accumulated and covered on the surface of the whole granule over the entire exposure period it is reported that the average pore width of mature granule sludge is 291 5 446 5 nm he et al 2017 thus these micron sized plastic spheres would not be able to access the internal core of granules however the direct physical contact between the granule surface and microplastics might cause toxicity toward adherent sludge cells 3 2 changes in morphology and size of ahpg the morphology changes of ahpg after acutely exposing to the microplastics 80 mg l were illustrated by the sem images as shown in fig 2 a the ahpg in the control reactor without microplastics exposure exhibited a smoother and more solid entire shape but the shock load of microplastics resulted in a fissured and broken surface microplastics were not seen on ahpg probably because they were washed out during pre treatment for sem observation at greater magnification the ahpg showed different structural features the ahpg were mainly made up of a large amount of microcolony of the cocci bacillus and thin filament however these anaerobes in the control reactor were dispersed as densely packed aggregates while the granules exposed to the microplastics appear to be a little loose the size distributions of the ahpg acutely exposed to three levels of microplastics 0 40 and 80 mg l were analysed and expressed as the volume fraction fig 2b showed that the particle sizes of the ahpg in all cases were in the range from 0 1 to 4000 μm and ahpg at about 1000 μm accounted for the highest volume fraction table s2 presented diameter property of ahpg with and without microplastics exposure in the control with no microplastics presence the median particle diameter dv 0 5 of ahpg was 957 12 μm it slightly decreased to 924 21 μm when exposed to 40 mg l of microplastics and significantly p 2 31e 05 reduced to 573 27 μm as microplastics concentration further increased to 80 mg l similarly the ahpg from the reactor exposed to 80 mg l of microplastics presented a remarkable decrease in the mean volume diameter of 748 17 μm in comparison to the control ahpg having mean volume diameter of 952 14 μm although sem results at greater magnification showed that granule interior became loose the shock load of microplastics at higher concentration i e 80 mg l caused the whole granule broke up as observed which was in accord with the decreased granule size measured 3 3 changes in eps secretion and ahpg structure the eps excreted by microorganisms is a vital component of ahpg this complex high molecular weight compound generally attached to the cell surface making numerous cells become a densely packed aggregate and forming a protective defense against the interference of possible toxic environment above results had visualized the direct contact between the ahpg and microplastics therefore the changes in the content and structure of eps in the ahpg after acutely exposed to microplastics were investigated fig 3 a showed that protein and polysaccharide were major compositions of eps in ahpg together with small amounts of lipid humic acid and dna the shock load of microplastics reduced the concentrations of the protein polysaccharide lipid and humic acid but increased dna content the dna is often inside the microbial cells thus increased release of dna indicated the increased cell death wang et al 2018b overall when the ahpg acutely exposed to 40 and 80 mg l of microplastics the total eps production decreased by 8 8 0 1 and 16 7 0 1 compared to that in the control this indicated that the shock load of microplastics inhibited the eps production and increased microplastic concentration resulted in decreased eps production the architecture of eps in the ahpg with 80 mg l and without microplastics exposure was observed using clsm microscopy fig 3b illustrated the spatial distribution of protein and polysaccharide it can be observed that protein and polysaccharide were evenly distributed in the cross section of ahpg supporting its structure and offering protection against interference however the ahpg exposed to microplastics had less protein α d glucopyranose and β d glucopyranose polysaccharide which was in keeping with those measured contents the eps can help microbial cells aggregate but the shock load of microplastics suppressed the eps secretion this finding might explain the reason for the loose morphology of microplastics bearing ahpg observed above 3 4 impacts on physiological activity and hydrogen production of ahpg over the exposure period dead and live microbial cells in the ahpg from the control reactor and experimental reactor 80 mg l microplastics were counted to assess the impacts of microplastics on physiological activity of the ahpg as seen from fig 4 a there were more dead microbial cells with red fluorescence in the ahpg exposed to microplastics compared with those in the control ahpg percentage of the dead cells in total cells was 5 6 0 2 without microplastics exposure while its fraction reached up to 14 7 0 5 in the presence of microplastics also many dead cells appeared in the granule center and even distributed across the entire cross section of granule the cumulative hydrogen production of the ahpg from wastewater with and without microplastics through the whole exposure phase was reported in fig 4b obviously the shock load of microplastics restrained hydrogen production of the ahpg from wastewater an increase inhibition in hydrogen production was found in the system with increasing microplastic level in the presence of 40 mg l microplastics hydrogen production of the ahpg decreased to 85 8 0 9 of the control and it further decreased to 81 3 1 4 of the control when the ahpg exposed to 80 mg l microplastics its variation was in line with the physiological activity of the ahpg measured in the system 3 5 changes in microbial community of ahpg to further understand the impact of shock load of microplastics on microbial community in ahpg the ahpg in control and experimental 80 mg l of microplastics reactors were illumina sequenced in both reactors rarefaction curves of microbial community fig s1 were similar and almost saturated suggesting that this sequencing depth enable to effectively capture all microbial species in the system alpha diversity of microbial community in both systems was analyzed and shown in fig 5 a the coverage index in the two cases reached up to 0 99 indicating that sequencing data was reliable and sequencing result was adequate meanwhile insignificant difference p 0 05 in shannon and chao indices were observed in the control 1 73 0 02 306 32 group and the experimental 1 74 0 04 324 17 group this implied that acute exposure of microplastics had little impact on microbial diversity the compositions of microbial community in control and experimental groups were further explored and demonstrated by taxonomic abundance scenarios as seen in fig 5b firmicutes was the most dominant microbial phylum in both groups with a small amount of proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes acidobacteria and synergistetes phyla many anaerobes known as organics degraders for hydrogen production belong to firmicutes phylum which is commonly found in various anaerobic habitats luo et al 2016 ariesyady et al 2007 those relative abundances of firmicutes phylum in control and experimental reactors were similar p 0 05 accounting for 92 1 0 5 and 90 9 0 7 respectively the other microbial phyla also had the comparable relative abundances in both systems note that almost no methanogens were detected in the two reactors indicating that methanogens activity was almost suppressed completely at the ph of 4 5 it was also evidenced by no methane production in the reactor in line with the previous report mu and yu 2006 thereby inhibiting the consumption of hydrogen generated from the wastewater similar diversity and composition of microbial community in the reactors with and without microplastics suggested that the shock load of microplastics in short term did not significantly change microbial community in the ahpg 3 6 assessment of the toxic mechanisms of microplastics toward ahpg although the shock load of microplastics did not significantly change microbial community in the ahpg they caused the death of mass cells in the ahpg with the decreased hydrogen production the underlying reasons were further explored by disclosing microplastic toxic mechanisms oxidative stress when ahpg exposed to different microplastic concentrations were evaluated by measuring intracellular ros production the results shown in fig 6 demonstrated that microplastics exposure enhanced intracellular ros level and increased microplastic concentration resulted in increased ros production ros level was increased by 27 3 when ahpg exposed to 80 mg l of microplastics to identify the damage of excessive oxidative stress to hydrogen production ability of the ahpg the ros scavenger was also initially added to balance ros the results showed that ros scavenger addition decreased ros levels in each case and the inhibition degree of microplastics on hydrogen production of the ahpg was clearly alleviated achieving 86 6 90 3 of the control in hydrogen production these findings revealed that the shock load of microplastics increased oxidative stress toward the ahpg thereby causing oxidative damage with the decreased ability chemical additives are generally involved in microplastic processing process for improving microplastics property it is reported that these chemical additives can leach out when microplastics is exposed to water suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 in this work leachate from microplastics was collected and its toxicity toward the ahpg ability was assayed fig 6 showed that the leachates from 40 to 80 mg l of microplastics inhibited the hydrogen production of the ahpg by 8 9 and 11 3 compared to the control thus microplastic leachate would also cause toxicity towards the ahpg 4 discussion various types of microplastics in large amounts have been detected in both municipal and industrial wastewaters due to technical limitations microplastic pollution in the wastewater would be much serious than expected it inevitably hits biological wastewater treatment system this study gained a first insight into the tolerance response of granular sludge especially the ahpg to multiple coexisting microplastics in wastewater during biological hydrogen production great affinity and conglomerate ability made microplastics accumulated and covered on the surface of granule although these micron sized plastic spheres cannot access the internal core of granules they caused the death of numerous cells inside and outside the eps composition and structure demonstrated that polysaccharide was the main component of the eps of the ahpg however mu et al 2012 found that protein is more than polysaccharide in the eps of the anaerobic methane production granule this reveals that protein plays important role in anaerobic methane production granule while polysaccharide was key success factor for the ahpg formation and stabilization the eps is an important component of the ahpg to build a protective barrier against the interference of toxic pollutants increased eps production induced by toxic substances has been reported previously which could be because of protective response of granule kokabian et al 2013 dai et al 2016 nevertheless microplastics at those studied concentrations in this work significantly reduced eps amounts this might be due to that these microplastics might go over a tolerance threshold of microorganisms thereby causing mass cells death with the decreased secretion of eps sheng et al 2005 besides eps enables to bind cells together supporting the stable structure of granule thus the ahpg exposed to microplastics became loose and even broken down with the smaller particle size observed this work also found that the shock load of microplastics did not change microbial community significantly in ahpg this is likely attributed to the rather short term exposure although the shock load of microplastics showed little impact on microbial community it did result in microbial cell inactivation thereby inhibiting the hydrogen production of the ahpg from wastewater microplastics have been found to be prone to adsorb on the cell surface and induce ros production e g h2o2 o2 and oh thereby upregulating intracellular oxidative stress jeong et al 2016 in the anaerobic condition this intracellular oxidative stress can also be induced by toxic substrates in small size like microplastics nanoplastics and nano metal particles wei et al 2019a mu and chen 2011 within a threshold of oxidative stress cells would activate their self protection mechanisms in order to balance oxidative stress by the secretion of antioxidant enzymes once intracellular oxidative stress exceeds the tolerance threshold however the redox sensitive signaling pathways will be triggered causing cells inactivation and death xia et al 2008 several toxicological studies had identified the microplastic damage associated with the induced excessive oxidative stress to rotifer zebrafish microalgae and anaerobe jeong et al 2016 wei et al 2019a lei et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in this work intracellular oxidative stress was evidenced to be induced when the microbial cells in the ahpg acutely exposed to microplastics causing cytotoxicity with the decreased hydrogen production ability from the wastewater bejgarn et al 2015 reported most of microplastics can leach chemical additives in environment during their usage and improper disposal global annual amount of chemical additives leaching from microplatics is estimated to be up to 35 tons suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 although their leaching concentration is relatively low usually within ng l ug l range the biotoxicity potential is high cole et al 2011 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is reported that li et al 2016 toxic leachates from seven types of microplastics reduce larval survival rate and inhibit settlement of the barnacle the 38 of microplastics were found to be able to produce leachates that caused acute toxicity on nitocra spinipes bejgarn et al 2015 in addition the toxic effect of virgin plastic pellets on brown mussel was also mainly linked with plastic additives e silva et al 2016 despite these micron sized plastic spheres in this study may not be able to access the internal core of granules their leachates could diffuse into interior of granules producing biotoxicity as confirmed the deaths of not only the outer cells but also the inner cells occurred 5 conclusions in the lab scale hydrogen production system with the ahpg the shock load of microplastics in the wastewater at the studied concentrations 40 and 80 mg l made the granule loose and even break down with the decreased granule size many microplastics accumulated and covered on the surface of the whole granule the eps secretion was suppressed when the ahpg acutely exposed to microplastics losing protection to the microorganisms in granules although no significant change in ahpg microbial community was induced acute microplastics exposure caused the death of mass cells inside and outside of the granule resulting in the decreased hydrogen production ability of the ahpg the toxicity of microplastics chiefly stem from the excessive oxidative stress and the leachates

were cod 8000 glucose nh4hco3 1196 k2hpo4 3h2o 312 mgcl2 6h2o 100 cacl2 50 fecl2 25 cocl2 6h2o 5 nacl 10 mncl2 4h2o 5 nh4 6mo7o24 15 alcl3 2 5 h3bo4 5 cucl2 5h2o 5 nicl2 6h2o 5 and zncl2 5 the coexisting microplastics with typical fraction in wastewater pet 36 pp 8 pe 42 and ps 15 were then added into three groups of reactors at three levels of 0 40 and 80 mg l respectively these four types of microplastics at these proportions are commonly detected in the real wastewater such as in the influents of wastewater treatment plants in sydney australia ziajahromi et al 2017 hence these microplastics were used to perform this work one group without microplastics exposure was used as control while the other two groups with the presence of microplastics at a low and a high level were served as experimental groups for comparison each group was repeated in triplicate all serum bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas to ensure anaerobic condition and sealed tightly and then placed in an incubator at temperature of 37 1 during the experiments the ph in each bottle was constantly stabilized at 4 5 to completely inhibit methanogens activity for facilitating hydrogen production the volume and proportion of gasses i e h2 co2 and n2 produced were periodically monitored for about 15 days till hydrogen production dropped to a negligible level 1 2 3 granules characterization and microplastics observation microplastics bearing ahpg samples through the whole acute exposure period were withdrawn from each reactor and conducted a series of analysis and characterization scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f japan was applied to visually characterize the surface and interior morphology of granules as detailed in the si particle size distribution of granules was measured by a laser particle size analyzer after microplastics were washed out using sodium chloride solution li et al 2018 the live and dead microbial cells in granules were visualized and counted according to hao et al 2009 briefly live dead baclight bacterial viability kit was used to stain the live and dead cells granules were washed three times using phosphate buffer solution and frozen at 20 c after 24 h the granules were sectioned into 10 μm sections and placed in a plastic tube nucleic acid stain sytor 9 green fluorescence for live cells and propidium iodide red fluorescence for dead cells were then added in the plastic tube to cover granule sections these sections were incubated in dark 15 min for staining and then placed on a slide a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 with no 09 and no 15 fluorescence microscope filters was employed to observe the live and dead microbial cells respectively simultaneously an annex digital camera was used to record the images observed the ratio of green red fluorescence to the total fluorescence in the photo was analysed using axiovision software which indicated the ratio of live dead cells to the total cells fluorescence tagging method was applied to characterize the accumulation and distribution of microplastics on granules as detailed in erni cassola et al 2017 granules were stained with nile red n3013 methanol solution 1 μg ml and incubated in dark 10 min 60 c after washing a fluorescence microscope zeiss axioskop 40 was employed to observe at 460 525 nm excitation emission wavelength the observed image was photographed by an annex digital camera to demonstrate the full shape of granule in the fluorescence images nucleic acid stain sytor 9 was used to stain live cells in ahpg as detailed above 2 4 eps extraction and visualization at the end of acute exposure experiments the ahpg samples were collected from each group the modified oscillation ultrasound combing cationic exchange resin method liu et al 2010 as detailed in si was used to extract the secretory eps on ahpg samples the components i e protein polysaccharide dna humic acid and lipid and concentrations of eps extractions were determined using the standard methods to characterize the eps structures multicolor fluorescent probes with different excitation and emission wavelengths shown in table s1 were used to label protein α d and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in the cross sections of ahpg the distributions of eps components were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscope clsm 2 5 biotoxicity tests of oxidative stress and leachates firstly the final reactive oxygen species ros in each group after acute exposure experiment was determined to assess the extent of oxidative stress the detailed information about the measurements of ros level can be found in si secondly to further access the influence of induced ros on ahpg activity additional acute exposure tests as in section 2 2 were conducted except that the ros scavengers superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat messina et al 2014 were initially added with microplastics to remove the ros induced by microplastics during hydrogen production process over the 15 days fermentation the ros level and cumulative hydrogen production were examined and compared to the control group in order to investigate the toxicity of microplastic leachates toward ahpg the leaching experiments were also performed as the acute exposure tests in section 2 2 except that ahpg was not inoculated in the reactor over 15 days the microplastic leachates solution was obtained after removing microplastics by filtration then 2 g tss l of ahpg was inoculated in the collected leachates solution to conduct another group of acute exposure tests as in section 2 2 but without microplastics addition the cumulative hydrogen production through 15 days was determined 2 6 analytical methods the biogas volume in each reactor was determined according to the previous work wei et al 2019b as detailed in si the gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector was employed to analyze the percentage of biogas components hydrogen accumulation was calculated through multiplying total volume with the hydrogen percentage the microbial community of ahpg samples withdrawn from the reactor was analysed by illumina miseq sequencing method which was detailed in si statistical analysis was done according to the method presented in si 3 results 3 1 microplastics accumulation and distribution on ahpg granules to observe microplastics accumulation and distribution on granules the ahpg from the control and experimental reactor 80 mg l of microplastics were dyed and the fluorescence images of the whole granule were shown in fig 1 obviously many microplastics with red fluorescence accumulated and covered on the surface of the whole granule over the entire exposure period it is reported that the average pore width of mature granule sludge is 291 5 446 5 nm he et al 2017 thus these micron sized plastic spheres would not be able to access the internal core of granules however the direct physical contact between the granule surface and microplastics might cause toxicity toward adherent sludge cells 3 2 changes in morphology and size of ahpg the morphology changes of ahpg after acutely exposing to the microplastics 80 mg l were illustrated by the sem images as shown in fig 2 a the ahpg in the control reactor without microplastics exposure exhibited a smoother and more solid entire shape but the shock load of microplastics resulted in a fissured and broken surface microplastics were not seen on ahpg probably because they were washed out during pre treatment for sem observation at greater magnification the ahpg showed different structural features the ahpg were mainly made up of a large amount of microcolony of the cocci bacillus and thin filament however these anaerobes in the control reactor were dispersed as densely packed aggregates while the granules exposed to the microplastics appear to be a little loose the size distributions of the ahpg acutely exposed to three levels of microplastics 0 40 and 80 mg l were analysed and expressed as the volume fraction fig 2b showed that the particle sizes of the ahpg in all cases were in the range from 0 1 to 4000 μm and ahpg at about 1000 μm accounted for the highest volume fraction table s2 presented diameter property of ahpg with and without microplastics exposure in the control with no microplastics presence the median particle diameter dv 0 5 of ahpg was 957 12 μm it slightly decreased to 924 21 μm when exposed to 40 mg l of microplastics and significantly p 2 31e 05 reduced to 573 27 μm as microplastics concentration further increased to 80 mg l similarly the ahpg from the reactor exposed to 80 mg l of microplastics presented a remarkable decrease in the mean volume diameter of 748 17 μm in comparison to the control ahpg having mean volume diameter of 952 14 μm although sem results at greater magnification showed that granule interior became loose the shock load of microplastics at higher concentration i e 80 mg l caused the whole granule broke up as observed which was in accord with the decreased granule size measured 3 3 changes in eps secretion and ahpg structure the eps excreted by microorganisms is a vital component of ahpg this complex high molecular weight compound generally attached to the cell surface making numerous cells become a densely packed aggregate and forming a protective defense against the interference of possible toxic environment above results had visualized the direct contact between the ahpg and microplastics therefore the changes in the content and structure of eps in the ahpg after acutely exposed to microplastics were investigated fig 3 a showed that protein and polysaccharide were major compositions of eps in ahpg together with small amounts of lipid humic acid and dna the shock load of microplastics reduced the concentrations of the protein polysaccharide lipid and humic acid but increased dna content the dna is often inside the microbial cells thus increased release of dna indicated the increased cell death wang et al 2018b overall when the ahpg acutely exposed to 40 and 80 mg l of microplastics the total eps production decreased by 8 8 0 1 and 16 7 0 1 compared to that in the control this indicated that the shock load of microplastics inhibited the eps production and increased microplastic concentration resulted in decreased eps production the architecture of eps in the ahpg with 80 mg l and without microplastics exposure was observed using clsm microscopy fig 3b illustrated the spatial distribution of protein and polysaccharide it can be observed that protein and polysaccharide were evenly distributed in the cross section of ahpg supporting its structure and offering protection against interference however the ahpg exposed to microplastics had less protein α d glucopyranose and β d glucopyranose polysaccharide which was in keeping with those measured contents the eps can help microbial cells aggregate but the shock load of microplastics suppressed the eps secretion this finding might explain the reason for the loose morphology of microplastics bearing ahpg observed above 3 4 impacts on physiological activity and hydrogen production of ahpg over the exposure period dead and live microbial cells in the ahpg from the control reactor and experimental reactor 80 mg l microplastics were counted to assess the impacts of microplastics on physiological activity of the ahpg as seen from fig 4 a there were more dead microbial cells with red fluorescence in the ahpg exposed to microplastics compared with those in the control ahpg percentage of the dead cells in total cells was 5 6 0 2 without microplastics exposure while its fraction reached up to 14 7 0 5 in the presence of microplastics also many dead cells appeared in the granule center and even distributed across the entire cross section of granule the cumulative hydrogen production of the ahpg from wastewater with and without microplastics through the whole exposure phase was reported in fig 4b obviously the shock load of microplastics restrained hydrogen production of the ahpg from wastewater an increase inhibition in hydrogen production was found in the system with increasing microplastic level in the presence of 40 mg l microplastics hydrogen production of the ahpg decreased to 85 8 0 9 of the control and it further decreased to 81 3 1 4 of the control when the ahpg exposed to 80 mg l microplastics its variation was in line with the physiological activity of the ahpg measured in the system 3 5 changes in microbial community of ahpg to further understand the impact of shock load of microplastics on microbial community in ahpg the ahpg in control and experimental 80 mg l of microplastics reactors were illumina sequenced in both reactors rarefaction curves of microbial community fig s1 were similar and almost saturated suggesting that this sequencing depth enable to effectively capture all microbial species in the system alpha diversity of microbial community in both systems was analyzed and shown in fig 5 a the coverage index in the two cases reached up to 0 99 indicating that sequencing data was reliable and sequencing result was adequate meanwhile insignificant difference p 0 05 in shannon and chao indices were observed in the control 1 73 0 02 306 32 group and the experimental 1 74 0 04 324 17 group this implied that acute exposure of microplastics had little impact on microbial diversity the compositions of microbial community in control and experimental groups were further explored and demonstrated by taxonomic abundance scenarios as seen in fig 5b firmicutes was the most dominant microbial phylum in both groups with a small amount of proteobacteria chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes acidobacteria and synergistetes phyla many anaerobes known as organics degraders for hydrogen production belong to firmicutes phylum which is commonly found in various anaerobic habitats luo et al 2016 ariesyady et al 2007 those relative abundances of firmicutes phylum in control and experimental reactors were similar p 0 05 accounting for 92 1 0 5 and 90 9 0 7 respectively the other microbial phyla also had the comparable relative abundances in both systems note that almost no methanogens were detected in the two reactors indicating that methanogens activity was almost suppressed completely at the ph of 4 5 it was also evidenced by no methane production in the reactor in line with the previous report mu and yu 2006 thereby inhibiting the consumption of hydrogen generated from the wastewater similar diversity and composition of microbial community in the reactors with and without microplastics suggested that the shock load of microplastics in short term did not significantly change microbial community in the ahpg 3 6 assessment of the toxic mechanisms of microplastics toward ahpg although the shock load of microplastics did not significantly change microbial community in the ahpg they caused the death of mass cells in the ahpg with the decreased hydrogen production the underlying reasons were further explored by disclosing microplastic toxic mechanisms oxidative stress when ahpg exposed to different microplastic concentrations were evaluated by measuring intracellular ros production the results shown in fig 6 demonstrated that microplastics exposure enhanced intracellular ros level and increased microplastic concentration resulted in increased ros production ros level was increased by 27 3 when ahpg exposed to 80 mg l of microplastics to identify the damage of excessive oxidative stress to hydrogen production ability of the ahpg the ros scavenger was also initially added to balance ros the results showed that ros scavenger addition decreased ros levels in each case and the inhibition degree of microplastics on hydrogen production of the ahpg was clearly alleviated achieving 86 6 90 3 of the control in hydrogen production these findings revealed that the shock load of microplastics increased oxidative stress toward the ahpg thereby causing oxidative damage with the decreased ability chemical additives are generally involved in microplastic processing process for improving microplastics property it is reported that these chemical additives can leach out when microplastics is exposed to water suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 in this work leachate from microplastics was collected and its toxicity toward the ahpg ability was assayed fig 6 showed that the leachates from 40 to 80 mg l of microplastics inhibited the hydrogen production of the ahpg by 8 9 and 11 3 compared to the control thus microplastic leachate would also cause toxicity towards the ahpg 4 discussion various types of microplastics in large amounts have been detected in both municipal and industrial wastewaters due to technical limitations microplastic pollution in the wastewater would be much serious than expected it inevitably hits biological wastewater treatment system this study gained a first insight into the tolerance response of granular sludge especially the ahpg to multiple coexisting microplastics in wastewater during biological hydrogen production great affinity and conglomerate ability made microplastics accumulated and covered on the surface of granule although these micron sized plastic spheres cannot access the internal core of granules they caused the death of numerous cells inside and outside the eps composition and structure demonstrated that polysaccharide was the main component of the eps of the ahpg however mu et al 2012 found that protein is more than polysaccharide in the eps of the anaerobic methane production granule this reveals that protein plays important role in anaerobic methane production granule while polysaccharide was key success factor for the ahpg formation and stabilization the eps is an important component of the ahpg to build a protective barrier against the interference of toxic pollutants increased eps production induced by toxic substances has been reported previously which could be because of protective response of granule kokabian et al 2013 dai et al 2016 nevertheless microplastics at those studied concentrations in this work significantly reduced eps amounts this might be due to that these microplastics might go over a tolerance threshold of microorganisms thereby causing mass cells death with the decreased secretion of eps sheng et al 2005 besides eps enables to bind cells together supporting the stable structure of granule thus the ahpg exposed to microplastics became loose and even broken down with the smaller particle size observed this work also found that the shock load of microplastics did not change microbial community significantly in ahpg this is likely attributed to the rather short term exposure although the shock load of microplastics showed little impact on microbial community it did result in microbial cell inactivation thereby inhibiting the hydrogen production of the ahpg from wastewater microplastics have been found to be prone to adsorb on the cell surface and induce ros production e g h2o2 o2 and oh thereby upregulating intracellular oxidative stress jeong et al 2016 in the anaerobic condition this intracellular oxidative stress can also be induced by toxic substrates in small size like microplastics nanoplastics and nano metal particles wei et al 2019a mu and chen 2011 within a threshold of oxidative stress cells would activate their self protection mechanisms in order to balance oxidative stress by the secretion of antioxidant enzymes once intracellular oxidative stress exceeds the tolerance threshold however the redox sensitive signaling pathways will be triggered causing cells inactivation and death xia et al 2008 several toxicological studies had identified the microplastic damage associated with the induced excessive oxidative stress to rotifer zebrafish microalgae and anaerobe jeong et al 2016 wei et al 2019a lei et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in this work intracellular oxidative stress was evidenced to be induced when the microbial cells in the ahpg acutely exposed to microplastics causing cytotoxicity with the decreased hydrogen production ability from the wastewater bejgarn et al 2015 reported most of microplastics can leach chemical additives in environment during their usage and improper disposal global annual amount of chemical additives leaching from microplatics is estimated to be up to 35 tons suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 although their leaching concentration is relatively low usually within ng l ug l range the biotoxicity potential is high cole et al 2011 suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is reported that li et al 2016 toxic leachates from seven types of microplastics reduce larval survival rate and inhibit settlement of the barnacle the 38 of microplastics were found to be able to produce leachates that caused acute toxicity on nitocra spinipes bejgarn et al 2015 in addition the toxic effect of virgin plastic pellets on brown mussel was also mainly linked with plastic additives e silva et al 2016 despite these micron sized plastic spheres in this study may not be able to access the internal core of granules their leachates could diffuse into interior of granules producing biotoxicity as confirmed the deaths of not only the outer cells but also the inner cells occurred 5 conclusions in the lab scale hydrogen production system with the ahpg the shock load of microplastics in the wastewater at the studied concentrations 40 and 80 mg l made the granule loose and even break down with the decreased granule size many microplastics accumulated and covered on the surface of the whole granule the eps secretion was suppressed when the ahpg acutely exposed to microplastics losing protection to the microorganisms in granules although no significant change in ahpg microbial community was induced acute microplastics exposure caused the death of mass cells inside and outside of the granule resulting in the decreased hydrogen production ability of the ahpg the toxicity of microplastics chiefly stem from the excessive oxidative stress and the leachates

15866,many wastewater utilities have discharge permits directly tied with the receiving river flow so it is critical to have accurate prediction of the hydraulic throughput to ensure safe operation and environment protection current empirical knowledge based operation faces many challenges so in this study we developed and assessed daily adaptive probabilistic soft sensor prediction models to forecast the next month s average receiving river flowrate and guide the utility operations by comparing 11 machine learning methods extra trees regression exhibits desired deterministic prediction accuracy at day 0 overall accuracy index 3 9 10 3 1 cms2 cms cubic meter per second which also increases steadily over the course of the month e g mape and rmse decrease from 41 46 and 23 31 cms to 3 31 and 2 81 cms respectively the overall classification accuracy of three river flow classes reaches 0 79 at the beginning and increases to about 0 97 over the course of the predicted month to manage the uncertainty caused by potential false negative classification as overestimations a probabilistic assessment on the predictions based on 95 lower pi is developed and successfully reduces the false negative classification from 17 to nearly zero with a slight sacrifice of overall classification accuracy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permit limit river flow soft sensor risk management probabilistic prediction adaptive prediction 1 introduction wastewater management is facing systemic challenges from global climate change extreme weather events and aging infrastructure more frequent flash flooding and extended droughts results in highly skewed flow distributions lv et al 2020 rosenberger et al 2021 which poses great challenges to the operation of wastewater utilities veronesi et al 2014 hughes et al 2021 recent studies have started to investigate the effects of storm events on wastewater treatment efficiency zhu and anderson 2017a heo et al 2021 and system resiliency zhu and anderson 2017b zhang et al 2021 but few groups have attempted to make a connection between the variability of river flow and its effects on wastewater treatment operation many utilities have discharge permits directly tied with the receiving river flow so more accurate prediction of receiving river flow can become critical to treatment operation to ensure the consistent compliance of environmental regulations and protect the water environment englert et al 2013 reported that compared to a typical winter season with high dilution potential 35 wastewater summer droughts with low dilution potential for treated wastewater 90 could result in significant negative effects in downstream freshwater ecosystems such as macroinvertebrate mediated leaf mass loss i e during a leaf litter decomposition process and gammarids feeding rate i e in situ bioassays to assess non food quality related implications taking the pacific northwest u s as an example the variability of a receiving river flow has increased gradually especially in the wet weather season each year but because often wastewater utilities have allowable nutrient discharge limits both daily maximum and monthly average tied to the receiving river flow the toxicity limit gets more stringent as the river flow decreases therefore utilities are faced with the dilemma about how to manage the nutrient driven inventory and how to deal with the uncertainty on hydraulic throughput and nitrification capacity if the utility maintains complete nitrification continuously the extra biomass inventory will create a risk of secondary clarifier overload during wet weather events due to increased throughput in contrast if a low inventory is maintained once the river flow drops the utility will be at risk of not meeting the permit due to a more stringent nutrient discharge limit caused by reduced flow currently utilities such as clean water services or cws that was studied in this work mostly rely on empirical knowledge collected by the operators to make decisions based on estimated flow in conjunction with weather forecasting which are not effective qualitative rather than quantitative or efficient lagged responses to a flow change so can be greatly improved the need for additional guidance could be addressed by soft sensors based on machine learning ml algorithms as such methods will help provide accurate flow prediction and early warning mechanisms that lead to the development and execution of more effective control strategies soft sensing which can be part of a hybrid mechanistic and data driven modeling architecture schneider et al 2022 or a digital twin strategy torfs et al 2022 offers numerous merits such as low cost fast response and potential to work in parallel with hard sensors fortuna et al 2007 soft sensors can be used to forecast both influent wastewater flow and receiving river flow to help decision makers better estimate the appropriate biomass inventory level in the bioreactors so either biomass overloading or discharge overlimit can be prevented soft sensor studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of wastewater flow forecasting though not the receiving river flow for example fernandez et al 2009 tested fuzzy neural networks models on forecasting of the next day s average influent wastewater flow based on the day of the week and the most recent day s average flow and the average prediction errors were below 10 zhu and anderson 2019 developed a matlab based iterated stepwise multiple linear regression ismlr package to predict the next day s influent flow at the kirie water reclamation plant in chicago in which they compared nine individual or hybrid i e combining more than one statistical and ml methods soft sensor methods and suggested that the hybrid model based on ismlr and artificial neural network ann obtained the best performance adj r2 0 834 mape 13 3 using historical and easily acquirable influent data more recently apaydin et al 2021 adopted singular spectral analysis ssa seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl and ann to forecast monthly river flow based on streamflow precipitation relative humidity and temperature data but such studies kisi et al 2019 apaydin et al 2021 only provided a one time deterministic prediction that cannot be used in daily wastewater operations they might also have data leakage problems associated with cross validation or ssa stl applications resulting in over optimistic results data leakage management in ml modeling was not studied frequently by environmental researchers but the problems can easily happen without a rigorous data preprocessing for example feature scaling applied before k fold cross validation leaks information between the pre training k 1 parts of the training dataset and validation subsets and the scaling should be used as a part of the cross validation process based on only the pre training subset in this study we aimed to fill the gap from empirical knowledge based to more intelligent quantifiable decision making and help better manage wastewater operation and discharge by developing a daily updated prediction model to forecast the next month s average receiving river flowrate routine historical data that can be readily obtained by the utility were used and ml methods were assessed to obtain reliable forecasting results furthermore to avoid the aforementioned operation risk we developed ml based probabilistic prediction models to minimize river flow overestimation as river flow is the determinant factor for effluent ammonia nitrogen limits table s1 this paper is organized by first presenting facility and data collection and preprocessing followed by soft sensor development and performance evaluation we also compared 11 ml methods for deterministic prediction and discussed the adaptive prediction and classification among the best performing models results of probabilistic adaptive prediction and classification are subsequently presented and discussed 2 methodology 2 1 wastewater facility receiving river and associated data collection rock creek water resource recovery facility rc wrrf is one of the four wastewater treatment facilities that are operated by clean water services cws in urban washington county oregon us the rc wrrf has operated since 1978 and treats an average of about 168 000 m3 day wastewater to provide services for more than 300 000 residents during the wet weather season the facility has toxicity based effluent ammonia limits the allowable ammonia limit both daily maximum highest allowable value for daily concentrations and monthly average highest allowable average of daily concentrations over a calendar month is tied to the tualatin river flow at farmington oregon and the toxicity limit gets more stringent as the river flow decreases table s1 after an extensive collection of data we identified data sources from two united states geological survey usgs river monitoring sites farmington and west linn owrd 2021 and 40 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa meteorological sites noaa 2021 for a period of 81 years 10 1939 12 2020 fig 1 daily data of the tualatin river flow at west linn were used to fill the gaps of missing data found in the daily data of the tualatin river flow at farmington the 40 meteorological sites located in the upstream region eight zip codes of the tualatin river were used to identify useful weather related information i e rain snow air temperature while different noaa sites have had monitored different variables for inconsistent periods with missing data all the sites were synthesized to create a complete 81 year meteorological dataset instead of calculating average air temperatures we directly adopted the minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperatures found in the raw data table s2 summarizes the data sources and variables that were used in this work details of data preprocessing are described in the next section 2 2 soft sensor development the soft sensor development started from data collection and as aforementioned 81 years of data from oregon water resources department owrd usgs and noaa databases were retrieved for the study fig 2 a because the data between west linn and farmington were highly correlated r 0 98 and river flow data at west linn were nearly complete 100 so missing data at farmington were filled based on their correlation and corresponding west linn daily flow data the daily flow data were then averaged to calculate monthly average river flow data for each of the meteorological variables average values of the data available from the 40 noaa sites were used this substitution was especially important for years prior to 2010 when data from only a few sites were available fig s1 when converting from daily data to monthly data averaging and summation were applied to river flow or temperature and rain or snow respectively in addition to the representative monthly values we also added statistical variables based on daily data maximum daily value rain max snow max and count of event days for rain or snow 2 54 mm or 0 1 inch rain count snow count for each month to enrich the input information as a result nine variables and their corresponding 975 monthly data were initially prepared the matlab based ismlr package ismlr 2019 was first used to preprocess and develop regressor based datasets time dependent regressors as described below technical outliers were detected based on the expert knowledge such as detection limits and reasonable ranges of variables and no technical outliers were found in the dataset statistical outliers were found based on a distance based heuristic method which could identify distanced tails of ordered data details in text s1 only seven statistical outliers were identified but they were not excluded from the dataset because they represent extreme wet weather events which may provide important information to the prediction model for example a record maximum monthly snow value 1746 2 mm was identified in january 1950 and compared to january february had less amounts of rain 208 5 319 1 mm and snow 55 9 mm but a higher river flow 170 5 135 9 cms or cubic meter per second due to the accumulated snow in january the next step was to develop time dependent regressors from variables based on periodogram analysis a time pattern identification approach using a fourier series model zhu and anderson 2016 with the help of periodogram analysis we could retain important data that contributed both near time information and periodicity to the prediction model unsurprisingly all the ten variables exhibit a strong yearly periodic pattern fig s2 suggesting that the same moving window should be applied to the most recent 12 data points for example the variable river river flow was developed to river t river t 1 river t 11 t stands for the current month and t x is used to indicate x months earlier than the current month in other words we used variables t x x 0 1 11 to predict river t 1 in addition because we could continuously acquire updated daily information e g days 1 2 3 over the course of the predicted month t 1 it would be useful to adaptively predict river t 1 over the month for making better adaptable decisions to include the concept of adaptive in the response variable we denoted it as river t 1 dn where d stands for day and n indicates the number of days elapsed in the predicted month we initially focused on river t 1 d0 the end of current month and later applied the model to the predicted month all regressors were normalized based on their corresponding maximum and minimum values before further soft sensor development the 81 years of data were divided into training 1939 1999 and testing 2000 2020 datasets and this configuration remained consistent in all subsequent soft sensor development work two feature selection methods principal components analysis pca and ismlr were compared for their ability to retain important information for ml prediction models eleven ml methods were compared in this study and a brief introduction of the ml methods is included in the supporting information table s3 text s2 the k fold cross validation was used with grid search to identify the optimal model s based on the training dataset fig 2 b the average cross validation score for each modeling run was used to rank the model performance the implementation of ml algorithms was conducted based on two steps in the first step 11 algorithms were used to generate 1239 ml models k 3 using a grid search approach with typical ranges of hyperparameters several of the methods identified shared the same type s of hyperparameter s such as the number of estimators and these were set to the same values to be tested table s4 three methods were selected based on the prediction performance in the second step those three methods were further evaluated using a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization assessment that involved a change of k value from 3 to 5 the result of that screening identified a more robust model 2 3 evaluation metrics and optimal model selection prediction performance was first quantified based on four typical single metrics mape adjusted r2 rmse and mae eqs 1 5 while it can be useful to compare the individual scores among models it would be challenging to determine a better candidate if there was a tradeoff between two or more metrics therefore an overall accuracy index oai was calculated based on the four individual metrics to account for the overall prediction performance eq 6 and the oai value was the key parameter to decide optimal methods or models for example each of the 11 ml methods could generate a range of results and the

method i e the ability to minimize the risk of generating poor results we identified and excluded the following methods in the initial method selection step based on robustness 1 any methods that produced negative oai values 2 up to three methods to ensure at least three methods were left for the final model selection that generated highest relative standard deviation rsd sd mean based on the oai values because the model will need to be periodically re optimized by onsite personnel using updated data in the facility and they will rely on the final selected method therefore this characteristic is important to provide more confidence on prediction stability and even operators with no expertise in data science can have less concern to use ml tools for prediction and decision making haimi et al 2013 therrien et al 2020 2 4 adaptive predictions and classifications the selected optimum model was used to continuously predict river t 1 with updated daily information to simplify the problem we focused on predictions over the first 28 days of the month because river t 1 d28 should be very close to the monthly average data the predicted results were first evaluated using the four individual metrics described above and then converted from the numeric data to categorical classes based on the three categories of river flow 14 16 14 16 28 32 and 28 32 cms for different allowable ammonia limits for the rc wrrf table s1 the classification results were later evaluated based on accuracy and f1 score accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified data tp true

measure correctly identified positive data from all the predicted positive data tp and fp false positive and all the true positive data tp and fn false negative respectively a confusion matrix was adopted to display the changes of correct classifications tp tn as well as overestimated fn and underestimated fp classes for different days in the predicted month 7 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 8

probabilistic predictions were used to enhance the reliability of soft sensor implementation for this study the risk is mainly associated with the overestimation of the river flow classes and the wrong information can be used by the onsite personnel to develop inappropriate control strategies therefore it would be important to prevent or minimize the overestimations fn e g a low class of river flow is mistakenly classified as the medium class even with a certain level of sacrifice in the overall accuracy the probabilistic inference was applied to monthly adaptive predictions based on 95 lower and upper prediction intervals pi using the optimal model and the lower pi was used to manage the risk by minimizing the overestimations to evaluate the degree of risk management the percentages of fn in the entire samples as well as in the low and medium classes were calculated and compared based on raw using the deterministic mean value and risk managed using the 95 lower pi scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal model determination pca and ismlr were applied and compared for their effectiveness on feature selection fig 3 exhibits the prediction performance i e oai of the 11 ml methods based on pca fig 3 a or ismlr fig 3 b followed by a final model selection step from their corresponding best three methods based on pca fig 3 c or ismlr fig 3 d for each method the box plot shows a range of prediction results based on different combinations of hyperparameter values a higher oai value stands for a better agreement between measured and predicted data a larger range of a box means a greater variability and the model results are more sensitive to the hyperparameter values and a negative oai value suggests that the method is likely to generate extreme poor results pca of the 108 regressors shows that the majority of the information can be extracted by the first 30 pcs the first significant drop in mse is found at 6 pcs that is able to explain about 70 of variance and the explained variance increases smoothly before 30 pcs and mse stays at roughly 700 cms2 fig s3 we adopted 6 pcs for further modeling because it achieves a local minimum of mse and avoid potential overtraining from excess pcs pca ml methods exhibit oai values ranging from 4 5 10 4 based on extreme gradient boosting regression or xgbr to 1 2 10 3 kernel ridge regression or krr 1 cms2 in the initial tests k 3 where the negative oai values are due to negative adjusted r2 values figs 3 a and s4 among the 11 ml methods based on the corresponding 1239 models seven methods generated negative oai values and they were excluded from the selection table s5 for example xgbr lower to 4 5 10 4 1 cms2 gaussian process regression gpr 2 8 10 4 and support vector regression svr 9 4 10 4 generated the lowest negative oai values fig 3 a in addition to the seven methods adaboost regression abr that exhibited a large deviation of oai values rsd 0 377 was also excluded because a large rsd value indicates that the model performance is very sensitive to their hyperparameter values as a result decision tree regression dtr extra trees regression etr and random forest regression rfr were selected to be further investigated in the second step of ml model optimization k 5 where 1200 models were assessed table s6 the best pca based ml model oai 1 48 10 3 1 cms2 is found when using the etr method in the final model selection step the oai values based on rfr up to 1 43 10 3 1 cms2 are similar to etr but are slightly higher dtr does not obtain relatively high oai values up to 1 01 10 3 1 cms2 figs 3 c and s5 table s7 seven important regressors that were identified from the 108 initial regressors using ismlr include rain t snow max t rain t 1 river t 10 tmax t 5 snow count t 11 and snow max t 9 table s8 the regressors rain t snow max t and rain t 1 represent the most recent meteorological conditions in addition to the most recent data river t 10 snow count t 11 and snow max t 9 provide important periodic information because their time gaps are all close to the 12 month period the discrepancy of the time gaps may be because of additional information needed to develop the model for example snow count and snow max could give long term cumulative and short term peak information respectively ismlr ml methods have similar patterns as described however remain differences in the magnitude of oai values up to 4 1 10 3 1 cms2 and several methods figs 3 b and s6 for example k nearest neighbors regression knn gives exceptionally promising results 4 09 10 3 1 cms2 gradient boosting regression gbr performs uniquely while its best results are close to the highest oai values but the remaining part covers up negative oai values making the method no longer a good candidate table s9 overall gbr lower to 2 31 10 5 1 cms2 gpr 1 54 10 3 histogram based gradient boosting regression hgbr 6 58 10 7 krr 2 34 10 5 svr 1 13 10 4 and xgbr 6 54 10 4 were excluded from the model selection due to negative oai values and abr rsd 0 388 and dtr 0 423 were subsequently excluded due to large rsd values etr oai up to 3 17 10 3 1 cms2 rsd 0 134 knn 4 09 10 3 1 cms2 0 223 and rfr 2 97 10 3 1 cms2 0 111 which exhibit relatively positive and high oai values with small rsd values were further examined by a more detailed hyperparameter optimization table s10 an assessment of 1242 models at the second step suggests that knn achieves the highest oai value 4 57 10 3 1 cms2 followed by etr 3 94 10 3 1 cms2 and rfr 3 86 10 3 1 cms2 figs 3 d and s7 table s11 by using a two step model selection process each of the best pca and ismlr based models were identified and evaluated based on the testing data table s12 similar to the cross validation training assessment ismlr ml models are superior to pca ml models the ismlr etr model number of estimators 400 max depth 20 min samples split 10 was selected to be the final optimum prediction model because the model gained the best individual scores based on mape rmse adj r2 as well as oai value 4 79 10 3 1 cms2 among the three ismlr ml models in addition the etr model is made of 400 dtr sub models so the model internal structure is readable fig s8 for example the dtr model could start from a random sampling sample size 602 of the initial dataset based on a root node with rain t 0 537 mm here left and right arrows from the node always indicates true and false respectively fig s8 c presuming it is a false condition an internal node with snow count t 11 0 739 mm will be used to determine the next rule based internal classification and with the same approach the model will provide the final prediction result value in the node in the bottom leaf node based on the given input data furthermore the rsd of prediction accuracies resulting from the etr model is much smaller than knn models and as previously mentioned that the great stability can be important when the model is implemented and operated by personnel who might not be familiar with data science overall the model is able to achieve a more accurate performance mape 41 5 adj r2 0 6009 rmse 23 31 cms mae 12 96 cms to predict the next month s average river flow compared to other models tested as discussed later due to the large time gap monthly the prediction accuracy can be further improved by developing adaptive models to obtain updated prediction result over the course of the next month so the updating forecast information rather than a one time outdated data point will be incorporated in the models fig 3 e 3 2 adaptive predictions over the t 1 month one approach to adaptively predict the river flow is to not only update the daily data over the month but also re optimize the model every time to ensure the best models are used the etr models can accomplish this without the need of frequent model optimization because it has the advantage of relatively stable performance the 29 ismlr etr models used different important regressors derived from ismlr feature selection over the predicted month table s13 the number of important regressors ranges from 6 to 14 snow t frequency 28 and rain t 26 are the most frequent regressors used for the 29 models followed by snow count t 11 25 tmax t 4 19 and snow max t 9 18 among the top regressors from the 29 models rain t frequency 11 is the most frequent regressor followed by river t 10 7 and river t 11 6 the results offer a good example to differentiate feature importance and feature contribution commonly used interchangeably in environmental community among these regressors rain t is both very important and has a high contribution to the models whereas snow t is important but provides a less contribution river t 10 is the top contributor to some models but not as important as snow count t 11 for the whole family of adaptive models as expected the prediction accuracy increases with increasing number of days elapsed in the month because the corresponding incremental daily data were used to improve the model performance fig 4 a based on the testing dataset adjusted r2 increases from 0 6009 to 0 9942 mape rmse and mae decrease from 41 46 23 31 cms and 12 96 cms to 3 31 2 81 cms and 1 11 cms respectively for example a significant improvement can be found on the 14th day of the predicted month when adjusted r2 and mape are 0 8607 and 19 06 respectively and many peaks are well forecasted the evaluation scores become 0 9637 and 10 19 on the 21st day respectively and the two curves show good correspondence fig 4 b the model residuals distribute randomly along the testing period and high residual values are typically observed at peak flows fig 4 c again because river flow overestimation creates a high risk of failing to meet the effluent limit when maintaining the overall model accuracy negative residuals overestimations were emphasized for example the top three extreme negative residuals on model d0 are in 11 2009 43 59 cms 11 2011 41 82 and 11 2017 40 76 they are reduced by models d7 d14 and d21 to 12 88 22 56 20 49 5 49 8 59 8 06 and 0 19 1 65 0 75 respectively the number of extreme overestimations 20 cms for models d0 d7 d14 and d21 are 18 14 5 and 2 respectively however exceptions exist model d21 generally performs better than d14 but the former model predicted flow 130 86 cms seriously overestimates the monthly river flow in 12 2006 true flow 89 03 cms a residual of 41 83 cms worse than models d7 33 30 cms and even d0 18 03 cms a closer inspection of raw data shows that the big rainfall event in the second week of the month may result in a rare outcome fig s9 interestingly the ammonia limits are based on the three classes of river flow so any flow above 28 32 cms 1000 cfs requires the same monthly average ammonia limit table s1 therefore the next section will introduce the assessment results of the classification accuracy which could provide the direct information for process decision making 3 3 assessment of predicted flow classes accuracy and f1 score were used to evaluate the classification performance of the adaptive models over the month figs 5 a and s10 the overall accuracy stays at a high level all the time and gradually increases from about 0 8 to 1 the high accuracy is mainly contributed from low 14 16 cms and high 28 32 cms flow classes which account for about 88 of all data the medium flow class does not have an acceptable accuracy until two weeks later with an accuracy of 0 6 the low accuracy in the medium flow class is likely due to its narrow range 14 16 28 32 cms so it is more likely to exceed the lower or upper bounds the low flow class that has the same size of flow range but is able to achieve high accuracies probably because most of the months in this class belong to a dry weather scenario and because there is little meteorological perturbation the model provides accurate predictions f1 scores of the classes show a similar pattern except for the high class which is slightly lower than its values based on accuracy f1 score is the harmonic mean of precision tp tp fp and recall tp tp fn so it tends to more focus on fp and fn because overestimation can create a risk for wrongly determining a false higher flow class so the samples classified as fn should be taken into a risk assessment for example on the 7th day seven 5 2 months out of 119 from the low flow class are wrongly classified into the medium or high flow classes while 16 months out of 35 that are grouped to the high flow class should be in the medium flow class fig 5 b the situation gets better over the time figs 5 b and s10 and on day 21 they are reduced to 3 and 7 respectively the classification results help to point out the crucial part fn in the medium or high flow classes that need to be further taken care to avoid permit violation the next step was to develop probabilistic models that can provide prediction bounds beside the deterministic values for better risk management as described in the next section 3 4 probabilistic inference and risk management probabilistic inference was conducted based on 400 random dtr sub models in each of the 28 etr models over the predicted month we were able to acquire the details and prediction results from the 400 dtr models by revising the source code of the python package scikit learn sklearn 2021 for example fig 6 a shows the probabilistic predictions of the river flow over the course of february 2020 the month was randomly selected from the range november april a time period when the ammonia limit is based on the river flow table s1 the mean predicted values are the conventional deterministic values obtained using the etr models whereas the box plots illustrate the evolution of prediction uncertainty over the days in the month as expected the range of pi decreases from 96 0 9 4 86 7 to 13 1 14 5 27 6 cms with increasing number of elapsed days the average river flow in february 2020 was about 20 2 cms which should be classified as the medium flow class 14 16 28 32 cms before applying the probabilistic assessment eight of the 28 deterministic prediction values over the month are above 28 32 cms so their corresponding predicted classes are mistakenly classified as the high flow class in contrast based on the probabilistic predictions the real monthly average river flow is well between the pis for all 28 evolving models which also exhibit a reliable shrunken range over the time more importantly using the 95 lower pi as the critical value to classify the river flow makes it possible to better manage the overestimation risk after the risk management it can be seen that several predicted classes are underestimated but none of them is overestimated meeting the conservative objectives similarly the majority of the predictions are well between the pis based on the testing dataset for example on day 14 only a few data are underestimated in 2016 and 2017 but are rarely overestimated fig 6 b specifically the top five overestimated data based on residual values using the deterministic approach are in 12 2006 measured 89 0 cms vs predicted 130 2 cms 12 2008 105 7 vs 136 2 12 2002 81 8 vs 108 8 12 2000 13 7 vs 36 5 and 1 2020 72 8 vs 94 2 the 95 lower bounds using the probabilistic approach are 89 0 95 1 66 6 6 7 and 38 2 cms respectively clearly all the overestimations are well managed especially the case of 12 2000 13 7 cms that was initially assigned to the low flow class 14 2 cms is well corrected by the lower bound 6 7 cms or the low flow class from the previous mistakenly predicted value 36 5 cms or the high flow class as previously noted the only difference among different days would be the range of pis which is getting narrower over the days fig 6 c displays the occurrences of prediction error for the entire time period 251 months 28 days month based on the pi only about 0 3 of valid cases are numerically overestimated and 90 of the overestimation cases are found on the first 13 days the remaining occurrences include 92 3 between pis and 7 4 underestimations overall the classification accuracy is sacrificed for the purpose of risk management so the accuracy increases from only about 0 61 to 0 91 over the month raw 0 78 0 97 fig 6 d in addition the percentage of false negative fn or categorical overestimations up to 17 4 on day 2 using the raw predicted classes are well minimized to nearly 0 across the 28 days with the risk managed specifically the fn in the low flow class can be up to 15 1 and the percentage keeps higher than 5 until after 16 days the situation in the medium flow class seems to be even worse because fn jumps to be more than 70 initially and decreases to about 15 at the end of the month although the sample size of river flow in the medium flow class is relatively small 35 of 251 the unexpected high fn can significantly affect the model usability onsite conversely the lower pis successfully reduce fn to almost a flat line in both flow classes with only a few minor errors initially which can provide the operators a high confidence of risk management to make better operational decisions 4 conclusion this work presents a first feasibility study in developing an adaptive probabilistic soft sensor tool to predict the next month s average receiving river flow which is critical for guiding wrrf operation and control effluent limits e g ammonia nitrogen results from this work are summarized as follows the study assessed two feature selection methods with 11 ml methods leading to about 5000 ml models with different hyperparameter values tested based on a two step model selection process ismlr ml shows more promising results relative to pca ml among the best ismlr ml methods ismlr knn exhibited the highest prediction accuracy oai up to 4 5 10 3 1 cms2 to forecast river t 1 d0 based on cross validation and training dataset but obtained lower performance 3 7 10 3 1 cms2 based on the testing dataset ismlr etr can achieve a similar results up to 3 9 10 3 1 cms2 during the model selection steps while also achieved better performance mape 41 5 adj r2 0 6009 rmse 23 31 cms mae 12 96 cms based on the testing dataset performance of adaptive predictions based on ismlr etr models increases steadily over the course of the month after 14 and 28 days adjusted r2 increases from 0 6009 to 0 8607 to 0 9942 mape rmse and mae decrease from 41 46 23 31 cms and 12 96 cms to 19 06 13 60 cms and 7 29 cms to 3 31 2 81 cms and 1 11 cms respectively based on the 29 ismlr preprocessed datasets snow t and rain t are the two most important regressors followed by snow count t 11 tmax t 4 and snow max t 9 classification shows the overall accuracy of the three river flow classes can reach about 0 79 for river t 1 d0 and increases to about 0 97 over time compared to the low from 0 89 to 0 99 and high from 0 83 to 0 99 flow classes that have similar high accuracy the medium flow class exhibits a much lower accuracy initially 0 31 and slowly increases to 0 51 to 0 86 after 14 and 28 days respectively ensemble methods such as etr make it possible to provide a probabilistic assessment on the predictions using 95 lower pi the percentage of overestimations false negative can be reduced from up to 17 to nearly zero for the overall evaluation and even for the medium flow class that can have up to 70 overestimations can also be reduced to around zero the nearly perfect risk management sacrifices a certain overall classification accuracy which increases from about 0 61 to 0 73 to 0 91 after 14 and 28 days respectively while this study shows encouraging results on balancing the prediction accuracy and risk management several aspects can be further improved in future studies first a big fraction 54 4 of the river flow data at farmington was missing and filled based on a high correlation r 0 98 with the flow at another site west linn such challenges are common but it should be less of a concern in the future as such data are becoming increasingly available developing a robust soft sensor to predict monthly data requires a much longer period of data e g 50 years than it needs for daily e g several years or hourly e g a year or less data forecasts also weather forecast data could be used to provide a valuable contribution to the models but the main reason we didn t use weather data was due to the limited data availability in addition the study was conducted from the standpoint of wastewater utilities based on accessible local data future work will include selected large scale climate data kisi et al 2019 in the analysis to capture the long term drift information as well as easy to use dashboard development to show soft sensor based state point analysis

15866,many wastewater utilities have discharge permits directly tied with the receiving river flow so it is critical to have accurate prediction of the hydraulic throughput to ensure safe operation and environment protection current empirical knowledge based operation faces many challenges so in this study we developed and assessed daily adaptive probabilistic soft sensor prediction models to forecast the next month s average receiving river flowrate and guide the utility operations by comparing 11 machine learning methods extra trees regression exhibits desired deterministic prediction

31 and 2 81 cms respectively the overall classification accuracy of three river flow classes reaches 0 79 at the beginning and increases to about 0 97 over the course of the predicted month to manage the uncertainty caused by potential false negative classification as overestimations a probabilistic assessment on the predictions based on 95 lower pi is developed and successfully reduces the false negative classification from 17 to nearly zero with a slight sacrifice of overall classification accuracy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permit limit river flow soft sensor risk management probabilistic prediction adaptive prediction 1 introduction wastewater management is facing systemic challenges from global climate change extreme weather events and aging infrastructure more frequent flash flooding and extended droughts results in highly skewed flow distributions lv et al 2020 rosenberger et al 2021 which poses great challenges to the operation of wastewater utilities veronesi et al 2014 hughes et al 2021 recent studies have started to investigate the effects of storm events on wastewater treatment efficiency zhu and anderson 2017a heo et al 2021 and system resiliency zhu and anderson 2017b zhang et al 2021 but few groups have attempted to make a connection between the variability of river flow and its effects on wastewater treatment operation many utilities have discharge permits directly tied with the receiving river flow so more accurate prediction of receiving river flow can become critical to treatment operation to ensure the consistent compliance of environmental regulations and protect the water environment englert et al 2013 reported that compared to a typical winter season with high dilution potential 35 wastewater summer droughts with low dilution potential for treated wastewater 90 could result in significant negative effects in downstream freshwater ecosystems such as macroinvertebrate mediated leaf mass loss i e during a leaf litter decomposition process and gammarids feeding rate i e in situ bioassays to assess non food quality related implications taking the pacific northwest u s as an example the variability of a receiving river flow has increased gradually especially in the wet weather season each year but because often wastewater utilities have allowable nutrient discharge limits both daily maximum and monthly average tied to the receiving river flow the toxicity limit gets more stringent as the river flow decreases therefore utilities are faced with the dilemma about how to manage the nutrient driven inventory and how to deal with the uncertainty on hydraulic throughput and nitrification capacity if the utility maintains complete nitrification continuously the extra biomass inventory will create a risk of secondary clarifier overload during wet weather events due to increased throughput in contrast if a low inventory is maintained once the river flow drops the utility will be at risk of not meeting the permit due to a more stringent nutrient discharge limit caused by reduced flow currently utilities such as clean water services or cws that was studied in this work mostly rely on empirical knowledge collected by the operators to make decisions based on estimated flow in conjunction with weather forecasting which are not effective qualitative rather than quantitative or efficient lagged responses to a flow change so can be greatly improved the need for additional guidance could be addressed by soft sensors based on machine learning ml algorithms as such methods will help provide accurate flow prediction and early warning mechanisms that lead to the development and execution of more effective control strategies soft sensing which can be part of a hybrid mechanistic and data driven modeling architecture schneider et al 2022 or a digital twin strategy torfs et al 2022 offers numerous merits such as low cost fast response and potential to work in parallel with hard sensors fortuna et al 2007 soft sensors can be used to forecast both influent wastewater flow and receiving river flow to help decision makers better estimate the appropriate biomass inventory level in the bioreactors so either biomass overloading or discharge overlimit can be prevented soft sensor studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of wastewater flow forecasting though not the receiving river flow for example fernandez et al 2009 tested fuzzy neural networks models on forecasting of the next day s average influent wastewater flow based on the day of the week and the most recent day s average flow and the average prediction errors were below 10 zhu and anderson 2019 developed a matlab based iterated stepwise multiple linear regression ismlr package to predict the next day s influent flow at the kirie water reclamation plant in chicago in which they compared nine individual or hybrid i e combining more than one statistical and ml methods soft sensor methods and suggested that the hybrid model based on ismlr and artificial neural network ann obtained the best performance adj r2 0 834 mape 13 3 using historical and easily acquirable influent data more recently apaydin et al 2021 adopted singular spectral analysis ssa seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl and ann to forecast monthly river flow based on streamflow precipitation relative humidity and temperature data but such studies kisi et al 2019 apaydin et al 2021 only provided a one time deterministic prediction that cannot be used in daily wastewater operations they might also have data leakage problems associated with cross validation or ssa stl applications resulting in over optimistic results data leakage management in ml modeling was not studied frequently by environmental researchers but the problems can easily happen without a rigorous data preprocessing for example feature scaling applied before k fold cross validation leaks information between the pre training k 1 parts of the training dataset and validation subsets and the scaling should be used as a part of the cross validation process based on only the pre training subset in this study we aimed to fill the gap from empirical knowledge based to more intelligent quantifiable decision making and help better manage wastewater operation and discharge by developing a daily updated prediction model to forecast the next month s average receiving river flowrate routine historical data that can be readily obtained by the utility were used and ml methods were assessed to obtain reliable forecasting results furthermore to avoid the aforementioned operation risk we developed ml based probabilistic prediction models to minimize river flow overestimation as river flow is the determinant factor for effluent ammonia nitrogen limits table s1 this paper is organized by first presenting facility and data collection and preprocessing followed by soft sensor development and performance evaluation we also compared 11 ml methods for deterministic prediction and discussed the adaptive prediction and classification among the best performing models results of probabilistic adaptive prediction and classification are subsequently presented and discussed 2 methodology 2 1 wastewater facility receiving river and associated data collection rock creek water resource recovery facility rc wrrf is one of the four wastewater treatment facilities that are operated by clean water services cws in urban washington county oregon us the rc wrrf has operated since 1978 and treats an average of about 168 000 m3 day wastewater to provide services for more than 300 000 residents during the wet weather season the facility has toxicity based effluent ammonia limits the allowable ammonia limit both daily maximum highest allowable value for daily concentrations and monthly average highest allowable average of daily concentrations over a calendar month is tied to the tualatin river flow at farmington oregon and the toxicity limit gets more stringent as the river flow decreases table s1 after an extensive collection of data we identified data sources from two united states geological survey usgs river monitoring sites farmington and west linn owrd 2021 and 40 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa meteorological sites noaa 2021 for a period of 81 years 10 1939 12 2020 fig 1 daily data of the tualatin river flow at west linn were used to fill the gaps of missing data found in the daily data of the tualatin river flow at farmington the 40 meteorological sites located in the upstream region eight zip codes of the tualatin river were used to identify useful weather related information i e rain snow air temperature while different noaa sites have had monitored different variables for inconsistent periods with missing data all the sites were synthesized to create a complete 81 year meteorological dataset instead of calculating average air temperatures we directly adopted the minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperatures found in the raw data table s2 summarizes the data sources and variables that were used in this work details of data preprocessing are described in the next section 2 2 soft sensor development the soft sensor development started from data collection and as aforementioned 81 years of data from oregon water resources department owrd usgs and noaa databases were retrieved for the study fig 2 a because the data between west linn and farmington were highly correlated r 0 98 and river flow data at west linn were nearly complete 100 so missing data at farmington were filled based on their correlation and corresponding west linn daily flow data the daily flow data were then averaged to calculate monthly average river flow data for each of the meteorological variables average values of the data available from the 40 noaa sites were used this substitution was especially important for years prior to 2010 when data from only a few sites were available fig s1 when converting from daily data to monthly data averaging and summation were applied to river flow or temperature and rain or snow respectively in addition to the representative monthly values we also added statistical variables based on daily data maximum daily value rain max snow max and count of event days for rain or snow 2 54 mm or 0 1 inch rain count snow count for each month to enrich the input information as a result nine variables and their corresponding 975 monthly data were initially prepared the matlab based ismlr package ismlr 2019 was first used to preprocess and develop regressor based datasets time dependent regressors as described below technical outliers were detected based on the expert knowledge such as detection limits and reasonable ranges of variables and no technical outliers were found in the dataset statistical outliers were found based on a distance based heuristic method which could identify distanced tails of ordered data details in text s1 only seven statistical outliers were identified but they were not excluded from the dataset because they represent extreme wet weather events which may provide important information to the prediction model for example a record maximum monthly snow value 1746 2 mm was identified in january 1950 and compared to january february had less amounts of rain 208 5 319 1 mm and snow 55 9 mm but a higher river flow 170 5 135 9 cms or cubic meter per second due to the accumulated snow in january the next step was to develop time dependent regressors from variables based on periodogram analysis a time pattern identification approach using a fourier series model zhu and anderson 2016 with the help of periodogram analysis we could retain important data that contributed both near time information and periodicity to the prediction model unsurprisingly all the ten variables exhibit a strong yearly periodic pattern fig s2 suggesting that the same moving window should be applied to the most recent 12 data points for example the variable river river flow was developed to river t river t 1 river t 11 t stands for the current month and t x is used to indicate x months earlier than the current month in other words we used variables t x x 0 1 11 to predict river t 1 in addition because we could continuously acquire updated daily information e g days 1 2 3 over the course of the predicted month t 1 it would be useful to adaptively predict river t 1 over the month for making better adaptable decisions to include the concept of adaptive in the response variable we denoted it as river t 1 dn where d stands for day and n indicates the number of days elapsed in the predicted month we initially focused on river t 1 d0 the end of current month and later applied the model to the predicted month all regressors were normalized based on their corresponding maximum and minimum values before further soft sensor development the 81 years of data were divided into training 1939 1999 and testing 2000 2020 datasets and this configuration remained consistent in all subsequent soft sensor development work two feature selection methods principal components analysis pca and ismlr were compared for their ability to retain important information for ml prediction models eleven ml methods were compared in this study and a brief introduction of the ml methods is included in the supporting information table s3 text s2 the k fold cross validation was used with grid search to identify the optimal model s based on the training dataset fig 2 b the average cross validation score for each modeling run was used to rank the model performance the implementation of ml algorithms was conducted based on two steps in the first step 11 algorithms were used to generate 1239 ml models k 3 using a grid search approach with typical ranges of hyperparameters several of the methods identified shared the same type s of hyperparameter s such as the number of estimators and these were set to the same values to be tested table s4 three methods were selected based on the prediction performance in the second step those three methods were further evaluated using a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization assessment that involved a change of k value from 3 to 5 the result of that screening identified a more robust model 2 3 evaluation metrics and optimal model selection prediction performance was first quantified based on four typical single metrics mape adjusted r2 rmse and mae eqs 1 5 while it can be useful to compare the individual scores among models it would be challenging to determine a better candidate if there was a tradeoff between two or more metrics therefore an overall accuracy index oai was calculated based on the four individual metrics to account for the overall prediction performance eq 6 and the oai value was the key parameter to decide optimal methods or models for example each of the 11 ml methods could generate a range of results and the best three ml methods were determined based on their corresponding best performed model with the highest oai values 1 mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 2 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 adjusted r 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n k 1 4 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 5 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i 6 oai adj r 2 mape rmse mae in addition to the oai the ml model selection was also based on the robustness sensitivity of the method i e the ability to minimize the risk of generating poor results we identified and excluded the following methods in the initial method selection step based on robustness 1 any methods that produced negative oai values 2 up to three methods to ensure at least three methods were left for the final model selection that generated highest relative standard deviation rsd sd mean based on the oai values because the model will need to be periodically re optimized by onsite personnel using updated data in the facility and they will rely on the final selected method therefore this characteristic is important to provide more confidence on prediction stability and even operators with no expertise in data science can have less concern to use ml tools for prediction and decision making haimi et al 2013 therrien et al 2020 2 4 adaptive predictions and classifications the selected optimum model was used to continuously predict river t 1 with updated daily information to simplify the problem we focused on predictions over the first 28 days of the month because river t 1 d28 should be very close to the monthly average data the predicted results were first evaluated using the four individual metrics described above and then converted from the numeric data to categorical classes based on the three categories of river flow 14 16 14 16 28 32 and 28 32 cms for different allowable ammonia limits for the rc wrrf table s1 the classification results were later evaluated based on accuracy and f1 score accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified data tp true positive and tn true negative to all observations eq 7 f1 score the harmonic mean of precision eq 8 and recall eq 9 is a score to show the incorrectly classified data eq 10 precision and recall measure correctly identified positive data from all the predicted positive data tp and fp false positive and all the true positive data tp and fn false negative respectively a confusion matrix was adopted to display the changes of correct classifications tp tn as well as overestimated fn and underestimated fp classes for different days in the predicted month 7 accuracy tp tn tp tn fp fn 8 precision tp tp fp 9 recall tp tp fn 10 f 1 score precisio n 1 recal l 1 2 1 2 tp 2 tp fp fn 2 5 probabilistic predictions and risk management risk management is a priority of wrrf operations so probabilistic predictions were used to enhance the reliability of soft sensor implementation for this study the risk is mainly associated with the overestimation of the river flow classes and the wrong information can be used by the onsite personnel to develop inappropriate control strategies therefore it would be important to prevent or minimize the overestimations fn e g a low class of river flow is mistakenly classified as the medium class even with a certain level of sacrifice in the overall accuracy the probabilistic inference was applied to monthly adaptive predictions based on 95 lower and upper prediction intervals pi using the optimal model and the lower pi was used to manage the risk by minimizing the overestimations to evaluate the degree of risk management the percentages of fn in the entire samples as well as in the low and medium classes were calculated and compared based on raw using the deterministic mean value and risk managed using the 95 lower pi scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal model determination pca and ismlr were applied and compared for their effectiveness on feature selection fig 3 exhibits the prediction performance i e oai of the 11 ml methods based on pca fig 3 a or ismlr fig 3 b followed by a final model selection step from their corresponding best three methods based on pca fig 3 c or ismlr fig 3 d for each method the box plot shows a range of prediction results based on different combinations of hyperparameter values a higher oai value stands for a better agreement between measured and predicted data a larger range of a box means a greater variability and the model results are more sensitive to the hyperparameter values and a negative oai value suggests that the method is likely to generate extreme poor results pca of the 108 regressors shows that the majority of the information can be extracted by the first 30 pcs the first significant drop in mse is found at 6 pcs that is able to explain about 70 of variance and the explained variance increases smoothly before 30 pcs and mse stays at roughly 700 cms2 fig s3 we adopted 6 pcs for further modeling because it achieves a local minimum of mse and avoid potential overtraining from excess pcs pca ml methods exhibit oai values ranging from 4 5 10 4 based on extreme gradient boosting regression or xgbr to 1 2 10 3 kernel ridge regression or krr 1 cms2 in the initial tests k 3 where the negative oai values are due to negative adjusted r2 values figs 3 a and s4 among the 11 ml methods based on the corresponding 1239 models seven methods generated negative oai values and they were excluded from the selection table s5 for example xgbr lower to 4 5 10 4 1 cms2 gaussian process regression gpr 2 8 10 4 and support vector regression svr 9 4 10 4 generated the lowest negative oai values fig 3 a in addition to the seven methods adaboost regression abr that exhibited a large deviation of oai values rsd 0 377 was also excluded because a large rsd value indicates that the model performance is very sensitive to their hyperparameter values as a result decision tree regression dtr extra trees regression etr and random forest regression rfr were selected to be further investigated in the second step of ml model optimization k 5 where 1200 models were assessed table s6 the best pca based ml model oai 1 48 10 3 1 cms2 is found when using the etr method in the final model selection step the oai values based on rfr up to 1 43 10 3 1 cms2 are similar to etr but are slightly higher dtr does not obtain relatively high oai values up to 1 01 10 3 1 cms2 figs 3 c and s5 table s7 seven important regressors that were identified from the 108 initial regressors using ismlr include rain t snow max t rain t 1 river t 10 tmax t 5 snow count t 11 and snow max t 9 table s8 the regressors rain t snow max t and rain t 1 represent the most recent meteorological conditions in addition to the most recent data river t 10 snow count t 11 and snow max t 9 provide important periodic information because their time gaps are all close to the 12 month period the discrepancy of the time gaps may be because of additional information needed to develop the model for example snow count and snow max could give long term cumulative and short term peak information respectively ismlr ml methods have similar patterns as described however remain differences in the magnitude of oai values up to 4 1 10 3 1 cms2 and several methods figs 3 b and s6 for example k nearest neighbors regression knn gives exceptionally promising results 4 09 10 3 1 cms2 gradient boosting regression gbr performs uniquely while its best results are close to the highest oai values but the remaining part covers up negative oai values making the method no longer a good candidate table s9 overall gbr lower to 2 31 10 5 1 cms2 gpr 1 54 10 3 histogram based gradient boosting regression hgbr 6 58 10 7 krr 2 34 10 5 svr 1 13 10 4 and xgbr 6 54 10 4 were excluded from the model selection due to negative oai values and abr rsd 0 388 and dtr 0 423 were subsequently excluded due to large rsd values etr oai up to 3 17 10 3 1 cms2 rsd 0 134 knn 4 09 10 3 1 cms2 0 223 and rfr 2 97 10 3 1 cms2 0 111 which exhibit relatively positive and high oai values with small rsd values were further examined by a more detailed hyperparameter optimization table s10 an assessment of 1242 models at the second step suggests that knn achieves the highest oai value 4 57 10 3 1 cms2 followed by etr 3 94 10 3 1 cms2 and rfr 3 86 10 3 1 cms2 figs 3 d and s7 table s11 by using a two step model selection process each of the best pca and ismlr based models were identified and evaluated based on the testing data table s12 similar to the cross validation training assessment ismlr ml models are superior to pca ml models the ismlr etr model number of estimators 400 max depth 20 min samples split 10 was selected to be the final optimum prediction model because the model gained the best individual scores based on mape rmse adj r2 as well as oai value 4 79 10 3 1 cms2 among the three ismlr ml models in addition the etr model is made of 400 dtr sub models so the model internal structure is readable fig s8 for example the dtr model could start from a random sampling sample size 602 of the initial dataset based on a root node with rain t 0 537 mm here left and right arrows from the node always indicates true and false respectively fig s8 c presuming it is a false condition an internal node with snow count t 11 0 739 mm will be used to determine the next rule based internal classification and with the same approach the model will provide the final prediction result value in the node in the bottom leaf node based on the given input data furthermore the rsd of prediction accuracies resulting from the etr model is much smaller than knn models and as previously mentioned that the great stability can be important when the model is implemented and operated by personnel who might not be familiar with data science overall the model is able to achieve a more accurate performance mape 41 5 adj r2 0 6009 rmse 23 31 cms mae 12 96 cms to predict the next month s average river flow compared to other models tested as discussed later due to the large time gap monthly the prediction accuracy can be further improved by developing adaptive models to obtain updated prediction result over the course of the next month so the updating forecast information rather than a one time outdated data point will be incorporated in the models fig 3 e 3 2 adaptive predictions over the t 1 month one approach to adaptively predict the river flow is to not only update the daily data over the month but also re optimize the model every time to ensure the best models are used the etr models can accomplish this without the need of frequent model optimization because it has the advantage of relatively stable performance the 29 ismlr etr models used different important regressors derived from ismlr feature selection over the predicted month table s13 the number of important regressors ranges from 6 to 14 snow t frequency 28 and rain t 26 are the most frequent regressors used for the 29 models followed by snow count t 11 25 tmax t 4 19 and snow max t 9 18 among the top regressors from the 29 models rain t frequency 11 is the most frequent regressor followed by river t 10 7 and river t 11 6 the results offer a good example to differentiate feature importance and feature contribution commonly used interchangeably in environmental community among these regressors rain t is both very important and has a high contribution to the models whereas snow t is important but provides a less contribution river t 10 is the top contributor to some models but not as important as snow count t 11 for the whole family of adaptive models as expected the prediction accuracy increases with increasing number of days elapsed in the month because the corresponding incremental daily data were used to improve the model performance fig 4 a based on the testing dataset adjusted r2 increases from 0 6009 to 0 9942 mape rmse and mae decrease from 41 46 23 31 cms and 12 96 cms to 3 31 2 81 cms and 1 11 cms respectively for example a significant improvement can be found on the 14th day of the predicted month when adjusted r2 and mape are 0 8607 and 19 06 respectively and many peaks are well forecasted the evaluation scores become 0 9637 and 10 19 on the 21st day respectively and the two curves show good correspondence fig 4 b the model residuals distribute randomly along the testing period and high residual values are typically observed at peak flows fig 4 c again because river flow overestimation creates a high risk of failing to meet the effluent limit when maintaining the overall model accuracy negative residuals overestimations were emphasized for example the top three extreme negative residuals on model d0 are in 11 2009 43 59 cms 11 2011 41 82 and 11 2017 40 76 they are reduced by models d7 d14 and d21 to 12 88 22 56 20 49 5 49 8 59 8 06 and 0 19 1 65 0 75 respectively the number of extreme overestimations 20 cms for models d0 d7 d14 and d21 are 18 14 5 and 2 respectively however exceptions exist model d21 generally performs better than d14 but the former model predicted flow 130 86 cms seriously overestimates the monthly river flow in 12 2006 true flow 89 03 cms a residual of 41 83 cms worse than models d7 33 30 cms and even d0 18 03 cms a closer inspection of raw data shows that the big rainfall event in the second week of the month may result in a rare outcome fig s9 interestingly the ammonia limits are based on the three classes of river flow so any flow above 28 32 cms 1000 cfs requires the same monthly average ammonia limit table s1 therefore the next section will introduce the assessment results of the classification accuracy which could provide the direct information for process decision making 3 3 assessment of predicted flow classes accuracy and f1 score were used to evaluate the classification performance of the adaptive models over the month figs 5 a and s10 the overall accuracy stays at a high level all the time and gradually increases from about 0 8 to 1 the high accuracy is mainly contributed from low 14 16 cms and high 28 32 cms flow classes which account for about 88 of all data the medium flow class does not have an acceptable accuracy until two weeks later with an accuracy of 0 6 the low accuracy in the medium flow class is likely due to its narrow range 14 16 28 32 cms so it is more likely to exceed the lower or upper bounds the low flow class that has the same size of flow range but is able to achieve high accuracies probably because most of the months in this class belong to a dry weather scenario and because there is little meteorological perturbation the model provides accurate predictions f1 scores of the classes show a similar pattern except for the high class which is slightly lower than its values based on accuracy f1 score is the harmonic mean of precision tp tp fp and recall tp tp fn so it tends to more focus on fp and fn because overestimation can create a risk for wrongly determining a false higher flow class so the samples classified as fn should be taken into a risk assessment for example on the 7th day seven 5 2 months out of 119 from the low flow class are wrongly classified into the medium or high flow classes while 16 months out of 35 that are grouped to the high flow class should be in the medium flow class fig 5 b the situation gets better over the time figs 5 b and s10 and on day 21 they are reduced to 3 and 7 respectively the classification results help to point out the crucial part fn in the medium or high flow classes that need to be further taken care to avoid permit violation the next step was to develop probabilistic models that can provide prediction bounds beside the deterministic values for better risk management as described in the next section 3 4 probabilistic inference and risk management probabilistic inference was conducted based on 400 random dtr sub models in each of the 28 etr models over the predicted month we were able to acquire the details and prediction results from the 400 dtr models by revising the source code of the python package scikit learn sklearn 2021 for example fig 6 a shows the probabilistic predictions of the river flow over the course of february 2020 the month was randomly selected from the range november april a time period when the ammonia limit is based on the river flow table s1 the mean predicted values are the conventional deterministic values obtained using the etr models whereas the box plots illustrate the evolution of prediction uncertainty over the days in the month as expected the range of pi decreases from 96 0 9 4 86 7 to 13 1 14 5 27 6 cms with increasing number of elapsed days the average river flow in february 2020 was about 20 2 cms which should be classified as the medium flow class 14 16 28 32 cms before applying the probabilistic assessment eight of the 28 deterministic prediction values over the month are above 28 32 cms so their corresponding predicted classes are mistakenly classified as the high flow class in contrast based on the probabilistic predictions the real monthly average river flow is well between the pis for all 28 evolving models which also exhibit a reliable shrunken range over the time more importantly using the 95 lower pi as the critical value to classify the river flow makes it possible to better manage the overestimation risk after the risk management it can be seen that several predicted classes are underestimated but none of them is overestimated meeting the conservative objectives similarly the majority of the predictions are well between the pis based on the testing dataset for example on day 14 only a few data are underestimated in 2016 and 2017 but are rarely overestimated fig 6 b specifically the top five overestimated data based on residual values using the deterministic approach are in 12 2006 measured 89 0 cms vs predicted 130 2 cms 12 2008 105 7 vs 136 2 12 2002 81 8 vs 108 8 12 2000 13 7 vs 36 5 and 1 2020 72 8 vs 94 2 the 95 lower bounds using the probabilistic approach are 89 0 95 1 66 6 6 7 and 38 2 cms respectively clearly all the overestimations are well managed especially the case of 12 2000 13 7 cms that was initially assigned to the low flow class 14 2 cms is well corrected by the lower bound 6 7 cms or the low flow class from the previous mistakenly predicted value 36 5 cms or the high flow class as previously noted the only difference among different days would be the range of pis which is getting narrower over the days fig 6 c displays the occurrences of prediction error for the entire time period 251 months 28 days month based on the pi only about 0 3 of valid cases are numerically overestimated and 90 of the overestimation cases are found on the first 13 days the remaining occurrences include 92 3 between pis and 7 4 underestimations overall the classification accuracy is sacrificed for the purpose of risk management so the accuracy increases from only about 0 61 to 0 91 over the month raw 0 78 0 97 fig 6 d in addition the percentage of false negative fn or categorical overestimations up to 17 4 on day 2 using the raw predicted classes are well minimized to nearly 0 across the 28 days with the risk managed specifically the fn in the low flow class can be up to 15 1 and the percentage keeps higher than 5 until after 16 days the situation in the medium flow class seems to be even worse because fn jumps to be more than 70 initially and decreases to about 15 at the end of the month although the sample size of river flow in the medium flow class is relatively small 35 of 251 the unexpected high fn can significantly affect the model usability onsite conversely the lower pis successfully reduce fn to almost a flat line in both flow classes with only a few minor errors initially which can provide the operators a high confidence of risk management to make better operational decisions 4 conclusion this work presents a first feasibility study in developing an adaptive probabilistic soft sensor tool to predict the next month s average receiving river flow which is critical for guiding wrrf operation and control effluent limits e g ammonia nitrogen results from this work are summarized as follows the study assessed two feature selection methods with 11 ml methods leading to about 5000 ml models with different hyperparameter values tested based on a two step model selection process ismlr ml shows more promising results relative to pca ml among the best ismlr ml methods ismlr knn exhibited the highest prediction accuracy oai up to 4 5 10 3 1 cms2 to forecast river t 1 d0 based on cross validation and training dataset but obtained lower performance 3 7 10 3 1 cms2 based on the testing dataset ismlr etr can achieve a similar results up to 3 9 10 3 1 cms2 during the model selection steps while also achieved better performance mape 41 5 adj r2 0 6009 rmse 23 31 cms mae 12 96 cms based on the testing dataset performance of adaptive predictions based on ismlr etr models increases steadily over the course of the month after 14 and 28 days adjusted r2 increases from 0 6009 to 0 8607 to 0 9942 mape rmse and mae decrease from 41 46 23 31 cms and 12 96 cms to 19 06 13 60 cms and 7 29 cms to 3 31 2 81 cms and 1 11 cms respectively based on the 29 ismlr preprocessed datasets snow t and rain t are the two most important regressors followed by snow count t 11 tmax t 4 and snow max t 9 classification shows the overall accuracy of the three river flow classes can reach about 0 79 for river t 1 d0 and increases to about 0 97 over time compared to the low from 0 89 to 0 99 and high from 0 83 to 0 99 flow classes that have similar high accuracy the medium flow class exhibits a much lower accuracy initially 0 31 and slowly increases to 0 51 to 0 86 after 14 and 28 days respectively ensemble methods such as etr make it possible to provide a probabilistic assessment on the predictions using 95 lower pi the percentage of overestimations false negative can be reduced from up to 17 to nearly zero for the overall evaluation and even for the medium flow class that can have up to 70 overestimations can also be reduced to around zero the nearly perfect risk management sacrifices a certain overall classification accuracy which increases from about 0 61 to 0 73 to 0 91 after 14 and 28 days respectively while this study shows encouraging results on balancing the prediction accuracy and risk management several aspects can be further improved in future studies first a big fraction 54 4 of the river flow data at farmington was missing and filled based on a high correlation r 0 98 with the flow at another site west linn such challenges are common but it should be less of a concern in the future as such data are becoming increasingly available developing a robust soft sensor to predict monthly data requires a much longer period of data e g 50 years than it needs for daily e g several years or hourly e g a year or less data forecasts also weather forecast data could be used to provide a valuable contribution to the models but the main reason we didn t use weather data was due to the limited data availability in addition the study was conducted from the standpoint of wastewater utilities based on accessible local data future work will include selected large scale climate data kisi et al 2019 in the analysis to capture the long term drift information as well as easy to use dashboard development to show soft sensor based state point analysis

15867,membrane flux recovery efficiency and durability are two key factors closely associated with the practical application for membrane cleaning process however conventional chemical membrane cleaning method by soaking the whole membrane module in highly concentrated chemical reagents has prominent drawbacks including the low mass transfer efficiency of reagents long period of washing time and the potential threat to membrane structure herein for the first time we report a facile approach to fabricate the sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets which show bubbling reaction to release oxygen and free radicals when being dispersed in water for membrane cleaning due to the synergistic effect of mno2 and sodium percarbonate the tablets are highly effective to clean the membrane fouled by humic acid within 5 min with the terminal membrane flux being recovered from 0 50 to 0 95 and the irreversible fouling resistance being reduced by more than 90 which is prominently more efficient than the conventional chemical cleaning methods moreover even by consecutive membrane fouling and cleaning for 6 times the membrane flux and filtration efficiency of the membrane could still be kept almost constant and the moderateness of this membrane cleaning method was also verified by the systematic microscopic analysis for mechanism study results of electron spin resonance esr and quenching experiments indicated that the high efficiency and robust durability of sodium percarbonate mno2 spc mno2 system for membrane cleaning was mainly attributed to the abundantly generated hydroxyl radicals and secondary free radicals i e carbonate radicals conclusively compared with the conventional membrane cleaning method with liquid cleaning reagents the novel spc mno2 system with remarkable advantages in terms of convenience and membrane cleaning performance demonstrated high potential for the wide application in practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane fouling membrane cleaning sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescence 1 introduction membrane fouling is always a critical limiting factor for the wider application of ultrafiltration uf in practice natural organic matter nom such as humic acid ha is considered to be the main irreversible foulant in long term filtration process campinas and rosa 2010 the foulants are remained on membrane surface or in membrane pores leading to great decrease in water permeate flux and quality as well as increasing energy demand and shortening membrane lifetime tang et al 2021 yao et al 2022 many methods for alleviating membrane fouling have been developed including the optimization of cleaning procedures i e backwashing zhang et al 2020 and operating conditions such as optimization of fluid dynamic conditions and operating under low flux etc arkhangelsky et al 2021 xu and gao 2010 membrane modification such as adding hydrophilic additive into hydrophobic material jiang et al 2021 and pre treatment to control membrane fouling guo et al 2020 however such strategies have limitations for the treatment of persistent foulants and irreversible membrane fouling is inevitable as proliferative foulants accumulate over time so it is necessary to conduct more effective chemical cleaning method such as fenton like reaction being initiated through the reaction between transition metal ions and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the process could generate free radicals to remove irreversible foulants and separate them from membrane surface for example the proposed h2o2 mno2 cleaning system conducting for only 5 mins in 0 5 wt h2o2 solution could achieve outstanding membrane cleaning performance he et al 2019 as a green oxidizer h2o2 solution could be degraded instantly with mno2 as the catalyst to generate amounts of oxygen bubbles and free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals o h with strong oxidizing property li et al 2022 although the washed membrane performance after 6 runs of consecutive fouling and cleaning was almost unchanged long term frequent cleaning with such amounts of o h might still pose a potential damage to the organic polymer membranes such as polyethersulfone pes membrane gan et al 2021 therefore in practice the cleaning time and h2o2 concentration should be strictly controlled in case of the changes in the physicochemical properties of membranes and decline in the foulants removal efficiency as a result there is still an urgent need for a more moderate and durable cleaning method at the same time during long term storage and transportation aqueous solution of h2o2 gradually decomposes and the decomposition rate is increased by light irradiation agitation and heating ling et al 2021 in addition h2o2 solution is incompatible with reducing agents including organic matter and oxidizable substances kim et al 2021 due to the self decomposition part of the h2o2 solution dispersed in cleaning module can not be utilized for membrane cleaning which further reduces the utilization efficiency of it such instability of h2o2 aqueous solutions is a real safety threat for storage and transportation and increases the cost of membrane cleaning li et al 2020b to address these drawbacks sodium percarbonate spc which can gradually release h2o2 when being dissolved in water is always used as a solid replacement for h2o2 gao et al 2020 sodium percarbonate is considered as a versatile oxidant over a wide ph range with the characteristics of non toxicity excellent storage stability and environmental friendliness gao et al 2020 li et al 2019 effervescence can be defined as the release of dissolved bubbles from an aqueous solution accompanied by bubbling foaming and fizzing the bubbles can be introduced by chemical reactions such as the reactions of metal carbonates with acid to produce carbon dioxide bubbles elpa et al 2020 and most precursors used for effervescence are in the tablet form which is portable to reserve and carry medinskaia et al 2016 inspired by these we rationally designed a type of spc mno2 system via the simple pressing technique for membrane cleaning by simply changing the mass ratio of sodium percarbonate to mno2 the efficient and durable membrane cleaning performance was simultaneously achieved moreover the moderate and effective cleaning performance was attributed to both the generated abundant oxygen bubbles and the efficient conversion of o h to c o 3 2 which plays an important role in the degradation and transformation of humic acid ha containing electron rich moieties wojnárovits et al 2020 more importantly the spc mno2 system could be carried in a portable way and put into the membrane module when it is needed for in situ membrane cleaning demonstrating the potential applications under various complicated conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the polyethersulfone flat membrane pes molecular weight cut off 30 kda diameter 80 mm was purchased from mosu science equipment co ltd shanghai chemicals including humic acid ha sodium percarbonate na2co3 3h2o spc sodium hydroxide hydrogen peroxide h2o2 manganese dioxide mno2 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo phenol phoh tertiary butanol tba and other chemical reagents were all analytical reagents purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and directly used in the experiments without further purification 2 2 preparation and characteristics of spc mno2 system tablet precursors including sodium percarbonate and mno2 were precisely weighed and mixed at various mass ratio the mixture of solids was uniformly ground until the powder was homogeneous and fine subsequently the mixed homogeneous powder was compressed into tablets using a yp 2 single punch press shanghai shanyue scientific instrument co ltd shanghai china finally the tablets were packed in a sealed bag and stored in a desiccator for subsequent use fig 1 the tablet diameter and thickness were measured by vernier caliper diameter thickness and weight measurements were done by randomly selecting 10 tablets and taking the average as the results disintegration time to complete the effervescence was defined as the time to dissolve one tablet completely in 250 ml of milli q water mq water the time was recorded for six tablets and results were presented as the average standard deviation triplicate ph measurements of the solution after tablet disintegration were also conducted 2 3 permeability and ha filtration efficiency measurement ha was chosen as the representative organic foulants to load the membrane because it was the main type of membrane foulants for drinking water treatment li et al 2020a the ha solution with an initial concentration of 6 1 mg l based on the content of dissolved organic carbon doc was prepared according to the method in text s1 in the filtration experiments permeate flux was evaluated using a dead end stirred filtration cell stirred ultrafiltration cells model 8400 millipore usa with an effective filtration area of 32 5 cm2 and the trans membrane pressure tmp was remained constantly at 0 1 mpa see fig s1 the permeate flux was determined by collected permeate volume filtration time and membrane area the permeate flux of clean membrane j 0 was measured with mq water then the prepared feed of ha was used to load the membrane for the 6 h fouling tests without recycling the fouling tests by ha completed until the permeate flux decreased to 0 4 0 44 j f j 0 of the clean membrane in general the fouled membrane was firstly rinsed by mq water thoroughly for 10 mins to remove the reversible fouling and the permeate flux at this moment was measured to calculate the irreversible membrane fouling resistance r i r r f o u l e d after that for spc mno2 system the membrane was immersed in 250 ml mq water and then the prepared spc mno2 system was put into water directly for further membrane washing for h2o2 mno2 system the membrane was immersed in h2o2 solution 0 5 wt containing 25 mg mno2 particles for further washing he et al 2019 finally the membrane was washed with mq water again to remove the remaining chemicals and the permeate flux of washed membrane j w was measured with mq water three duplicated experiments were conducted at least the detailed expressions for the normalized flux f n membrane resistance in

organic carbon doc representing concentrations of ha was determined by organic carbon analyzer apg basisgerat analytik jena ag and three duplicated experiments were conducted at least for one sample scanning electron microscope sem quanta 200feg fei was used to observe the morphology of sodium percarbonate particles mno2 particles and membranes atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolution 030 118 bruker was used to characterize the membrane surface and roughness water contact angles were recorded with a contact angle goniometer qspj 360 jinshengxin co china to study the hydrophilicity property of membrane surface the major functional groups of ha was monitored by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectrum one perkinelmer three dimensional eems spectra 3d eem were acquired by front face sample holder with an incident angle of 30 orient koji china to characterize the removal of fluorescent components by membrane washing see text s3 electron spin resonance esr elexsys ii e560 bruker signals were measured using 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline dmpo as trapping agents to identify the generated reactive species see text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets the utilized sodium percarbonate and mno2 particles were firstly characterized by sem as shown in fig 2 the particle sizes of sodium percarbonate and mno2 were in the range of 30 35 μm and 20 25 μm respectively it could be seen that the size of particles was relatively uniform in the sample and the boundary was also clear after tablets pressing the novel sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets were characterized based on physical diameter thickness and weight and chemical disintegration time and solution ph after disintegration subsequently properties as well as energy dispersive spectroscopy eds elemental mapping to show the distribution of each element in the sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablet see fig s3 the key characteristics of sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets were listed in table 1 after disintegration the solution was transparent with no white sodium percarbonate particle being observed only small amounts of mno2 particles were precipitated in the bottom of beaker and some bubbles were stuck to their surface which could be observed by the video and images in the supporting information 3 2 evaluation of membrane cleaning performance the optimal mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio was determined by comparing the membrane flux recovery efficiency j j0 the tested mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio were 0 2 0 25 0 5 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 3 after being fouled by ha the permeate flux decreased to 0 48 of the clean membrane after being rinsed with mq water and washed by spc mno2 system with different mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratios j j0 was recovered from 0 48 to 0 67 0 75 and 0 96 when the mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio was 0 2 0 25 0 5 respectively further enhancement of mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio showed no promotion on the membrane cleaning performance therefore 0 5 was chosen as the optimal mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio for the washing process with the sodium percarbonate dosage being about 70 75 mg and mno2 dosage being about 30 35 mg to investigate the feasibility of the spc mno2 system on membrane cleaning herein the performance of spc mno2 system for membrane cleaning were evaluated in comparison of h2o2 mno2 system by membrane flux recovery rate j w j 0 and removal efficiency of irreversible fouling resistance 1 r i r r w a s h e d r i r r f o u l e d as shown in fig 4 a the membrane flux was recovered slightly by only mq water rinsing after membrane cleaning by spc mno2 system for 5 mins without extra stirring the final flux was recovered from 0 4 j f j 0 to 0 95 j w j 0 which demonstrated effective membrane cleaning performance comparable with h2o2 mno2 system while for the cases of sodium percarbonate or h2o2 alone no obvious membrane flux recovery was observed in addition as shown in fig 4b above 0 94 of irreversible membrane foulants could be removed effectively by spc mno2 system which was also comparable with h2o2 mno2 system by mno2 catalysis the h2o2 generated from sodium percarbonate could be degraded to release free radicals with oxidation capacity which might exert influence on the membrane filtration performance jiang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 for the case of h2o2 mno2 system the membrane performance was not changed prominently after consecutive fouling and cleaning which was possibly attributed to the short duration of the cleaning process he et al 2019 for spc mno2 system consecutive fouling and washing of one membrane were also conducted the key to evaluate the membrane performance was filtration efficiency of foulants it has been reported that an increase of membrane permeability and a decrease of filtration efficiency were generally related to increased pore size robinson et al 2016 as seen in fig 5 a the filtration efficiency of ha by clean pes membrane was about 0 84 and the filtration efficiency of ha by the same membrane used for the 6 consecutive membrane washing test was 0 839 0 852 0 840 0 852 0 854 and 0 845 respectively which exhibited similar filtration efficiency of ha to the clean one the results implied that the spc mno2 cleaning process did not alter the filtration ability of membrane as a comparison the pes membranes aged with naclo resulted in a substantial decrease in filtration efficiency of ha li et al 2021a according to the previous research under attacks by active oxidants the hydrophobic pes might undergo a chain scission of the backbone structure into sulfonic acid groups and phenyl chloride groups the sulfonic acid groups and phenyl chloride groups rendered the increased hydrophilicity of the pes membranes susanto and ulbricht 2009 as shown in fig 5b with the increase of fouling and washing circulations water contact angles of the same membrane kept stable between the values of 63 and 65 without apparent fluctuation which was comparable with that of clean membrane 64 and far less than that of fouled membrane 72 indicating the feasibility of the spc mno2 system the results showed that the normalized flux j w j 0 filtration efficiency of ha and contact angle could always be maintained almost consistent even after 6 times of consecutive membrane fouling and washing with spc mno2 system demonstrating that the spc mno2 system was an effective and durable method to remove irreversible membrane foulants 3 3 characterization of membrane surface change 3 3 1 comparison of membrane surface morphology sem images were taken to reveal the surface morphology of the membrane washed by spc mno2 system it could be seen that by only mq water rinsing the surface of fouled membranes was still covered with irreversible foulants in the form of a dense gel layer on membrane surface however after being washed by spc mno2 system it could be observed clearly that the membrane surface was recovered with almost no irreversible foulants being remained fig 6 c which demonstrated the spc mno2 system was an effective membrane washing method 3 3 2 three dimensional afm analysis the topography of clean fouled and washed membranes was determined by afm images and the average roughness ra root mean square roughness rq and maximum roughness rmax were utilized to quantitatively assess the changes of surface roughness among them ra reflects the average distance deviation of sample surface from the basic plane rq is the root mean square distance deviation of the sample surface from the basic plane and rmax indicates the difference between the largest positive and negative deviation in fig 7 the clean membrane showed obvious peaks and valleys distributed on membrane surface with rq ra of 4 59 0 85 3 6 0 71 nm fig 7 a in comparison after filtering the feed of ha deposits of foulants on the membrane surface was observed resulting in a much higher roughness of 163 12 1 132 10 4 nm fig 7 b when the fouled membrane was washed by the spc mno2 system peaks and valleys reappeared on the membrane surface fig 7 c meanwhile the roughness was recovered to 4 97 0 76 3 71 0 55 nm close to that of the clean membrane implying that the spc mno2 system could effectively remove the fouling layer without causing damage to the membrane surface 3 4 mechanisms for membrane cleaning by spc mno2 system 3 4 1 ftir comparison of treated ha by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems it has been reported that the free radicals could cause a characteristic variation in the functional groups of ha mohsin et al 2021 the spc mno2 system demonstrated outstanding and durable membrane cleaning performance which was comparable with h2o2 mno2 system while the different free radicals generated in the two systems might have different effects on the functional groups of ha to assess the oxidation capacity of spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems comparative investigation for the structural changes of ha by different membrane cleaning methods was conducted by ftir spectra as shown in fig 8 on the one hand for ha treated by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems the characteristic peaks of typical hydrophobic groups were apparently decreased and even disappeared after being treated by both washing methods such as the band at 2920 cm 1 attributing to ch3 and ch2 groups a cuspate peak at about 1406 cm 1 ascribing to c h deformation of ch2 and ch3 groups a shoulder at around 1013 1089 cm 1 corresponding to c o stretching of aryl ethers and phenols and the peak between 700 and 850 cm 1 representing c h out of plane deformation rodríguez et al 2016 wang et al 2016 while the intensities of hydrophilic indicators were enhanced or remained such as the broad band centered at about 3380 cm 1 attributing to the associated oh stretching vibrations alcohols phenols and carboxylic acids and the band at 1630 1720 cm 1 representing the structural vibrations of asymmetric stretch of coo groups yu et al 2005 the results indicated that ha became more hydrophilic by the reactions with spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems leading to the easier separation of them from the hydrophobic membrane surface on the other hand it could be observed the intensities of hydrophobic functional groups in ha was reduced more prominently by h2o2 mno2 system than that by spc mno2 system suggesting that h2o2 mno2 system had stronger oxidation capacity it should be notice that after the removal of irreversible foulants the oxidation system might further cause potential damage to the hydrophobic pes membrane during the washing process which could inhibit the membrane filtration performance in the long term operation therefore the results suggested that the spc mno2 system might be a more moderate washing strategy in comparison with the h2o2 mno2 system 3 4 2 3d eem comparison of ha treated by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems three dimensional fluorescence spectra is widely used to describe the physicochemical properties of ha qualitatively and quantitatively jacquin et al 2017 there are several different fluorescence groups in ha and the fluorescence characteristics of ha contain information related to structure functional group configuration heterogeneity intramolecular and intermolecular dynamics guo et al 2020 consistent with the ftir results eem spectroscopy displayed different attenuation levels of fluorescence intensity by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems respectively the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of ha were characterized with two main peaks marked as α and β the α peak was located at the ex em wavelengths of about 270 440 nm nm which could be ascribed to the simple organic structures of low molecular weight with low condensation degree of aromatic structures high fluorescence intensity in this area could be related to the electron donating composition such as hydroxyl groups in ha for β peak which was located at the ex em wavelengths of about 370 460 nm nm it could be attributed to ha of high molecular mass with unsaturated bonds representing aromatic ring networks quinones and phenols boguta et al 2019 rodríguez et al 2014 for original ha fig 9 a relative intensities of the two fluorophores areas were the highest among all samples after treated by h2o2 mno2 system for 5 mins the intensity of two fluorophores areas were both greatly decreased fig 9 d due to the oxidation by h2o2 mno2 system in comparison after treated by spc mno2 system for 5mins fig 9 b the fluorophores area α was less affected while the fluorophores area β was decreased indicating that only the high molecular weight ha with aromatic structure was progressively degraded by the spc mno2 system to further assess the oxidation capacity of free radicals in the two systems on ha the washing time was extended to 30 mins as shown in fig 9 c and 9 e the intensity of two fluorophores areas were almost totally disappeared in h2o2 mno2 system whereas they were still remained by the treatment of spc mno2 system the results suggested free radicals generated in h2o2 mno2 system had relatively stronger oxidation capacity but weaker oxidation selectivity while a better oxidation selectivity was exhibited for the free radicals generated in spc mno2 system in conclusion the 3d eem results were highly in accordance with ftir analysis which further confirmed that spc mno2 system was a moderate and durable membrane cleaning method 3 4 3 esr detection and scavenging tests of free radicals as revealed by the mentioned multiple techniques production of abundant free radicals might prominently alter the chemical composition of ha facilitating the ha separation from membrane surface through membrane washing process for h2o2 mno2 system besides the hydraulic turbulence caused by oxygen bubbles the membrane cleaning was achieved mainly by o h oxidation he et al 2019 for spc mno2 system effective cleaning performance and moderate washing property has been observed where possible reactive species o h may be converted to c o 3 because of the carbonate ions generated from sodium percarbonate gao et al 2020 to verify the generation of reactive species esr tests with dmpo as trapping agent were conducted to detect the generated free radicals qualitatively as shown in fig 10 a the characteristic peaks of dmpo o h and dmpo c o 3 2 were observed simultaneously demonstrating that both o h and c o 3 2 were existed in the spc mno2 system li et al 2021b the spectra in fig 10 b also illustrated the intensity of dmpo oh with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 confirming the presence of o h in h2o2 mno2 system chang et al 2022 it was noteworthy that the intensity of dmpo o h signals in spc mno2 system was weaker than that in h2o2 mno2 system fig 10 b which was attributed to the interaction between o h and c o 3 2 h c o 3 leading to the transformation of o h to c o 3 2 furthermore quenching experiments with tertiary butanol tba and phenol phoh as scavengers fig 10 c and d were also conducted the reaction activity between c o 3 2 and tba was much lower than that between o h and tba k o h t b a 3 8 7 6 10 8 m 1 s 1 k co 3 t b a 1 6 10 2 m 1 s 1 so the quenching efficiency of tba on c o 3 2 could be ignored compared with that on o h li et al 2021b liu et al 2018 therefore tba was involved to assess the contributions of o h in spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems respectively as presented in fig 10 d without tba the membrane flux could be restored from 0 45 j f j 0 to 0 96 j w j 0 by h2o2 mno2 system however when 10 mm tba was added j w j 0 was only recovered to 0 59 manifesting that o h did play a dominant role in the h2o2 mno2 cleaning process via the fenton like reactions in contrast even in the presence of tba the flux of the membrane could still be restored greatly from 0 39 j f j 0 to 0 82 j w j 0 by spc mno2 system indicating that there were still other dominant reactive species generated in this system to further verify the results 10 mm phoh as the scavenger of both o h k o h p h o h 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 and c o 3 k c o 3 p h o h 2 2 10 7 m 1 s 1 were added into the spc mno2 system li et al 2021b as observed in fig 10 c j w j 0 was only recovered to 0 51 the discrepancy of recovery efficiencies between conditions of tba and phoh verified that c o 3 2 did contribute to the removal of irreversible foulants in the spc mno2 system which was consistent with the esr tests 3 4 4 proposed reaction mechanism in spc mno2 system according to the results of esr tests and quenching experiments the possible reaction pathways through spc mno2 system were displayed as eqs 1 7 gao et al 2020 jildeh et al 2018 and fig 11 as described by eqs 1 and 2 the c o 3 2 was generated along with h2o2 when sodium percarbonate was gradually dissolved in water subsequently some of the c o 3 2 was hydrolyzed to h c o 3 see eq 3 meanwhile the released h2o2 was decomposed to generate o 2 and o h by m n 4 catalysis see eq 4 6 it was reported that the presence of c o 3 2 and h c o 3 could exert great influence on c o 3 2 and o h which played an important role in the transformation of o h to c o 3 2 see eq 7 8 and the transform rate constant of reaction 7 and 8 could reach to the high values of 3 0 108 m 1s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1s 1 respectively cui et al 2017 c o 3 2 displayed the weaker oxidative capability e c o 3 c o 3 2 1 57 ev than o h e o h o h 2 76 ev which reduced the overall oxidation capacity of the system on organic membranes liu et al 2021 1 2 n a 2 c o 3 3 h 2 o 2 2 n a 2 c o 3 3 h 2 o 2 2 n a 2 c o 3 2 n a c o 3 2 3 c o 3 2 h 2 o h c o 3 o h 4 m n 4 h 2 o 2 h m n 3 h

for the first time to achieve the effective cleaning of pes membranes fouled by ha especially more than 95 permeate flux was recovered and almost total irreversible foulants were removed by this system results of ftir and eem spectra implied that the spc mno2 system was a more moderate and durable membrane cleaning method compared to h2o2 mno2 system based on the esr tests and quenching experiments the generated o h was transformed to c o 3 2 in the presence of c o 3 2 h c o 3 ions and c o 3 2 played a significant role in the spc mno2 system to achieve the moderate membrane cleaning moreover as a solid carrier of liquid h2o2 the novel spc mno2 system with superior stability longer storage time and anti explosion property is easier to be transported which is a cost effective approach for membrane cleaning in conclusion compared with the conventional membrane cleaning methods spc mno2 system with the high mass transfer rate of reactive components demonstrates remarkable advantages of high membrane cleaning efficiency and robust durability further tests are suggested to employ this system for the practical water treatment process and investigate whether the high membrane cleaning efficiency could also be achieved for other types of membrane module such as ceramic membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15867,membrane flux recovery efficiency and durability are two key factors closely associated with the practical application for membrane cleaning process however conventional chemical membrane cleaning method by soaking the whole membrane module in highly concentrated chemical reagents has prominent drawbacks including the low mass transfer efficiency of reagents long period of washing time and the potential threat to membrane structure herein for the first time we report a facile approach to fabricate the sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets which show bubbling reaction to release oxygen and free radicals when being dispersed in water for membrane cleaning due to the synergistic effect of mno2 and sodium percarbonate the tablets are highly effective to clean the membrane fouled by humic acid within 5 min with the terminal membrane flux being recovered from 0 50 to 0 95 and the irreversible fouling resistance being reduced by more than 90 which is prominently more efficient than the conventional chemical cleaning methods moreover even by consecutive membrane fouling and cleaning for 6 times the membrane flux and filtration efficiency of the membrane could still be kept almost constant and the moderateness of this membrane cleaning method was also verified by the systematic microscopic analysis for mechanism study results of electron spin resonance esr and quenching experiments indicated that the high efficiency and robust durability of sodium percarbonate mno2 spc mno2 system for membrane cleaning was mainly attributed to the abundantly generated hydroxyl radicals and secondary free radicals i e carbonate radicals conclusively compared with the conventional membrane cleaning method with liquid cleaning reagents the novel spc mno2 system with remarkable advantages in terms of convenience and membrane cleaning performance demonstrated high potential for the wide application in practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane fouling membrane cleaning sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescence 1 introduction membrane fouling is always a critical limiting factor for the wider application of ultrafiltration uf in practice natural organic matter nom such as humic acid ha is considered to be the main irreversible foulant in long term filtration process campinas and rosa 2010 the foulants are remained on membrane surface or in membrane pores leading to great decrease in water permeate flux and quality as well as increasing energy demand and shortening membrane lifetime tang et al 2021 yao et al 2022 many methods for alleviating membrane fouling have been developed including the optimization of cleaning procedures i e backwashing zhang et al 2020 and operating conditions such as optimization of fluid dynamic conditions and operating under low flux etc arkhangelsky et al 2021 xu and gao 2010 membrane modification such as adding hydrophilic additive into hydrophobic material jiang et al 2021 and pre treatment to control membrane fouling guo et al 2020 however such strategies have limitations for the treatment of persistent foulants and irreversible membrane fouling is inevitable as proliferative foulants accumulate over time so it is necessary to conduct more effective chemical cleaning method such as fenton like reaction being initiated through the reaction between transition metal ions and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the process could generate free radicals to remove irreversible foulants and separate them from membrane surface for example the proposed h2o2 mno2 cleaning system conducting for only 5 mins in 0 5 wt h2o2 solution could achieve outstanding membrane cleaning performance he et al 2019 as a green oxidizer h2o2 solution could be degraded instantly with mno2 as the catalyst to generate amounts of oxygen bubbles and free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals o h with strong oxidizing property li et al 2022 although the washed membrane performance after 6 runs of consecutive fouling and cleaning was almost unchanged long term frequent cleaning with such amounts of o h might still pose a potential damage to the organic polymer membranes such as polyethersulfone pes membrane gan et al 2021 therefore in practice the cleaning time and h2o2 concentration should be strictly controlled in case of the changes in the physicochemical properties of membranes and decline in the foulants removal efficiency as a result there is still an urgent need for a more moderate and durable cleaning method at the same time during long term storage and transportation aqueous solution of h2o2 gradually decomposes and the decomposition rate is increased by light irradiation agitation and heating ling et al 2021 in addition h2o2 solution is incompatible with reducing agents including organic matter and oxidizable substances kim et al 2021 due to the self decomposition part of the h2o2 solution dispersed in cleaning module can not be utilized for membrane cleaning which further reduces the utilization efficiency of it such instability of h2o2 aqueous solutions is a real safety threat for storage and transportation and increases the cost of membrane cleaning li et al 2020b to address these drawbacks sodium percarbonate spc which can gradually release h2o2 when being dissolved in water is always used as a solid replacement for h2o2 gao et al 2020 sodium percarbonate is considered as a versatile oxidant over a wide ph range with the characteristics of non toxicity excellent storage stability and environmental friendliness gao et al 2020 li et al 2019 effervescence can be defined as the release of dissolved bubbles from an aqueous solution accompanied by bubbling foaming and fizzing the bubbles can be introduced by chemical reactions such as the reactions of metal carbonates with acid to produce carbon dioxide bubbles elpa et al 2020 and most precursors used for effervescence are in the tablet form which is portable to reserve and carry medinskaia et al 2016 inspired by these we rationally designed a type of spc mno2 system via the simple pressing technique for membrane cleaning by simply changing the mass ratio of sodium percarbonate to mno2 the efficient and durable membrane cleaning performance was simultaneously achieved moreover the moderate and effective cleaning performance was attributed to both the generated abundant oxygen bubbles and the efficient conversion of o h to c o 3 2 which plays an important role in the degradation and transformation of humic acid ha containing electron rich moieties wojnárovits et al 2020 more importantly the spc mno2 system could be carried in a portable way and put into the membrane module when it is needed for in situ membrane cleaning demonstrating the

electron spin resonance esr elexsys ii e560 bruker signals were measured using 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline dmpo as trapping agents to identify the generated reactive species see text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets the utilized sodium percarbonate and mno2 particles were firstly characterized by sem as shown in fig 2 the particle sizes of sodium percarbonate and mno2 were in the range of 30 35 μm and 20 25 μm respectively it could be seen that the size of particles was relatively uniform in the sample and the boundary was also clear after tablets pressing the novel sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets were characterized based on physical diameter thickness and weight and chemical disintegration time and solution ph after disintegration subsequently properties as well as energy dispersive spectroscopy eds elemental mapping to show the distribution of each element in the sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablet see fig s3 the key characteristics of sodium percarbonate mno2 effervescent tablets were listed in table 1 after disintegration the solution was transparent with no white sodium percarbonate particle being observed only small amounts of mno2 particles were precipitated in the bottom of beaker and some bubbles were stuck to their surface which could be observed by the video and images in the supporting information 3 2 evaluation of membrane cleaning performance the optimal mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio was determined by comparing the membrane flux recovery efficiency j j0 the tested mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio were 0 2 0 25 0 5 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 3 after being fouled by ha the permeate flux decreased to 0 48 of the clean membrane after being rinsed with mq water and washed by spc mno2 system with different mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratios j j0 was recovered from 0 48 to 0 67 0 75 and 0 96 when the mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio was 0 2 0 25 0 5 respectively further enhancement of mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio showed no promotion on the membrane cleaning performance therefore 0 5 was chosen as the optimal mno2 sodium percarbonate mass ratio for the washing process with the sodium percarbonate dosage being about 70 75 mg and mno2 dosage being about 30 35 mg to investigate the feasibility of the spc mno2 system on membrane cleaning herein the performance of spc mno2 system for membrane cleaning were evaluated in comparison of h2o2 mno2 system by membrane flux recovery rate j w j 0 and removal efficiency of irreversible fouling resistance 1 r i r r w a s h e d r i r r f o u l e d as shown in fig 4 a the membrane flux was recovered slightly by only mq water rinsing after membrane cleaning by spc mno2 system for 5 mins without extra stirring the final flux was recovered from 0 4 j f j 0 to 0 95 j w j 0 which demonstrated effective membrane cleaning performance comparable with h2o2 mno2 system while for the cases of sodium percarbonate or h2o2 alone no obvious membrane flux recovery was observed in addition as shown in fig 4b above 0 94 of irreversible membrane foulants could be removed effectively by spc mno2 system which was also comparable with h2o2 mno2 system by mno2 catalysis the h2o2 generated from sodium percarbonate could be degraded to release free radicals with oxidation capacity which might exert influence on the membrane filtration performance jiang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 for the case of h2o2 mno2 system the membrane performance was not changed prominently after consecutive fouling and cleaning which was possibly attributed to the short duration of the cleaning process he et al 2019 for spc mno2 system consecutive fouling and washing of one membrane were also conducted the key to evaluate the membrane performance was filtration efficiency of foulants it has been reported that an increase of membrane permeability and a decrease of filtration efficiency were generally related to increased pore size robinson et al 2016 as seen in fig 5 a the filtration efficiency of ha by clean pes membrane was about 0 84 and the filtration efficiency of ha by the same membrane used for the 6 consecutive membrane washing test was 0 839 0 852 0 840 0 852 0 854 and 0 845 respectively which exhibited similar filtration efficiency of ha to the clean one the results implied that the spc mno2 cleaning process did not alter the filtration ability of membrane as a comparison the pes membranes aged with naclo resulted in a substantial decrease in filtration efficiency of ha li et al 2021a according to the previous research under attacks by active oxidants the hydrophobic pes might undergo a chain scission of the backbone structure into sulfonic acid groups and phenyl chloride groups the sulfonic acid groups and phenyl chloride groups rendered the increased hydrophilicity of the pes membranes susanto and ulbricht 2009 as shown in fig 5b with the increase of fouling and washing circulations water contact angles of the same membrane kept stable between the values of 63 and 65 without apparent fluctuation which was comparable with that of clean membrane 64 and far less than that of fouled membrane 72 indicating the feasibility of the spc mno2 system the results showed that the normalized flux j w j 0 filtration efficiency of ha and contact angle could always be maintained almost consistent even after 6 times of consecutive membrane fouling and washing with spc mno2 system demonstrating that the spc mno2 system was an effective and durable method to remove irreversible membrane foulants 3 3 characterization of membrane surface change 3 3 1 comparison of membrane surface morphology sem images were taken to reveal the surface morphology of the membrane washed by spc mno2 system it could be seen that by only mq water rinsing the surface of fouled membranes was still covered with irreversible foulants in the form of a dense gel layer on membrane surface however after being washed by spc mno2 system it could be observed clearly that the membrane surface was recovered with almost no irreversible foulants being remained fig 6 c which demonstrated the spc mno2 system was an effective membrane washing method 3 3 2 three dimensional afm analysis the topography of clean fouled and washed membranes was determined by afm images and the average roughness ra root mean square roughness rq and maximum roughness rmax were utilized to quantitatively assess the changes of surface roughness among them ra reflects the average distance deviation of sample surface from the basic plane rq is the root mean square distance deviation of the sample surface from the basic plane and rmax indicates the difference between the largest positive and negative deviation in fig 7 the clean membrane showed obvious peaks and valleys distributed on membrane surface with rq ra of 4 59 0 85 3 6 0 71 nm fig 7 a in comparison after filtering the feed of ha deposits of foulants on the membrane surface was observed resulting in a much higher roughness of 163 12 1 132 10 4 nm fig 7 b when the fouled membrane was washed by the spc mno2 system peaks and valleys reappeared on the membrane surface fig 7 c meanwhile the roughness was recovered to 4 97 0 76 3 71 0 55 nm close to that of the clean membrane implying that the spc mno2 system could effectively remove the fouling layer without causing damage to the membrane surface 3 4 mechanisms for membrane cleaning by spc mno2 system 3 4 1 ftir comparison of treated ha by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems it has been reported that the free radicals could cause a characteristic variation in the functional groups of ha mohsin et al 2021 the spc mno2 system demonstrated outstanding and durable membrane cleaning performance which was comparable with h2o2 mno2 system while the different free radicals generated in the two systems might have different effects on the functional groups of ha to assess the oxidation capacity of spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems comparative investigation for the structural changes of ha by different membrane cleaning methods was conducted by ftir spectra as shown in fig 8 on the one hand for ha treated by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems the characteristic peaks of typical hydrophobic groups were apparently decreased and even disappeared after being treated by both washing methods such as the band at 2920 cm 1 attributing to ch3 and ch2 groups a cuspate peak at about 1406 cm 1 ascribing to c h deformation of ch2 and ch3 groups a shoulder at around 1013 1089 cm 1 corresponding to c o stretching of aryl ethers and phenols and the peak between 700 and 850 cm 1 representing c h out of plane deformation rodríguez et al 2016 wang et al 2016 while the intensities of hydrophilic indicators were enhanced or remained such as the broad band centered at about 3380 cm 1 attributing to the associated oh stretching vibrations alcohols phenols and carboxylic acids and the band at 1630 1720 cm 1 representing the structural vibrations of asymmetric stretch of coo groups yu et al 2005 the results indicated that ha became more hydrophilic by the reactions with spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems leading to the easier separation of them from the hydrophobic membrane surface on the other hand it could be observed the intensities of hydrophobic functional groups in ha was reduced more prominently by h2o2 mno2 system than that by spc mno2 system suggesting that h2o2 mno2 system had stronger oxidation capacity it should be notice that after the removal of irreversible foulants the oxidation system might further cause potential damage to the hydrophobic pes membrane during the washing process which could inhibit the membrane filtration performance in the long term operation therefore the results suggested that the spc mno2 system might be a more moderate washing strategy in comparison with the h2o2 mno2 system 3 4 2 3d eem comparison of ha treated by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems three dimensional fluorescence spectra is widely used to describe the physicochemical properties of ha qualitatively and quantitatively jacquin et al 2017 there are several different fluorescence groups in ha and the fluorescence characteristics of ha contain information related to structure functional group configuration heterogeneity intramolecular and intermolecular dynamics guo et al 2020 consistent with the ftir results eem spectroscopy displayed different attenuation levels of fluorescence intensity by spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems respectively the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of ha were characterized with two main peaks marked as α and β the α peak was located at the ex em wavelengths of about 270 440 nm nm which could be ascribed to the simple organic structures of low molecular weight with low condensation degree of aromatic structures high fluorescence intensity in this area could be related to the electron donating composition such as hydroxyl groups in ha for β peak which was located at the ex em wavelengths of about 370 460 nm nm it could be attributed to ha of high molecular mass with unsaturated bonds representing aromatic ring networks quinones and phenols boguta et al 2019 rodríguez et al 2014 for original ha fig 9 a relative intensities of the two fluorophores areas were the highest among all samples after treated by h2o2 mno2 system for 5 mins the intensity of two fluorophores areas were both greatly decreased fig 9 d due to the oxidation by h2o2 mno2 system in comparison after treated by spc mno2 system for 5mins fig 9 b the fluorophores area α was less affected while the fluorophores area β was decreased indicating that only the high molecular weight ha with aromatic structure was progressively degraded by the spc mno2 system to further assess the oxidation capacity of free radicals in the two systems on ha the washing time was extended to 30 mins as shown in fig 9 c and 9 e the intensity of two fluorophores areas were almost totally disappeared in h2o2 mno2 system whereas they were still remained by the treatment of spc mno2 system the results suggested free radicals generated in h2o2 mno2 system had relatively stronger oxidation capacity but weaker oxidation selectivity while a better oxidation selectivity was exhibited for the free radicals generated in spc mno2 system in conclusion the 3d eem results were highly in accordance with ftir analysis which further confirmed that spc mno2 system was a moderate and durable membrane cleaning method 3 4 3 esr detection and scavenging tests of free radicals as revealed by the mentioned multiple techniques production of abundant free radicals might prominently alter the chemical composition of ha facilitating the ha separation from membrane surface through membrane washing process for h2o2 mno2 system besides the hydraulic turbulence caused by oxygen bubbles the membrane cleaning was achieved mainly by o h oxidation he et al 2019 for spc mno2 system effective cleaning performance and moderate washing property has been observed where possible reactive species o h may be converted to c o 3 because of the carbonate ions generated from sodium percarbonate gao et al 2020 to verify the generation of reactive species esr tests with dmpo as trapping agent were conducted to detect the generated free radicals qualitatively as shown in fig 10 a the characteristic peaks of dmpo o h and dmpo c o 3 2 were observed simultaneously demonstrating that both o h and c o 3 2 were existed in the spc mno2 system li et al 2021b the spectra in fig 10 b also illustrated the intensity of dmpo oh with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 confirming the presence of o h in h2o2 mno2 system chang et al 2022 it was noteworthy that the intensity of dmpo o h signals in spc mno2 system was weaker than that in h2o2 mno2 system fig 10 b which was attributed to the interaction between o h and c o 3 2 h c o 3 leading to the transformation of o h to c o 3 2 furthermore quenching experiments with tertiary butanol tba and phenol phoh as scavengers fig 10 c and d were also conducted the reaction activity between c o 3 2 and tba was much lower than that between o h and tba k o h t b a 3 8 7 6 10 8 m 1 s 1 k co 3 t b a 1 6 10 2 m 1 s 1 so the quenching efficiency of tba on c o 3 2 could be ignored compared with that on o h li et al 2021b liu et al 2018 therefore tba was involved to assess the contributions of o h in spc mno2 and h2o2 mno2 systems respectively as presented in fig 10 d without tba the membrane flux could be restored from 0 45 j f j 0 to 0 96 j w j 0 by h2o2 mno2 system however when 10 mm tba was added j w j 0 was only recovered to 0 59 manifesting that o h did play a dominant role in the h2o2 mno2 cleaning process via the fenton like reactions in contrast even in the presence of tba the flux of the membrane could still be restored greatly from 0 39 j f j 0 to 0 82 j w j 0 by spc mno2 system indicating that there were still other dominant reactive species generated in this system to further verify the results 10 mm phoh as the scavenger of both o h k o h p h o h 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 and c o 3 k c o 3 p h o h 2 2 10 7 m 1 s 1 were added into the spc mno2 system li et al 2021b as observed in fig 10 c j w j 0 was only recovered to 0 51 the discrepancy of recovery efficiencies between conditions of tba and phoh verified that c o 3 2 did contribute to the removal of irreversible foulants in the spc mno2 system which was consistent with the esr tests 3 4 4 proposed reaction mechanism in spc mno2 system according to the results of esr tests and quenching experiments the possible reaction pathways through spc mno2 system were displayed as eqs 1 7 gao et al 2020 jildeh et al 2018 and fig 11 as described by eqs 1 and 2 the c o 3 2 was generated along with h2o2 when sodium percarbonate was gradually dissolved in water subsequently some of the c o 3 2 was hydrolyzed to h c o 3 see eq 3 meanwhile the released h2o2 was decomposed to generate o 2 and o h by m n 4 catalysis see eq 4 6 it was reported that the presence of c o 3 2 and h c o 3 could exert great influence on c o 3 2 and o h which played an important role in the transformation of o h to c o 3 2 see eq 7 8 and the transform rate constant of reaction 7 and 8 could reach to the high values of 3 0 108 m 1s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1s 1 respectively cui et al 2017 c o 3 2 displayed the weaker oxidative capability e c o 3 c o 3 2 1 57 ev than o h e o h o h 2 76 ev which reduced the overall oxidation capacity of the system on organic membranes liu et al 2021 1 2 n a 2 c o 3 3 h 2 o 2 2 n a 2 c o 3 3 h 2 o 2 2 n a 2 c o 3 2 n a c o 3 2 3 c o 3 2 h 2 o h c o 3 o h 4 m n 4 h 2 o 2 h m n 3 h

for the first time to achieve the effective cleaning of pes membranes fouled by ha especially more than 95 permeate flux was recovered and almost total irreversible foulants were removed by this system results of ftir and eem spectra implied that the spc mno2 system was a more moderate and durable membrane cleaning method compared to h2o2 mno2 system based on the esr tests and quenching experiments the generated o h was transformed to c o 3 2 in the presence of c o 3 2 h c o 3 ions and c o 3 2 played a significant role in the spc mno2 system to achieve the moderate membrane cleaning moreover as a solid carrier of liquid h2o2 the novel spc mno2 system with superior stability longer storage time and anti explosion property is easier to be transported which is a cost effective approach for membrane cleaning in conclusion compared with the conventional membrane cleaning methods spc mno2 system with the high mass transfer rate of reactive components demonstrates remarkable advantages of high membrane cleaning efficiency and robust durability further tests are suggested to employ this system for the practical water treatment process and investigate whether the high membrane cleaning efficiency could also be achieved for other types of membrane module such as ceramic membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15868,the operating parameters necessary to improve the desorption rate of a membrane capacitive deionization mcdi system while controlling the faradaic reactions were studied the total charge q t accumulated in the carbon electrode was set as the main operating parameter determining the desorption rate of the mcdi system after adsorption was performed until the preset q t value was reached using the mcdi unit cell desorption was performed at a cell potential of 0 2 v as a result of this mcdi operation the average desorption rate increased in proportion to the q t value additionally the ratio of desorption charge according to the desorption time was consistent regardless of q t through this it could be seen that the desorption process of the mcdi system is similar to the discharge characteristic of a series circuit comprising a resistor r and a capacitor c if the desorption time is too short during the mcdi operation some charges will remain in the carbon electrode when the adsorption charge q a d is supplied again q t increases when q t exceeds the maximum allowable charge mac which is the total charge at the onset of faradaic reactions electrode reactions can occur through rc circuit analysis a model equation for calculating the minimum desorption time required to operate a mcdi system without the occurrence of faradaic reactions was derived as a result of mcdi operation while changing the desorption time the desalination performance almost matched the result predicted through the model equation additionally it was found that the smaller q a d is the shorter the desorption time resulting in a higher desalination rate of the mcdi system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane capacitive deionization maximum allowable charge faradaic reactions minimum desorption time desorption rate 1 introduction the importance of seawater desalination technology is growing as this technology can be used as a method for solving the serious water shortage problem in particular reverse osmosis ro plays a key role in the seawater desalination process and many ro plants have been constructed worldwide elimelech and phillip 2011 lee et al 2011 these ro processes apply a two pass ro system to meet the drinking water quality tds 500 mg l regulated by the world health organization who farhat et al 2013 however the two pass ro system increases the energy consumption because the permeate of the first ro unit is processed back to the second ro unit dorji et al 2018 choi et al 2019 to compensate for this capacitive deionization cdi was considered as an alternative technology for the second ro unit in fact choi et al 2019 reported that a rocdi hybrid system could reduce the energy consumption compared to the two pass ro system as the applicability of cdi systems has been confirmed in the seawater desalination process interest in cdi technology is gradually increasing cdi removes ions through electrostatic attraction between the electrode and the ions by applying an electric potential to the carbon electrode anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 the amount of adsorbed ions is proportional to the total charge accumulated in the electrode therefore the capacitance of the carbon electrode is the most important element determining the desalination performance of cdi systems ahmed and tewari 2018 since the 2000s carbon electrodes with high capacitance have been developed using carbon materials such as activated carbon carbon nanotubes carbon fiber and graphene huang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 singh et al 2019 ntakirutimana et al 2020 in addition various cell structures were introduced to improve the desalination performance suss et al 2015 a membrane cdi mcdi that combines an ion exchange membrane iem and a carbon electrode could dramatically improve the charge efficiency of a conventional cdi cell composed of only carbon electrodes lee et al 2006 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 in addition novel cell configurations such as flow electrode cdi jeon et al 2013 inverted cdi gao et al 2015 and hybrid cdi cell configurations lee et al 2014 have been developed which overcame the shortcomings of the conventional cdi cell structure the desalination performance of cdi systems can be significantly different depending on the operating conditions to increase the salt adsorption capacity sac and desalination rate it is desirable to operate cdi systems at as high a cell potential as possible when the cell potential increases however faradaic reactions such as the oxidation of carbon oxidation and reduction of water and reduction of dissolved oxygen can occur at the carbon electrode cohen et al 2013 omosebi et al 2014 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 shapira et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the carbon oxidation reaction shortens the lifespan of the carbon electrode and greatly reduces the adsorption capacity moreover the treated water can be contaminated by the products of faradaic reactions additionally these electrode reactions cause a decrease in charge efficiency and an increase in energy consumption zhang et al 2018 as such since faradaic reactions in cdi systems cause serious problems it is very important to maintain stability against these electrode reactions in most studies thus far the cell potential has been used as the operating variable that determines the sac and adsorption rate of a cdi system however the faradaic reactions in the carbon electrode are governed by the electrode potential not by the cell potential bard and faulkner 2001 choi and yoon 2019a depending on the electrical resistance of the cdi cell and the current supplied the cell potential at which the faradaic reactions occur may vary therefore there is a limit to controlling faradaic reactions by the cell potential to solve this problem choi and yoon 2019a proposed a novel operation method using the concept of maximum allowable charge mac they defined the mac as the total charge stored in the carbon electrode at the start of the electrode reactions they confirmed that faradaic reactions in an mcdi cell did not occur regardless of the cell potential when the charge supplied to the carbon electrode was below the mac value through operation methods based on the mac concept the adsorption rate of mcdi systems could be improved dramatically while completely controlling faradaic reactions even at a cell potential of 2 0 v cdi is performed by repeating adsorption and desorption processes in general the desalination rate of a cdi system is expressed as the average salt adsorption rate asar which is obtained by dividing the sac by the sum of the adsorption time at and the desorption time dt suss et al 2015 since adsorption and desorption are repeated in a single flow channel it is essential to decrease the at and dt to increase the asar as described above the at can be shortened by applying the mac concept on the other hand in the desorption process a sufficient dt is required to desorb all the adsorbed ions if the dt is too short some ions remain in the carbon electrode which directly affects the subsequent adsorption process therefore it is very important to quickly and completely desorb the adsorbed ions during the desorption process as such the desorption process is essential to improve the desalination performance of cdi systems however there are still very few studies on this desorption process the cdi cell can be interpreted as an rc circuit in which a resistor r and a capacitor c are connected in series yoon and choi 2019 qu et al 2016 in the rc series circuit the discharge rate discharge current is proportional to the total charge accumulated in the capacitor plonus 2020 also the discharge rate decreases exponentially with time from rc circuit analysis it can be expected that the greater the total charge q t accumulated in the carbon electrode the faster the desorption rate of the cdi cell it can be inferred that q t is the main operating parameter that determines the desorption rate of a cdi system therefore it is considered that the optimal dt can be determined by analyzing the desorption rate according to the q t in a cdi system this study was conducted to improve the desorption rate of an mcdi system while maintaining stability against the faradaic reactions desalination experiments were carried out using an mcdi unit cell the mac value of the carbon electrode used in the mcdi cell was measured to analyze the desorption rate according to q t the adsorption process was performed until the charge supplied to the carbon electrode reached a preset q t value and then desorption was performed at a constant cell potential mcdi experiments were carried out at different dts to analyze the desalination performance with respect to dt in addition a model equation for determining the minimum dt required to operate the mcdi system without the occurrence of faradaic reactions was derived from rc circuit analysis the desalination performances of the mcdi experiments were compared with the result estimated from the model equation 2 experimental 2 1 construction of the mcdi unit cell and desalination experimental setup an mcdi unit cell was fabricated using a carbon electrode purichem co korea thickness 200 μm and ion exchange membranes iems the carbon electrode cation exchange membrane neosepta cmx astom co japan and anion exchange membrane neosepta amx were cut to a diameter of 10 5 cm using a circular specimen cutter then a hole with a diameter of 1 4 cm was drilled in the centers of the carbon electrode and the iems so that the effluent could exit the effective area and mass of one carbon electrode were approximately 85 cm2 and 1 22 g respectively the mcdi cell was constructed by combining the amx and cmx membranes to the surfaces of the anodic and cathodic carbon electrodes respectively and inserting a spacer 180 μm ex31 071 80 pw nbc meshtec inc japan between the iems influent 1000 mg l nacl was supplied to the mcdi cell at a flow rate of 40 ml min by a peristaltic pump the influent was introduced from the edge of the circular carbon electrode where it then passed through the spacer and flowed out through the hole in the center the mcdi experiments were performed in a single pass mode in which the effluent that passed through the cell was discarded the power was supplied using a potentiostat wpg100 wona tech co korea and the current voltage and cumulative charge supplied to the cell were measured at 2 s intervals an electrical conductivity sensor con bta and ph sensor ph bta vernier software technology usa were installed at the point where the effluent discharged from the cell the conductivity and ph were measured in real time at 2 s intervals through an interface labquest vernier software technology usa connected to a computer the nacl concentration of the effluent was calculated using the correlation between the nacl concentration and the conductivity 2 2 measurement of the mac value of the carbon electrode during the operation of the mcdi cell the adsorption and desorption processes are repeated to discharge all the charges accumulated in the carbon electrode desorption should proceed for a sufficient time at a desorption potential below the pzc potential of zero charge if the discharge is not completed in the desorption process residual charge q r e exists in the carbon electrode in this state if the adsorption charge charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process q a d is supplied again the q t q r e q a d of the carbon electrode increases the mac value is measured by dividing the total charge accumulated in the carbon electrode by the mass of the carbon electrode when the faradaic reactions start yoon and choi 2019 to measure accurate mac values the mcdi cell must reach a dynamic steady state dss additionally there should be no charge remaining in the carbon electrode when adsorption starts through a preliminary experiment it was confirmed that all charges accumulated in the carbon electrode were completely discharged when desorption was performed for 360 s at a desorption potential of 0 2 v the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times to allow the mcdi cell to reach a dss adsorption proceeded at a constant current density 2 35 ma cm2 until the cell potential reached 1 0 v and then desorption proceeded at a cell potential of 0 2 v for 360 s after the final 10th cycle an adsorption experiment was performed to measure the mac value at the same current density 2 35 ma cm2 adsorption was continued until the cell potential reached 1 6 v then the desorption process was performed again for 360 s at a cell potential of 0 2 v the current cell potential and cumulative charge supplied to the cell were measured during this adsorption and desorption cycle the conductivity and ph of the effluent were measured to observe the electrode reactions this method of mac measurement has been described in detail in previous studies choi and yoon 2019b son and choi 2022 2 3 conditions for mcdi desalination experiments to analyze the effect of the total charge accumulated on the carbon electrode on the desorption rate mcdi experiments were conducted while changing the q t value from 19 7 to 44 3 c g the mac value measured in the previous experiment was determined to be 45 3 c g therefore the q t values were set to be below this mac value to prevent the faradaic reactions from occurring the adsorption process was performed at a current density of 2 35 ma cm2 until a preset q t was supplied and then desorption was performed at 0 2 v for 360 s the adsorption desorption cycle was successively repeated 10 times so that the carbon electrode reached a dss under the given conditions if the dt is too short during the mcdi operation all adsorbed ions cannot be desorbed which may affect the subsequent adsorption process to evaluate the effects of incomplete desorption on the performance of the mcdi cell mcdi experiments were carried out while changing the dts after supplying 39 3 c g of q a d during the adsorption process desorption was performed while changing the dt from 100 to 360 s adsorption was performed at a current density of 2 35 ma cm2 and desorption was carried out at a cell potential of 0 2 v for each dt the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times to observe the change in the desalination performance sac charge efficiency according to the cycle the sac and charge efficiency were calculated using the equations described in other papers suss et al 2015 liu et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 mac value as a criterion for controlling faradaic reactions to measure the mac value of the carbon electrode used in the mcdi cell adsorption was performed while supplying a constant current until the cell potential reached 1 6 v fig 1 shows the nacl concentration and ph change of the effluent according to the cumulative charge supplied to the cell as a result of supplying a constant current to the cell the effluent concentration was kept constant at 825 mg l by analyzing the nacl concentrations of the feed and effluent solution 1000 and 825 mg l respectively flow rate 40 ml min and current density 2 35 ma cm2 it was found that the charge efficiency was 96 2 this means that ions were adsorbed in proportion to the current supplied to the cell however as the cumulative charge supplied reached approximately 45 3 c g the concentration of the effluent gradually increased at the same charge the ph started to decrease as described in detail in other papers the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent were attributed to the faradaic reactions at the carbon electrode choi 2014 tang et al 2017 choi and yoon 2019b from this it can be inferred that when a charge of 45 3 c g accumulates in the carbon electrode the faradaic reactions start and it can be seen that the mac value of the carbon electrode is 45 3 c g the mac value of a carbon electrode is a useful indicator that can be used to increase the adsorption rate without the occurrence of faradaic reactions during the operation of an mcdi system if the charge accumulated in the carbon electrode during the adsorption process is controlled to be below the mac value the electrode reaction does not occur regardless of the cell potential or current density therefore the adsorption rate can be increased by operating the mcdi cell at a high cell potential or current density choi and yoon 2019a as such the mac value can be used as an important criterion to improve the adsorption rate of an mcdi system while maintaining stability against the faradaic reactions 3 2 analysis of desorption rate according to the total charge the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times while changing the q t from 19 7 to 44 3 c g fig 2 shows the change in the concentration of the effluent in the last 10th adsorption desorption cycle as a constant current density was supplied during the adsorption process the effluent concentration was constant the adsorption time increased from 120 to 270 s in proportion to the q t value the amount of adsorbed ions was proportional to the q t value as a result it can be seen that the concentration of the effluent in the desorption process increases in proportion to q t in addition when the desorption process was complete the effluent and the influent had almost the same concentration indicating that all of the adsorbed ions have been desorbed the inset in fig 2 shows the sac values calculated from the effluent concentration as q t increased from 19 7 to 44 3 c g the sac value increased linearly from 5 8 to 13 1 mg g fig 3 shows the changes in cell potential measured during the adsorption process the cell potential was approximately 0 30 v immediately after the current was applied from this it can be seen that the electrical resistance of the mcdi cell was approximately 1 5 ω when the concentration of nacl in the flow channel was 1000 mg l as adsorption started the nacl concentration in the flow channel decreased due to the adsorption of ions as a result the cell potential rapidly increased owing to the increase in the electrical resistance of the solution at the initial adsorption process then as the concentration in the flow channel became constant the cell potential increased linearly in proportion to the charge supplied additionally the cell potential according to the cumulative charge showed overlapping results at all q t values this means that the carbon electrode was completely regenerated during the desorption process the inset in fig 3 shows the final cell potential when the preset q t was supplied as q t increased the final cell potential also increased almost linearly in particular the cell potential reached 1 42 v at a q t of 44 3 c g as a result of measuring the ph of the effluent it was observed that the ph was maintained in a stable state from this it can be seen that the electrode reactions did not occur even at the cell potential of 1 42 v the cell potential is the sum of the electrode potential and the i r drop caused by the electrical resistance r and current i the cell potential was 1 42 v but the voltage drop due to the i r was expected to be at least 0 3 v when the concentration of the flow channel is 1000 mg l or more therefore it is considered that the electrode potential was maintained at 1 1 v or less after adsorption was performed until the preset q t was reached desorption proceeded for 360 s at a cell potential of 0 2 v fig 4 shows the change in the current density solid line over time during the desorption process a high current density was supplied at the beginning of the desorption process and it showed a tendency to decrease exponentially with time the current density at a dt of 150 s decreased to 2 3 of the initial current density it can be seen that the higher q t is the higher the current density the current density supplied to the mcdi cell indicates the transport rate of ions therefore it was confirmed that the more charge accumulated on the carbon electrode during the adsorption process the higher the average desorption rate meanwhile the total desorption charge q d e supplied to the cell during the desorption process was measured and determined to be almost the same as q t this means that desorption proceeded completely without charge remaining on the carbon electrode the percentage of q d e was calculated by dividing the cumulative q d e at a certain dt by the total q d e value the percentage of q d e according to the dt is shown in fig 4 dotted lines as q t increased the current density increased during the desorption process however the percentage of q d e according to the dt was consistent regardless of the q t value it can be seen that 84 6 and 92 5 of the q t are discharged at dt values of 100 and 150 s respectively when adsorption and desorption ideally progress at the carbon electrode the mcdi cell can be interpreted as a circuit in which a resistor and a capacitor are connected in series in this case the change in current i d e according to time t in the desorption process is expressed by the following equation plonus 2020 1 i d e t q t r c exp t r c q t τ exp t τ where q t is the total charge accumulated in the carbon electrode c g r is the electrical resistance of the mcdi cell ω c is the capacitance of the carbon electrode f g and τ is the time constant from eq 1 assuming that the resistance and capacitance of the mcdi cell are constant it can be seen that the desorption current is proportional to q t this coincides with the result shown in fig 4 in which the desorption current increases as q t increases on the other hand the desorption charge q d e t over time in the desorption process can be calculated by integrating eq 1 and eq 3 obtained by dividing eq 2 by q t represents the ratio of q d e λ t over time 2 q d e t q t 1 exp t τ 3 λ t q d e t q t 1 exp t τ eq 3 indicates that λ t is not affected by q t when τ is constant which supports the result of fig 4 from the above results it can be seen that the operation of the mcdi system at a high q t value is effective in increasing the desorption rate 3 3 estimation of the minimum desorption time for stability against the faradaic reactions when the desorption potential was applied the current decreased exponentially with time sufficient time is required to discharge all the charges accumulated in the carbon electrode as the dt becomes shorter residual charges remain in the carbon electrode fig 5 shows the schematic diagram for changing q t according to the dt when dt is maintained long enough a all the q t is discharged and no charge remains in the carbon electrode q r e 0 so q t q a d as the dt becomes shorter q r e increases when q a d is supplied to the carbon electrode in the presence of q r e q t increases if q t q r e q a d exceeds the mac value fig 5c faradaic reactions may occur in the carbon electrode therefore to operate the mcdi system without the occurrence of electrode reactions it is important to control the dt and q a d so that the q t does not exceed the mac value when the mcdi cell reaches a dss q a d and q d e are the same in this case eq 2 can be expressed as eq 4 below 4 q t t q a d 1 exp t τ q a d λ t eq 4 represents the q t value required to desorb all the q a d in time t if the dt is long enough λ 1 and q r e 0 therefore the q t value is the same as q a d as the dt is shortened λ decreases and q t increases rapidly by substituting the λ value obtained from fig 4 into eq 4 q t was calculated and is shown in fig 6 as a function of dt q t rapidly increases as dt becomes shorter when q t exceeds the mac value 45 3 c g of the carbon electrode it can be expected that faradaic reactions occur therefore the minimum dt d t m i n for operating the mcdi cell without the occurrence of faradaic reactions is the time that q t reaches the mac value for example when operating the mcdi cell at q a d 39 3 c g the dt must be at least 112 s to prevent the electrode reactions from occurring the d t m i n for each q a d were obtained from fig 6 and are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that d t m i n increased rapidly as q a d increased when q a d was 39 3 c g or less d t m i n increased linearly from 23 to 112 s as q a d increased however as the q a d 44 3 c g approached the mac value d t m i n significantly increased to 252 s the maximum average discharge rate was calculated by dividing the q a d value by d t m i n and is shown in fig 7 as q a d increased the maximum average discharge rate decreased due to an increase in d t m i n the discharge rate represents the desorption rate of ions in the mcdi cell the faster the desorption rate is the higher the asar of the mcdi cell when the mcdi system is operated at a low q a d value d t m i n is shortened and the desorption rate can be increased in this case however it may be difficult to operate the mcdi system because the switching time between the adsorption and desorption processes is shortened 3 4 verification of stability according to the desorption time to verify the stability against the faradaic reactions according to the dt predicted in the previous section mcdi desalination experiments were conducted while changing the dts the adsorption process was performed until the q a d 39 3 c g was supplied at a current density of 2 35 ma cm2 and desorption was performed while changing the dt from 100 to 360 s at a cell potential of 0 2 v the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times at each given dt fig 8 shows the change in the nacl concentration of the effluent in the final 10th adsorption desorption cycle during the adsorption process the concentration of the effluent was kept constant so it can be seen that the change in dt did not affect the adsorption process however although the same q a d was supplied during the adsorption process the maximum concentration of the effluent during the desorption process increased from 1830 to 1960 mg l as dt became shorter this means that the desorption rate increased as dt became shorter additionally as seen in the inset which shows the concentration of the effluent at the end of the desorption process the final concentration gradually increased as the dt became shorter when the final concentration is higher than the influent concentration 1000 mg l this indicates that the desorption did not proceed completely while the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times the q a d and the q d e values were measured in each cycle and q r e was calculated from the difference q a d q d e fig 9 shows the cumulative q r e according to the number of cycles as expected q r e increased significantly as the dt decreased when dt 360 s q r e was almost zero which indicates that all q a d was discharged however the q r e was 8 03 c g at dt 100 s and when q a d 39 3 c g was supplied again q t reached 47 3 c g which exceeds the mac value therefore it can be expected that faradaic reactions may occur when the mcdi cell is operated at dt 100 s on the other hand q r e was 5 5 c g at dt 120 s in this case q t can reach 44 9 c g at the end of the adsorption process which is close to the mac value 45 3 c g the presence of faradaic reactions during the mcdi operation was examined by measuring the ph of the effluent fig 10 a shows the ph of the effluent during the 10 adsorption desorption cycles at dt 100 120 and 150 s additionally the ph of the effluent during the last cycle is shown in fig 10 b when the dt was 150 s or more it was found that the ph of the effluent was maintained in a stable state so that the electrode reactions did not occur however when the dt was less than 120 s the effluent ph gradually decreased as the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated from the ph change it was found that the electrode reactions occurred at dt 120 s or less from fig 6 it was predicted that the electrode reactions would not occur when the dt was longer than 112 s at q a d 39 3 c g additionally from q r e in fig 9 q t was calculated to be 44 9 c g at dt 120 s which is lower than the mac value therefore it was predicted that the faradaic reactions would not occur at dt 120 s in contrast to these predictions however the electrode reactions were observed at dt 120 s the cause for this is considered to be the limitation of the mac measurement in the measurement of mac it is important to accurately determine the point where the electrode reactions start as seen in fig 1 however it is not easy to determine the exact position from the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent it is thought that the difference from the expected result is attributed to slight error in the mac measurement the sac and charge efficiency in each cycle were calculated from the concentration of the effluent and the average values are summarized in table 1 in addition the desorption rate was calculated by dividing the amount of desorbed nacl by the dt the faradaic reactions were observed when the dt was 100 and 120 s as a result the sac and charge efficiency showed slight decreases however when the dt was 150 s or more the electrode reactions were not observed and the sac and charge efficiency remained constant on the other hand as dt was shortened the desorption rate increased significantly from 1 91 to 6 69 mg g min considering the stability of the mcdi system it is thought that the optimal dt is 150 s the desorption rate is 4 56 mg g min in this case the asar the desalination rate of the mcdi cell becomes 1 75 mg g min since this study focused on the optimization of the dt to increase the asar adsorption experiments were conducted at a constant current density of 2 35 ma cm2 when q t does not exceed the mac value the faradaic reactions do not occur regardless of the current density supplied during the adsorption process when the current density is doubled the adsorption time is reduced by half so that the asar can increase to 2 53 mg g min 4 conclusion in this study the optimum operating conditions were obtained to improve the desalination rate of the mcdi system while maintaining stability against faradaic reactions the mcdi cell can be interpreted as an equivalent circuit in which a resistor and capacitor are connected in series from an analysis of the series rc circuit the desorption rate was expected to be proportional to the total charge accumulated in the carbon electrode to confirm this the average desorption rate was measured by operating the mcdi cell at various q t values as expected the average desorption rate of the mcdi cell was proportional to q t additionally it was confirmed that the ratio of q d e with time in the desorption process was consistent regardless of the q t value this is consistent with the discharge characteristics of an rc series circuit by applying the mac concept of the carbon electrode a model equation that can predict the minimum dt for operating an mcdi system without the occurrence of faradaic reactions was derived it was estimated that the average desorption rate can be increased when the mcdi system is operated at a low q a d value the results of the mcdi experiments while changing the dt almost matched the results predicted from the model equation these results are expected to contribute greatly to improving the long term stability and desalination

15868,the operating parameters necessary to improve the desorption rate of a membrane capacitive deionization mcdi system while controlling the faradaic reactions were studied the total charge q t accumulated in the carbon electrode was set as the main operating parameter determining the desorption rate of the mcdi system after adsorption was performed until the preset q t value was reached using the mcdi unit cell desorption was performed at a cell potential of 0 2 v as a result of this mcdi operation the average desorption rate increased in proportion to the q t value additionally the ratio of desorption charge according to the desorption time was consistent regardless of q t through this it could be seen that the desorption process of the mcdi system is similar to the discharge characteristic of a series circuit comprising a resistor r and a capacitor c if the desorption time is too short during the mcdi operation some charges will remain in the carbon electrode when the adsorption charge q a d is supplied again q t increases when q t exceeds the maximum allowable charge mac which is the total charge at the onset of faradaic reactions electrode reactions can occur through rc circuit analysis a model equation for calculating the minimum desorption time required to operate a mcdi system without the occurrence of faradaic reactions was derived as a result of mcdi operation while changing the desorption time the desalination performance almost matched the result predicted through the model equation additionally it was found that the smaller q a d is the shorter the desorption time resulting in a higher desalination rate of the mcdi system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane capacitive deionization maximum allowable charge faradaic reactions minimum desorption time desorption rate 1 introduction the importance of seawater desalination technology is growing as this technology can be used as a method for solving the serious water shortage problem in particular reverse osmosis ro plays a key role in the seawater desalination process and many ro plants have been constructed worldwide elimelech and phillip 2011 lee et al 2011 these ro processes apply a two pass ro system to meet the drinking water quality tds 500 mg l regulated by the world health organization who farhat et al 2013 however the two pass ro system increases the energy consumption because the permeate of the first ro unit is processed back to the second ro unit dorji et al 2018 choi et al 2019 to compensate for this capacitive deionization cdi was considered as an alternative technology for the second ro unit in fact choi et al 2019 reported that a rocdi hybrid system could reduce the energy consumption compared to the two pass ro system as the applicability of cdi systems has been confirmed in the seawater desalination process interest in cdi technology is gradually increasing cdi removes ions through electrostatic attraction between the electrode and the ions by applying an electric potential to the carbon electrode anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 the amount of adsorbed ions is proportional to the total charge accumulated in the electrode therefore the capacitance of the carbon electrode is the most important element determining the desalination performance of cdi systems ahmed and tewari 2018 since the 2000s carbon electrodes with high capacitance have been developed using carbon materials such as activated carbon carbon nanotubes carbon fiber and graphene huang et al 2017 lee et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 singh et al 2019 ntakirutimana et al 2020 in addition various cell structures were introduced to improve the desalination performance suss et al 2015 a membrane cdi mcdi that combines an ion exchange membrane iem and a carbon electrode could dramatically improve the charge efficiency of a conventional cdi cell composed of only carbon electrodes lee et al 2006 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 in addition novel cell configurations such as flow electrode cdi jeon et al 2013 inverted cdi gao et al 2015 and hybrid cdi cell configurations lee et al 2014 have been developed which overcame the shortcomings of the conventional cdi cell structure the desalination performance of cdi systems can be significantly different depending on the operating conditions to increase the salt adsorption capacity sac and desalination rate it is desirable to operate cdi systems at as high a cell potential as possible when the cell potential increases however faradaic reactions such as the oxidation of carbon oxidation and reduction of water and reduction of dissolved oxygen can occur at the carbon electrode cohen et al 2013 omosebi et al 2014 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 shapira et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the carbon oxidation reaction shortens the lifespan of the carbon electrode and greatly reduces the adsorption capacity moreover the treated water can be contaminated by the products of faradaic reactions additionally these electrode reactions cause a decrease in charge efficiency and an increase in energy consumption zhang et al 2018 as such since faradaic reactions in cdi systems cause serious problems it is very important to maintain stability against these electrode reactions in most studies thus far the cell potential has been used as the operating variable that determines the sac and adsorption rate of a cdi system however the faradaic reactions in the carbon electrode are governed by the electrode potential not by the cell potential bard and faulkner 2001 choi and yoon 2019a depending on the electrical resistance of the cdi cell and the current supplied the cell potential at which the faradaic reactions occur may vary therefore there is a limit to controlling faradaic reactions by the cell potential to solve this problem choi and yoon 2019a proposed a novel operation method using the concept of maximum allowable charge mac they defined the mac as the total charge stored in the carbon electrode at the start of the electrode reactions they confirmed that faradaic reactions in an mcdi cell did not occur regardless of the cell potential when the charge supplied to the carbon electrode was below the mac value through operation methods based on the mac concept the adsorption rate of mcdi systems could be improved dramatically while completely controlling faradaic reactions even at a cell potential of 2 0 v cdi is performed by repeating adsorption and desorption processes in general the desalination rate of a cdi system is expressed as the average salt adsorption rate asar which is obtained by dividing the sac by the sum of the adsorption time at and the desorption time dt suss et al 2015 since adsorption and desorption are repeated in a single flow channel it is essential to decrease the at and dt to increase the asar as described above the at can be shortened by applying the mac concept on the other hand in the desorption process a sufficient dt is required to desorb all the adsorbed ions if the dt is too short some ions remain in the carbon electrode which directly affects the subsequent adsorption process therefore it is very important to quickly and completely desorb the adsorbed ions during the desorption process as such the desorption process is essential to improve the desalination performance of cdi systems however there are still very few studies on this desorption process the cdi cell can be interpreted as an rc circuit in which a resistor r and a capacitor c are connected in series yoon and choi 2019 qu et al 2016 in the rc series circuit the discharge rate discharge current is proportional to the total charge accumulated in the capacitor plonus 2020 also the discharge rate decreases exponentially with time from rc circuit analysis it can be expected that the greater the total charge q t accumulated in the carbon electrode the faster the desorption rate of the cdi cell it can be inferred that q t is the main operating parameter that determines the desorption rate of a cdi system therefore it is considered that the optimal dt can be determined by analyzing the desorption rate according to the q t in a cdi system this study was conducted to improve the desorption rate of an mcdi system while maintaining stability against the faradaic reactions desalination experiments were carried out using an mcdi unit cell the mac value of the carbon electrode used in the mcdi cell was measured to analyze the desorption rate according to q t the adsorption process was performed until the charge supplied to the carbon electrode reached a preset q t value and then desorption was performed at a constant cell potential mcdi experiments were carried out at different dts to analyze the desalination performance with respect to dt in addition a model equation for determining the minimum dt required to operate the mcdi system without the occurrence of faradaic reactions was derived from rc circuit analysis the desalination performances of the mcdi experiments were compared with the result estimated from the model equation 2 experimental 2 1 construction of the mcdi unit cell and desalination experimental setup an mcdi unit cell was fabricated using a carbon electrode purichem co korea thickness 200 μm and ion exchange membranes iems the carbon electrode cation exchange membrane neosepta cmx astom co japan and anion exchange membrane neosepta amx were cut to a diameter of 10 5 cm using a circular specimen cutter then a hole with a diameter of 1 4 cm was drilled in the centers of the carbon electrode and the iems so that the effluent could exit the effective area and mass of one carbon electrode were approximately 85 cm2 and 1 22 g respectively the mcdi cell was constructed by combining the amx and cmx membranes to the surfaces of the anodic and cathodic carbon electrodes respectively and inserting a spacer 180 μm ex31 071 80 pw nbc meshtec inc japan between the iems influent 1000 mg l nacl was supplied to the mcdi cell at a flow rate of 40 ml min by a peristaltic pump the influent was introduced from the edge of the circular carbon electrode where it then passed through the spacer and flowed out through the hole in the center the mcdi experiments were performed in a single pass mode in which the effluent that passed through the cell was discarded the power was supplied using a potentiostat wpg100 wona tech co korea and the current voltage and cumulative charge supplied to the cell were measured at 2 s intervals an electrical conductivity sensor con bta and ph sensor ph bta vernier software technology usa were installed at the point where the effluent discharged from the cell the conductivity and ph were measured in real time at 2 s intervals through an interface labquest vernier software technology usa connected to a computer the nacl concentration of the effluent was calculated using the correlation between the nacl concentration and the conductivity 2 2 measurement of the mac value of the carbon electrode during the operation of the mcdi cell the adsorption and desorption processes are repeated to discharge all the charges accumulated in the carbon electrode desorption should proceed for a sufficient time at a desorption potential below the pzc potential of zero charge if the discharge is not completed in the desorption process residual charge q r e exists in the carbon electrode in this state if the adsorption charge charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process q a d is supplied again the q t q r e q a d of the carbon electrode increases the mac value is measured by dividing the total charge accumulated in the carbon electrode by the mass of the carbon electrode when the faradaic reactions start yoon and choi 2019 to measure accurate mac values the mcdi cell must reach a dynamic steady state dss additionally there should be no charge remaining in the carbon electrode when adsorption starts through a preliminary experiment it was confirmed that all charges accumulated in the carbon electrode were completely discharged when desorption was performed for 360 s at a desorption potential of 0 2 v the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times to allow the mcdi cell to reach a dss adsorption proceeded at a constant current density 2 35 ma cm2 until the cell potential reached 1 0 v and then desorption proceeded at a cell potential of 0 2 v for 360 s after the final 10th cycle an adsorption experiment was performed to measure the mac value at the same current density 2 35 ma cm2 adsorption was continued until the cell potential reached 1 6 v then the desorption process was performed again for 360 s at a cell potential of 0 2 v the current cell potential and cumulative charge supplied to the cell were measured during this adsorption and desorption cycle the conductivity and ph of the effluent were measured to observe the electrode reactions this method of mac measurement has been described in detail in previous studies choi and yoon 2019b son and choi 2022 2 3 conditions for mcdi desalination experiments to analyze the effect of the total charge accumulated on the carbon electrode on the desorption rate mcdi experiments were conducted while changing the q t value from 19 7 to 44 3 c g the mac value measured in the previous experiment was determined to be 45 3 c g therefore the q t values were set to be below this mac value to prevent the faradaic reactions from occurring the adsorption process was performed at a current density of 2 35 ma cm2 until a preset q t was supplied and then desorption was performed at 0 2 v for 360 s the adsorption desorption cycle was successively repeated 10 times so that the carbon electrode reached a dss under the given conditions if the dt is too short during the mcdi operation all adsorbed ions cannot be desorbed which may affect the subsequent adsorption process to evaluate the effects of incomplete desorption on the performance of the mcdi cell mcdi experiments were carried out while changing the dts after supplying 39 3 c g of q a d during the adsorption process desorption was performed while changing the dt from 100 to 360 s adsorption was performed at a current density of 2 35 ma cm2 and desorption was carried out at a cell potential of 0 2 v for each dt the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times to observe the change in the desalination performance sac charge efficiency according to the cycle the sac and charge efficiency were calculated using the equations described in other papers suss et al 2015 liu et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 mac value as a criterion for controlling faradaic reactions to measure the mac value of the carbon electrode used in the mcdi cell adsorption was performed while supplying a constant current until the cell potential reached 1 6 v fig 1 shows the nacl concentration and ph change of the effluent according to the cumulative charge supplied to the cell as a result of supplying a constant current to the cell the effluent concentration was kept constant at 825 mg l by analyzing the nacl concentrations of the feed and effluent solution 1000 and 825 mg l respectively flow rate 40 ml min and current density 2 35 ma cm2 it was found that the charge efficiency was 96 2 this means that ions were adsorbed in proportion to the current supplied to the cell however as the cumulative charge supplied reached approximately 45 3 c g the concentration of the effluent gradually increased at the same charge the ph started to decrease as described in detail in other papers the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent were attributed to the faradaic reactions at the carbon electrode choi 2014 tang et al 2017 choi and yoon 2019b from this it can be inferred that when a charge of 45 3 c g accumulates in the carbon electrode the faradaic reactions start and it can be seen that the mac value of the carbon electrode is 45 3 c g the mac value of a carbon electrode is a useful indicator that can be used to increase the adsorption rate without the occurrence of faradaic reactions during the operation of an mcdi system if the charge accumulated in the carbon electrode during the adsorption process is controlled to be below the mac value the electrode reaction does not occur regardless of the cell potential or current density therefore the adsorption rate can be increased by operating the mcdi cell at a high cell potential or current density choi and yoon 2019a as such the mac value can be used as an important criterion to improve the adsorption rate of an mcdi system while maintaining stability against the faradaic reactions 3 2 analysis of desorption rate according to the total charge the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times while changing the q t from 19 7 to 44 3 c g fig 2 shows the change in the concentration of the effluent in the last 10th adsorption desorption cycle as a constant current density was supplied during the adsorption process the effluent concentration was constant the adsorption time increased from 120 to 270 s in proportion to the q t value the amount of adsorbed ions was proportional to the q t value as a result it can be seen that the concentration of the effluent in the desorption process increases in proportion to q t in addition when the desorption process was complete the effluent and the influent had almost the same concentration indicating that all of the adsorbed ions have been desorbed the inset in fig 2 shows the sac values calculated from the effluent concentration as q t increased from 19 7 to 44 3 c g the sac value increased linearly from 5 8 to 13 1 mg g fig 3 shows the changes in cell potential measured during the adsorption process the cell potential was approximately 0 30 v immediately after the current was applied from this it can be seen that the electrical resistance of the mcdi cell was approximately 1 5 ω when the concentration of nacl in the flow channel was 1000 mg l as adsorption started the nacl concentration in the flow channel decreased due to the adsorption of ions as a result the cell potential rapidly increased owing to the increase in the electrical resistance of the solution at the initial adsorption process then as the concentration in the flow channel became constant the cell potential increased linearly in proportion to the charge supplied additionally the cell potential according to the cumulative charge showed overlapping results at all q t values this means that the carbon electrode was completely regenerated during the desorption process the inset in fig 3 shows the final cell potential when the preset q t was supplied as q t increased the final cell potential also increased almost linearly in particular the cell potential reached 1 42 v at a q t of 44 3 c g as a result of measuring the ph of the effluent it was observed that the ph was maintained in a stable state from this it can be seen that the electrode reactions did not occur even at the cell potential of 1 42 v the cell potential is the sum of the electrode potential and the i r drop caused by the electrical resistance r and current i the cell potential was 1 42 v but the voltage drop due to the i r was expected to be at least 0 3 v when the concentration of the flow channel is 1000 mg l or more therefore it is considered that the electrode potential was maintained at 1 1 v or less after adsorption was performed until the preset q t was reached desorption proceeded for 360 s at a cell potential of 0 2 v fig 4 shows the change in the current density solid line over time during the desorption process a high current density was supplied at the beginning of the desorption process and it showed a tendency to decrease exponentially with time the current density at a dt of 150 s decreased to 2 3 of the initial current density it can be seen that the higher q t is the higher the current density the current density supplied to the mcdi cell indicates the transport rate of ions therefore it was confirmed that the more charge accumulated on the carbon electrode during the adsorption process the higher the average desorption rate meanwhile the total desorption charge q d e supplied to the cell during the desorption process was measured and determined to be almost the same as q t this means that desorption proceeded completely without charge remaining on the carbon electrode the percentage of q d e was calculated by dividing the cumulative q d e at a certain dt by the total q d e value the percentage of q d e according to the dt is shown in fig 4 dotted lines as q t increased the current density increased during the desorption process however the percentage of q d e according to the dt was consistent regardless of the q t value it can be seen that 84 6 and 92 5 of the q t are discharged at dt values of 100 and 150 s respectively when adsorption and desorption ideally progress at the carbon electrode the mcdi cell can be interpreted as a circuit in which a resistor and a capacitor are connected in series in this case the change in current i d e according to time t in the desorption process is expressed by the following equation plonus 2020 1 i d e t q t r c exp t r c q t τ exp t τ where q t is the total charge accumulated in the carbon electrode c g r is the electrical resistance of the mcdi cell ω c is the capacitance of the carbon electrode f g and τ is the time constant from eq 1 assuming that the resistance and capacitance of the mcdi cell are constant it can be seen that the desorption current is proportional to q t this coincides with the result shown in fig 4 in which the desorption current increases as q t increases on the other hand the desorption charge q d e t over time in the desorption process can be calculated by integrating eq 1 and eq 3 obtained by dividing eq 2 by q t represents the ratio of q d e λ t over time 2 q d e t q t 1 exp t τ 3 λ t q d e t q t 1 exp t τ eq 3 indicates that λ t is not affected by q t when τ is constant which supports the result of fig 4 from the above results it can be seen that the operation of the mcdi system at a high q t value is effective in increasing the desorption rate 3 3 estimation of the minimum desorption time for stability against the faradaic reactions when the desorption potential was applied the current decreased exponentially with time sufficient time is required to discharge all the charges accumulated in the carbon electrode as the dt becomes shorter residual charges remain in the carbon electrode fig 5 shows the schematic diagram for changing q t according to the dt when dt is maintained long enough a all the q t is discharged and no charge remains in the carbon electrode q r e 0 so q t q a d as the dt becomes shorter q r e increases when q a d is supplied to the carbon electrode in the presence of q r e q t increases if q t q r e q a d exceeds the mac value fig 5c faradaic reactions may occur in the carbon electrode therefore to operate the mcdi system without the occurrence of electrode reactions it is important to control the dt and q a d so that the q t does not exceed the mac value when the mcdi cell reaches a dss q a d and q d e are the same in this case eq 2 can be expressed as eq 4 below 4 q t t q a d 1 exp t τ q a d λ t eq 4 represents the q t value required to desorb all the q a d in time t if the dt is long enough λ 1 and q r e 0 therefore the q t value is the same as q a d as the dt is shortened λ decreases and q t increases rapidly by substituting the λ value obtained from fig 4 into eq 4 q t was calculated and is shown in fig 6 as a function of dt q t rapidly increases as dt becomes shorter when q t exceeds the mac value 45 3 c g of the carbon electrode it can be expected that faradaic reactions occur therefore the minimum dt d t m i n for operating the mcdi cell without the occurrence of faradaic reactions is the time that q t reaches the mac value for example when operating the mcdi cell at q a d 39 3 c g the dt must be at least 112 s to prevent the electrode reactions from occurring the d t m i n for each q a d were obtained from fig 6 and are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that d t m i n increased rapidly as q a d increased when q a d was 39 3 c g or less d t m i n increased linearly from 23 to 112 s as q a d increased however as the q a d 44 3 c g approached the mac value d t m i n significantly increased to 252 s the maximum average discharge rate was calculated by dividing the q a d value by d t m i n and is shown in fig 7 as q a d increased the maximum average discharge rate decreased due to an increase in d t m i n the discharge rate represents the desorption rate of ions in the mcdi cell the faster the desorption rate is the higher the asar of the mcdi cell when the mcdi system is operated at a low q a d value d t m i n is shortened and the desorption rate can be increased in this case however it may be difficult to operate the mcdi system because the switching time between the adsorption and desorption processes is shortened 3 4 verification of stability according to the desorption time to verify the stability against the faradaic reactions according to the dt predicted in the previous section mcdi desalination experiments were conducted while changing the dts the adsorption process was performed until the q a d 39 3 c g was supplied at a current density of 2 35 ma cm2 and desorption was performed while changing the dt from 100 to 360 s at a cell potential of 0 2 v the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times at each given dt fig 8 shows the change in the nacl concentration of the effluent in the final 10th adsorption desorption cycle during the adsorption process the concentration of the effluent was kept constant so it can be seen that the change in dt did not affect the adsorption process however although the same q a d was supplied during the adsorption process the maximum concentration of the effluent during the desorption process increased from 1830 to 1960 mg l as dt became shorter this means that the desorption rate increased as dt became shorter additionally as seen in the inset which shows the concentration of the effluent at the end of the desorption process the final concentration gradually increased as the dt became shorter when the final concentration is higher than the influent concentration 1000 mg l this indicates that the desorption did not proceed completely while the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 10 times the q a d and the q d e values were measured in each cycle and q r e was calculated from the difference q a d q d e fig 9 shows the cumulative q r e according to the number of cycles as expected q r e increased significantly as the dt decreased when dt 360 s q r e was almost zero which indicates that all q a d was discharged however the q r e was 8 03 c g at dt 100 s and when q a d 39 3 c g was supplied again q t reached 47 3 c g which exceeds the mac value therefore it can be expected that faradaic reactions may occur when the mcdi cell is operated at dt 100 s on the other hand q r e was 5 5 c g at dt 120 s in this case q t can reach 44 9 c g at the end of the adsorption process which is close to the mac value 45 3 c g the presence of faradaic reactions during the mcdi operation was examined by measuring the ph of the effluent fig 10 a shows the ph of the effluent during the 10 adsorption desorption cycles at dt 100 120 and 150 s additionally the ph of the effluent during the last cycle is shown in fig 10 b when the dt was 150 s or more it was found that the ph of the effluent was maintained in a stable state so that the electrode reactions did not occur however when the dt was less than 120 s the effluent ph gradually decreased as the adsorption desorption cycle was repeated from the ph change it was found that the electrode reactions occurred at dt 120 s or less from fig 6 it was predicted that the electrode reactions would not occur when the dt was longer than 112 s at q a d 39 3 c g additionally from q r e in fig 9 q t was calculated to be 44 9 c g at dt 120 s which is lower than the mac value therefore it was predicted that the faradaic reactions would not occur at dt 120 s in contrast to these predictions however the electrode reactions were observed at dt 120 s the cause for this is considered to be the limitation of the mac measurement in the measurement of mac it is important to accurately determine the point where the electrode reactions start as seen in fig 1 however it is not easy to determine the exact position from the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent it is thought that the difference from the expected result is attributed to slight error in the mac measurement the sac and charge efficiency in each cycle were calculated from the concentration of the effluent and the average values are summarized in table 1 in addition the desorption rate was calculated by dividing the amount of desorbed nacl by the dt the faradaic reactions were observed when the dt was 100 and 120 s as a result the sac and charge efficiency showed slight decreases however when the dt was 150 s or more the electrode reactions were not observed and the sac and charge efficiency remained constant on the other hand as dt was shortened the desorption rate increased significantly from 1 91 to 6 69 mg g min considering the stability of the mcdi system it is thought that the optimal dt is 150 s the desorption rate is 4 56 mg g min in this case the asar the desalination rate of the mcdi cell becomes 1 75 mg g min since this study focused on the optimization of the dt to increase the asar adsorption experiments were conducted at a constant current density of 2 35 ma cm2 when q t does not exceed the mac value the faradaic reactions do not occur regardless of the current density supplied during the adsorption process when the current density is doubled the adsorption time is reduced by half so that the asar can increase to 2 53 mg g min 4 conclusion in this study the optimum operating conditions were obtained to improve the desalination rate of the mcdi system while maintaining stability against faradaic reactions the mcdi cell can be interpreted as an equivalent circuit in which a resistor and capacitor are connected in series from an analysis of the series rc circuit the desorption rate was expected to be proportional to the total charge accumulated in the carbon electrode to confirm this the average desorption rate was measured by operating the mcdi cell at various q t values as expected the average desorption rate of the mcdi cell was proportional to q t additionally it was confirmed that the ratio of q d e with time in the desorption process was consistent regardless of the q t value this is consistent with the discharge characteristics of an rc series circuit by applying the mac concept of the carbon electrode a model equation that can predict the minimum dt for operating an mcdi system without the occurrence of faradaic reactions was derived it was estimated that the average desorption rate can be increased when the mcdi system is operated at a low q a d value the results of the mcdi experiments while changing the dt almost matched the results predicted from the model equation these results are expected to contribute greatly to improving the long term stability and desalination

of feocl cm batch experiment was conducted as follows feocl 2 g l 1 and bsa solution 20 mg l 1 300 ml were placed in a beaker and paa solution 2 5 mm was added to start the reaction magnetic stirring 300 rpm was applied during the reaction water samples were taken at different time intervals and filtered with 0 22 μm ptfe filters for further analysis 25 mm na2s2o3 was employed as the quenching agent to cease the oxidation reaction yuan et al 2021 2 4 2 paa feocl cm catalytic filtration filtration was carried out in dead end mode under 0 1 mpa milli q water was first filtered for 15 min to obtain pure water flux bsa solution 20 mg l 1 was then filtered by the pristine cm or feocl cm the filtration duration was 30 min in order to explore the anti fouling efficiency of the paa catalytic filtrations 2 5 mm paa was added into the bsa solution prior to the filtration test water flux was measured periodically by the electronic balance the normalized water flux was calculated based on the initial pure water flux of the membrane 2 5 mechanism analysis 2 5 1 electrochemical measurement three electrode system was used for electrochemical measurement which contained an ag agcl 3 m kcl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum sheet 1 cm 1 cm as the counter electrode a glassy carbon electrode gce with a diameter of 4 mm was used as the working electrode the square wave voltammetry swv test was conducted as follows bsa tyrosine or tryptophan was first adsorbed to the gce for 300 s in the phosphate buffer solution ph 7 at 0 1 v and then the voltammetric curve was

quench both oh and organic radicals wang et al 2020d the degraded bsa samples were measured by feem spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of feocl cm the as prepared feocl cm showed an obvious color change compared with the pristine cm from white to reddish brown after feocl loading fig 1 a the sem image of the feocl cm surface exhibited a uniform distribution of feocl on the membrane fig 1b according to the eds mapping images fig s1 fe o and cl elements were evenly scattered on the membrane surface further a zoomed in sem image of the feocl cm surface showed nanosheet structures of feocl and eds mappings of fe and cl elements coincided with the contour of the nanosheet fig 1c according to fig s2 the feocl nanosheet structure was evident when the feocl loading amount was 0 1 g ml 1 while feocl appeared as the form of agglomerates under lower loading amounts overall the dip coating method was proved successful for feocl functionalization on the ceramic membrane it is also worth noting that the dip coating technique possesses easy scale up ability and readily adjustment of coating thickness qing et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless the reliability and durability of membrane coating layers by the dip coating technique need further exploration as it influences both membrane performance and economic viability xrd and xps characterizations were carried out to verify the molecular structures and elemental compositions of the feocl cm surface as shown in fig 1d the xrd diffraction peaks of the feocl cm surface at 11 17 26 1 35 37 and 50 38 corresponded to the 010 110 021 and 131 planes of the feocl characteristic crystallographic structure respectively verifying the structure of feocl loaded on the cm surface sun et al 2018a the other diffraction peaks showed the components of the cm substrate i e zro2 jcpds no 49 1642 and tio2 jcpds no 21 1276 according to the xps analysis fig 1e the deconvoluted peaks of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 at the binding energies of 710 6 and 723 8 ev indicated the predominance of fe3 zhu et al 2016 additionally the main peaks of o 1 s at 530 1 ev and cl 2p at 198 8 ev validated the presence of fe o bond yan et al 2018 and fe cl bond sun et al 2018b respectively surface roughness and hydrophilicity are important factors that affect the anti fouling performances of the membranes lu et al 2016 according to the three dimensional afm surface images and surface roughness parameters figs s3 and 1f the functionalized feocl cm showed comparable surface roughness as the pristine cm specifically the loading of 0 1 g ml 1 feocl slightly decreased the membrane surface roughness root mean square deviation i e rq 36 75 than the pristine cm rq 45 50 implying that the loading of 0 1 g ml 1 feocl smooths the cm surface morphology the pore size distribution of the feocl cm was also explored feocl cm feocl loading amount 0 1 g ml 1 and the cm with mwco of 3 kda shared resembling pore size ranges in fig 1g which was also consistent with their similar water flux performances fig s4 zhao et al 2020b additionally water contact angle was used to evaluate the membrane surface hydrophilicity according to fig 1h feocl cm exhibited lower water contact angle 37 and reduced normalized wicking time to 15 compared with the cm of mwco 3 kda contact angle 64 boo et al 2016 these results indicated that the feocl cm surface is more hydrophilic than the pristine cm taken together a fine ultrafiltration feocl cm feocl loading amount 0 1 g ml 1 with high hydrophilicity and low surface roughness was prepared this membrane was further employed for the catalytic filtration tests 3 2 anti fouling performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system the anti fouling performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system was evaluated using bsa 20 mg l 1 as the model foulant catalytic filtration experiments were conducted in a customized dead end filtration cell with an applied transmembrane pressure of 1 bar according to fig 2 a in the absence of paa the normalized water fluxes of the pristine cm and feocl cm reduced to 0 22 and 0 27 when filtrating bsa which indicated that the feocl cm shared comparable and slightly improved anti fouling performance than the pristine cm additionally the water fluxes of both membranes showed a sharp decrease at the initial stage suggesting substantial pore blocking orange dotted box in fig 2a and followed by mild flux decline gray dotted box in fig 2a suggesting the cake layer formation above membrane kusworo et al 2017 zuriaga agustí et al 2014 on the other hand in paa catalytic filtrations the normalized water fluxes of both membranes were evidently enhanced the normalized water flux of feocl cm increased from 0 27 to 0 46 when paa 2 5 mm was added in the feed solution importantly as shown in the orange dotted box in fig 2a membrane fouling at the front end of the filtration was effectively alleviated in paa catalytic filtrations suggesting the reduction of pore blocking lu et al 2016 wei et al 2016 hermia model was also employed to explain the fouling patterns of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration model equations see table s1 zheng et al 2009 zhao et al 2020a as shown in table s2 the correlation coefficient values r2 of standard blocking and cake layer patterns in single filtrations i e filtrations without in situ paa oxidation were the highest indicating evident blocking inside ceramic membrane pores and cake layer formation above membrane when integrating paa oxidation with ceramic membrane filtration r2 values of standard blocking and cake layer were still the highest yet r2 values of the complete blocking and intermediate blocking patterns increased in catalytic filtrations the alteration of r2 values suggested that the oxidized bsa particles were likely more prone to be retained above membrane and blocked membrane pore on the membrane surface i e complete blocking and intermediate blocking this postulation was further confirmed by the detailed sem analysis of the bsa foulants on the ceramic membranes fig 2b and c additionally as shown in table s2 the fouling kinetic constants of intermediate blocking ki cake layer kc and standard blocking ks in the paa feocl cm filtration were notably smaller than those of the single filtrations further confirming the reduced fouling tendency by the catalytic filtration compared with the paa cm filtration the enhanced flux performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration could be ascribed to the effective activation ability of feocl towards paa activated paa may show efficient degradation of bsa particles stuck in membrane pores resulting in obvious growth of water flux this postulation of bsa degradation will be further investigated in detail in sections 3 3 3 5 sem images of the fouled feocl cm demonstrated intuitive evidence of the effective anti fouling performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration where bsa particles that deposited on the membrane surface or penetrated into membrane pores were notably degraded after paa addition according to fig 2b and c distinct fouling areas were observed on the surface and cross section of the feocl cm after filtration in the view of membrane cross sections the foulants mainly remained at the top surface vicinity after paa feocl cm catalytic filtration while they penetrated deeply into the membrane pores with a notably larger fouling area after single feocl cm filtration see red dash lines in fig 2b1 and c1 additionally scattered bsa particles were observed on the feocl cm surface after paa feocl cm catalytic filtration fig 2b2 whereas the larger and agglomerated bsa particles were stacked on the membrane surface after single feocl cm filtration fig 2c2 furthermore as shown in table s3 the paa feocl cm filtration showed comparable antifouling tendency to the reported catalytic filtration systems i e peroxymonosulfate involved filtration fenton reaction involved filtration photo catalytic filtration and electro catalytic filtration kumari et al 2020 kumari et al 2021 additionally feocl cm shows lower water permeability than other reported catalytic membranes which is attributed to that feocl cm falls in the range of fine ultrafiltration figs 1g and s4 while the catalytic membranes generally belong to the range of ultrafiltration 3 3 influence of paa feocl catalytic oxidation on bsa properties fig 3 a presented images of bsa in paa feocl catalytic systems obtained by epifluorescence microscope after paa addition the bsa particles exhibited smaller fluorescence distribution areas and weaker intensity suggesting that paa can induce the degradation and removal of bsa after 5 min of paa feocl catalytic oxidation the fluorescence areas and intensity of bsa greatly reduced and only a few scattered green dots were observed moreover with the prolongation of the catalytic reaction to 20 min there was little bsa residue which indicated that paa feocl catalytic oxidation system can effectively degrade bsa agglomerate ftir analysis was further applied to analyze the functional group changes of bsa before and after paa feocl catalytic oxidation ftir spectra illustrated the functional groups of the degraded bsa at different reaction times as shown in fig 3b the ftir spectra of the pristine bsa presented several characteristic functional groups i e hydroxyl stretching amide i and amide ii specifically the broad band at 3307 cm 1 of the pristine bsa indicated the oh groups and the absorption peak at 1659 cm 1 was attributed to the co stretching amide i bian et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 the peak at 1640 cm 1 represented the stretching vibrations of cn and the bending of nh amide ii due to the peptide linkage in the pristine bsa structure alhazmi 2019 with the prolongation of the catalytic oxidation the disappearance of the amide i band and decrease in the intensities of the amide ii band implied that the structure of bsa was destructed via paa feocl catalytic oxidation this could well explain the decreasing fluorescence intensity of bsa after being treated by the paa feocl catalytic oxidation fig 3a in addition co stretching of aliphatic compounds at 1123 cm 1 and 1005 cm 1 became stronger after the catalytic oxidation indicating that the rings of complex aromatic structures of the pristine bsa were opened and degraded to aliphatic compound zhao et al 2020a this may be ascribed to the oxidation of aromatic amino acids in bsa components e g tryptophan and tyrosine as shown in fig 4 a ledesma et al 2017 molecular weight distributions were further investigated via gel chromatography fig 3c detailed procedure see text s1 the pristine bsa particles presented two peaks 119 kda 8 6 kda and degraded to a peak of 10 kda after the paa feocl catalytic oxidation this suggested that the catalytic oxidation system effectively disintegrated the macro molecular bsa structure which also corresponded to the results of the ftir spectra fig 3b furthermore the degradation of bsa in paa feocl catalytic system was verified by feem analysis fig 4b the excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of bsa at the highest intensity are 280 nm and 340 nm respectively the standard curve of bsa was depicted by measuring the feem intensities of bsa in different concentrations at the highest excitation ex and emission em wavelengths as shown in fig s5 bsa concentration was positively correlated with the feem intensity r2 0 9993 confirming the validity of the standard curve according to fig s6 60 removal of bsa was obtained by 2 5 mm paa oxidation within 1 min while the degradation rate of bsa increased to 95 within 1 min of paa feocl catalytic oxidation this indicated that feocl exhibited excellent efficiency as a paa activator for bsa degradation the relationship between paa concentration and bsa degradation in paa feocl catalytic system was also explored bsa removal rate increased continuously with the increase of paa concentration fig s7 additionally as paa mixture often contains h2o2 oxidant due to the preparation method the influence of h2o2 oxidation to bsa was also investigated according to fig s8 bsa degradation extent by h2o2 feocl oxidation was much lower than that by paa feocl oxidation at the same oxidant concentrations i e 0 25 and 2 5 mm suggesting that the contribution of catalytic h2o2 oxidation to bsa degradation was negligible 3 4 swv analysis of bsa and its characteristic components bsa consists of 583 amino acid residues and is rich in aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine tyr and tryptophan trp fig 4a ziaee et al 2021 according to fig 4b d the characteristic feem peaks of tyr ex 270 280 nm em 300 310 nm and trp ex 270 280 nm em 340 360 nm coincided with those of bsa ex 270 280 nm em 330 350 nm indicating that tyr and trp are characteristic components of bsa chen et al 2015 square wave voltammetry swv was employed to analyze the degradation of bsa and its characteristic aromatic amino acid residues in paa feocl catalytic oxidation system fig s9 showed swv analysis of bsa solutions in different concentrations the generated current positively correlated with bsa concentration which indicated that the removal of bsa could be quantitatively inferred from the change of peak value in swv analysis in the protein voltammograms tyr peak peak y and trp peak peak w usually overlap as characteristic yw peak in bsa vargová et al 2016 as marked in fig 4e g additionally tyr and trp could be electro oxidized on the glassy carbon electrode gce in the form of monomeric states or short peptides resulting in oxidation peaks at different peak potentials in swv analysis giménez et al 2016 in fig 4e g yw peak peak y and peak w decreased by 68 2 70 4 and 91 6 respectively suggesting that paa feocl catalytic oxidation effectively degraded bsa through destructing the characteristic components i e tyr and trp of bsa the effective degradation of these aromatic amino acids was also consisted with the aforementioned ftir analysis fig 3b 3 5 mechanism analysis of paa feocl cm catalytic filtration bsa degradation could be ascribed to the direct electron transfer between the reactants i e electron transfer from bsa to paa via feocl catalyst and the oxidation by in situ generated ros in the paa feocl catalytic filtration chen et al 2020b chung et al 2018 the electron transfer pathway between bsa feocl paa was analyzed by chronoamperometry fig s10 first displayed the cyclic voltammetry cv curves of gce feocl in different electrolyte solutions i e phosphate buffer solution paa solution and bsa solution no obvious cv peak occurred in the three curves indicating that the additional electric energy could not induce direct electron transfer between feocl paa or feocl bsa in the voltage range of 2 to 0 v a potential of 0 5 v was selected to measure the electron transfer in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation system shao et al 2021 as depicted in fig 5 a the current increased evidently after paa addition which was attributed to the instantaneous electron transfer between gce feocl and paa subsequently current signal only changed slightly upon the addition of bsa indicating that the direct electron transfer between bsa and paa via feocl catalyst was not the main mechanism for bsa degradation in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation ros mediated oxidation pathway was analyzed in the paa feocl catalytic system epr detection was employed to indicate the existence of ros dmpo and temp are spin trapping agents for indicating oh and 1o2 respectively luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 5b there was little peak signal detected when paa or feocl alone existed in paa feocl catalytic system a characteristic four line spectrum signal 1 2 2 1 appeared which was considered as dmpooh based on the hyperfine splitting constants li et al 2021a this result showed that oh was generated in the paa feocl catalytic system according to fig 5c typical triplet peaks 1 1 1 of tempo were observed in both paa and paa feocl catalytic systems suggesting the existence of 1o2 li et al 2021a the 1 1 1 signal of the paa feocl catalytic system was stronger than that of paa alone confirming that 1o2 production by paa was enhanced when using feocl as the catalyst further the epr analyses figs s11 and s12 showed that with the increase of feocl loading amounts and reaction time the amount of in situ generated oh and 1o2 both enhanced accordingly in addition as shown in fig s13a o2 signal was not detected in the system to further clarify the degradation mechanism of bsa in the paa feocl catalytic system ros quenching experiments were employed to verify the contribution of in situ generated ros upon paa activation by transition metals the generation of oh is accompanied by the generation of organic radicals e g ch3c o o and ch3c o oo due to the homolytic cleavage of the oo bond of paa rokhina et al 2010 ao et al 2021 hence the contribution of organic radicals were also examined meoh is a scavenger for both oh and organic radicals while tba can only quench oh wang et al 2020d yuan et al 2021 the comparison of the quenching performances of meoh and tba can differentiate the contributions of oh and the organic radicals meanwhile ffa and p bq scavenge 1o2 and o2 respectively appiani et al 2017 qu et al 2019 according to fig s14 the addition of these scavengers caused negligible influence on the feem spectra of bsa thus feem could be employed to measure the degraded bsa coexisted with the scavengers as shown in fig 5d the inhibition of bsa degradations correlated positively with the scavenger concentrations specifically tba and meoh scavengers exhibited similarly strong inhibition effect confirming that oh contributed notably to bsa degradation while organic radical played a weak role similarly the significant inhibition by ffa scavenger suggested 1o2 oxidation towards bsa in the paa feocl catalytic system the oxidative reaction between 1o2 and bsa was also reported in previous studies giménez et al 2016 gracanin et al 2009 vargová et al 2016 in addition from fig s13b no obvious change of bsa removal rate was observed after the addition of p bq scavenger which confirmed with the result from fig s13a and again implied that a negligible amount of o2 was generated taken together ros oh and 1o2 mediated oxidation pathway mainly attributed to bsa degradation while direct electron transfer pathway played a negligible role in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation system fig 5e with the above results the fouling mechanism of bsa on cm is proposed along with the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration bsa was oxidized by the in situ generated oh and 1o2 bsa was thus disintegrated into smaller molecules along with the breakage of amide i and amide ii bands such catalytic oxidation rendered the reduction of pore blocking by bsa foulants alleviating membrane fouling liu et al 2020 4 conclusion this study demonstrated a paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system for notable membrane fouling inhibition the as prepared feocl cm showed high hydrophilicity low surface roughness and highly efficient activation towards paa oxidation using bsa as the model protein foulant the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system significantly lowered the membrane fouling and halved the flux reduction degree as compared with the conventional cm filtration the extent of pore blocking and cake layer formation were both reduced via in situ paa feocl catalytic oxidation in the membrane epifluorescence microscopy and gel chromatography collectively confirmed that bsa particles were disintegrated into smaller molecules after the catalytic filtration the bsa disintegration was attributed to the breakage of the amide i and ii bands via ftir spectra analysis moreover the square wave voltammetry method was for the first time employed to specify the degradation of the bsa characteristic components aromatic amino acids i e tyr trp in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation system combining epr analysis and radical quenching tests the in situ generated oh and 1o2 were the key reactive species towards bsa degradation during catalytic filtration while the organic radicals played a minor role further the bsa degradation via the electron transfer pathway from bsa to paa via feocl cm was insignificant from chronoamperometry analysis overall this work provided a new paradigm of paa cm catalytic filtration for achieving efficient membrane antifouling performance and provided in depth mechanism analysis pertaining to the integrated paa catalytic oxidation membrane filtration process future works including cation influence and treatment of typical foulants besides proteins could be investigated for more comprehensive evaluation of the paa catalytic filtration system due to the following concerns i cations e g ca2 mg2 na likely possess influence on the membrane antifouling performance due to the complexation with bsa foulant via the functional groups e g carboxyl group wang and tang 2011 and alteration of the electrostatic interaction of bsa bsa and bsa ceramic membrane tian et al 2013 ii typical foulants including humic acid and polysaccharide possess different molecular structures and physicochemical properties from bsa which would likely cause different fouling patterns in the paa catalytic filtration systems and are thus worthy of further investigation besides membrane fouling control this multifunctional catalytic membrane filtration system has promising potential in diverse water treatment applications such as fast water decontamination and disinfection more thorough investigation of paa integration with membrane filtration is needed for exploring the potential of paa in developing high performance and multifunctional catalytic membrane

performed with autolab pgstat302n analyzer metrohm switzerland 2 4 paa feocl cm catalytic system 2 4 1 batch experiment of paa feocl catalytic oxidation to investigate the catalytic oxidation effect of feocl cm batch experiment was conducted as follows feocl 2 g l 1 and bsa solution 20 mg l 1 300 ml were placed in a beaker and paa solution 2 5 mm was added to start the reaction magnetic stirring 300 rpm was applied during the reaction water samples were taken at different time intervals and filtered with 0 22 μm ptfe filters for further analysis 25 mm na2s2o3 was employed as the quenching agent to cease the oxidation reaction yuan et al 2021 2 4 2 paa feocl cm catalytic filtration filtration was carried out in dead end mode under 0 1 mpa milli q water was first filtered for 15 min to obtain pure water flux bsa solution 20 mg l 1 was then filtered by the pristine cm or feocl cm the filtration duration was 30 min in order to explore the anti fouling efficiency of the paa catalytic filtrations 2 5 mm paa was added into the bsa solution prior to the filtration test water flux was measured periodically by the electronic balance the normalized water flux was calculated based on the initial pure water flux of the membrane 2 5 mechanism analysis 2 5 1 electrochemical measurement three electrode system was used for electrochemical measurement which contained an ag agcl 3 m kcl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum sheet 1 cm 1 cm as the counter electrode a glassy carbon electrode gce with a diameter of 4 mm was used as the working electrode the square wave voltammetry swv test was conducted as follows bsa tyrosine or tryptophan was first adsorbed to the gce for 300 s in the phosphate buffer solution ph 7 at 0 1 v and then the voltammetric curve was recorded under the following conditions amplitude 10 mv step 10 mv frequency 25 hz initial potential 0 4 v end potential 1 2 v chronoamperometry ca was measured using a feocl loaded glassy carbon electrode gce feocl as the working electrode the gce feocl was prepared by first dispersing feocl powder 25 mg in a mixture of 1 5 ml milli q water and 120 μl nafion solution sonicating the mixture for 0 5 h and then transferring the mixture onto gce and drying it at room temperature ca test was measured in phosphate buffer solution ph 7 at 0 5 v allowing monitoring of current changes in response to the sequential addition of paa 2 5 mm and bsa 20 mg l 1 2 5 2 reactive oxygen species ros identification epr spectra were used for ros identification in the paa feocl system dmpo 200 mm served as the trapping agent for hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 and temp 100 mm was used for detecting singlet oxygen 1o2 the instrument settings were modulation frequency 100 khz modulation amplitude 1 g sweep width 150 g and sweep time 123 s dose dependent ros quenching tests were conducted in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation system where ros quenchers in different concentrations were added to examine its influence on bsa degradation tba p bq and ffa served as the quenching agents for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively qu et al 2019 methyl alcohol meoh was used to quench both oh and organic radicals wang et al 2020d the degraded bsa samples were measured by feem spectrophotometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of feocl cm the as prepared feocl cm showed an obvious color change compared with the pristine cm from white to reddish brown after feocl loading fig 1 a the sem image of the feocl cm surface exhibited a uniform distribution of feocl on the membrane fig 1b according to the eds mapping images fig s1 fe o and cl elements were evenly scattered on the membrane surface further a zoomed in sem image of the feocl cm surface showed nanosheet structures of feocl and eds mappings of fe and cl elements coincided with the contour of the nanosheet fig 1c according to fig s2 the feocl nanosheet structure was evident when the feocl loading amount was 0 1 g ml 1 while feocl appeared as the form of agglomerates under lower loading amounts overall the dip coating method was proved successful for feocl functionalization on the ceramic membrane it is also worth noting that the dip coating technique possesses easy scale up ability and readily adjustment of coating thickness qing et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless the reliability and durability of membrane coating layers by the dip coating technique need further exploration as it influences both membrane performance and economic viability xrd and xps characterizations were carried out to verify the molecular structures and elemental compositions of the feocl cm surface as shown in fig 1d the xrd diffraction peaks of the feocl cm surface at 11 17 26 1 35 37 and 50 38 corresponded to the 010 110 021 and 131 planes of the feocl characteristic crystallographic structure respectively verifying the structure of feocl loaded on the cm surface sun et al 2018a the other diffraction peaks showed the components of the cm substrate i e zro2 jcpds no 49 1642 and tio2 jcpds no 21 1276 according to the xps analysis fig 1e the deconvoluted peaks of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 at the binding energies of 710 6 and 723 8 ev indicated the predominance of fe3 zhu et al 2016 additionally the main peaks of o 1 s at 530 1 ev and cl 2p at 198 8 ev validated the presence of fe o bond yan et al 2018 and fe cl bond sun et al 2018b respectively surface roughness and hydrophilicity are important factors that affect the anti fouling performances of the membranes lu et al 2016 according to the three dimensional afm surface images and surface roughness parameters figs s3 and 1f the functionalized feocl cm showed comparable surface roughness as the pristine cm specifically the loading of 0 1 g ml 1 feocl slightly decreased the membrane surface roughness root mean square deviation i e rq 36 75 than the pristine cm rq 45 50 implying that the loading of 0 1 g ml 1 feocl smooths the cm surface morphology the pore size distribution of the feocl cm was also explored feocl cm feocl loading amount 0 1 g ml 1 and the cm with mwco of 3 kda shared resembling pore size ranges in fig 1g which was also consistent with their similar water flux performances fig s4 zhao et al 2020b additionally water contact angle was used to evaluate the membrane surface hydrophilicity according to fig 1h feocl cm exhibited lower water contact angle 37 and reduced normalized wicking time to 15 compared with the cm of mwco 3 kda contact angle 64 boo et al 2016 these results indicated that the feocl cm surface is more hydrophilic than the pristine cm taken together a fine ultrafiltration feocl cm feocl loading amount 0 1 g ml 1 with high hydrophilicity and low surface roughness was prepared this membrane was further employed for the catalytic filtration tests 3 2 anti fouling performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system the anti fouling performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system was evaluated using bsa 20 mg l 1 as the model foulant catalytic filtration experiments were conducted in a customized dead end filtration cell with an applied transmembrane pressure of 1 bar according to fig 2 a in the absence of paa the normalized water fluxes of the pristine cm and feocl cm reduced to 0 22 and 0 27 when filtrating bsa which indicated that the feocl cm shared comparable and slightly improved anti fouling performance than the pristine cm additionally the water fluxes of both membranes showed a sharp decrease at the initial stage suggesting substantial pore blocking orange dotted box in fig 2a and followed by mild flux decline gray dotted box in fig 2a suggesting the cake layer formation above membrane kusworo et al 2017 zuriaga agustí et al 2014 on the other hand in paa catalytic filtrations the normalized water fluxes of both membranes were evidently enhanced the normalized water flux of feocl cm increased from 0 27 to 0 46 when paa 2 5 mm was added in the feed solution importantly as shown in the orange dotted box in fig 2a membrane fouling at the front end of the filtration was effectively alleviated in paa catalytic filtrations suggesting the reduction of pore blocking lu et al 2016 wei et al 2016 hermia model was also employed to explain the fouling patterns of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration model equations see table s1 zheng et al 2009 zhao et al 2020a as shown in table s2 the correlation coefficient values r2 of standard blocking and cake layer patterns in single filtrations i e filtrations without in situ paa oxidation were the highest indicating evident blocking inside ceramic membrane pores and cake layer formation above membrane when integrating paa oxidation with ceramic membrane filtration r2 values of standard blocking and cake layer were still the highest yet r2 values of the complete blocking and intermediate blocking patterns increased in catalytic filtrations the alteration of r2 values suggested that the oxidized bsa particles were likely more prone to be retained above membrane and blocked membrane pore on the membrane surface i e complete blocking and intermediate blocking this postulation was further confirmed by the detailed sem analysis of the bsa foulants on the ceramic membranes fig 2b and c additionally as shown in table s2 the fouling kinetic constants of intermediate blocking ki cake layer kc and standard blocking ks in the paa feocl cm filtration were notably smaller than those of the single filtrations further confirming the reduced fouling tendency by the catalytic filtration compared with the paa cm filtration the enhanced flux performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration could be ascribed to the effective activation ability of feocl towards paa activated paa may show efficient degradation of bsa particles stuck in membrane pores resulting in obvious growth of water flux this postulation of bsa degradation will be further investigated in detail in sections 3 3 3 5 sem images of the fouled feocl cm demonstrated intuitive evidence of the effective anti fouling performance of the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration where bsa particles that deposited on the membrane surface or penetrated into membrane pores were notably degraded after paa addition according to fig 2b and c distinct fouling areas were observed on the surface and cross section of the feocl cm after filtration in the view of membrane cross sections the foulants mainly remained at the top surface vicinity after paa feocl cm catalytic filtration while they penetrated deeply into the membrane pores with a notably larger fouling area after single feocl cm filtration see red dash lines in fig 2b1 and c1 additionally scattered bsa particles were observed on the feocl cm surface after paa feocl cm catalytic filtration fig 2b2 whereas the larger and agglomerated bsa particles were stacked on the membrane surface after single feocl cm filtration fig 2c2 furthermore as shown in table s3 the paa feocl cm filtration showed comparable antifouling tendency to the reported catalytic filtration systems i e peroxymonosulfate involved filtration fenton reaction involved filtration photo catalytic filtration and electro catalytic filtration kumari et al 2020 kumari et al 2021 additionally feocl cm shows lower water permeability than other reported catalytic membranes which is attributed to that feocl cm falls in the range of fine ultrafiltration figs 1g and s4 while the catalytic membranes generally belong to the range of ultrafiltration 3 3 influence of paa feocl catalytic oxidation on bsa properties fig 3 a presented images of bsa in paa feocl catalytic systems obtained by epifluorescence microscope after paa addition the bsa particles exhibited smaller fluorescence distribution areas and weaker intensity suggesting that paa can induce the degradation and removal of bsa after 5 min of paa feocl catalytic oxidation the fluorescence areas and intensity of bsa greatly reduced and only a few scattered green dots were observed moreover with the prolongation of the catalytic reaction to 20 min there was little bsa residue which indicated that paa feocl catalytic oxidation system can effectively degrade bsa agglomerate ftir analysis was further applied to analyze the functional group changes of bsa before and after paa feocl catalytic oxidation ftir spectra illustrated the functional groups of the degraded bsa at different reaction times as shown in fig 3b the ftir spectra of the pristine bsa presented several characteristic functional groups i e hydroxyl stretching amide i and amide ii specifically the broad band at 3307 cm 1 of the pristine bsa indicated the oh groups and the absorption peak at 1659 cm 1 was attributed to the co stretching amide i bian et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 the peak at 1640 cm 1 represented the stretching vibrations of cn and the bending of nh amide ii due to the peptide linkage in the pristine bsa structure alhazmi 2019 with the prolongation of the catalytic oxidation the disappearance of the amide i band and decrease in the intensities of the amide ii band implied that the structure of bsa was destructed via paa feocl catalytic oxidation this could well explain the decreasing fluorescence intensity of bsa after being treated by the paa feocl catalytic oxidation fig 3a in addition co stretching of aliphatic compounds at 1123 cm 1 and 1005 cm 1 became stronger after the catalytic oxidation indicating that the rings of complex aromatic structures of the pristine bsa were opened and degraded to aliphatic compound zhao et al 2020a this may be ascribed to the oxidation of aromatic amino acids in bsa components e g tryptophan and tyrosine as shown in fig 4 a ledesma et al 2017 molecular weight distributions were further investigated via gel chromatography fig 3c detailed procedure see text s1 the pristine bsa particles presented two peaks 119 kda 8 6 kda and degraded to a peak of 10 kda after the paa feocl catalytic oxidation this suggested that the catalytic oxidation system effectively disintegrated the macro molecular bsa structure which also corresponded to the results of the ftir spectra fig 3b furthermore the degradation of bsa in paa feocl catalytic system was verified by feem analysis fig 4b the excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of bsa at the highest intensity are 280 nm and 340 nm respectively the standard curve of bsa was depicted by measuring the feem intensities of bsa in different concentrations at the highest excitation ex and emission em wavelengths as shown in fig s5 bsa concentration was positively correlated with the feem intensity r2 0 9993 confirming the validity of the standard curve according to fig s6 60 removal of bsa was obtained by 2 5 mm paa oxidation within 1 min while the degradation rate of bsa increased to 95 within 1 min of paa feocl catalytic oxidation this indicated that feocl exhibited excellent efficiency as a paa activator for bsa degradation the relationship between paa concentration and bsa degradation in paa feocl catalytic system was also explored bsa removal rate increased continuously with the increase of paa concentration fig s7 additionally as paa mixture often contains h2o2 oxidant due to the preparation method the influence of h2o2 oxidation to bsa was also investigated according to fig s8 bsa degradation extent by h2o2 feocl oxidation was much lower than that by paa feocl oxidation at the same oxidant concentrations i e 0 25 and 2 5 mm suggesting that the contribution of catalytic h2o2 oxidation to bsa degradation was negligible 3 4 swv analysis of bsa and its characteristic components bsa consists of 583 amino acid residues and is rich in aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine tyr and tryptophan trp fig 4a ziaee et al 2021 according to fig 4b d the characteristic feem peaks of tyr ex 270 280 nm em 300 310 nm and trp ex 270 280 nm em 340 360 nm coincided with those of bsa ex 270 280 nm em 330 350 nm indicating that tyr and trp are characteristic components of bsa chen et al 2015 square wave voltammetry swv was employed to analyze the degradation of bsa and its characteristic aromatic amino acid residues in paa feocl catalytic oxidation system fig s9 showed swv analysis of bsa solutions in different concentrations the generated current positively correlated with bsa concentration which indicated that the removal of bsa could be quantitatively inferred from the change of peak value in swv analysis in the protein voltammograms tyr peak peak y and trp peak peak w usually overlap as characteristic yw peak in bsa vargová et al 2016 as marked in fig 4e g additionally tyr and trp could be electro oxidized on the glassy carbon electrode gce in the form of monomeric states or short peptides resulting in oxidation peaks at different peak potentials in swv analysis giménez et al 2016 in fig 4e g yw peak peak y and peak w decreased by 68 2 70 4 and 91 6 respectively suggesting that paa feocl catalytic oxidation effectively degraded bsa through destructing the characteristic components i e tyr and trp of bsa the effective degradation of these aromatic amino acids was also consisted with the aforementioned ftir analysis fig 3b 3 5 mechanism analysis of paa feocl cm catalytic filtration bsa degradation could be ascribed to the direct electron transfer between the reactants i e electron transfer from bsa to paa via feocl catalyst and the oxidation by in situ generated ros in the paa feocl catalytic filtration chen et al 2020b chung et al 2018 the electron transfer pathway between bsa feocl paa was analyzed by chronoamperometry fig s10 first displayed the cyclic voltammetry cv curves of gce feocl in different electrolyte solutions i e phosphate buffer solution paa solution and bsa solution no obvious cv peak occurred in the three curves indicating that the additional electric energy could not induce direct electron transfer between feocl paa or feocl bsa in the voltage range of 2 to 0 v a potential of 0 5 v was selected to measure the electron transfer in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation system shao et al 2021 as depicted in fig 5 a the current increased evidently after paa addition which was attributed to the instantaneous electron transfer between gce feocl and paa subsequently current signal only changed slightly upon the addition of bsa indicating that the direct electron transfer between bsa and paa via feocl catalyst was not the main mechanism for bsa degradation in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation ros mediated oxidation pathway was analyzed in the paa feocl catalytic system epr detection was employed to indicate the existence of ros dmpo and temp are spin trapping agents for indicating oh and 1o2 respectively luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 5b there was little peak signal detected when paa or feocl alone existed in paa feocl catalytic system a characteristic four line spectrum signal 1 2 2 1 appeared which was considered as dmpooh based on the hyperfine splitting constants li et al 2021a this result showed that oh was generated in the paa feocl catalytic system according to fig 5c typical triplet peaks 1 1 1 of tempo were observed in both paa and paa feocl catalytic systems suggesting the existence of 1o2 li et al 2021a the 1 1 1 signal of the paa feocl catalytic system was stronger than that of paa alone confirming that 1o2 production by paa was enhanced when using feocl as the catalyst further the epr analyses figs s11 and s12 showed that with the increase of feocl loading amounts and reaction time the amount of in situ generated oh and 1o2 both enhanced accordingly in addition as shown in fig s13a o2 signal was not detected in the system to further clarify the degradation mechanism of bsa in the paa feocl catalytic system ros quenching experiments were employed to verify the contribution of in situ generated ros upon paa activation by transition metals the generation of oh is accompanied by the generation of organic radicals e g ch3c o o and ch3c o oo due to the homolytic cleavage of the oo bond of paa rokhina et al 2010 ao et al 2021 hence the contribution of organic radicals were also examined meoh is a scavenger for both oh and organic radicals while tba can only quench oh wang et al 2020d yuan et al 2021 the comparison of the quenching performances of meoh and tba can differentiate the contributions of oh and the organic radicals meanwhile ffa and p bq scavenge 1o2 and o2 respectively appiani et al 2017 qu et al 2019 according to fig s14 the addition of these scavengers caused negligible influence on the feem spectra of bsa thus feem could be employed to measure the degraded bsa coexisted with the scavengers as shown in fig 5d the inhibition of bsa degradations correlated positively with the scavenger concentrations specifically tba and meoh scavengers exhibited similarly strong inhibition effect confirming that oh contributed notably to bsa degradation while organic radical played a weak role similarly the significant inhibition by ffa scavenger suggested 1o2 oxidation towards bsa in the paa feocl catalytic system the oxidative reaction between 1o2 and bsa was also reported in previous studies giménez et al 2016 gracanin et al 2009 vargová et al 2016 in addition from fig s13b no obvious change of bsa removal rate was observed after the addition of p bq scavenger which confirmed with the result from fig s13a and again implied that a negligible amount of o2 was generated taken together ros oh and 1o2 mediated oxidation pathway mainly attributed to bsa degradation while direct electron transfer pathway played a negligible role in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation system fig 5e with the above results the fouling mechanism of bsa on cm is proposed along with the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration bsa was oxidized by the in situ generated oh and 1o2 bsa was thus disintegrated into smaller molecules along with the breakage of amide i and amide ii bands such catalytic oxidation rendered the reduction of pore blocking by bsa foulants alleviating membrane fouling liu et al 2020 4 conclusion this study demonstrated a paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system for notable membrane fouling inhibition the as prepared feocl cm showed high hydrophilicity low surface roughness and highly efficient activation towards paa oxidation using bsa as the model protein foulant the paa feocl cm catalytic filtration system significantly lowered the membrane fouling and halved the flux reduction degree as compared with the conventional cm filtration the extent of pore blocking and cake layer formation were both reduced via in situ paa feocl catalytic oxidation in the membrane epifluorescence microscopy and gel chromatography collectively confirmed that bsa particles were disintegrated into smaller molecules after the catalytic filtration the bsa disintegration was attributed to the breakage of the amide i and ii bands via ftir spectra analysis moreover the square wave voltammetry method was for the first time employed to specify the degradation of the bsa characteristic components aromatic amino acids i e tyr trp in the paa feocl catalytic oxidation system combining epr analysis and radical quenching tests the in situ generated oh and 1o2 were the key reactive species towards bsa degradation during catalytic filtration while the organic radicals played a minor role further the bsa degradation via the electron transfer pathway from bsa to paa via feocl cm was insignificant from chronoamperometry analysis overall this work provided a new paradigm of paa cm catalytic filtration for achieving efficient membrane antifouling performance and provided in depth mechanism analysis pertaining to the integrated paa catalytic oxidation membrane filtration process future works including cation influence and treatment of typical foulants besides proteins could be investigated for more comprehensive evaluation of the paa catalytic filtration system due to the following concerns i cations e g ca2 mg2 na likely possess influence on the membrane antifouling performance due to the complexation with bsa foulant via the functional groups e g carboxyl group wang and tang 2011 and alteration of the electrostatic interaction of bsa bsa and bsa ceramic membrane tian et al 2013 ii typical foulants including humic acid and polysaccharide possess different molecular structures and physicochemical properties from bsa which would likely cause different fouling patterns in the paa catalytic filtration systems and are thus worthy of further investigation besides membrane fouling control this multifunctional catalytic membrane filtration system has promising potential in diverse water treatment applications such as fast water decontamination and disinfection more thorough investigation of paa integration with membrane filtration is needed for exploring the potential of paa in developing high performance and multifunctional catalytic membrane
