11025,guayule is being produced for natural rubber in us desert areas where irrigation requirements are high improved irrigation practices and methods are required to increase guayule yields and reduce its water use presently there is no information available on guayule produced using subsurface drip irrigation sdi therefore we conducted an sdi guayule field study in 2012 2015 in maricopa arizona us the objectives were to evaluate guayule dry biomass db rubber yield ry and crop evapotranspiration etc responses to water application level and to compare these results to previously reported guayule irrigation studies guayule seedlings were transplanted in the field in october 2012 at 0 35 m spacing in 100 m long rows spaced 1 02 m apart the field had 15 8 row wide plots 5 irrigation treatments x 3 replicates irrigation treatments were imposed in a randomized complete block design starting in may 2013 irrigation scheduling was based on the measured soil water depletion percentage swdp of a fully irrigated treatment defined as 100 etc replacement and maintained at 20 35 swdp the other treatments received 25 50 75 and 125 of irrigation applied to the 100 treatment on each day of irrigation destructive samples for dry biomass rubber and resin contents were periodically taken from each plot between february and november of each year until the guayule was bulk harvested in march 2015 results indicated etc db and ry increased with total water applied irrigation rain which varied between treatments from 2080 to 4900 mm for the 29 month growing season final dry biomass and rubber yields of 61 2 mg ha and 3430 kg ha respectively were achieved with the highest irrigation treatment level 125 and these yields were significantly higher than those under all other irrigation levels all sdi irrigation treatments except for the lowest 25 level had rubber yields from 24 to 200 greater than the maximum ry achieved under a companion surface irrigation study conducted simultaneously in maricopa keywords evapotranspiration irrigation scheduling rubber yield soil water water productivity 1 introduction guayule parthenium argentatum gray is a perennial hardwood shrub native to northern mexico and the southwestern us deserts whose stem branches and roots produce high quality natural rubber nr rasutis et al 2015 it is presently being targeted in the us and other countries as a major source of nr to supplement limited hevea hevea brasiliensis imported rubber grown primarily in southeastern asia soratana et al 2017 current pressures on nr supplies include rising nr demand from developing countries and potential hevea plantation destruction due to rising incidents of plant disease eranki et al 2017 sfeir et al 2014 inspired by us tire companies there is renewed interest in expanding guayule production in the southwestern us desert a recent usa today news article reported that general motors and four of the world s largest tire manufacturers are committed to using sustainable nr for all its tires in the future evanoff 2018 this commitment includes a major focus on utilizing guayule as the cornerstone crop and generating a domestic nr industry in the us the need to achieve high yield productivity with efficient irrigation water use is one of several major obstacles impeding the guayule industry guayule shrubs are considered drought tolerant surviving on little or no rainfall for long periods of time foster and coffelt 2005 the national academy of sciences national academy of science nas 1977 recommended that the total water application twa i e irrigation water plus rainfall be limited to 640 mm in desert areas increased knowledge on irrigation water use and yield response for guayule was expanded in the mid 1980s the research included three guayule irrigation studies conducted in mesa and yuma arizona bucks et al 1985a 1985b 1985c bucks et al 1985d and in el paso texas miyamoto et al 1984 miyamoto and bucks 1985 at these locations where the average yearly rainfall is less than 190 mm year the guayule was grown for two years and then harvested they reported that maximum dry biomass db and maximum rubber yield ry were attained for fully irrigated treatments whose measured cumulative crop evapotranspiration etc during the second year of growth was 2050 1950 and 1830 in mesa yuma and el paso respectively maximum db and ry for the three field studies were approximately 22 0 mg ha and 1200 kg ha respectively for the arizona sites and 12 7 mg ha and 840 kg ha respectively for the texas site these yields were obtained with about 2000 2200 mm year of twa for the arizona studies and with 1600 mm year of twa for the texas study a literature search revealed a few more recent studies regarding guayule yield response to measured water applied have been conducted since the mid 1980s the relevant papers include guayule research in the negev desert of israel benzioni et al 1989 and studies in more humid and cooler climates than us deserts such as zacatecas mexico rodriquez garcia et al 2002 queensland australia dissanayake et al 2007 northern texas foster et al 2011 and southern france and southern spain sfeir et al 2014 snoeck et al 2015 in all these more recent studies the twa reported were 900 mm year or less and rubber yields were substantially lower than those in the mid 1980s arizona deserts bucks et al 1985a and 1985b except in the negev desert where ry was 1060 kg ha sfeir et al 2014 however estimated after one year of study that a ry of about 1400 kg ha could be achieved in southern spain with 900 mm year the guayule studies cited above indicate that high yields of rubber can only be achieved with high levels of irrigation they also showed that guayule biomass production increases directly with increased etc and irrigation but that percentage of rubber in the plant tends to decrease at higher irrigation levels in october 2012 we initiated field research to augment existing guayule irrigation information focusing on a new guayule cultivar yulex b sanchez et al 2014 grown under the recommended plant population of 27 000 plants ha ray et al 1999 we conducted one irrigation study using surface irrigation si grown for 29 months 2012 2015 in maricopa arizona which evaluated guayule response under five levels of irrigation water application results from that study showed that maximum db and ry were about 30 higher than those in the mid 1980s arizona studies hunsaker and elshikha 2017 however results from maricopa also indicated that the water productivity wp for dry biomass and rubber yield expressed as the ratio of final db and ry to twa respectively increased significantly when the twa level was reduced from the maximum yield twa level thus under surface irrigation guayule rubber yield gains became increasingly smaller as total water applied increased subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a system used for row crops and trees which applies water below the soil surface lamm et al 2012 researchers have reported that sdi compared to other irrigation methods has the potential to increase crop quality and yields reduce irrigation water use and reduce agronomic costs ayars et al 2015 colaizzi et al 2004 some of the primary crop production advantages attributed to sdi include more frequent precise and spatially uniform water and fertilizer applications ability to maintain soil water content and soil temperatures at stable levels over the season and reduced irrigation water losses such as soil evaporation ayars et al 2015 colaizzi et al 2004 lamm et al 2012 reported that sdi can increase and stabilize crop yield compared to sprinkler when deficit irrigation is practiced due to limited water resources however there is very limited information on the use of sdi for guayule production and virtually no literature that compares guayule responses with sdi to other irrigation systems therefore during 2012 2015 we conducted a sdi guayule study on a nearby field in maricopa simultaneously with the si study a similar range of irrigation levels were also imposed under sdi the objectives of this paper are to evaluate guayule biomass rubber yield and etc responses to irrigation water application amounts and soil water status with sdi and to compare yield and water productivity of guayule under sdi with the companion study results and those in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details irrigation system and plant establishment a guayule subsurface drip irrigation field study was conducted from october 2012 planting through march 2015 final harvest within a 1 4 ha field site at the university of arizona maricopa agricultural center mac in maricopa arizona located in the northeastern sonoran desert of the usa the field site soil is mapped as a casa grande series fine loamy mixed superactive hyperthermic typic natrargids post et al 1988 having sandy loam and sandy clay loam textures daily meteorological data including rainfall were provided by the arizona meteorological network azmet brown 1989 weather station at mac located less than 100 m from the field site the azmet station also provided daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto calculated by the asce standardized penman monteith equation allen et al 2005 the field site at mac located in the northeastern sonoran desert is characterized by high evaporation rates and low precipitation where historical annual average eto and rainfall 1990 2014 recorded by azmet are 1880 and 169 mm year respectively typical maximum temperatures in june to august are 40 c and above the winter months of december and january can be cold where minimum temperatures often fall below 0 c details of climatic data during the 29 month study are provided in fig 1 a b c and d bi weekly averaged climate data for 2012 2013 fig 1a and b and 2014 2015 fig 1c and d show that months from january to april were cooler and more humid in 2013 than 2014 climate data including eto and rainfall for the two years were similar from may to early july however during mid july to august in 2014 fig 1c and d higher rates of rainfall and generally lower temperatures less solar radiation and lower eto rates occurred than during the same period in 2013 during the september through december period 2013 had generally higher temperatures lower relative humidity less frequent rainfall and higher eto rates than during that period in 2014 cumulative rainfall for the 2013 and 2014 years was 194 and 207 mm respectively while cumulative eto was 1878 mm and 1855 mm respectively both representing typical weather conditions in the central arizona desert prior to planting 120 raised beds were formed every 1 02 m along a length of 100 m a 15 station sdi system was then installed in the field during august 2012 the sdi system was designed to provide metered water and fertilizer applications to 15 individual plots each plot being eight plant beds wide for a plot size 7 14 m by 100 m the irrigation flow rate and totalized flow volume for each plot were monitored with flow meters and pressure heads were monitored using a pressure gauge placed above the irrigation entry point of each plot beneath each plant bed drip tape 22 mm in diameter and 13 mils 0 325 mm in thickness was buried to a depth of 0 20 m emitters along the tape were spaced every 0 51 m the system applied water at a rate of 0 91 l hr per emitter at a pressure of 100 kpa in late october of 2012 95 day old greenhouse grown yulex b line guayule seedlings sanchez et al 2014 were transplanted in the raised beds using a 2 row rotary vegetable planter pulled behind a farm tractor the planter was calibrated to place one 100 mm tall seedling every 0 36 m along the beds giving an initial transplant population of 27 000 plants ha following transplanting the guayule plants were established by applying alternate row furrow irrigation five times between october 26 and november 20 2012 establishment irrigations were managed by the mac irrigation supervisor who estimated a total of 629 mm of water was applied to the field during 2012 prior to imposing irrigation treatments on may 21 2013 the mac irrigator applied additional furrow irrigations to all plots on february 28 122 mm and may 14 2013 100 mm also sdi was applied four times to all plots between april 10 and may 5 total averaged 35 mm 2 2 experimental design soil water content measurements irrigation scheduling and fertilizer applications the experimental design was a randomized complete block consisting of five irrigation treatments replicated in three blocks neutron access tubes were installed in all 15 plots in late april 2013 using a tractor mounted soil sampler five 2 1 m long metal access tubes were installed vertically in the soil along the length of each of the 15 plots at distances of 10 30 50 70 and 90 m from the irrigation inlet 75 tubes total the access tubes were placed in the middle row viz row 4 in each 8 row plot field calibrated neutron moisture meters were used to measure volumetric soil water contents θv from 0 10 to 1 9 m below the surface in 0 20 m increments measurements of θv were begun on may 9 2013 and continued through march 13 2015 from may through early november when guayule growth was active θv measurements were made every 7 14 days at all 75 tube locations exceptions occurred during october 2013 when θv was measured only once in plots and between late april and mid may 2014 when time between measurements was 20 days from mid november through march when guayule growth was slow θv was measured about every three weeks at all tube locations during installation of the access tubes soil samples from 0 to 1 8 m were collected in 0 3 m increments at all locations the soil samples were immediately analyzed in the laboratory to determine the upper field capacity fc and lower permanent wilting point pwp volumetric soil water contents the fc and pwp soil water contents were determined at the 0 33 kpa and 1500 kpa soil matric potentials respectively using pressure membrane extractors the soil samples were also analyzed for soil particle size fraction soil texture using the bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 differential irrigation amounts to treatments using sdi were initiated on may 21 2013 seven months after planting one irrigation treatment designated as i100 served as a control treatment whose irrigation scheduling was intended to provide ample and uniform available soil water asw within the crop root zone depth zr the principle used for scheduling the i100 treatment was to provide irrigation to maintain asw within an effective zr of 1 8 m between 65 80 of total available water taw defined as the total amount of water the soil can store between fc and pwp over the crop root zone depth martin and gilley 1993 thus soil water depletion percentage swdp as calculated by eq 1 was to be maintained at 20 35 1 swdp 1 asw taw 100 where asw and taw are in mm and swdp is in percent the 1 8 m depth used for zr was based on the extent of measurable guayule soil water extraction determined by bucks et al 1985a the scheduling principle was relaxed from late november through the end of the guayule winter dormancy period in late february when irrigation was not provided for the i100 treatment a separate daily soil water balance model was made for each plot replicate the soil parameter calculations use eq 1 and the following equations eqs 2 to 5 the soil water balance models were initiated on may 9 2013 with the first set of θv measurements and then repeatedly updated after each new set of soil water content measurements was made the daily soil water balance models for the i100 treatment were also updated with measured irrigation and rainfall amounts and daily eto provided by the azmet station the measured θv were first averaged at each measurement depth for the five tube locations within each replicate and then converted to soil water storage sws over the zr of 1 8 m 2 sw s m i 1 i 0 2 θ v i where swsm is the measured soil water storage over zr in mm θv i are the volumetric soil water contents measured every 0 2 m from 0 1 m to 1 7 m j 8 the taw for each replicate was determined using the lab analyses of fc and wp as averaged by depth for each replicate the amount of soil water storage sws at field capacity over zr was calculated by eq 3 using the replicate average fc data determined at each sampling depth 3 s w s f c i 1 j θ f c i d i x 10 where swsfc is soil water storage at field capacity over the 1 8 m crop root zone depth in mm θfc i are the field capacity soil water contents determined at each 0 3 m sample depth j 6 similarly the sws at pwp swspwp over zr was calculated using eq 3 by replacing θfc i with the replicate average θpwp i for each di thus taw over zr for each treatment replicate was computed as the difference between swsfc and swspwp the available soil water over zr martin and gilley 1983 was calculated as 4 asw swsm swspwp and the soil water depletion swd was calculated as 5 swd swsfc swsm where all units for eqs 4 and 5 are in mm four other irrigation treatments in the study were governed by the i100 irrigation dates and application amounts the four treatments were designated as i25 i50 i75 i125 and received 25 50 75 and 125 of the irrigation amount applied to the i100 at each irrigation respectively prior to initiating irrigation treatments on may 21 2013 urea ammonium nitrate uan was injected during irrigation by sdi on april 19 2013 to uniformly apply 32 kg n ha to all plots a second application of uan 32 kg n ha was given to all plots during treatment irrigations on 10 july 2013 a third and final uan application of 64 kg n ha was applied to all plots during irrigations in march 2014 soil tests for p and k indicated adequate levels so no p or k fertilizer was applied 2 3 crop evapotranspiration for treatments in this section methods are presented for the estimation of the actual etc that occurred for irrigation treatments where etc was calculated separately at each of the five access tube locations within a treatment plot replicate these etc calculations were begun on may 17 2013 following a final flood irrigation to all plots on may 14 the etc was determined as the residual of the soil water balance equation jensen et al 1990 shown in eq 6 over time periods between two consecutive soil water content measurement dates 6 etc swd2 swd1 iw r dp where etc is the total evapotranspiration mm between two consecutive water measurement dates swd1 and swd2 are the measured root zone soil water depletion mm on first and second dates respectively and iw r and dp are the measured irrigation water mm measured rainfall mm and the estimated deep percolation mm that occurred during the time period between the two soil water measurements respectively for eq 6 swd was calculated over a zr of 1 8 m by eqs 2 3 and 5 using the lab analyzed field capacity values determined for each tube location measurement of dp was not made however thorough evaluation of the measured swd with time indicated an assumption of negligible dp was valid for all locations within i25 i50 and i75 treatments evaluation of the measured swd for the i125 treatment plots indicated significant dp was certain particularly during the 2014 and therefore etc calculations were omitted for the i125 treatment examination of swd for i100 plots suggested dp likely occurred at some tube locations during a period in early july 2014 when measured swd approached values near zero i e field capacity after a 29 mm rain occurred on july 3 one day after full irrigation had been applied consequently an estimated dp of about one half the rain amount 15 mm was uniformly applied to all i100 plots in the soil water balance calculation of etc for the period from july 3 to july 10 2014 2 4 plant growth and destructive sampling guayule canopy height and canopy cover measurements commenced in april 2013 measurements were made for three to six plants in each plot every 25 days from april to november 2013 every 36 days from february to september 2014 and on march 16 2015 three to six destructive whole plant samples were harvested by hand for each plot three times between july and november 2013 and four times between february and september 2014 a final destructive hand harvest of five whole plants was made on march 16 2015 just before a final bulk harvest was made during destructive harvests the plants were extracted from the soil to a depth of 0 1 m below the soil surface all plant measurements and plant harvests were limited to the three inner rows rows 3 4 and 5 of each 8 row plot to minimize the influence on plant growth due to irrigation from adjacent treatment plots fresh biomass weights obtained from whole plant harvests were immediately measured and then dried in open greenhouses for 2 4 weeks each biomass sample was periodically weighed until there was no significant change in dry weight mohammadi shad and antungulu 2019 after drying the plants in each plot were chopped and ground with a chipper shredder the samples were analyzed for resin and rubber by the university of arizona plant science department in tucson arizona resin and rubber concentrations were determined through a sequential extraction protocol that closely followed the methods recommended by cornish et al 2013 2 5 final harvest final bulk harvest occurred on march 17 and 18 2015 when entire 100 m lengths of two plant rows rows 4 and 5 were bulk harvested for each of the 15 plots the equipment used was a modified potato digger harvester that pulled the two rows of plants including main roots up to the surface the trailer load for each plot harvest was then immediately weighed on a large truck scale on the mac farm the content of moisture in the fresh weights of the bulk final harvests and the rubber and resin contents were determined from the mean values obtained from the destructive samples within each plot taken during hand harvests on march 16 2015 the dry biomass db in kg ha was multiplied by the rubber and resin contents to obtain final rubber and resin yields ray et al 2005 respectively the wp of the total water applied was calculated as the ratio between yield and twa kg m3 using the dry biomass and rubber and resin yield data obtained from final bulk harvest 2 6 statistical analyses irrigation treatment effects for measured total water applied plant height db rubber and resin contents final yields water productivity and cumulative etc were analyzed statistically using a randomized complete block model within the proc mixed procedures of sas sas institute inc 2009 the proc mixed estimation method used the residual maximum likelihood reml option block and block x irrigation treatment were considered random effects while irrigation treatment was the fixed effect with four degrees of freedom the error term had eight degrees of freedom the covtest option in proc mixed was used to test the block and interaction effects treatment means were separated using the pdiff least significance difference lsd at p 0 05 option 3 results 3 1 irrigation fig 2 shows the irrigation totals for treatments by year including the 629 mm estimated for plant establishment irrigations in oct nov 2012 monthly and yearly irrigation amounts for treatments and rain data are summarized in table 1 the yearly total for irrigation water applied to the i100 treatment in 2013 averaged 1215 33 mm which included furrow applied irrigations of 122 mm late feb and 100 mm early may also equally applied to the four other treatments because differential irrigation to treatments did not start until may 21 2013 yearly total irrigation applied to the i125 treatment in 2013 1418 mm table 1 was only 17 greater than that for the i100 while the i75 i50 and i25 received about 72 58 and 42 of that applied to the i100 yearly total irrigation to the i100 averaged 1848 mm in 2014 while the 2014 yearly irrigation amounts to other treatments were generally commensurate with treatment target rates the total yearly irrigation applied to the i125 was 24 greater than for the i100 while the i75 i50 and i25 treatments total irrigation were 68 47 and 25 less respectively the lower than intended irrigation for the i75 treatment which was only 68 of that for the i100 in 2014 was affected by greater variability in irrigation amounts among replicates then for other treatments e g the greater standard deviation sd for i75 in table 1 and fig 1 one replicate in the i75 was consistently less than the target irrigation rate by about 10 throughout the study thus lowering the average intended for the treatment i75 only one irrigation was applied to treatments in 2015 feb compared to the amount applied to the i100 in 2015 other treatments were somewhat less than intended amount except for the i25 treatment table 1 considering the entire 29 month guayule growing period between planting oct 2012 and final harvest march 2015 total irrigation water applied to the i100 was 3791 mm and the total water applied including the 452 mm of rain for the period was 4243 mm table 1 relative to the twa for the i100 over the entire growing period twa was 16 greater for the i125 while twa for the i75 i50 and i25 were 77 63 and 49 of the i100 twa statistical analyses indicated twa was significantly different between all irrigation treatments derivation of the twa at an annual basis i e considering the entire 29 month growing period gave an annual twa for treatments of 2032 1756 1354 1112 and 861 mm year for the i125 i100 i75 i50 and i25 3 2 soil water properties and soil water depletion irrigation treatment averages for soil texture fraction field capacity permanent wilting point and soil water holding capacity were not appreciably different table 2 sand fraction for a 1 8 m soil depth varied from 59 to 63 silt fraction from 12 to 15 and clay fraction from 23 to 26 the soil water contents determined for fc and pwp were notably uniform for treatments varying from 26 to 28 for fc and from 14 to 15 for pwp average soil water holding capacity was highest for the i50 treatment 130 mm m and lowest for the i25 treatment 122 mm m there was also comparable within treatment variability in soil water holding capacities for treatments as indicated by a range in the sd of 14 19 mm m for the treatments table 2 measured soil water depletion for treatments with time are shown from may 17 2013 through dec 17 2013 fig 3 a and from jan 30 2014 through march 12 2015 fig 3b following a flood irrigation to plots on may 14 2013 all treatments were near field capacity 5 to 6 swdp for measurements made three days later fig 3a the swdp for treatments then increased during the remainder of may through mid june initiation of irrigation treatments on may 21 2013 led to higher swdp for the less irrigated treatments i50 and i25 than the three higher irrigated treatments i75 i100 and i125 starting in early june as the differences in irrigation water applications accumulated swdp for the i75 increased relative to i100 beginning in late june and decreased for i125 relative to i100 beginning in early july 2013 differences in swdp between the i50 and i25 treatments also became evident in early july the trends for treatment separation in swdp remained relatively stable throughout the irrigation cycle of 2013 that ended in early november soil water depletion for the i100 treatment which had been maintained less than 32 through late september increased to 41 in late october and then increased to 47 at the end of 2013 about six weeks after irrigation had been terminated during the irrigation period of 2013 may 17 to november 11 the measured swdp for the i100 varied from 6 to 42 and averaged 25 for all measurements in that period during the same irrigation period the swdp for the i125 treatment varied from 6 to 30 and averaged 20 the average swdp for the i75 i50 and i25 treatments in 2013 may to nov was 37 44 and 51 respectively with a maximum swdp of 60 66 and 73 occurring on november 11 prior to subsequent rain in late november that reduced the soil water depletion for those treatments before resuming irrigation in early february 2014 swdp varied between 42 and 64 for irrigation treatments in late january fig 3b this was followed by decreased swdp for all treatments through march 13 2014 where the average i100 and i125 values were 19 and 11 respectively the subsequent swdp values for i100 then gradually increased to 30 on april 23 however swdp for i100 then increased to 44 on may 13 2014 which was above the target range i e 20 35 the increased swdp for the i100 indicated that the estimated crop evapotranspiration used to project irrigation amounts had underestimated actual the etc during the late april early may timeframe coinciding with a 20 day period between soil water content measurements the swdp for the i125 i75 i50 and i25 treatments on may 13 2014 was 37 61 72 and 82 respectively fig 3b as for the i100 treatment swdp for other treatments on may 13 was near to or above the maximum depletion measured for each treatment through the end of 2014 measurement december 8 the lowest measured swdp for the i100 in 2014 was 10 and occurred on july 10 fig 3b the lowest soil water depletion coincided with significant rain events following irrigation just prior to july 10 water content measurements after august 6 2014 swdp for the i100 treatment was maintained between about 19 36 until irrigation termination for the period of irrigation in 2014 measurement early feb to early nov the average swdp for the i100 was 27 slightly higher than during irrigation period in 2013 between early june through mid november 2014 measured swdp on many dates were in the range of 5 to 5 for the more heavily irrigated i125 treatment indicating deep percolation occurred in these plots during the irrigation period of 2014 the average swdp for the i125 i75 i50 and i25 was 12 54 66 and 78 respectively which was slightly lower than in 2013 for the i125 but much higher in 2014 than 2013 for the three drier treatments as rainfall between late november 2014 through mid february 2015 was light soil water depletion increased for treatments during that period until reduced following irrigation applied for five days in late february 2015 the swdp measured during the short irrigation period of 2015 late feb through march 12 2015 varied from 27 i125 to 79 i25 for treatments fig 3b 3 3 guayule crop evapotranspiration etc crop evapotranspiration rates are shown for irrigation treatments from may to december in 2013 fig 4 a and from january 2014 to march 2015 fig 4b as mentioned in section 2 3 etc data were not calculated for the i125 treatment due to uncertainty of the dp quantity in that treatment s soil water balance seasonal variation in etc was apparent for all treatments but varied more for the i100 treatment where the etc extremes were less than 1 0 mm d during winter months late december through january and as high as 12 0 mm d during a mid june period in 2014 during 2013 etc rates for the i100 were at a yearly maximum of about 9 0 mm d during late june to mid july declined to about 7 0 mm d during late july through august and then progressively declined from 7 0 mm d to 2 0 mm day between mid september to late december fig 4a noticeably higher etc rates for i100 than i75 occurred in early june about two weeks after initiation of irrigation treatments it was evident that the higher application of irrigation for the i100 treatment corresponded to increased etc rates over the i175 during the remainder of the irrigation period early november 2013 though the treatment etc rates converged by january 2014 similarly a clear separation in etc rates between the i75 and i50 and those between the i50 and the i25 began by mid june 2013 and separation remained through late october fig 4a resumption of irrigation treatments in early february 2014 resulted in treatment separation for etc in late february i100 and in early march for i75 vs i50 as well as for i50 vs i25 fig 4b during 2014 etc rates for the i100 varied from 9 7 12 0 mm d between late may through the end of july declined to 8 4 9 0 mm d during august and then steadily declined from 9 0 1 4 mm d between early september and late november 2014 all treatments experienced a decline in etc rates during august in both 2013 and 2014 from the higher etc rates that occurred during june and july the reduction in august guayule etc rates corresponded to reduced eto during the august monsoon season where average eto for august was 6 8 and 6 6 mm d in 2013 and 2014 respectively compared to eto for june 9 3 and 8 7 mm d and july 7 8 and 7 9 mm d respectively similarly average eto declined monthly from 5 4 and 5 5 mm d in september 2013 and 2014 respectively to 1 8 and 1 5 mm d in december the yearly average cumulative etc for the i100 was 1159 mm for 2013 where the periodic etc water balance were summed for all periodic etc determinations from may 17 to december 18 in 2013 table 3 obviously more etc occurred during the 6 5 months between october 26 2012 planting and the first soil water content measurements on may 17 but this etc was not determined by a soil water balance for 2014 average cumulative etc for the i100 treatment summed from dec 19 2013 to dec 9 2014 was 2057 mm a short final period of average cumulative etc for i100 was 109 mm determined between dec 10 2014 and march 12 2015 just prior to final harvest thus total cumulative etc for the 22 month period of soil water balance measurement averaged 3325 mm for the i100 treatment statistical analyses of the data in table 3 indicated all treatment means for cumulative etc were significantly different from one another whether yearly or total for the 22 month period of etc measurement total cumulative etc for the three treatments i75 i50 and i25 were 73 56 and 38 respectively of that for the i100 these treatment differences in total etc reflect a linear response to the twa during the same 22 month period where the twa for the i100 was 3273 mm while the i75 i50 and i25 were 70 53 and 34 of that for the i100 respectively prorated on an annual basis considering the 22 month period of etc measurement gave an annual etc of 1820 1390 1060 and 680 mm year for the i100 i75 i50 and i25 treatments respectively 3 4 guayule growth measures and rubber and resin contents fig 5 a and b illustrate the development of guayule plants over the course of the study measured plant height averages for treatments fig 5a increased from 0 3 m in late april 2013 to 0 63 to 0 66 m for the two wettest irrigation treatments i100 and i125 respectively by the end of july 2013 for the same period plant heights increased to 0 59 0 55 and 0 50 m for the i75 i50 and i25 treatments respectively however plant height measurements through mid november 2013 revealed only slight changes in height occurred during the remainder of 2013 for the i125 0 03 m i50 0 03 m and the i25 0 015 m treatments during the same period plant height increased at a higher rate for the i75 0 04 m and even greater rate for the i100 0 07 m plant height averages on november 15 2013 were not significantly different p 0 05 between the three wettest treatments i75 i100 and i125 while heights for these three treatments were significantly greater than those for i50 and i25 though i50 was significantly greater than for i25 during 2014 plant heights increased rapidly for the two wettest treatments beginning in late march 2014 fig 5a and the heights were not significantly different between i100 and i125 throughout 2014 and on the final measurement made on march 16 2015 for most measurements made in 2014 plant height was significantly greater for the two wettest treatments than for the i75 treatment which in turn had significantly greater height than the two driest treatments i50 and i25 while height was also greater for i50 than i25 from late april 2014 through the final plant measurement in 2015 on march 16 2015 plant height averaged 0 96 m 0 94 m 0 88 m 0 80 m and 0 65 m for i125 i100 i75 i50 and i25 respectively there were significant treatment effects for guayule dry biomass db for all destructive plant sampling dates which began on july 30 2013 fig 5b for the first two sampling dates in 2013 treatment mean comparison tests revealed significant differences between the i125 treatment and the drier i75 i50 and i25 means with no difference detected between the i125 and the i100 db at mid november 2013 the dry biomass for i125 was 0 76 kg plant compared with a db of 0 65 kg plant for the i100 treatment although the difference was not significant however both i125 and i100 had significantly greater db than the i75 whose db was also significantly greater than the db for the i50 and i25 treatments in november 2013 a similar trend in treatment differences occurred for the first db sampling date in 2014 on january 30 however for samples taken on april 30 and june 30 2014 db increased at a higher rate for the i125 than i100 and mean db was significantly different between the two treatments on june 30 2014 the db for the i125 was just over 2 0 kg plant versus 1 59 kg plant for the i100 however towards the end of 2014 and through the march 16 2015 sample the i100 db appeared to have caught up to that in the i125 treatment and differences were not statistically significant for samples made in 2014 through march 2015 the general trend was greater db for i100 than the i75 and greater biomass for i75 than both the i50 and the i25 though the i50 had higher mean db than that for the i25 during this same period significant differences between the two only occurred on the october 22 2014 date on march 16 2015 treatment db determined from the destructive made just before final bulk harvest was 2 54 2 45 1 72 1 04 and 0 69 kg plant for the i125 i100 i75 i50 and i25 respectively rubber and resin contents are shown for treatments in table 4 a general trend for all treatments was to increase the rubber content of plants with time starting at low initial values of 1 2 2 1 in late july 2013 to 4 6 to 5 4 on january 30 2014 after january 2014 subsequent treatment rubber contents gradually decreased through the remaining sample dates in 2014 to 3 2 4 3 table 4 however by late winter of 2015 i e march 16 2015 rubber content for each treatment had increased to their maximum 5 6 8 6 significant treatment differences for rubber contents occurred during all three sample dates of 2013 where the driest treatment i25 had higher rubber than the two wettest treatments i125 and i100 though there were no differences in average rubber content between i25 versus the i50 and i75 except on july 30 2013 during 2014 there were no treatment differences in rubber content until late october however at the final sampling on march 16 2015 significantly higher rubber content was attained for the i25 and i50 than for all three wetter treatments treatment trends for resin content with time were different than for rubber content table 4 where resin content generally decreased from july 2013 to november 2013 highest resin content in 2014 occurred in july for the i100 i75 and i50 treatments however it was in october 2014 for the i125 and i25 treatments on march 16 2015 resin content for the i100 and i75 was at the maximum for the study 7 9 and 8 6 respectively while i125 i50 and i25 had significantly lower resin content on that last sampling date 3 5 final yields and water productivity means for the final bulk harvested dry biomass after 29 months of growth were significantly different among all treatments with a near four fold increase in mean db from i25 to i125 table 5 final yield of all 15 plots for db for was highly linear with twa having a regression coefficient of determination r2 of 0 90 fig 6 a the i125 treatment achieved the maximum db in the study with a mean of 61 2 mg ha this was 29 greater than the mean db for the i100 and was achieved with only 16 more twa than that for i100 final mean db for the three drier treatments i75 i50 and i25 was 81 57 and 34 the db attained for the for i100 respectively water productivity for dry biomass averaged i125 1 25 mg m3 and the mean was significantly greater than that for both i50 and i25 while the mean wp for the i100 and i75 and i50 treatments were each significantly greater than for i25 table 5 a maximum rubber yield ry of 3429 kg ha for the i125 treatment was significantly greater than the ry for all other treatments and was two and a half times greater than for the i25 treatment table 5 the i125 ry was 21 greater than the ry for i100 and the increased rubber yield for i125 was slightly greater than the 16 increase in twa for i125 over i100 the 11 higher ry for the i100 over the i75 was not significant and the increase in ry was much less than the 23 increase in twa for i100 over i75 similarly an 18 increase in ry for the i75 over the i50 could not be excepted as significant however all treatments were found to have significantly greater ry than the i25 treatment regression of rubber yield data for all 15 plots fig 6b also reveals an overall linear relationship with twa while wp for ry was highest in the i50 and i75 treatments statistical differences in mean wp for treatments did not occur table 5 mean resin yields from 3300 to 3780 kg ha were achieved by the i75 i100 and i125 treatments and differences between the treatment means for these three treatments were not significant table 5 also all three treatments had significantly greater resin yield than the i50 and i25 while i50 resin yield was significantly greater than for i25 the water productivity of resin yield was highest for the i75 treatment but not enough to be significantly greater than either i100 and i125 4 discussion the estimated 629 mm of irrigation water applied using furrow irrigation for guayule transplant establishment represented a significant portion of the total irrigation water applied to treatments during the sdi study however guayule transplants in the us southwest desert were more efficiently established using sprinkler irrigation where only 380 mm of irrigation was applied for establishment in yuma arizona bucks et al 1985d guayule growers using sdi should consider the deployment of portable sprinkler systems to reduce irrigation water use for plant establishment on an annual basis twa for the i100 and the i125 treatments in the sdi study were 1760 and 2030 mm year respectively somewhat less than the 2000 2220 mm annual twa for the wetter treatments in the previous 1980s studies in arizona bucks et al 1985a d annual twa for the i75 i50 and i25 in the sdi study were 1350 1110 and 860 mm yr for the companion study conducted simultaneously in maricopa using surface irrigation hunsaker and elshikha 2017 annual twa for five similar irrigation treatments i e i120 i100 i80 i60 and i40 were 1950 1770 1460 1210 and 980 mm year respectively considering guayule research conducted outside the us deserts in which irrigation and rainfall were measured a maximum amount of 900 mm year of total water was applied in mediterranean studies sfeir et al 2014 snoeck et al 2015 and in israel benzioni et al 1989 these amounts of twa were comparable to our lowest twa in the sdi study i25 the i25 treatment attained db and ry of 15 7 mg ha and 1350 kg ha respectively which are similar values reported by sfeir et al 2014 for guayule grown for two years in spain even less twa 600 700 mm year was provided in studies in australia dissanayake et al 2007 northern texas foster et al 2011 and mexico rodriquez garcia et al 2002 in the latter three studies rubber yields reported after two years of growth were on the order of 600 700 kg ha regarding irrigation scheduling and soil water depletion the average measured swdp for the sdi i100 treatment during irrigation periods was 27 for the i100 treatment the target swdp 20 35 was both somewhat exceeded and somewhat reduced on several measurement dates but overall the fluctuations in swdp were small in comparison to those usually encountered under surface irrigation si methods in the companion study in maricopa with si the measured swdp for the i100 treatment went from 12 measured shortly after irrigation to as high as 69 just prior to irrigation overall the measured swdp for the 100 si treatment in maricopa averaged 46 over irrigation periods hunsaker and elshikha 2017 bucks et al 1985a did not provide detailed swdp data for the si treatments in mesa but did report that the depletion measured prior to irrigation for their wettest treatment averaged about 72 for the two years of study benzioni et al 1989 reported that guayule plants showed signs of visible wilting and had increased plant temperatures beginning at 60 swdp in the negev desert of israel a study by veatch blohm et al 2006 in tucson arizona found a 50 reduction in rubber yield when soil water depletion was increased to 75 before irrigating the ability to apply frequent but light irrigation amounts using sdi allowed uniformly high available soil water for guayule throughout the irrigation season for the three wettest treatments in maricopa because higher irrigation was applied to the i125 than i100 treatment in the sdi study the average measured swdp for the i125 over irrigation periods for the three years was only 16 for the sdi irrigation periods average swdp for the i75 and i50 treatments were 47 and 57 respectively during the second year 2014 of the sdi study the annual etc was 2050 mm for the i100 treatment this result shows that cumulative etc increased about 12 using sdi over the 2014 annual etc of 1830 mm for the i100 treatment under surface irrigation in maricopa hunsaker and elshikha 2017 this was close to the 9 0 higher twa for sdi than the si in 2014 the current study and the companion si study results clearly demonstrated that guayule etc responses will be closely proportional to the amount of total water applied other studies that reported measured etc for guayule in arid climates showed similar maximum etc values to the sdi cumulative etc varying from 1950 to 2050 during the second year bucks et al 1985a d miyamoto et al 1984 however benzioni et al 1989 reported maximum cumulative etc for the second year of guayule was about 1300 mm though the experiment used deficit irrigation for the highest treatment other research found on this subject applied much less total water than in our studies and thus cumulative etc would be much smaller for example rodriquez garcia et al 2002 calculated a maximum annual etc of 690 mm but the combined irrigation plus rainfall was only slightly higher than that amount although the i125 treatment under sdi had obvious deep percolation during some periods in 2014 we would expect the etc of that treatment to be about the twa minus any dp that occurred this would give an estimated cumulative etc during the second year about 17 20 higher than for i100 or about 2300 mm in the two maricopa studies etc rates for the 100 treatments occurred in june and july 2014 during the second year of growth between mid june to the end of july 2014 the etc for the i100 treatment under surface irrigation varied from 9 5 10 8 mm d and averaged 9 9 mm d however for the sdi study the etc was increased during this same period where the rates for the i100 varied from 9 7 12 0 mm d fig 4b and averaged 10 8 mm d differences in etc rates between the si and sdi fully irrigated treatments were considerable in 2014 where the average etc rate for the i100 sdi treatment between early may through the end of august was 9 9 mm d or 1 6 mm d higher daily etc than for the 100 under si the higher etc rate and cumulative etc for sdi than for si under full irrigation is contrary to the often heard theory that sdi may decrease etc for crops due to less evaporation burt et al 2002 however a detailed analysis of crop evapotranspiration under different irrigation methods in california by burt et al 2002 showed that for a wide variety of crops sdi tends to increase etc by 6 10 over etc using surface and sprinkler irrigation methods in the case of guayule in maricopa it is most likely that the higher frequency irrigation under sdi allowed more available soil water use by plants than si since relatively less of the irrigated water is lost to evaporation ayars et al 2015 and colaizzi et al 2004 suggested that higher etc for sdi than under si or other irrigation methods is mainly due to increased transpiration which is also associated with decreased evaporation because guayule is drought tolerant even the extreme and prolonged soil water depletion of 80 that occurred from june to september in 2014 for the driest treatment i25 in the sdi study fig 3b did not further reduce the i25 etc rate during summer relative to the i100 treatment etc rate fig 4b this would not be the case for many annual crops as reported by butt et al 2017 periodic sampling of plant dry biomass indicated that the db for the i100 and i125 treatments were no different than the db of the two highest irrigation levels i120 and i100 under si in maricopa through early february 2014 however db differences dramatically increased starting with samples collected on april 30 2014 where i100 and i125 had db between 1 0 1 4 kg plant versus about 0 8 kg plant for the two highest irrigation levels under si the differences grew larger through the end of 2014 final db from destructive sampling in march 2015 was about 2 5 kg plant for both the sdi i125 and i100 treatments for sdi while notably the db for the i75 was 1 7 kg plant fig 5b these compare to db of 1 4 1 5 kg plant for the high irrigation levels under si after 29 months of growth thus even the less irrigated i75 treatment under sdi produced db greater than the i120 and i100 treatments under surface irrigation the dry biomass of the final bulk harvest made after 29 months of growth was maximum for the i125 treatment 61 2 mg ha this db yield was 2 2 times greater than the maximum db realized in the si study in maricopa also at 29 months a comparison of final db for the i100 treatments in the two maricopa studies shows db for sdi 47 4 mg ha was 1 9 times higher than that with si 24 5 mg ha coffelt and ray 2010 reported dry biomass yields of 21 6 mg ha after 24 months and 29 7 mg ha after 36 months for guayule cultivars grown in maricopa under surface irrigation and a plant population of 27 000 plants ha as used in the present study more recently however at the same plant population abdel haleem et al 2018 grew improved lines of guayule in maricopa using si and achieved an average db of 27 2 mg ha after two years thus dry biomass yield for the i125 and i100 treatments achieved with sdi was substantially greater than all recent guayule si irrigation studies at the same location in maricopa at two locations in australia dissanayake et al 2007 maximum final db for well watered guayule after 32 months was 14 1 20 3 mg ha also for well watered and fertilized treatments in france snoeck et al 2015 reported guayule db after one year averaged 9 0 mg ha however in zacatecas mexico well watered guayule achieved only 15 0 mg ha in dry biomass after 30 months rodriquez garcia et al 2002 because the relationship between db and twa was linear fig 6a and b with no leveling off at the highest twa in the sdi study we submit that possibly higher db could have been realized with increased irrigation applications under sdi this is supported by the trend found for water productivity for dry biomass under sdi that increased rather than decreased with twa unlike wp with surface irrigation hunsaker and elshikha 2017 the water productivity for dry biomass production under the three highest irrigation levels under sdi 1 12 1 25 kg m3 are the highest reported for guayule to date for the companion study in maricopa wp for db for all treatments 0 59 to 0 69 kg m3 were about half that of the i125 treatment under sdi the findings concerning irrigation effects on final rubber contents were generally consistent with previous research which has mainly revealed rubber content increases as irrigation and available soil water decrease peak rubber concentrations occurred at the end of the guayule winter dormancy period i e february and march versus other times of the year and similar trends for rubber with time were reported by others coffelt et al 2009 veatch et al 2005 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 low temperatures during winter months induce biochemical reactions in the guayule plant that stimulate rubber biosynthesis and accumulated rubber content benedict et al 2013 final rubber contents table 4 for the three highest irrigation levels under sdi 5 6 6 6 were slightly lower than those for the three highest irrigation levels under si in maricopa 6 0 6 8 whereas rubber contents were higher at the two lowest irrigation levels under sdi 7 6 and 8 6 than those for si maximum guayule rubber contents found in the literature vary from 4 1 12 0 rasutis et al 2015 however we found that final resin content was generally not related to irrigation level in a consistent manner this result was consistent to data provided by rodriquez garcia et al 2002 however hunsaker and elshikha 2017 found that resin content was generally higher for the three wettest than two driest treatments under surface irrigation though significant differences were only between the two wettest versus the second driest treatment the rubber yield for the i125 treatment 3429 kg ha was 21 higher than the i100 treatment which in turn was only 12 higher than that for the i75 and the difference was not significant table 5 rubber yield was 2080 kg ha for the i50 and not significantly different than that for i75 due to higher percent rubber for the i50 treatment table 5 remarkably the i50 sdi treatment ry was 24 higher than maximum rubber yield in the companion study using si 1680 kg ha for the i120 but the i50 treatment received 57 less twa than that si treatment the i125 using sdi was twice the i120 ry using si even though twa for i125 was only 200 mm more the highest rubber yield for guayule after two years of growth reported in previous literature was 2006 kg ha abdel haleem et al 2018 a vast improvement in the wp for ry compared to previous results was achieved under sdi where values ranged from 0 067 to 0 078 kg m3 table 5 this is especially pertinent for higher irrigation levels which were only 0 036 to 0 037 kg m3 for the two highest irrigation levels under si in maricopa and comparable to the wp for ry at the two highest irrigation levels in the mid 1980s studies in mesa yuma and el paso 0 029 to 0 035 kg m3 similarly resin yield 3600 kg ha and wp of resin yield 0 089 kg m3 when averaged for the three highest irrigation levels under sdi were 56 and 59 greater than those based on the average of the three highest irrigation levels under si in maricopa respectively 5 conclusions a major challenge in commercializing guayule for natural rubber is to improve yield and water productivity under cropped conditions this is particularly true for the irrigated guayule crops that are envisioned for us deserts areas this study was conducted to evaluate guayule responses to water applied by subsurface drip irrigation in the southwestern us the results provide strong evidence that guayule yield and irrigation water productivity can both be vastly improved using subsurface drip instead of surface irrigation both dry biomass and rubber yield were the highest ever reported when guayule was irrigated to maintain soil water depletion less than 35 rubber yield for fully irrigated guayule using subsurface drip irrigation was about double the rubber yield attained by surface irrigation with similar amounts of total water applied we attribute the higher yield to more uniform readily available soil water at the upper soil profile for crop water use resulting in more rapid biomass production rubber content generally decreases with irrigation amount however under subsurface drip irrigation rubber yields are substantially increased with irrigation amount because of the significantly higher dry biomass produced moreover this study suggests that irrigation water use for guayule could be drastically reduced using subsurface drip and still achieve higher rubber yields than guayule grown with surface irrigation to further improve water savings using subsurface drip more efficient establishment irrigation practices need to be developed acknowledgements the authors

11025,guayule is being produced for natural rubber in us desert areas where irrigation requirements are high improved irrigation practices and methods are required to increase guayule yields and reduce its water use presently there is no information available on guayule produced using subsurface drip irrigation sdi therefore we conducted an sdi guayule field study in 2012 2015 in maricopa arizona us the objectives were to evaluate guayule dry biomass db rubber yield ry and crop evapotranspiration etc responses to water application level and to compare these results to previously reported guayule irrigation studies guayule seedlings were transplanted in the field in october 2012 at 0 35 m spacing in 100 m long rows spaced 1 02 m apart the field had 15 8 row wide plots 5 irrigation treatments x 3 replicates irrigation treatments were imposed in a randomized complete block design starting in may 2013 irrigation scheduling was based on the measured soil water depletion percentage swdp of a fully irrigated treatment defined as 100 etc replacement and maintained at 20 35 swdp the other treatments received 25 50 75 and 125 of irrigation applied to the 100 treatment on each day of irrigation destructive samples for dry biomass rubber and resin contents were periodically taken from each plot between february and november of each year until the guayule was bulk harvested in march 2015 results indicated etc db and ry increased with total water applied irrigation rain which varied between treatments from 2080 to 4900 mm for the 29 month growing season final dry biomass and rubber yields of 61 2 mg ha and 3430 kg ha respectively were achieved with the highest irrigation treatment level 125 and these yields were significantly higher than those under all other irrigation levels all sdi irrigation treatments except for the lowest 25 level had rubber yields from 24 to 200 greater than the maximum ry achieved under a companion surface irrigation study

hardwood shrub native to northern mexico and the southwestern us deserts whose stem branches and roots produce high quality natural rubber nr rasutis et al 2015 it is presently being targeted in the us and other countries as a major source of nr to supplement limited hevea hevea brasiliensis imported rubber grown primarily in southeastern asia soratana et al 2017 current pressures on nr supplies include rising nr demand from developing countries and potential hevea plantation destruction due to rising incidents of plant disease eranki et al 2017 sfeir et al 2014 inspired by us tire companies there is renewed interest in expanding guayule production in the southwestern us desert a recent usa today news article reported that general motors and four of the world s largest tire manufacturers are committed to using sustainable nr for all its tires in the future evanoff 2018 this commitment includes a major focus on utilizing guayule as the cornerstone crop and generating a domestic nr industry in the us the need to achieve high yield productivity with efficient irrigation water use is one of several major obstacles impeding the guayule industry guayule shrubs are considered drought tolerant surviving on little or no rainfall for long periods of time foster and coffelt 2005 the national academy of sciences national academy of science nas 1977 recommended that the total water application twa i e irrigation water plus rainfall be limited to 640 mm in desert areas increased knowledge on irrigation water use and yield response for guayule was expanded in the mid 1980s the research included three guayule irrigation studies conducted in mesa and yuma arizona bucks et al 1985a 1985b 1985c bucks et al 1985d and in el paso texas miyamoto et al 1984 miyamoto and bucks 1985 at these locations where the average yearly rainfall is less than 190 mm year the guayule was grown for two years and then harvested they reported that maximum dry biomass db and maximum rubber yield ry were attained for fully irrigated treatments whose measured cumulative crop evapotranspiration etc during the second year of growth was 2050 1950 and 1830 in mesa yuma and el paso respectively maximum db and ry for the three field studies were approximately 22 0 mg ha and 1200 kg ha respectively for the arizona sites and 12 7 mg ha and 840 kg ha respectively for the texas site these yields were obtained with about 2000 2200 mm year of twa for the arizona studies and with 1600 mm year of twa for the texas study a literature search revealed a few more recent studies regarding guayule yield response to measured water applied have been conducted since the mid 1980s the relevant papers include guayule research in the negev desert of israel benzioni et al 1989 and studies in more humid and cooler climates than us deserts such as zacatecas mexico rodriquez garcia et al 2002 queensland australia dissanayake et al 2007 northern texas foster et al 2011 and southern france and southern spain sfeir et al 2014 snoeck et al 2015 in all these more recent studies the twa reported were 900 mm year or less and rubber yields were substantially lower than those in the mid 1980s arizona deserts bucks et al 1985a and 1985b except in the negev desert where ry was 1060 kg ha sfeir et al 2014 however estimated after one year of study that a ry of about 1400 kg ha could be achieved in southern spain with 900 mm year the guayule studies cited above indicate that high yields of rubber can only be achieved with high levels of irrigation they also showed that guayule biomass production increases directly with increased etc and irrigation but that percentage of rubber in the plant tends to decrease at higher irrigation levels in october 2012 we initiated field research to augment existing guayule irrigation information focusing on a new guayule cultivar yulex b sanchez et al 2014 grown under the recommended plant population of 27 000 plants ha ray et al 1999 we conducted one irrigation study using surface irrigation si grown for 29 months 2012 2015 in maricopa arizona which evaluated guayule response under five levels of irrigation water application results from that study showed that maximum db and ry were about 30 higher than those in the mid 1980s arizona studies hunsaker and elshikha 2017 however results from maricopa also indicated that the water productivity wp for dry biomass and rubber yield expressed as the ratio of final db and ry to twa respectively increased significantly when the twa level was reduced from the maximum yield twa level thus under surface irrigation guayule rubber yield gains became increasingly smaller as total water applied increased subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a system used for row crops and trees which applies water below the soil surface lamm et al 2012 researchers have reported that sdi compared to other irrigation methods has the potential to increase crop quality and yields reduce irrigation water use and reduce agronomic costs ayars et al 2015 colaizzi et al 2004 some of the primary crop production advantages attributed to sdi include more frequent precise and spatially uniform water and fertilizer applications ability to maintain soil water content and soil temperatures at stable levels over the season and reduced irrigation water losses such as soil evaporation ayars et al 2015 colaizzi et al 2004 lamm et al 2012 reported that sdi can increase and stabilize crop yield compared to sprinkler when deficit irrigation is practiced due to limited water resources however there is very limited information on the use of sdi for guayule production and virtually no literature that compares guayule responses with sdi to other irrigation systems therefore during 2012 2015 we conducted a sdi guayule study on a nearby field in maricopa simultaneously with the si study a similar range of irrigation levels were also imposed under sdi the objectives of this paper are to evaluate guayule biomass rubber yield and etc responses to irrigation water application amounts and soil water status with sdi and to compare yield and water productivity of guayule under sdi with the companion study results and those in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details irrigation system and plant establishment a guayule subsurface drip irrigation field study was conducted from october 2012 planting through march 2015 final harvest within a 1 4 ha field site at the university of arizona maricopa agricultural center mac in maricopa arizona located in the northeastern sonoran desert of the usa the field site soil is mapped as a casa grande series fine loamy mixed superactive hyperthermic typic natrargids post et al 1988 having sandy loam and sandy clay loam textures daily meteorological data including rainfall were provided by the arizona meteorological network azmet brown 1989 weather station at mac located less than 100 m from the field site the azmet station also provided daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto calculated by the asce standardized penman monteith equation allen et al 2005 the field site at mac located in the northeastern sonoran desert is characterized by high evaporation rates and low precipitation where historical annual average eto and rainfall 1990 2014 recorded by azmet are 1880 and 169 mm year respectively typical maximum temperatures in june to august are 40 c and above the winter months of december and january can be cold where minimum temperatures often fall below 0 c details of climatic data during the 29 month study are provided in fig 1 a b c and d bi weekly averaged climate data for 2012 2013 fig 1a and b and 2014 2015 fig 1c and d show that months from january to april were cooler and more humid in 2013 than 2014 climate data including eto and rainfall for the two years were similar from may to early july however during mid july to august in 2014 fig 1c and d higher rates of rainfall and generally lower temperatures less solar radiation and lower eto rates occurred than during the same period in 2013 during the september through december period 2013 had generally higher temperatures lower relative humidity less frequent rainfall and higher eto rates than during that period in 2014 cumulative rainfall for the 2013 and 2014 years was 194 and 207 mm respectively while cumulative eto was 1878 mm and 1855 mm respectively both representing typical weather conditions in the central arizona desert prior to planting 120 raised beds were formed every 1 02 m along a length of 100 m a 15 station sdi system was then installed in the field during august 2012 the sdi system was designed to provide metered water and fertilizer applications to 15 individual plots each plot being eight plant beds wide for a plot size 7 14 m by 100 m the irrigation flow rate and totalized flow volume for each plot were monitored with flow meters and pressure heads were monitored using a pressure gauge placed above the irrigation entry point of each plot beneath each plant bed drip tape 22 mm in diameter and 13 mils 0 325 mm in thickness was buried to a depth of 0 20 m emitters along the tape were spaced every 0 51 m the system applied water at a rate of 0 91 l hr per emitter at a pressure of 100 kpa in late october of 2012 95 day old greenhouse grown yulex b line guayule seedlings sanchez et al 2014 were transplanted in the raised beds using a 2 row rotary vegetable planter pulled behind a farm tractor the planter was calibrated to place one 100 mm tall seedling every 0 36 m along the beds giving an initial transplant population of 27 000 plants ha following transplanting the guayule plants were established by applying alternate row furrow irrigation five times between october 26 and november 20 2012 establishment irrigations were managed by the mac irrigation supervisor who estimated a total of 629 mm of water was applied to the field during 2012 prior to imposing irrigation treatments on may 21 2013 the mac irrigator applied additional furrow irrigations to all plots on february 28 122 mm and may 14 2013 100 mm also sdi was applied four times to all plots between april 10 and may 5 total averaged 35 mm 2 2 experimental design soil water content measurements irrigation scheduling and fertilizer applications the experimental design was a randomized complete block consisting of five irrigation treatments replicated in three blocks neutron access tubes were installed in all 15 plots in late april 2013 using a tractor mounted soil sampler five 2 1 m long metal access tubes were installed vertically in the soil along the length of each of the 15 plots at distances of 10 30 50 70 and 90 m from the irrigation inlet 75 tubes total the access tubes were placed in the middle row viz row 4 in each 8 row plot field calibrated neutron moisture meters were used to measure volumetric soil water contents θv from 0 10 to 1 9 m below the surface in 0 20 m increments measurements of θv were begun on may 9 2013 and continued through march 13 2015 from may through early november when guayule growth was active θv measurements were made every 7 14 days at all 75 tube locations exceptions occurred during october 2013 when θv was measured only once in plots and between late april and mid may 2014 when time between measurements was 20 days from mid november through march when guayule growth was slow θv was measured about every three weeks at all tube locations during installation of the access tubes soil samples from 0 to 1 8 m were collected in 0 3 m increments at all locations the soil samples were immediately analyzed in the laboratory to determine the upper field capacity fc and lower permanent wilting point pwp volumetric soil water contents the fc and pwp soil water contents were determined at the 0 33 kpa and 1500 kpa soil matric potentials respectively using pressure membrane extractors the soil samples were also analyzed for soil particle size fraction soil texture using the bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 differential irrigation amounts to treatments using sdi were initiated on may 21 2013 seven months after planting one irrigation treatment designated as i100 served as a control treatment whose irrigation scheduling was intended to provide ample and uniform available soil water asw within the crop root zone depth zr the principle used for scheduling the i100 treatment was to provide irrigation to maintain asw within an effective zr of 1 8 m between 65 80 of total available water taw defined as the total amount of water the soil can store between fc and pwp over the crop root zone depth martin and gilley 1993 thus soil water depletion percentage swdp as calculated by eq 1 was to be maintained at 20 35 1 swdp 1 asw taw 100 where asw and taw are in mm and swdp is in percent the 1 8 m depth used for zr was based on the extent of measurable guayule soil water extraction determined by bucks et al 1985a the scheduling principle was relaxed from late november through the end of the guayule winter dormancy period in late february when irrigation was not provided for the i100 treatment a separate daily soil water balance model was made for each plot replicate the soil parameter calculations use eq 1 and the following equations eqs 2 to 5 the soil water balance models were initiated on may 9 2013 with the first set of θv measurements and then repeatedly updated after each new set of soil water content measurements was made the daily soil water balance models for the i100 treatment were also updated with measured irrigation and rainfall amounts and daily eto provided by the azmet station the measured θv were first averaged at each measurement depth for the five tube locations within each replicate and then converted to soil water storage sws over the zr of 1 8 m 2 sw s m i 1 i 0 2 θ v i where swsm is the measured soil water storage over zr in mm θv i are the volumetric soil water contents measured every 0 2 m from 0 1 m to 1 7 m j 8 the taw for each replicate was determined using the lab analyses of fc and wp as averaged by depth for each replicate the amount of soil water storage sws at field capacity over zr was calculated by eq 3 using the replicate average fc data determined at each sampling depth 3 s w s f c i 1 j θ f c i d i x 10 where swsfc is soil water storage at field capacity over the 1 8 m crop root zone depth in mm θfc i are the field capacity soil water contents determined at each 0 3 m sample depth j 6 similarly the sws at pwp swspwp over zr was calculated using eq 3 by replacing θfc i with the replicate average θpwp i for each di thus taw over zr for each treatment replicate was computed as the difference between swsfc and swspwp the available soil water over zr martin and gilley 1983 was calculated as 4 asw swsm swspwp and the soil water depletion swd was calculated as 5 swd swsfc swsm where all units for eqs 4 and 5 are in mm four other irrigation treatments in the study were governed by the i100 irrigation dates and application amounts the four treatments were designated as i25 i50 i75 i125 and received 25 50 75 and 125 of the irrigation amount applied to the i100 at each irrigation respectively prior to initiating irrigation treatments on may 21 2013 urea ammonium nitrate uan was injected during irrigation by sdi on april 19 2013 to uniformly apply 32 kg n ha to all plots a second application of uan 32 kg n ha was given to all plots during treatment irrigations on 10 july 2013 a third and final uan application of 64 kg n ha was applied to all plots during irrigations in march 2014 soil tests for p and k indicated adequate levels so no p or k fertilizer was applied 2 3 crop evapotranspiration for treatments in this section methods are presented for the estimation of the actual etc that occurred for irrigation treatments where etc was calculated separately at each of the five access tube locations within a treatment plot replicate these etc calculations were begun on may 17 2013 following a final flood irrigation to all plots on may 14 the etc was determined as the residual of the soil water balance equation jensen et al 1990 shown in eq 6 over time periods between two consecutive soil water content measurement dates 6 etc swd2 swd1 iw r dp where etc is the total evapotranspiration mm between two consecutive water measurement dates swd1 and swd2 are the measured root zone soil water depletion mm on first and second dates respectively and iw r and dp are the measured irrigation water mm measured rainfall mm and the estimated deep percolation mm that occurred during the time period between the two soil water measurements respectively for eq 6 swd was calculated over a zr of 1 8 m by eqs 2 3 and 5 using the lab analyzed field capacity values determined for each tube location measurement of dp was not made however thorough evaluation of the measured swd with time indicated an assumption of negligible dp was valid for all locations within i25 i50 and i75 treatments evaluation of the measured swd for the i125 treatment plots indicated significant dp was certain particularly during the 2014 and therefore etc calculations were omitted for the i125 treatment examination of swd for i100 plots suggested dp likely occurred at some tube locations during a period in early july 2014 when measured swd approached values near zero i e field capacity after a 29 mm rain occurred on july 3 one day after full irrigation had been applied consequently an estimated dp of about one half the rain amount 15 mm was uniformly applied to all i100 plots in the soil water balance calculation of etc for the period from july 3 to july 10 2014 2 4 plant growth and destructive sampling guayule canopy height and canopy cover measurements commenced in april 2013 measurements were made for three to six plants in each plot every 25 days from april to november 2013 every 36 days from february to september 2014 and on march 16 2015 three to six destructive whole plant samples were harvested by hand for each plot three times between july and november 2013 and four times between february and september 2014 a final destructive hand harvest of five whole plants was made on march 16 2015 just before a final bulk harvest was made during destructive harvests the plants were extracted from the soil to a depth of 0 1 m below the soil surface all plant measurements and plant harvests were limited to the three inner rows rows 3 4 and 5 of each 8 row plot to minimize the influence on plant growth due to irrigation from adjacent treatment plots fresh biomass weights obtained from whole plant harvests were immediately measured and then dried in open greenhouses for 2 4 weeks each biomass sample was periodically weighed until there was no significant change in dry weight mohammadi shad and antungulu 2019 after drying the plants in each plot were chopped and ground with a chipper shredder the samples were analyzed for resin and rubber by the university of arizona plant science department in tucson arizona resin and rubber concentrations were determined through a sequential extraction protocol that closely followed the methods recommended by cornish et al 2013 2 5 final harvest final bulk harvest occurred on march 17 and 18 2015 when entire 100 m lengths of two plant rows rows 4 and 5 were bulk harvested for each of the 15 plots the equipment used was a modified potato digger harvester that pulled the two rows of plants including main roots up to the surface the trailer load for each plot harvest was then immediately weighed on a large truck scale on the mac farm the content of moisture in the fresh weights of the bulk final harvests and the rubber and resin contents were determined from the mean values obtained from the destructive samples within each plot taken during hand harvests on march 16 2015 the dry biomass db in kg ha was multiplied by the rubber and resin contents to obtain final rubber and resin yields ray et al 2005 respectively the wp of the total water applied was calculated as the ratio between yield and twa kg m3 using the dry biomass and rubber and resin yield data obtained from final bulk harvest 2 6 statistical analyses irrigation treatment effects for measured total water applied plant height db rubber and resin contents final yields water productivity and cumulative etc were analyzed statistically using a randomized complete block model within the proc mixed procedures of sas sas institute inc 2009 the proc mixed estimation method used the residual maximum likelihood reml option block and block x irrigation treatment were considered random effects while irrigation treatment was the fixed effect with four degrees of freedom the error term had eight degrees of freedom the covtest option in proc mixed was used to test the block and interaction effects treatment means were separated using the pdiff least significance difference lsd at p 0 05 option 3 results 3 1 irrigation fig 2 shows the irrigation totals for treatments by year including the 629 mm estimated for plant establishment irrigations in oct nov 2012 monthly and yearly irrigation amounts for treatments and rain data are summarized in table 1 the yearly total for irrigation water applied to the i100 treatment in 2013 averaged 1215 33 mm which included furrow applied irrigations of 122 mm late feb and 100 mm early may also equally applied to the four other treatments because differential irrigation to treatments did not start until may 21 2013 yearly total irrigation applied to the i125 treatment in 2013 1418 mm table 1 was only 17 greater than that for the i100 while the i75 i50 and i25 received about 72 58 and 42 of that applied to the i100 yearly total irrigation to the i100 averaged 1848 mm in 2014 while the 2014 yearly irrigation amounts to other treatments were generally commensurate with treatment target rates the total yearly irrigation applied to the i125 was 24 greater than for the i100 while the i75 i50 and i25 treatments total irrigation were 68 47 and 25 less respectively the lower than intended irrigation for the i75 treatment which was only 68 of that for the i100 in 2014 was affected by greater variability in irrigation amounts among replicates then for other treatments e g the greater standard deviation sd for i75 in table 1 and fig 1 one replicate in the i75 was consistently less than the target irrigation rate by about 10 throughout the study thus lowering the average intended for the treatment i75 only one irrigation was applied to treatments in 2015 feb compared to the amount applied to the i100 in 2015 other treatments were somewhat less than intended amount except for the i25 treatment table 1 considering the entire 29 month guayule growing period between planting oct 2012 and final harvest march 2015 total irrigation water applied to the i100 was 3791 mm and the total water applied including the 452 mm of rain for the period was 4243 mm table 1 relative to the twa for the i100 over the entire growing period twa was 16 greater for the i125 while twa for the i75 i50 and i25 were 77 63 and 49 of the i100 twa statistical analyses indicated twa was significantly different between all irrigation treatments derivation of the twa at an annual basis i e considering the entire 29 month growing period gave an annual twa for treatments of 2032 1756 1354 1112 and 861 mm year for the i125 i100 i75 i50 and i25 3 2 soil water properties and soil water depletion irrigation treatment averages for soil texture fraction field capacity permanent wilting point and soil water holding capacity were not appreciably different table 2 sand fraction for a 1 8 m soil depth varied from 59 to 63 silt fraction from 12 to 15 and clay fraction from 23 to 26 the soil water contents determined for fc and pwp were notably uniform for treatments varying from 26 to 28 for fc and from 14 to 15 for pwp average soil water holding capacity was highest for the i50 treatment 130 mm m and lowest for the i25 treatment 122 mm m there was also comparable within treatment variability in soil water holding capacities for treatments as indicated by a range in the sd of 14 19 mm m for the treatments table 2 measured soil water depletion for treatments with time are shown from may 17 2013 through dec 17 2013 fig 3 a and from jan 30 2014 through march 12 2015 fig 3b following a flood irrigation to plots on may 14 2013 all treatments were near field capacity 5 to 6 swdp for measurements made three days later fig 3a the swdp for treatments then increased during the remainder of may through mid june initiation of irrigation treatments on may 21 2013 led to higher swdp for the less irrigated treatments i50 and i25 than the three higher irrigated treatments i75 i100 and i125 starting in early june as the differences in irrigation water applications accumulated swdp for the i75 increased relative to i100 beginning in late june and decreased for i125 relative to i100 beginning in early july 2013 differences in swdp between the i50 and i25 treatments also became evident in early july the trends for treatment separation in swdp remained relatively stable throughout the irrigation cycle of 2013 that ended in early november soil water depletion for the i100 treatment which had been maintained less than 32 through late september increased to 41 in late october and then increased to 47 at the end of 2013 about six weeks after irrigation had been terminated during the irrigation period of 2013 may 17 to november 11 the measured swdp for the i100 varied from 6 to 42 and averaged 25 for all measurements in that period during the same irrigation period the swdp for the i125 treatment varied from 6 to 30 and averaged 20 the average swdp for the i75 i50 and i25 treatments in 2013 may to nov was 37 44 and 51 respectively with a maximum swdp of 60 66 and 73 occurring on november 11 prior to subsequent rain in late november that reduced the soil water depletion for those treatments before resuming irrigation in early february 2014 swdp varied between 42 and 64 for irrigation treatments in late january fig 3b this was followed by decreased swdp for all treatments through march 13 2014 where the average i100 and i125 values were 19 and 11 respectively the subsequent swdp values for i100 then gradually increased to 30 on april 23 however swdp for i100 then increased to 44 on may 13 2014 which was above the target range i e 20 35 the increased swdp for the i100 indicated that the estimated crop evapotranspiration used to project irrigation amounts had underestimated actual the etc during the late april early may timeframe coinciding with a 20 day period between soil water content measurements the swdp for the i125 i75 i50 and i25 treatments on may 13 2014 was 37 61 72 and 82 respectively fig 3b as for the i100 treatment swdp for other treatments on may 13 was near to or above the maximum depletion measured for each treatment through the end of 2014 measurement december 8 the lowest measured swdp for the i100 in 2014 was 10 and occurred on july 10 fig 3b the lowest soil water depletion coincided with significant rain events following irrigation just prior to july 10 water content measurements after august 6 2014 swdp for the i100 treatment was maintained between about 19 36 until irrigation termination for the period of irrigation in 2014 measurement early feb to early nov the average swdp for the i100 was 27 slightly higher than during irrigation period in 2013 between early june through mid november 2014 measured swdp on many dates were in the range of 5 to 5 for the more heavily irrigated i125 treatment indicating deep percolation occurred in these plots during the irrigation period of 2014 the average swdp for the i125 i75 i50 and i25 was 12 54 66 and 78 respectively which was slightly lower than in 2013 for the i125 but much higher in 2014 than 2013 for the three drier treatments as rainfall between late november 2014 through mid february 2015 was light soil water depletion increased for treatments during that period until reduced following irrigation applied for five days in late february 2015 the swdp measured during the short irrigation period of 2015 late feb through march 12 2015 varied from 27 i125 to 79 i25 for treatments fig 3b 3 3 guayule crop evapotranspiration etc crop evapotranspiration rates are shown for irrigation treatments from may to december in 2013 fig 4 a and from january 2014 to march 2015 fig 4b as mentioned in section 2 3 etc data were not calculated for the i125 treatment due to uncertainty of the dp quantity in that treatment s soil water balance seasonal variation in etc was apparent for all treatments but varied more for the i100 treatment where the etc extremes were less than 1 0 mm d during winter months late december through january and as high as 12 0 mm d during a mid june period in 2014 during 2013 etc rates for the i100 were at a yearly maximum of about 9 0 mm d during late june to mid july declined to about 7 0 mm d during late july through august and then progressively declined from 7 0 mm d to 2 0 mm day between mid september to late december fig 4a noticeably higher etc rates for i100 than i75 occurred in early june about two weeks after initiation of irrigation treatments it was evident that the higher application of irrigation for the i100 treatment corresponded to increased etc rates over the i175 during the remainder of the irrigation period early november 2013 though the treatment etc rates converged by january 2014 similarly a clear separation in etc rates between the i75 and i50 and those between the i50 and the i25 began by mid june 2013 and separation remained through late october fig 4a resumption of irrigation treatments in early february 2014 resulted in treatment separation for etc in late february i100 and in early march for i75 vs i50 as well as for i50 vs i25 fig 4b during 2014 etc rates for the i100 varied from 9 7 12 0 mm d between late may through the end of july declined to 8 4 9 0 mm d during august and then steadily declined from 9 0 1 4 mm d between early september and late november 2014 all treatments experienced a decline in etc rates during august in both 2013 and 2014 from the higher etc rates that occurred during june and july the reduction in august guayule etc rates corresponded to reduced eto during the august monsoon season where average eto for august was 6 8 and 6 6 mm d in 2013 and 2014 respectively compared to eto for june 9 3 and 8 7 mm d and july 7 8 and 7 9 mm d respectively similarly average eto declined monthly from 5 4 and 5 5 mm d in september 2013 and 2014 respectively to 1 8 and 1 5 mm d in december the yearly average cumulative etc for the i100 was 1159 mm for 2013 where the periodic etc water balance were summed for all periodic etc determinations from may 17 to december 18 in 2013 table 3 obviously more etc occurred during the 6 5 months between october 26 2012 planting and the first soil water content measurements on may 17 but this etc was not determined by a soil water balance for 2014 average cumulative etc for the i100 treatment summed from dec 19 2013 to dec 9 2014 was 2057 mm a short final period of average cumulative etc for i100 was 109 mm determined between dec 10 2014 and march 12 2015 just prior to final harvest thus total cumulative etc for the 22 month period of soil water balance measurement averaged 3325 mm for the i100 treatment statistical analyses of the data in table 3 indicated all treatment means for cumulative etc were significantly different from one another whether yearly or total for the 22 month period of etc measurement total cumulative etc for the three treatments i75 i50 and i25 were 73 56 and 38 respectively of that for the i100 these treatment differences in total etc reflect a linear response to the twa during the same 22 month period where the twa for the i100 was 3273 mm while the i75 i50 and i25 were 70 53 and 34 of that for the i100 respectively prorated on an annual basis considering the 22 month period of etc measurement gave an annual etc of 1820 1390 1060 and 680 mm year for the i100 i75 i50 and i25 treatments respectively 3 4 guayule growth measures and rubber and resin contents fig 5 a and b illustrate the development of guayule plants over the course of the study measured plant height averages for treatments fig 5a increased from 0 3 m in late april 2013 to 0 63 to 0 66 m for the two wettest irrigation treatments i100 and i125 respectively by the end of july 2013 for the same period plant heights increased to 0 59 0 55 and 0 50 m for the i75 i50 and i25 treatments respectively however plant height measurements through mid november 2013 revealed only slight changes in height occurred during the remainder of 2013 for the i125 0 03 m i50 0 03 m and the i25 0 015 m treatments during the same period plant height increased at a higher rate for the i75 0 04 m and even greater rate for the i100 0 07 m plant height averages on november 15 2013 were not significantly different p 0 05 between the three wettest treatments i75 i100 and i125 while heights for these three treatments were significantly greater than those for i50 and i25 though i50 was significantly greater than for i25 during 2014 plant heights increased rapidly for the two wettest treatments beginning in late march 2014 fig 5a and the heights were not significantly different between i100 and i125 throughout 2014 and on the final measurement made on march 16 2015 for most measurements made in 2014 plant height was significantly greater for the two wettest treatments than for the i75 treatment which in turn had significantly greater height than the two driest treatments i50 and i25 while height was also greater for i50 than i25 from late april 2014 through the final plant measurement in 2015 on march 16 2015 plant height averaged 0 96 m 0 94 m 0 88 m 0 80 m and 0 65 m for i125 i100 i75 i50 and i25 respectively there were significant treatment effects for guayule dry biomass db for all destructive plant sampling dates which began on july 30 2013 fig 5b for the first two sampling dates in 2013 treatment mean comparison tests revealed significant differences between the i125 treatment and the drier i75 i50 and i25 means with no difference detected between the i125 and the i100 db at mid november 2013 the dry biomass for i125 was 0 76 kg plant compared with a db of 0 65 kg plant for the i100 treatment although the difference was not significant however both i125 and i100 had significantly greater db than the i75 whose db was also significantly greater than the db for the i50 and i25 treatments in november 2013 a similar trend in treatment differences occurred for the first db sampling date in 2014 on january 30 however for samples taken on april 30 and june 30 2014 db increased at a higher rate for the i125 than i100 and mean db was significantly different between the two treatments on june 30 2014 the db for the i125 was just over 2 0 kg plant versus 1 59 kg plant for the i100 however towards the end of 2014 and through the march 16 2015 sample the i100 db appeared to have caught up to that in the i125 treatment and differences were not statistically significant for samples made in 2014 through march 2015 the general trend was greater db for i100 than the i75 and greater biomass for i75 than both the i50 and the i25 though the i50 had higher mean db than that for the i25 during this same period significant differences between the two only occurred on the october 22 2014 date on march 16 2015 treatment db determined from the destructive made just before final bulk harvest was 2 54 2 45 1 72 1 04 and 0 69 kg plant for the i125 i100 i75 i50 and i25 respectively rubber and resin contents are shown for treatments in table 4 a general trend for all treatments was to increase the rubber content of plants with time starting at low initial values of 1 2 2 1 in late july 2013 to 4 6 to 5 4 on january 30 2014 after january 2014 subsequent treatment rubber contents gradually decreased through the remaining sample dates in 2014 to 3 2 4 3 table 4 however by late winter of 2015 i e march 16 2015 rubber content for each treatment had increased to their maximum 5 6 8 6 significant treatment differences for rubber contents occurred during all three sample dates of 2013 where the driest treatment i25 had higher rubber than the two wettest treatments i125 and i100 though there were no differences in average rubber content between i25 versus the i50 and i75 except on july 30 2013 during 2014 there were no treatment differences in rubber content until late october however at the final sampling on march 16 2015 significantly higher rubber content was attained for the i25 and i50 than for all three wetter treatments treatment trends for resin content with time were different than for rubber content table 4 where resin content generally decreased from july 2013 to november 2013 highest resin content in 2014 occurred in july for the i100 i75 and i50 treatments however it was in october 2014 for the i125 and i25 treatments on march 16 2015 resin content for the i100 and i75 was at the maximum for the study 7 9 and 8 6 respectively while i125 i50 and i25 had significantly lower resin content on that last sampling date 3 5 final yields and water productivity means for the final bulk harvested dry biomass after 29 months of growth were significantly different among all treatments with a near four fold increase in mean db from i25 to i125 table 5 final yield of all 15 plots for db for was highly linear with twa having a regression coefficient of determination r2 of 0 90 fig 6 a the i125 treatment achieved the maximum db in the study with a mean of 61 2 mg ha this was 29 greater than the mean db for the i100 and was achieved with only 16 more twa than that for i100 final mean db for the three drier treatments i75 i50 and i25 was 81 57 and 34 the db attained for the for i100 respectively water productivity for dry biomass averaged i125 1 25 mg m3 and the mean was significantly greater than that for both i50 and i25 while the mean wp for the i100 and i75 and i50 treatments were each significantly greater than for i25 table 5 a maximum rubber yield ry of 3429 kg ha for the i125 treatment was significantly greater than the ry for all other treatments and was two and a half times greater than for the i25 treatment table 5 the i125 ry was 21 greater than the ry for i100 and the increased rubber yield for i125 was slightly greater than the 16 increase in twa for i125 over i100 the 11 higher ry for the i100 over the i75 was not significant and the increase in ry was much less than the 23 increase in twa for i100 over i75 similarly an 18 increase in ry for the i75 over the i50 could not be excepted as significant however all treatments were found to have significantly greater ry than the i25 treatment regression of rubber yield data for all 15 plots fig 6b also reveals an overall linear relationship with twa while wp for ry was highest in the i50 and i75 treatments statistical differences in mean wp for treatments did not occur table 5 mean resin yields from 3300 to 3780 kg ha were achieved by the i75 i100 and i125 treatments and differences between the treatment means for these three treatments were not significant table 5 also all three treatments had significantly greater resin yield than the i50 and i25 while i50 resin yield was significantly greater than for i25 the water productivity of resin yield was highest for the i75 treatment but not enough to be significantly greater than either i100 and i125 4 discussion the estimated 629 mm of irrigation water applied using furrow irrigation for guayule transplant establishment represented a significant portion of the total irrigation water applied to treatments during the sdi study however guayule transplants in the us southwest desert were more efficiently established using sprinkler irrigation where only 380 mm of irrigation was applied for establishment in yuma arizona bucks et al 1985d guayule growers using sdi should consider the deployment of portable sprinkler systems to reduce irrigation water use for plant establishment on an annual basis twa for the i100 and the i125 treatments in the sdi study were 1760 and 2030 mm year respectively somewhat less than the 2000 2220 mm annual twa for the wetter treatments in the previous 1980s studies in arizona bucks et al 1985a d annual twa for the i75 i50 and i25 in the sdi study were 1350 1110 and 860 mm yr for the companion study conducted simultaneously in maricopa using surface irrigation hunsaker and elshikha 2017 annual twa for five similar irrigation treatments i e i120 i100 i80 i60 and i40 were 1950 1770 1460 1210 and 980 mm year respectively considering guayule research conducted outside the us deserts in which irrigation and rainfall were measured a maximum amount of 900 mm year of total water was applied in mediterranean studies sfeir et al 2014 snoeck et al 2015 and in israel benzioni et al 1989 these amounts of twa were comparable to our lowest twa in the sdi study i25 the i25 treatment attained db and ry of 15 7 mg ha and 1350 kg ha respectively which are similar values reported by sfeir et al 2014 for guayule grown for two years in spain even less twa 600 700 mm year was provided in studies in australia dissanayake et al 2007 northern texas foster et al 2011 and mexico rodriquez garcia et al 2002 in the latter three studies rubber yields reported after two years of growth were on the order of 600 700 kg ha regarding irrigation scheduling and soil water depletion the average measured swdp for the sdi i100 treatment during irrigation periods was 27 for the i100 treatment the target swdp 20 35 was both somewhat exceeded and somewhat reduced on several measurement dates but overall the fluctuations in swdp were small in comparison to those usually encountered under surface irrigation si methods in the companion study in maricopa with si the measured swdp for the i100 treatment went from 12 measured shortly after irrigation to as high as 69 just prior to irrigation overall the measured swdp for the 100 si treatment in maricopa averaged 46 over irrigation periods hunsaker and elshikha 2017 bucks et al 1985a did not provide detailed swdp data for the si treatments in mesa but did report that the depletion measured prior to irrigation for their wettest treatment averaged about 72 for the two years of study benzioni et al 1989 reported that guayule plants showed signs of visible wilting and had increased plant temperatures beginning at 60 swdp in the negev desert of israel a study by veatch blohm et al 2006 in tucson arizona found a 50 reduction in rubber yield when soil water depletion was increased to 75 before irrigating the ability to apply frequent but light irrigation amounts using sdi allowed uniformly high available soil water for guayule throughout the irrigation season for the three wettest treatments in maricopa because higher irrigation was applied to the i125 than i100 treatment in the sdi study the average measured swdp for the i125 over irrigation periods for the three years was only 16 for the sdi irrigation periods average swdp for the i75 and i50 treatments were 47 and 57 respectively during the second year 2014 of the sdi study the annual etc was 2050 mm for the i100 treatment this result shows that cumulative etc increased about 12 using sdi over the 2014 annual etc of 1830 mm for the i100 treatment under surface irrigation in maricopa hunsaker and elshikha 2017 this was close to the 9 0 higher twa for sdi than the si in 2014 the current study and the companion si study results clearly demonstrated that guayule etc responses will be closely proportional to the amount of total water applied other studies that reported measured etc for guayule in arid climates showed similar maximum etc values to the sdi cumulative etc varying from 1950 to 2050 during the second year bucks et al 1985a d miyamoto et al 1984 however benzioni et al 1989 reported maximum cumulative etc for the second year of guayule was about 1300 mm though the experiment used deficit irrigation for the highest treatment other research found on this subject applied much less total water than in our studies and thus cumulative etc would be much smaller for example rodriquez garcia et al 2002 calculated a maximum annual etc of 690 mm but the combined irrigation plus rainfall was only slightly higher than that amount although the i125 treatment under sdi had obvious deep percolation during some periods in 2014 we would expect the etc of that treatment to be about the twa minus any dp that occurred this would give an estimated cumulative etc during the second year about 17 20 higher than for i100 or about 2300 mm in the two maricopa studies etc rates for the 100 treatments occurred in june and july 2014 during the second year of growth between mid june to the end of july 2014 the etc for the i100 treatment under surface irrigation varied from 9 5 10 8 mm d and averaged 9 9 mm d however for the sdi study the etc was increased during this same period where the rates for the i100 varied from 9 7 12 0 mm d fig 4b and averaged 10 8 mm d differences in etc rates between the si and sdi fully irrigated treatments were considerable in 2014 where the average etc rate for the i100 sdi treatment between early may through the end of august was 9 9 mm d or 1 6 mm d higher daily etc than for the 100 under si the higher etc rate and cumulative etc for sdi than for si under full irrigation is contrary to the often heard theory that sdi may decrease etc for crops due to less evaporation burt et al 2002 however a detailed analysis of crop evapotranspiration under different irrigation methods in california by burt et al 2002 showed that for a wide variety of crops sdi tends to increase etc by 6 10 over etc using surface and sprinkler irrigation methods in the case of guayule in maricopa it is most likely that the higher frequency irrigation under sdi allowed more available soil water use by plants than si since relatively less of the irrigated water is lost to evaporation ayars et al 2015 and colaizzi et al 2004 suggested that higher etc for sdi than under si or other irrigation methods is mainly due to increased transpiration which is also associated with decreased evaporation because guayule is drought tolerant even the extreme and prolonged soil water depletion of 80 that occurred from june to september in 2014 for the driest treatment i25 in the sdi study fig 3b did not further reduce the i25 etc rate during summer relative to the i100 treatment etc rate fig 4b this would not be the case for many annual crops as reported by butt et al 2017 periodic sampling of plant dry biomass indicated that the db for the i100 and i125 treatments were no different than the db of the two highest irrigation levels i120 and i100 under si in maricopa through early february 2014 however db differences dramatically increased starting with samples collected on april 30 2014 where i100 and i125 had db between 1 0 1 4 kg plant versus about 0 8 kg plant for the two highest irrigation levels under si the differences grew larger through the end of 2014 final db from destructive sampling in march 2015 was about 2 5 kg plant for both the sdi i125 and i100 treatments for sdi while notably the db for the i75 was 1 7 kg plant fig 5b these compare to db of 1 4 1 5 kg plant for the high irrigation levels under si after 29 months of growth thus even the less irrigated i75 treatment under sdi produced db greater than the i120 and i100 treatments under surface irrigation the dry biomass of the final bulk harvest made after 29 months of growth was maximum for the i125 treatment 61 2 mg ha this db yield was 2 2 times greater than the maximum db realized in the si study in maricopa also at 29 months a comparison of final db for the i100 treatments in the two maricopa studies shows db for sdi 47 4 mg ha was 1 9 times higher than that with si 24 5 mg ha coffelt and ray 2010 reported dry biomass yields of 21 6 mg ha after 24 months and 29 7 mg ha after 36 months for guayule cultivars grown in maricopa under surface irrigation and a plant population of 27 000 plants ha as used in the present study more recently however at the same plant population abdel haleem et al 2018 grew improved lines of guayule in maricopa using si and achieved an average db of 27 2 mg ha after two years thus dry biomass yield for the i125 and i100 treatments achieved with sdi was substantially greater than all recent guayule si irrigation studies at the same location in maricopa at two locations in australia dissanayake et al 2007 maximum final db for well watered guayule after 32 months was 14 1 20 3 mg ha also for well watered and fertilized treatments in france snoeck et al 2015 reported guayule db after one year averaged 9 0 mg ha however in zacatecas mexico well watered guayule achieved only 15 0 mg ha in dry biomass after 30 months rodriquez garcia et al 2002 because the relationship between db and twa was linear fig 6a and b with no leveling off at the highest twa in the sdi study we submit that possibly higher db could have been realized with increased irrigation applications under sdi this is supported by the trend found for water productivity for dry biomass under sdi that increased rather than decreased with twa unlike wp with surface irrigation hunsaker and elshikha 2017 the water productivity for dry biomass production under the three highest irrigation levels under sdi 1 12 1 25 kg m3 are the highest reported for guayule to date for the companion study in maricopa wp for db for all treatments 0 59 to 0 69 kg m3 were about half that of the i125 treatment under sdi the findings concerning irrigation effects on final rubber contents were generally consistent with previous research which has mainly revealed rubber content increases as irrigation and available soil water decrease peak rubber concentrations occurred at the end of the guayule winter dormancy period i e february and march versus other times of the year and similar trends for rubber with time were reported by others coffelt et al 2009 veatch et al 2005 hunsaker and elshikha 2017 low temperatures during winter months induce biochemical reactions in the guayule plant that stimulate rubber biosynthesis and accumulated rubber content benedict et al 2013 final rubber contents table 4 for the three highest irrigation levels under sdi 5 6 6 6 were slightly lower than those for the three highest irrigation levels under si in maricopa 6 0 6 8 whereas rubber contents were higher at the two lowest irrigation levels under sdi 7 6 and 8 6 than those for si maximum guayule rubber contents found in the literature vary from 4 1 12 0 rasutis et al 2015 however we found that final resin content was generally not related to irrigation level in a consistent manner this result was consistent to data provided by rodriquez garcia et al 2002 however hunsaker and elshikha 2017 found that resin content was generally higher for the three wettest than two driest treatments under surface irrigation though significant differences were only between the two wettest versus the second driest treatment the rubber yield for the i125 treatment 3429 kg ha was 21 higher than the i100 treatment which in turn was only 12 higher than that for the i75 and the difference was not significant table 5 rubber yield was 2080 kg ha for the i50 and not significantly different than that for i75 due to higher percent rubber for the i50 treatment table 5 remarkably the i50 sdi treatment ry was 24 higher than maximum rubber yield in the companion study using si 1680 kg ha for the i120 but the i50 treatment received 57 less twa than that si treatment the i125 using sdi was twice the i120 ry using si even though twa for i125 was only 200 mm more the highest rubber yield for guayule after two years of growth reported in previous literature was 2006 kg ha abdel haleem et al 2018 a vast improvement in the wp for ry compared to previous results was achieved under sdi where values ranged from 0 067 to 0 078 kg m3 table 5 this is especially pertinent for higher irrigation levels which were only 0 036 to 0 037 kg m3 for the two highest irrigation levels under si in maricopa and comparable to the wp for ry at the two highest irrigation levels in the mid 1980s studies in mesa yuma and el paso 0 029 to 0 035 kg m3 similarly resin yield 3600 kg ha and wp of resin yield 0 089 kg m3 when averaged for the three highest irrigation levels under sdi were 56 and 59 greater than those based on the average of the three highest irrigation levels under si in maricopa respectively 5 conclusions a major challenge in commercializing guayule for natural rubber is to improve yield and water productivity under cropped conditions this is particularly true for the irrigated guayule crops that are envisioned for us deserts areas this study was conducted to evaluate guayule responses to water applied by subsurface drip irrigation in the southwestern us the results provide strong evidence that guayule yield and irrigation water productivity can both be vastly improved using subsurface drip instead of surface irrigation both dry biomass and rubber yield were the highest ever reported when guayule was irrigated to maintain soil water depletion less than 35 rubber yield for fully irrigated guayule using subsurface drip irrigation was about double the rubber yield attained by surface irrigation with similar amounts of total water applied we attribute the higher yield to more uniform readily available soil water at the upper soil profile for crop water use resulting in more rapid biomass production rubber content generally decreases with irrigation amount however under subsurface drip irrigation rubber yields are substantially increased with irrigation amount because of the significantly higher dry biomass produced moreover this study suggests that irrigation water use for guayule could be drastically reduced using subsurface drip and still achieve higher rubber yields than guayule grown with surface irrigation to further improve water savings using subsurface drip more efficient establishment irrigation practices need to be developed acknowledgements the authors

11026,considering the uncertainties in agricultural system and spatiotemporal variability in evapotranspiration and precipitation a distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming dinmp model was developed for optimal allocation of limited irrigation water resources in the middle reaches of heihe river basin the meteorological data from meteorological stations were used to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration et0 through fao56 penman monteith pm equation and then the remote sensing mod16 pet data were fitted by linear regression model according to the fao56 pm results the 95 confidence interval was used to further improve the accuracy of the fitting results thus satellite based potential evapotranspiration pet and ground based et0 estimation were integrated to not only reflect the spatial and temporal variability but also guarantee the accuracy of the et0 in the terms of precipitation spatial interpolation was used to spatial information of precipitation based on these spatiotemporal data a dinmp with three objectives including maximizing economic benefits and water saving as well as minimizing water shortage of critical growth periods was formulated and further solved by fuzzy coordination method the optimal allocation scheme improves the irrigation water productivity by 0 50 0 66 kg m3 and decreases net irrigation water allocation by 0 33 1 01 108 m3 these results show that dinmp can not only consider the uncertainties and multiple objectives in agricultural water management but also improve the spatial resolution of optimal water allocation strategies the framework of this study can provide a reference for agricultural water managers in similar areas to obtain more reasonable water allocation schemes keywords mod16 pet spatiotemporal water requirement of crops and precipitation spatial interpolation uncertainty distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming 1 introduction water resources play an indispensable role in agricultural production and social economic development however economic development and population growth are deepening the contradiction between decreasing water supply and increasing water demands china is a conventional agricultural country where more than 60 of water resources are used for irrigation the average irrigation quota is 5700 m3 hm2 and the effective utilization efficiency of irrigation water is only 0 542 ministry of water resources 2016 low water use efficiency leads to severe water scarcity problem relevant research in water scarce areas shows that reasonable water use strategy can save up to 35 of water and energy singh et al 2016 therefore in order to rationally utilize water resources ensure food supply and achieve sustainable agricultural development it is necessary to optimize the allocation of agricultural water resources when optimizing limited irrigation water the water requirement should be calculated firstly that is the actual evapotranspiration eta of crops should be obtained as the basis of optimization however in reality the eta is difficult to obtain directly and thus many related studies considered maximum evapotranspiration etc as the main reference when formulating optimization models to guide water allocation caselles et al 1992 moreover comparing with the et estimate method through lysimeters or flux towers it is simpler and cheaper to obtain the estimated value of reference evapotranspiration et0 via observed meteorological data at meteorological stations and then multiplies the crop coefficient kc to calculate the estimated value of etc westerhoff 2015 the traditional method of estimating et0 can be roughly divided into three types including temperature based calculation radiation based calculation and a penman method combining the two in 1948 penman first studied the calculation method of et0 in the condition without horizontal water vapor transport penman 1948 then monteith introduced the concept of surface impedance in the study of crop evaporation and transpiration development then proposed penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 based on penman method the fao56 pm equation allen et al 1998 was recommended by food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao because of its higher accuracy and became the most popular method in estimating et0 however the et0 obtained from fao56 pm equation have limitations in reflecting the spatial variability of crop water requirement besides it is too expensive to obtain large scale extensive observation these factors obstruct the practicality and reasonability of the optimal allocation schemes obtained from the optimization model based on pm with the new technology developing more spatial information can be obtained via remote sensing technology christakos et al 2017 remote sensing technology can overcome the shortcomings of single site observations in the poor representation of complex surface space it saves labor and obtains more timely information than manual observation the results obtained from remote sensing not only are less affected by human impacts but also reflect the relationship among land use plant growth status and the environment miralles et al 2011 according to the different mechanisms and methods of constructing models the current widely used remote sensing models can be divided into five types empirical statistical models energy balance models remote sensing models combined with traditional methods temperature vegetation index feature space methods and assimilation method with land surface process data jia et al 2012 the mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 uses remote sensing data including land cover albedo leaf area index and radiation temperature and water vapor pressure deficit etc to obtain the potential evapotranspiration pet alvarado barrientos and medina 2017 stan et al 2017 but the obtained pet data are usually too rough due to the data contamination of noise and uncertainty moreover there is a deviation between the true value of water requirement and modis production kim et al 2012 trambauer et al 2014 velpuri et al 2013 xue et al 2013 in comparison ground estimation is more accuracy on certain points alvarado barrientos and medina 2017 therefore to obtain more accuracy spatial crop water requirement the pet product developed by modis model is considered to integrate with pm method in this study the remote sensing mod16 pet data were fitted by linear regression model according to the fao56 pm results at three meteorological stations after combining the two data sets in this way both the accuracy and spatial variability of et0 can be better guaranteed furthermore considering the uncertainty of the spatial data in the fitting process this study obtained the interval results of spatial crop water requirement the 95 confidence interval was used to further improve the accuracy of the fitting results at the same time the spatial interpolation was used for obtaining the spatial precipitation information of the areas with less meteorological data considering the uncertainty in spatial interpolation this study obtained the interval results of spatial precipitation these spatial data were used as inputs of the optimization model for optimizing limited irrigation water resources as an important method to guide managers to effectively allocate water resources the optimization models are widely used in practice zhang and guo 2017 however irrigation water management is a large system with complex structures which includes many factors such as natural conditions human activities and socio economic conditions li and guo 2014 cheng et al 2017 in the past decades researchers have developed many effective optimization models to solve real world allocation problems li and guo 2015 mulvey and ruszczyński 1995 huang and loucks 2000 guo et al 2008 li et al 2017a among these models interval programming was proposed to solve problems featuring interval uncertainty and nonlinear programming can deal with the marginal benefits due to decision makers tend to consider multiple objectives at the same time multiobjective models were used to represent multilateral interests in addressing water allocation problems however interval numbers and conflicting objectives are always needed to be solved simultaneously thus this study makes an attempt to calculate the interval nonlinear multiobjective model with spatial inputs for better supporting agricultural water management under uncertainty this study proposed a distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming dinmp model to optimize limited irrigation water in which the spatial distribution information of crop water requirement and precipitation were considered to solve the proposed model the fuzzy coordination method was used to demonstrate its practicality and applicability the proposed model was used to allocate irrigation water to three major crops wheat seed corn and field corn among 17 irrigation areas in the middle reaches of heihe river basin to help the managers allocate the limited irrigation water reasonably and contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture in the arid and semi arid regions 2 study system 2 1 study area heihe river between 98 101 30 east longitude and 37 50 42 40 north latitude is the second largest inland river in the eastern part of gansu province and in the middle of the hexi corridor northwest china the yingluo and zhengyi gorge hydrological station divide heihe river as the upstream midstream and downstream hao and su 2015 the irrigation area in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin occupies 95 of the cultivated land in the whole basin and about 70 of the water in the main stream is used to irrigate crops in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the annual average et0 1453 2351 mm is much larger than the precipitation 60 280 mm in this area and the cultivated land area is about 206 800 hm2 nian et al 2014 it is the main food production area in northwest china among them field corn c seed corn s and wheat w are widely planted and are the main crops in the study area due to the excessive use of water in the middle reaches the downstream lake has dried up which causes ecological deterioration and serious desertification therefore the study area is needed to strictly control the expansion of the cultivated land area for saving more water to restore the ecological environment nian et al 2014 the research area consists of seventeen irrigation districts including anyang banqiao daman hongyazizi huazhaizi liyuanhe liaoqua liuba luocheng pingchuan shahe shangsan xijun xinba yanuan yingke and youlian irrigation areas according to this order the numbering of above irrigation areas are defined as 1 17 respectively this study attempts to optimally allocate limited irrigation water to three main crops in the seventeen irrigation areas the geographical location of the study area and the position of the irrigation areas are shown in fig 1 the elevation distribution of the study area is shown in fig 2 the spatial resolution is 30 m derived from the aster gdem data the slope and aspect data of the study area are derived from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn sources with a spatial resolution of 90 m the soil type and planting structure data are derived from the heihe plan data management center http www heihedata org with a spatial resolution of 1000 m fig 3 shows the distribution of slope aspect soil type and planting structure due to the same growth period of field corn and seed corn no distinction was made between field corn and seed corn in the agro type maps in the study area according to the figs 2 and 3 the elevation slope direction slope soil type and planting structure of the study area are highly variable in space at the same time crop water requirement is affected by many factors such as meteorological factors soil factors topographic factors basic agricultural facilities agricultural management methods etc therefore there is a large spatial variability of crop water requirements in the study area and it is necessary to obtain a spatial pet by remote sensing technology besides uncertainties may exist in the process of data collection and they should be fully considered in agricultural water management moreover based on the actual condition of the study area two reasonable assumptions were made li et al 2016 firstly the change value of soil water in the whole growth period is zero allen et al 1998 secondly the groundwater recharge is negligible because of the deep groundwater depth in the irrigation area chadha and chadha 2007 in summary due to the shortage of water resources in the study area when allocating the limited irrigation water reasonably and considering the sustainable development of agriculture there are some problems desired to be addressed in the study area 1 the large spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration and precipitation 2 uncertainties existing in the parameters of agricultural systems 3 multiobjective tradeoff including the economic benefits crop water requirement of critical growth periods and water saving to solve the above problems dinmp was used in the middle reaches of heihe river basin to obtain reasonable allocation schemes for helping decision makers manage the limited irrigation water 2 2 data collection and process this study selected 2014 as the typical year the remote sensing data used in this paper is collected from the modis pet during 2004 to 2014 the time resolution is 8 d the spatial resolution is 1000 m the decision making unit dmu in this study is the monthly water allocation of each crop planting area in each irrigation area the total corn and wheat planting area in each irrigation areas were obtained from the planting structure maps and the boundary maps of irrigation areas then the area of the field corn and seed corn is obtained by multiplying the total area of the corn by the planting proportion of two crops in each irrigation area which were obtained through field investigation thus the planting area of each crop in this study can be obtained in fig 4 meteorological data from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en due to the lack of data linze station only has data for the six years from 2004 to 2009 hydrological information irrigation area data socio economic conditions groundwater information etc from 2004 to 2014 were obtained from the statistical yearbook of zhangye city field research and field trials this study used the interval nonlinear irrigation water production function to simulate the relationship between irrigation water and crop yield due to the existence of uncertainties and marginal utility which can be obtained from the field experiment data in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the irrigation water production function and price range of each crop can be obtained from previous researches jiang et al 2016 li et al 2017b which are shown in table 1 based on the variation of population yields of food crops and cash crops in 17 irrigation areas the entropy weight method delgado and romero 2016 was used to calculate the water allocation weight of each irrigation district the results are shown in table 2 in order to indicate the importance of irrigation water for different months of crop growth period this paper introduced water sensitivity weight based on jensen model fu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 which reflects the relationship between crop yield and monthly water deficit sensitivity and the crop coefficient method was used in this study to estimate the crop water requirement the formula can be expressed as 1 e t c k c e t 0 where etc is the crop water requirement mm kc is the crop coefficient et0 is the reference evapotranspiration after fitting mm kc values of the main crops in each month can be collected from previous studies jiang et al 2014 kang et al 2003 the water sensitivity weights the surface water supply and the available groundwater of study area in 2014 are shown in table 3 2 3 study framework in this paper the data of the meteorological station were used for estimating the et0 from 2004 to 2014 by the pm equation and the results were further used to fitting the mod16 pet data besides with the help of the historical precipitation data in the gansu province meteorological stations and inverse distance weighting idw method the spatial precipitation can be obtained then these spatial data of the main crops in each irrigation area were extracted based on these spatial data the dinmp model was established and solved by fuzzy coordination method fig 5 3 spatial analysis of crop water requirement and precipitation since crop water requirement and precipitation play an important role in the optimal allocation of agricultural water resources the spatiotemporal variability of these two parameters is analyzed in detail as follows 3 1 remote sensing et0 fitting by regression model the fao56 pm equation recommended by fao is the most commonly used method of traditional ground monitoring et0 the mathematical expression is as follows 2 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the reference

used for estimating the daily et0 of each station from 2004 to 2014 with the help of the data from three meteorological stations in the study area and then accumulated them as monthly values soundly the downloaded mod16 pet data were re projected and spliced by using the modis reprojection tool software to obtain the tiff format in the wgs 1984 geographic coordinate system on this basis after the operation of projection transformation resampling and spatial modeling etc the annual mean values monthly mean values and the grid image of the pet were given by using arcgis then removed the invalid value and multiply 0 1 to get its true value the pet values at the meteorological stations were extracted from the latitude and longitude information of the stations of gaotai linze and zhangye the comparison between calculation results and the fao56 pm results of three stations are shown in fig 6 respectively from the results of fig 6 we can find that the mod16 pet values of the three stations and the estimated et0 results of the pm equation have synchronized trends from 2004 to 2014 reflecting obvious periodicity compared with the et0 values obtained by the fao56 pm equation the mod16 pet have higher values during this period fig 7 a shows the comparison between monthly fao56 pm results and mod16 pet values the scattered points are concentrated below the oblique line and the distribution of points is relatively regular therefore it seems feasible to fit mod16 pet by a linear regression model to obtain more accurate et0 data 332 sets of monthly pet and et0 samples with the same temporal and spatial locations at three meteorological stations were used in this part the fitting model can be obtained as follows 3 et0 0 7884 pet 28 3826 the results can be shown as fig 7 b r2 is the deterministic coefficient that can be used to characterize the degree of agreement between the two data sets gui et al 2016 the fitted r2 of the mod16 pet and fao56 pm equation results is 0 9011 which demonstrates the linear regression model can fit mod16 pet well from the corrected image it can be found that the calibration results have obvious interval properties to reflect more detailed information 95 confidence interval is used in this study and the following interval fitting model is obtained as follows 4 et0 0 7604 0 8166 pet 23 6287 33 1365 the interval fitting result is shown in fig 8 the results estimated by the fao56 pm equation are basically between the range of intervals which shows that this range can provide more accuracy spatial et0 the obtained interval fitting model was used to analyze and calculate the spatial water requirement of the main crop cultivation areas in 17 irrigation districts 3 2 result analysis and discussion for spatial water requirement of crops the monthly mod16 pet images were extracted by the irrigation area boundary map to obtain the pet mean values of each irrigation area then the crop planting structure map was separately cut by each irrigation area boundary map and the obtained crop planting structure map of each irrigation area was used for extracting the monthly mod16 pet finally the monthly average pet values of each dmu were obtained fig 9 fig 9 shows that there are obvious differences among the mean pet values for each irrigation area in the same month and there is a large difference in the pet values in different spatial locations therefore the mod16 pet image is extracted by using the irrigation area boundary map to obtain the pet mean values of each irrigation area whose spatial precision is higher than the fao56 pm results directly used in the optimized water allocation model even in the same irrigation area where the spatial difference is smaller different crops have obvious differences because of their different planting positions therefore using the planting structure map to extract the pet value further improves its spatial precision at the same time the values of pet have obvious time varying relationship the time resolution of mod16 pet is 8d which can meet the time precision required for optimal water allocation therefore this paper satisfies the spatiotemporal resoltion requirements of the evapotranspiration data in water resources optimal allocation to a certain extent furthermore the obtained interval linear regression model was used for fitting the pet values to obtain the et0 results and process that according to the crop growth period at the same time the crop coefficient approach is used to estimate the water requirement of each crop and then the spatial water requirement of each dmu can be obtained the results are shown in fig 10 c represents field corn s represents seed corn and w represents wheat compared with the crop water requirement obtained by fa056 pm equation in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin see table 4 li et al 2017b it can be found that the interval numbers obtained in this study are different from table 4 but it is basically located near the interval of table 4 therefore it is considered feasible to apply the eq 4 in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the fitted results were used as potential inputs for dinmp optimization model to allocate limited irrigation water 3 3 spatial analysis of precipitation as an important parameter in agricultural water management precipitation has strong spatiotemporal variation this paper used the idw shekhar and hui 2008 methods to process the precipitation data in gansu province then the monthly precipitation interpolation results in the middle reaches can be obtained by the extraction tool in gis fig 11 through the interpolation results it is found that the precipitation of the study area changes with time and space and the high precipitation level are mainly in the upper reaches and mountainous areas the average precipitation values of the main crop planting areas in each irrigation area can be obtained by extraction tool with considering the growth period and the effective precipitation can be estimated as the following formula 5 e p α p where ep is the effective precipitation mm p is the precipitation mm α is the effective precipitation coefficient according to the yearly precipitation data in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin 0 8 was chosen as the effective precipitation coefficient in this area zhang et al 2018 li et al 2017b because precipitation is affected by various factors such as topography and meteorology uncertainties are existing in the estimate process the interval parameters can better describe the uncertainty of precipitation caused by the spatial interpolation process each dmu includes many grids with corresponding precipitation results in the unit the results of precipitation of all grids can be obtained via the statistics the maximum and minimum grid values of ep in each decision unit were multiplied by the effective precipitation coefficient and thus the upper and lower bound of effective precipitation were obtained in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 difference obviously exist in the effective precipitation of the same crops in different irrigation areas the irrigation areas close to the upper reaches of the heihe river basin such as anyang hongyazi and huazhaizi own higher elevations and significantly more precipitation than the others in this part the monthly crop water requirement and precipitation data of different major crop planting areas in different irrigation areas were obtained with fully considering uncertainties all of the data were input to dinmp model to obtain the water allocation schemes 4 distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming dinmp 4 1 model formulation by considering the spatial distribution and uncertainties existing in evapotranspiration and precipitation the marginal benefit and uncertainty of crop yield and irrigation water the uncertainties contained in the data of water supply and socioeconomic dinmp model was developed the model has three objectives including maximizing economic benefits minimizing water shortage during crucial growth periods in crucial irrigation areas and maximizing water saving the dinmp model is formulated as follows 6a max f 1 j 1 17 i 1 3 a i j b i a i t 1 6 w i j t 2 b i t 1 6 w i j t c i objective of economic maximizing economic benefits 6b min f

mm is an interval with lower and upper bounds and are the upper and lower bounds respectively 4 2 model solution process zimmermann zimmermann 1978 proposed a fuzzy algorithm for solving multi objective optimization models the basic idea is to transform the multiobjective model into an equivalent specific single objective fuzzy optimization model on the basis of this fuzzy coordination method was developed guo and wen hua 2008 zhang et al 2018 to obtain satisfactory solutions in this study the fuzzy coordination method is used to solve the dinmp model the specific solution steps are shown as follows step 1 transform all interval number parameters in the developed model by a i a i δ a i r i where δ a i a i a i r i 0 1 step 2 transform each objective function into a model with minimized objective step 3 use lingo software to solve three objectives separately and obtain the maximum and minimum values of each objective f 1 max f 1 min f 2 max f 2 min f 3 max f 3 min step 4

decompose the above model into upper and lower sub models by using the two step method huang and loucks 2000 to solve the interval programming solve the upper and lower sub models separately and obtain the interval of the decision variables w 4 3 optimization results analysis and discussion fig 13 shows the upper and lower bound of the water allocation results net irrigation water per unit area for each month the results of the dinmp model are a set of interval numbers and the interval difference is mainly between 0 and 28 mm indicating that the model is sensitive to the input interval parameters and reflects the uncertainty existing in the real world the results show the spatial variability of crop water requirement and precipitation had a significant impact on the results moreover in different months the same crop in one irrigation area have different water allocation schemes that reflects not only the temporal variability of crop water requirements and precipitation but also the sensitivity of crops to water in different growth stages it is found that the larger water allocation will get more crop yield and more economic benefits but the yield and benefit per unit water will be reduced that is determined by the nonlinear water production function which reflects the marginal benefits in the real world after optimizing the limited agricultural water resources the results of each objective that the decision maker may care about are shown in table 5 the results can save irrigation water improve yield and benefit and thus these results may be helpful for decision makers the yield per unit irrigation water of each crop in each irrigation area is shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the irrigation water productivity of anyang no 1 and hongyazi no 5 are higher than others because they close to the upper reaches of the heihe river basin there is more precipitation and lower evapotranspiration meanwhile these two irrigation districts have smaller planting area lower total yield and less population and thus the importance weight of the irrigation area is lower further resulting in a less water allocation additionally due to the high level of precipitation in these irrigation areas the water allocation is greatly affected by the uncertainty of precipitation when the precipitation is higher the water requirement of the crop can be generally satisfied so the irrigation water allocation is reduced resulting in a high yield per unit irrigation water decision makers can consider increasing the planting area in such irrigation areas with large yield per unit irrigation water according to the actual situation in order to save water and increase profits comparing the results between the results of the multiobjective model and the model with every single objective respectively the comparison result is illustrated in table 6 it is found that each single objective model with a certain indicator can obtain the maximum value of that objective but can hardly take other significant factors into consideration however the dinmp model can coordinate three different objectives and obtain reasonable allocation schemes 5 conclusions based on the fitted mod16 pet data and the spatial interpolation results of precipitation data this study proposed a dinmp model with fully considering the spatiotemporal variability and uncertainties of the agricultural water management system in the real world to optimize limited irrigation water the decision makers can obtain the water allocation schemes of each crop from the research the following are the main conclusions 1 in recent years the evapotranspiration of the middle reaches of the heihe river basin has generally increased the mod16 pet values and the fao56 pm results have synchronized trends from 2004 to 2014 reflecting obvious periodicity after deterministic fitting r2 is 0 9011 the interval fitted results are obtained by using the confidence interval to improve the accuracy thus satellite pet and ground based et0 estimation were integrated to not only reflect the spatial and temporal variability but also guarantee the accuracy of the et0 moreover it reflects the spatiotemporal variability between the irrigation crop month and more information can be obtained from the interval results of the spatial evapotranspiration data 2 spatial interpolation was carried out using the meteorological stations in gansu province the precipitation in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin has an obviously spatial variability those areas close to the upper reaches have higher elevations are affected by the upstream meteorological station and have more precipitation 3 anyang and hongyazi irrigation areas are closer to the upper reaches of the heihe river basin the precipitation is relatively higher and the crop water requirement is lower than others therefore in the optimization results the yield per unit irrigation water is higher than other irrigation districts decision makers can consider increasing the planting area in such irrigation areas according to the actual situation 4 considering the spatiality of evapotranspiration and precipitation the results can be obtained by the dinmp model via fuzzy coordination method from the calculated results the economic benefit is 38 33 59 04 108 cny the water shortage in the crucial growth period is 320 80 349 33 104 m3 and the allocation of net irrigation water is 5 34 6 37 108 m3 the yield per unit irrigation water is 1 67 1 83 kg m3 compared with the current situation the yield per unit water increased by 0 50 0 66 kg m3 and the net irrigation water consumption reduced by 0 33 1 01 108 m3 the yield and benefit are significantly improved so the water allocation results are considered reasonable the interval based water allocation scheme can provide decision makers with more reasonable choices therefore the dinmp can help managers make reasonable and high resolution water allocation strategies for the middle reaches of heihe river basin and contribute to the environment restoration in the middle and lower reaches moreover changes of soil water content in this area was not considered in this optimal water allocation model and it would be our future research direction besides this method can be applied to other similar areas to improve agricultural water management

11026,considering the uncertainties in agricultural system and spatiotemporal variability in evapotranspiration and precipitation a distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming dinmp model was developed for optimal allocation of limited irrigation water resources in the middle reaches of heihe river basin the meteorological data from meteorological stations were used to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration et0 through fao56 penman monteith pm equation and then the remote sensing mod16 pet data were fitted by linear regression model according to the fao56 pm results the 95 confidence interval was used to further improve the accuracy of the fitting results thus satellite based potential evapotranspiration pet and ground based et0 estimation were integrated to not only reflect the spatial and temporal variability but also guarantee the accuracy of the et0 in the terms of precipitation spatial interpolation was used to spatial information of precipitation based on these spatiotemporal data a dinmp with three objectives including maximizing economic benefits and water saving as well as minimizing water shortage of critical growth periods was formulated and further solved by fuzzy coordination method the optimal allocation scheme improves the irrigation water productivity by 0 50 0 66 kg m3 and decreases net irrigation water allocation by 0 33 1 01 108 m3 these results show that dinmp can not only consider the uncertainties and multiple objectives in agricultural water management but also improve the spatial resolution of optimal water allocation strategies the framework of this study can provide a reference for agricultural water managers in similar areas to obtain more reasonable water allocation schemes keywords mod16 pet spatiotemporal water requirement of crops and precipitation spatial interpolation uncertainty distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming 1 introduction water resources play an indispensable role in agricultural production and social economic development however economic development and population growth are deepening the contradiction between decreasing water supply and increasing water demands china is a conventional agricultural country where more than 60 of water resources are used for irrigation the average irrigation quota is 5700 m3 hm2 and the effective utilization efficiency of irrigation water is only 0 542 ministry of water resources 2016 low water use efficiency leads to severe water scarcity problem relevant research in water scarce areas shows that reasonable water use strategy can save up to 35 of water and energy singh et al 2016 therefore in order to rationally utilize water resources ensure food supply and achieve sustainable agricultural development it is necessary to optimize the allocation of agricultural water resources when optimizing limited irrigation water the water requirement should be calculated firstly that is the actual evapotranspiration eta of crops should be obtained as the basis of optimization however in reality the eta is difficult to obtain directly and thus many related studies considered maximum evapotranspiration etc as the main reference when formulating optimization models to guide water allocation caselles et al 1992 moreover comparing with the et estimate method through lysimeters or flux towers it is simpler and cheaper to obtain the estimated value of reference evapotranspiration et0 via observed meteorological data at meteorological stations and then multiplies the crop coefficient kc to calculate the estimated value of etc westerhoff 2015 the traditional method of estimating et0 can be roughly divided into three types including temperature based calculation radiation based calculation and a penman method combining the two in 1948 penman first studied the calculation method of et0 in the condition without horizontal water vapor transport penman 1948 then monteith introduced the concept of surface impedance in the study of crop evaporation and transpiration development then proposed penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 based on penman method the fao56 pm equation allen et al 1998 was recommended by food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao because of its higher accuracy and became the most popular method in estimating et0 however the et0 obtained from fao56 pm equation have limitations in reflecting the spatial variability of crop water requirement besides it is too expensive to obtain large scale extensive observation these factors obstruct the practicality and reasonability of the optimal allocation schemes obtained from the optimization model based on pm with the new technology developing more spatial information can be obtained via remote sensing technology christakos et al 2017 remote sensing technology can overcome the shortcomings of single site observations in the poor representation of complex surface space it saves labor and obtains more timely information than manual observation the results obtained from remote sensing not only are less affected by human impacts but also reflect the relationship among land use plant growth status and the environment miralles et al 2011 according to the different mechanisms and methods of constructing models the current widely used remote sensing models can be divided into five types empirical statistical models energy balance models remote sensing models combined with traditional methods temperature vegetation index feature space methods and assimilation method with land surface process data jia et al 2012 the mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 uses remote sensing data including land cover albedo leaf area index and radiation temperature and water vapor pressure deficit etc to obtain the potential evapotranspiration pet alvarado barrientos and medina 2017 stan et al 2017 but the obtained pet data are usually too rough due to the data contamination of noise and uncertainty moreover there is a deviation between the true value of water requirement and modis production kim et al 2012 trambauer et al 2014 velpuri et al 2013 xue et al 2013 in comparison ground estimation is more accuracy on certain points alvarado barrientos and medina 2017 therefore to obtain more accuracy spatial crop water requirement the pet product developed by modis model is considered to integrate with pm method in this study the remote sensing mod16 pet data were fitted by linear regression model according to the fao56 pm results at three meteorological stations after combining the two data sets in this way both the accuracy and spatial variability of et0 can be better guaranteed furthermore considering the uncertainty of the spatial data in the fitting process this study obtained the interval results of spatial crop water requirement the 95 confidence interval was used to further improve the accuracy of the fitting results at the same time the spatial interpolation was used for obtaining the spatial precipitation information of the areas with less meteorological data considering the uncertainty in spatial interpolation this study obtained the interval results of spatial precipitation these spatial data were used as inputs of the optimization model for optimizing limited irrigation water resources as an important method to guide managers to effectively allocate water resources the optimization models are widely used in practice zhang and guo 2017 however irrigation water management is a large system with complex structures which includes many factors such as natural conditions human activities and socio economic conditions li and guo 2014 cheng et al 2017 in the past decades researchers have developed many effective optimization models to solve real world allocation problems li and guo 2015 mulvey and ruszczyński 1995 huang and loucks 2000 guo et al 2008 li et al 2017a among these models interval programming was proposed to solve problems featuring interval uncertainty and nonlinear programming can deal with the marginal benefits due to decision makers tend to consider multiple objectives at the same time multiobjective models were used to represent multilateral interests in addressing water allocation problems however interval numbers and conflicting objectives are always needed to be solved simultaneously thus this study makes an attempt to calculate the interval nonlinear multiobjective model with spatial inputs for better supporting agricultural water management under uncertainty this study proposed a distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming dinmp model to optimize limited irrigation water in which the spatial distribution information of crop water requirement and precipitation were considered to solve the proposed model the fuzzy coordination method was used to demonstrate its practicality and applicability the proposed model was used to allocate irrigation water to three major crops wheat seed corn and field corn among 17 irrigation areas in the middle reaches of heihe river basin to help the managers allocate the limited irrigation water reasonably and contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture in the arid and semi arid regions 2 study system 2 1 study area heihe river between 98 101 30 east longitude and 37 50 42 40 north latitude is the second largest inland river in the eastern part of gansu province and in the middle of the hexi corridor northwest china the yingluo and zhengyi gorge hydrological station divide heihe river as the upstream midstream and downstream hao and su 2015 the irrigation area in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin occupies 95 of the cultivated land in the whole basin and about 70 of the water in the main stream is used to irrigate crops in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the annual average et0 1453 2351 mm is much larger than the precipitation 60 280 mm in this area and the cultivated land area is about 206 800 hm2 nian et al 2014 it is the main food production area in northwest china among them field corn c seed corn s and wheat w are widely planted and are the main crops in the study area due to the excessive use of water in the middle reaches the downstream lake has dried up which causes ecological deterioration and serious desertification therefore the study area is needed to strictly control the expansion of the cultivated land area for saving more water to restore the ecological environment nian et al 2014 the research area consists of seventeen irrigation districts including anyang banqiao daman hongyazizi huazhaizi liyuanhe liaoqua liuba luocheng pingchuan shahe shangsan xijun xinba yanuan yingke and youlian irrigation areas according to this order the numbering of above irrigation areas are defined as 1 17 respectively this study attempts to optimally allocate limited irrigation water to three main crops in the seventeen irrigation areas the geographical location of the study area and the position of the irrigation areas are shown in fig 1 the elevation distribution of the study area is shown in fig 2 the spatial resolution is 30 m derived from the aster gdem data the slope and aspect data of the study area are derived from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn sources with a spatial resolution of 90 m the soil type and planting structure data are derived from the heihe plan data management center http www heihedata org with a spatial resolution of 1000 m fig 3 shows the distribution of slope aspect soil type and planting structure due to the same growth period of field corn and seed corn no distinction was made between field corn and seed corn in the agro type maps in the study area according to the figs 2 and 3 the elevation slope direction slope soil type and planting structure of the study area are highly variable in space at the same time crop water requirement is affected by many factors such as meteorological factors soil factors topographic factors basic agricultural facilities agricultural management methods etc therefore there is a large spatial variability of crop water requirements in the study area and it is necessary to obtain a spatial pet by remote sensing technology besides uncertainties may exist in the process of data collection and they should be fully considered in agricultural water management moreover based on the actual condition of the study area two reasonable assumptions were made li et al 2016 firstly the change value of soil water in the whole growth period is zero allen et al 1998 secondly the groundwater recharge is negligible because of the deep groundwater depth in the irrigation area chadha and chadha 2007 in summary due to the shortage of water resources in the study area when allocating the limited irrigation water reasonably and considering the sustainable development of agriculture there are some problems desired to be addressed in the study area 1 the large spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration and precipitation 2 uncertainties existing in the parameters of agricultural systems 3 multiobjective tradeoff including the economic benefits crop water requirement of critical growth periods and water saving to solve the above problems dinmp was used in the middle reaches of heihe river basin to obtain reasonable allocation schemes for helping decision makers manage the limited irrigation water 2 2 data collection and process this study selected 2014 as the typical year the remote sensing data used in this paper is collected from the modis pet during 2004 to 2014 the time resolution is 8 d the spatial resolution is 1000 m the decision making unit dmu in this study is the monthly water allocation of each crop planting area in each irrigation area the total corn and wheat planting area in each irrigation areas were obtained from the planting structure maps and the boundary maps of irrigation areas then the area of the field corn and seed corn is obtained by multiplying the total area of the corn by the planting proportion of two crops in each irrigation area which were obtained through field investigation thus the planting area of each crop in this study can be obtained in fig 4 meteorological data from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en due to the lack of data linze station only has data for the six years from 2004 to 2009 hydrological information irrigation area data socio economic conditions groundwater information etc from 2004 to 2014 were obtained from the statistical yearbook of zhangye city field research and field trials this study used the interval nonlinear irrigation water production function to simulate the relationship between irrigation water and crop yield due to the existence of uncertainties and marginal utility which can be obtained from the field experiment data in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the irrigation water production function and price range of each crop can be obtained from previous researches jiang et al 2016 li et al 2017b which are shown in table 1 based on the variation of population yields of food crops and cash crops in 17 irrigation areas the entropy weight method delgado and romero 2016 was used to calculate the water allocation weight of each irrigation district the results are shown in table 2 in order to indicate the importance of irrigation water for different months of crop growth period this paper introduced water sensitivity weight based on jensen model fu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 which reflects the relationship between crop yield and monthly water deficit sensitivity and the crop coefficient method was used in this study to estimate the crop water requirement the formula can be expressed as 1 e t c k c e t 0 where etc is the crop water requirement mm kc is the crop coefficient et0 is the reference evapotranspiration after fitting mm kc values of the main crops in each month can be collected from previous studies jiang et al 2014 kang et al 2003 the water sensitivity weights the surface water supply and the available groundwater of study area in 2014 are shown in table 3 2 3 study framework in this paper the data of the meteorological station were used for estimating the et0 from 2004 to 2014 by the pm equation and the results were further used to fitting the mod16 pet data besides with the help of the historical precipitation data in the gansu province meteorological stations and inverse distance weighting idw method the spatial precipitation can be obtained then these spatial data of the main crops in each irrigation area were extracted based on these spatial data the dinmp model was established and solved by fuzzy coordination method fig 5 3 spatial analysis of crop water requirement and precipitation since crop water requirement and precipitation play an important role in the optimal allocation of agricultural water resources the spatiotemporal variability of these two parameters is analyzed in detail as follows 3 1 remote sensing et0 fitting by regression model the fao56 pm equation recommended by fao is the most commonly used method of traditional ground monitoring et0 the mathematical expression is as follows 2 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure and air temperature curve kpa rn is the net radiation mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d γ is the hygrometer constant k pa c t is the average air temperature c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m above the ground m s es is the air saturated vapor pressure k pa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa the fao56 pm equation is used for estimating the daily et0 of each station from 2004 to 2014 with the help of the data from three meteorological stations in the study area and then accumulated them as monthly values soundly the downloaded mod16 pet data were re projected and spliced by using the modis reprojection tool software to obtain the tiff format in the wgs 1984 geographic coordinate system on this basis after the operation of projection transformation resampling and spatial modeling etc the annual mean values monthly mean values and the grid image of the pet were given by using arcgis then removed the invalid value and multiply 0 1 to get its true value the pet values at the meteorological stations were extracted from the latitude and longitude information of the stations of gaotai linze and zhangye the comparison between calculation results and the fao56 pm results of three stations are shown in fig 6 respectively from the results of fig 6 we can find that the mod16 pet values of the three stations and the estimated et0 results of the pm equation have synchronized trends from 2004 to 2014 reflecting obvious periodicity compared with the et0 values obtained by the fao56 pm equation the mod16 pet have higher values during this period fig 7 a shows the comparison between monthly fao56 pm results and mod16 pet values the scattered points are concentrated below the oblique line and the distribution of points is relatively regular therefore it seems feasible to fit mod16 pet by a linear regression model to obtain more accurate et0 data 332 sets of monthly pet and et0 samples with the same temporal and spatial locations at three meteorological stations were used in this part the fitting model can be obtained as follows 3 et0 0 7884 pet 28 3826 the results can be shown as fig 7 b r2 is the deterministic coefficient that can be used to characterize the degree of agreement between the two data sets gui et al 2016 the fitted r2 of the mod16 pet and fao56 pm equation results is 0 9011 which demonstrates the linear regression model can fit mod16 pet well from the corrected image it can be found that the calibration results have obvious interval properties to reflect more detailed information 95 confidence interval is used in this study and the following interval fitting model is obtained as follows 4 et0 0 7604 0 8166 pet 23 6287 33 1365 the interval fitting result is shown in fig 8 the results estimated by the fao56 pm equation are basically between the range of intervals which shows that this range can provide more accuracy spatial et0 the obtained interval fitting model was used to analyze and calculate the spatial water requirement of the main crop cultivation areas in 17 irrigation districts 3 2 result analysis and discussion for spatial water requirement of crops the monthly mod16 pet images were extracted by the irrigation area boundary map to obtain the pet mean values of each irrigation area then the crop planting structure map was separately cut by each irrigation area boundary map and the obtained crop planting structure map of each irrigation area was used for extracting the monthly mod16 pet finally the monthly average pet values of each dmu were obtained fig 9 fig 9 shows that there are obvious differences among the mean pet values for each irrigation area in the same month and there is a large difference in the pet values in different spatial locations therefore the mod16 pet image is extracted by using the irrigation area boundary map to obtain the pet mean values of each irrigation area whose spatial precision is higher than the fao56 pm results directly used in the optimized water allocation model even in the same irrigation area where the spatial difference is smaller different crops have obvious differences because of their different planting positions therefore using the planting structure map to extract the pet value further improves its spatial precision at the same time the values of pet have obvious time varying relationship the time resolution of mod16 pet is 8d which can meet the time precision required for optimal water allocation therefore this paper satisfies the spatiotemporal resoltion requirements of the evapotranspiration data in water resources optimal allocation to a certain extent furthermore the obtained interval linear regression model was used for fitting the pet values to obtain the et0 results and process that according to the crop growth period at the same time the crop coefficient approach is used to estimate the water requirement of each crop and then the spatial water requirement of each dmu can be obtained the results are shown in fig 10 c represents field corn s represents seed corn and w represents wheat compared with the crop water requirement obtained by fa056 pm equation in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin see table 4 li et al 2017b it can be found that the interval numbers obtained in this study are different from table 4 but it is basically located near the interval of table 4 therefore it is considered feasible to apply the eq 4 in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the fitted results were used as potential inputs for dinmp optimization model to allocate limited irrigation water 3 3 spatial analysis of precipitation as an important parameter in agricultural water management precipitation has strong spatiotemporal variation this paper used the idw shekhar and hui 2008 methods to process the precipitation data in gansu province then the monthly precipitation interpolation results in the middle reaches can be obtained by the extraction tool in gis fig 11 through the interpolation results it is found that the precipitation of the study area changes with time and space and the high precipitation level are mainly in the upper reaches and mountainous areas the average precipitation values of the main crop planting areas in each irrigation area can be obtained by extraction tool with considering the growth period and the effective precipitation can be estimated as the following formula 5 e p α p where ep is the effective precipitation mm p is the precipitation mm α is the effective precipitation coefficient according to the yearly precipitation data in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin 0 8 was chosen as the effective precipitation coefficient in this area zhang et al 2018 li et al 2017b because precipitation is affected by various factors such as topography and meteorology uncertainties are existing in the estimate process the interval parameters can better describe the uncertainty of precipitation caused by the spatial interpolation process each dmu includes many grids with corresponding precipitation results in the unit the results of precipitation of all grids can be obtained via the statistics the maximum and minimum grid values of ep in each decision unit were multiplied by the effective precipitation coefficient and thus the upper and lower bound of effective precipitation were obtained in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 difference obviously exist in the effective precipitation of the same crops in different irrigation areas the irrigation areas close to the upper reaches of the heihe river basin such as anyang hongyazi and huazhaizi own higher elevations and significantly more precipitation than the others in this part the monthly crop water requirement and precipitation data of different major crop planting areas in different irrigation areas were obtained with fully considering uncertainties all of the data were input to dinmp model to obtain the water allocation schemes 4 distributed interval nonlinear multiobjective programming dinmp 4 1 model formulation by considering the spatial distribution and uncertainties existing in evapotranspiration and precipitation the marginal benefit and uncertainty of crop yield and irrigation water the uncertainties contained in the data of water supply and socioeconomic dinmp model was developed the model has three objectives including maximizing economic benefits minimizing water shortage during crucial growth periods in crucial irrigation areas and maximizing water saving the dinmp model is formulated as follows 6a max f 1 j 1 17 i 1 3 a i j b i a i t 1 6 w i j t 2 b i t 1 6 w i j t c i objective of economic maximizing economic benefits 6b min f

mm is an interval with lower and upper bounds and are the upper and lower bounds respectively 4 2 model solution process zimmermann zimmermann 1978 proposed a fuzzy algorithm for solving multi objective optimization models the basic idea is to transform the multiobjective model into an equivalent specific single objective fuzzy optimization model on the basis of this fuzzy coordination method was developed guo and wen hua 2008 zhang et al 2018 to obtain satisfactory solutions in this study the fuzzy coordination method is used to solve the dinmp model the specific solution steps are shown as follows step 1 transform all interval number parameters in the developed model by a i a i δ a i r i where δ a i a i a i r i 0 1 step 2 transform each objective function into a model with minimized objective step 3 use lingo software to solve three objectives separately and obtain the maximum and minimum values of each objective f 1 max f 1 min f 2 max f 2 min f 3 max f 3 min step 4 use the min operator proposed by zimmermann to determine the membership function for the above three objective model 7 γ n x i 1 f n max f n x i f n max f n min 0 f n x i f n min f n min f n x i f n

decompose the above model into upper and lower sub models by using the two step method huang and loucks 2000 to solve the interval programming solve the upper and lower sub models separately and obtain the interval of the decision variables w 4 3 optimization results analysis and discussion fig 13 shows the upper and lower bound of the water allocation results net irrigation water per unit area for each month the results of the dinmp model are a set of interval numbers and the interval difference is mainly between 0 and 28 mm indicating that the model is sensitive to the input interval parameters and reflects the uncertainty existing in the real world the results show the spatial variability of crop water requirement and precipitation had a significant impact on the results moreover in different months the same crop in one irrigation area have different water allocation schemes that reflects not only the temporal variability of crop water requirements and precipitation but also the sensitivity of crops to water in different growth stages it is found that the larger water allocation will get more crop yield and more economic benefits but the yield and benefit per unit water will be reduced that is determined by the nonlinear water production function which reflects the marginal benefits in the real world after optimizing the limited agricultural water resources the results of each objective that the decision maker may care about are shown in table 5 the results can save irrigation water improve yield and benefit and thus these results may be helpful for decision makers the yield per unit irrigation water of each crop in each irrigation area is shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the irrigation water productivity of anyang no 1 and hongyazi no 5 are higher than others because they close to the upper reaches of the heihe river basin there is more precipitation and lower evapotranspiration meanwhile these two irrigation districts have smaller planting area lower total yield and less population and thus the importance weight of the irrigation area is lower further resulting in a less water allocation additionally due to the high level of precipitation in these irrigation areas the water allocation is greatly affected by the uncertainty of precipitation when the precipitation is higher the water requirement of the crop can be generally satisfied so the irrigation water allocation is reduced resulting in a high yield per unit irrigation water decision makers can consider increasing the planting area in such irrigation areas with large yield per unit irrigation water according to the actual situation in order to save water and increase profits comparing the results between the results of the multiobjective model and the model with every single objective respectively the comparison result is illustrated in table 6 it is found that each single objective model with a certain indicator can obtain the maximum value of that objective but can hardly take other significant factors into consideration however the dinmp model can coordinate three different objectives and obtain reasonable allocation schemes 5 conclusions based on the fitted mod16 pet data and the spatial interpolation results of precipitation data this study proposed a dinmp model with fully considering the spatiotemporal variability and uncertainties of the agricultural water management system in the real world to optimize limited irrigation water the decision makers can obtain the water allocation schemes of each crop from the research the following are the main conclusions 1 in recent years the evapotranspiration of the middle reaches of the heihe river basin has generally increased the mod16 pet values and the fao56 pm results have synchronized trends from 2004 to 2014 reflecting obvious periodicity after deterministic fitting r2 is 0 9011 the interval fitted results are obtained by using the confidence interval to improve the accuracy thus satellite pet and ground based et0 estimation were integrated to not only reflect the spatial and temporal variability but also guarantee the accuracy of the et0 moreover it reflects the spatiotemporal variability between the irrigation crop month and more information can be obtained from the interval results of the spatial evapotranspiration data 2 spatial interpolation was carried out using the meteorological stations in gansu province the precipitation in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin has an obviously spatial variability those areas close to the upper reaches have higher elevations are affected by the upstream meteorological station and have more precipitation 3 anyang and hongyazi irrigation areas are closer to the upper reaches of the heihe river basin the precipitation is relatively higher and the crop water requirement is lower than others therefore in the optimization results the yield per unit irrigation water is higher than other irrigation districts decision makers can consider increasing the planting area in such irrigation areas according to the actual situation 4 considering the spatiality of evapotranspiration and precipitation the results can be obtained by the dinmp model via fuzzy coordination method from the calculated results the economic benefit is 38 33 59 04 108 cny the water shortage in the crucial growth period is 320 80 349 33 104 m3 and the allocation of net irrigation water is 5 34 6 37 108 m3 the yield per unit irrigation water is 1 67 1 83 kg m3 compared with the current situation the yield per unit water increased by 0 50 0 66 kg m3 and the net irrigation water consumption reduced by 0 33 1 01 108 m3 the yield and benefit are significantly improved so the water allocation results are considered reasonable the interval based water allocation scheme can provide decision makers with more reasonable choices therefore the dinmp can help managers make reasonable and high resolution water allocation strategies for the middle reaches of heihe river basin and contribute to the environment restoration in the middle and lower reaches moreover changes of soil water content in this area was not considered in this optimal water allocation model and it would be our future research direction besides this method can be applied to other similar areas to improve agricultural water management

11027,shallow aquifers significantly impact crop growth as saturated soil conditions may occur canals are widely constructed in such areas to mitigate groundwater saturation or flooding we applied a simulation model to estimate the occurrence of root zone saturation root zone saturation index rzsi for agricultural crops and to identify factors that influence root zone saturation in a shallow coastal aquifer and canal system results indicated that groundwater modeling combined with multiple linear regression can relate the influencing factors and root zone saturation durations in low lying farmland adjacent to canal systems in our study most areas had a low rzsi but areas towards the northwest and southeast where the land surface elevation is generally low were predicted to have a greater rzsi in general positive correlations were found between the root zone saturation durations and rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation and average canal stages in areas where the higher rzsis were predicted rainfall amount played a more important role than antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage in determining the root zone saturation during the wet season while antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage played a more important role than rainfall amount during dry season correlations between the predicted root zone saturation duration and land surface elevation were negative and stronger during the wet season than the dry season and the correlations were stronger in the deep 0 61 cm root zone than with the shallow 0 18 cm root zone in area where the land surface elevation is relatively high the root zone saturation duration was not influenced by rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation or canal stage at least under the current management practices and climate conditions keywords root zone shallow aquifer groundwater model agriculture risk 1 introduction highly porous and shallow aquifers typically have greater hydrologic connectivity and response to recharge and surface water management practices than less porous and deeper aquifers therefore compared to deeper aquifers shallow aquifers often have higher susceptibility to root zone saturation due to aquifer fluctuations previous research has shown that groundwater systems in lowland karst formations are susceptible to root zone saturation and groundwater flooding due to low storage high transmissivity and strong interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies such as canals rivers and lakes ascott et al 2017 naughton et al 2017a b brenner et al 2018 groundwater flooding occurs when the water table in permeable and porous media such as soil or rocks rises to above the ground surface likewise shallow aquifers can significantly impact crop growth and vegetation development reilly et al 1994 zencich et al 2002 nayak et al 2006 rahman 2008 as saturated or near saturated soils in the rhizosphere of agricultural crops results in hypoxic or anoxic conditions and promote plant disease and or insect infestation ashraf 1999 kozdrój and van elsas 2000 rosenzweig et al 2002 lauer 2004 the extent to which root zone saturation injures agricultural crops is determined by several factors including the susceptibility of the crops species or cultivar to low soil oxygen content timing frequency air temperature soil type and duration of root zone saturation balerdi et al 2003 lauer 2004 while shallow aquifers and related hydrogeology contribute to root zone saturation additional characteristics such as rainfall intensity micro topography of land surface and distance to surface waters have also been identified as significant factors kisekka et al 2014 naughton et al 2017a land surface and subsurface processes are tightly coupled in regions with shallow groundwater tables ferguson and maxwell 2010 rihani et al 2010 fordyce 2014 kim and cha 2016 groundwater flooding may occur in such regions and poses unique challenges to policy makers and flood risk management agencies naughton et al 2017b groundwater flooding differs from surface water flooding in that the latter is mainly caused by heavy rain or large amount of water directly impacting the ground surface in such a way that rainfall rates exceed infiltration rates in contrast groundwater flooding is a relatively slow and long term processes compared to surface water flooding research efforts have investigated and mapped groundwater flood areas hughes et al 2011 mckenzie 2015 morris et al 2015 jimenez martinez et al 2016 kim and cha 2016 in these studies direct observations were supplemented with statistical and or modeling methods to predict the potential for groundwater flooding mckenzie 2015 modeling approaches range from simple gis based analysis to detailed numerical flow modeling for example kim and cha 2016 applied a numerical model to predict changes in flood risk due to riverside construction jimenez martinez et al 2016 predicted groundwater induced flooding using a frequency domain analysis to derive a transfer function the dynamics between shallow groundwater and surface waters are influenced by physical characteristics of the system physical characteristics such as topography rainfall intensity aspect clay content porosity hydraulic conductivity and antecedent groundwater tables can exert controlling influences on soil water content groundwater table elevation occurrence of a water table outcrop area where water table reaches the land surface and groundwater flooding grayson et al 1997 famiglietti et al 1998 western et al 1999 geroy 2010 gleeson et al 2011 fordyce 2014 condon and maxwell 2015 bresciani et al 2016 for example gleeson et al 2011 investigated factors that can influence groundwater behavior they used a dimensionless criterion water table ratio to classify topography controlled and recharge controlled water table regions over the contiguous united states their analysis indicated that recharge controlled groundwater tables are found in arid regions with mountainous topography and high hydraulic conductivity whereas topography controlled groundwater tables are found in humid regions with subdued topography and low hydraulic conductivity fordyce 2014 investigated the influence of rainfall intensity sea level rise urban land use and climate change on groundwater table and occurrence of groundwater flooding in a shallow coastal aquifer in south dunedin florida the study indicated a linear relationship between rainfall and the water table response when the groundwater response to extreme rainfall events was considered in combination with projections of elevated groundwater levels due to sea level rise the risk of groundwater flooding in south dunedin was exacerbated the study found that at silt dominated sites the groundwater table response to rainfall lagged and was prolonged whereas at sand dominated sites the water table responded and recovers quickly after rainfall shallow aquifers are often found in coastal areas or deltas where surface waters and groundwater table exchange is dynamic inclusion of different agricultural commodities and their response to saturated conditions created by these surface groundwater dynamics provides a complex system well suited for numerical model analyses an example where agriculture coexists with shallow aquifers is in southern florida usa c 111 agricultural basin the karst aquifer and surface waters in the basin dynamically interact and basin soils have high infiltration rates zhang et al 2017a canals structures and pumps which direct water to meet the needs of different users have significant effects on groundwater tables the combination of high infiltration rates and a shallow aquifer results in rainfall events contributing to a rising groundwater table in the soil profile if sufficient rainfall occurs groundwater tables or saturated soil conditions can rise into the plant root zone zhang et al 2017a previous work by zhang et al 2017a predicted groundwater table response to rainfall in this basin with an average response of 15 26 cm rise in groundwater table with a 3 cm rainfall event for highly responsive systems such as the c 111 agricultural basin surface and subsurface water management for specific objectives can be too complex to optimize by merely monitoring water levels numerical models offer the ability to explore a suite of scenarios to gain knowledge on system response to a variety of management options another strength of the numerical modeling approach is its ability to evaluate groundwater behavior at a high resolution previously kisekka et al 2014 applied a groundwater model to simulate aquifer response to large storms and a change in management of a structure in the c 111 agricultural basin while this study provided analysis of response in groundwater tables in six wells to one particular management modification at one canal station the modflow nwt groundwater model application did not include quantification of the root zone saturation or consider combinations of different rainfall and canal operational management scenarios in addition the study was limited to assessing the influence of land surface topography on root zone saturation and groundwater flooding at six specific well sites other factors such as rainfall intensity antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stages were not evaluated as far as we know limited work has been done to understand the controls on the root zone saturation in a shallow coastal aquifer with relatively flat topography and intensive surface water regulation structures our objectives were to classify the areas with greater or lesser likelihood of experiencing saturated soil conditions due to groundwater table rise in the plant root zone the objectives were achieved by developing a groundwater model that simulates the dynamic nature of surface waters and the shallow aquifer in the c 111 agricultural basin groundwater model simulations were designed considering different combination of rainfall and canal stages scenarios through which rzsi for the entire study area were identified our analyses also included identifying factors that influence root zone saturation and mapping locations that were predicted to be most suitable for particular crops in the study area by calculating correlation coefficients and implementing multiple regressions the methods presented provide an approach for simulating root zone saturation identifying significant factors that influencing root zone saturation at different sites and delineating optimal crop sites that can be used in agricultural and water management planning 2 study area and root zone saturation analysis methodology 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the c 111 agricultural basin in southern miami dade county florida encompassing 31 km2 fig 1 the site topography is essentially flat fig 2 the climate is maritime subtropical with a distinct annual pattern of wet and dry seasons duever et al 1994 the mean annual rainfall is 1 48 m with approximately 59 occurring during the wet season from june through october the agricultural soils in the study area were created from scarification of the underlying limestone bedrock and contain on average of 45 fine fractions and 55 gravel with depths of 10 to 20 cm kisekka et al 2013 the soils are generally classified as krome and chekika very gravely loam nobel et al 1996 potter et al 2007 kisekka et al 2013 the study area is located between the c 111 and c 111e canals managed by the south florida water management district sfwmd in the east of the everglades national park enp canal water levels are regulated by remotely operated spillways s177 s178 and s18c c 111 and c 111e join to become a single canal at the southern end the c 111 canal system provides flood protection and drainage for agricultural areas fig 1 biscayne aquifer underlies the study area and consists of porous limestone rock with hydraulic conductivities exceeding 10 000 m day merritt 1996 kisekka et al 2013 the high hydraulic conductivity of the biscayne aquifer contributes to strong interactions between groundwater and surface water flow miller 1988 miles and pfeuffer 1997 choi and harvey 2000 muñoz carpena et al 2005 and fluctuation of the shallow aquifer has been correlated with canal stage changes chin 2008 kisekka et al 2013 the aquifer is the source of water supply in southeastern florida and is one of the most permeable aquifers in the world parker et al 1955 during the study period august 2010 to december 2016 groundwater table elevations were generally between 0 2 and 1 7 m ngvd29 national geodetic vertical datum 2 2 agricultural production characteristics vegetable and tree crops such as corn green beans okra squash tomato and avocado are cultivated in the study area each plant s tolerance to root zone water saturation differs in addition the depth of plant roots varies depending on the plant type and soil depth as roots do not penetrate the underlying limestone found in the study area the limited soil depth 10 20 cm requires that additional root space be created for fruit trees by trenching into the limestone trenches are created by plowing into the limestone 0 5 to 0 65 m deep in rows and across rows in a perpendicular pattern trees are planted in the intersection of the trenches trenches provide additional space for roots to increase tree stability three example crops were selected based on their prominence in the study area and their susceptibility to root zone saturation avocado persea americana mill green beans phaseolus vulgaris l and tomato solanum lycopersicum l avocado is produced on 2 780 ha which is the most important fruit crops produced in miami dade county nass usda 2009 2013 evans and nalampang 2014 with regard to the amount and value of production avocado trees are one of the most sensitive woody tree fruit crops to root zone flooding or low soil oxygen content and were shown to experience reductions in net photosynthesis transpiration xylem sap flow tree growth and nutrition under such conditions ploetz and schaffer 1987 1992 schaffer 1998 ploetz and schaffer observed a strong synergistic effect between flooding and phytophthora root rot of avocado trees in south florida ploetz and schaffer 1987 1989 schaffer and ploetz 1989 phytophthora root rot caused by the pathogen phytophthora cinnamomi which thrives in poorly drained soils is the major disease and limitation to avocado production worldwide although the pathogen exists in avocado orchards in southern florida under non saturated soil conditions it is not a problem since under normal conditions these very porous soils drain quickly however when flooding occurs in avocado orchards in miami dade county that have phythtophora negative effects on tree physiology such as reductions in photosynthesis and transpiration occur much more rapidly and are more drastic than in flooded soils without phytophthora schaffer and ploetz 1989 reductions in tree growth and fruit yield and tree mortality in south florida avocado orchards after flooding have primarily attributed to the combination of low soil oxygen and phytophthora root rot schaffer et al 1992 whiley and schaffer 1994 sanclemente et al 2013 wolstenholme 2013 sanclemente et al 2014 a major production region for fresh market green beans also called snap beans is miami dade county with 11 050 ha comprising almost 60 of florida s production usda 2017 zhang et al 2017b green beans are grown from september to may in the c 111 agricultural basin zhang et al 2017b two to three different vegetable crops may be grown in rotation during that time period only four days of flooding can result in severely reduced growth and production of green beans in southern florida rao and li 2003 in the area of the c 111 basin tomatoes are grown from september to may with acreage varying between 1 480 and 5 420 ha since 1980 li et al 2017 tomatoes are particularly sensitive to flooding after only 24 h of flooding tomato plants exhibited reductions in photosynthesis by almost 30 bradford 1983 transpiration by 40 50 bradford and hsiao 1982 and crop yields by 40 hubbell et al 1979 yield losses of tomato were observed after 2 to 4 days of flooding depending on cultivar ezin et al 2010 bhatt et al 2015 reported that flooding of tomato fields in india for two to three days resulted in yield loss and plant death after six days of flooding no yield was obtained from tomato rootstock that was not grafted bhatt et al 2015 crop damage thresholds for avocado green beans and tomato were estimated based on review of the literature and agricultural conditions in the study area avocado crop damage was predicted to occur if saturated soil conditions last longer than five days 120 h for within the root zone ploetz and schaffer 1989 schaffer and ploetz 1989 schaffer et al 1992 whiley and schaffer 1994 schaffer et al 2013 because avocado is a perennial crop saturated soil conditions in avocado orchards can happen at any time during the year maximum depth of avocado roots defined as 61 cm below the soil surface whiley and schaffer 1994 wolstenholme 2013 green bean crop damage was predicted to occur if the soil was saturated greater than four days 96 h in florida rao and li 2003 during the dry season october to april the time of year that beans are typically grown in the area zhang et al 2017b tomato crop damage was predicted to occur if saturated soil conditions existed for more than one day 24 h hubbell et al 1979 bradford and hsiao 1982 bradford 1983 during the dry season when they are typically grown in the area of the c 111 basin li et al 2017 maximum root depths of green bean and tomato plants were defined as 18 cm below the soil surface due to the shallow soil depth in the study area brown et al 2018 root zone saturation was evaluated considering saturation in the green bean and tomato root zone 0 to 18 cm depth from the ground surface and saturation in the avocado root zone 0 to 61 cm depth from the ground surface the total number of days of saturated conditions was calculated as the days when saturation occurred within any portion of two depths in the simulated model 0 to 18 cm from the ground surface and 0 to 61 cm from the ground surface for the vegetable crops and avocado respectively thus soil saturation was considered to occur if groundwater tables rose into the root zone root zone saturations were classified as low medium or high based on the duration that the root zone was saturated to create a root zone saturation index rzsi table 1 2 3 modflow nwt model modflow nwt harbaugh 2005 was used to simulate the biscayne aquifer system down to the top of the tamiami formation which was treated as an intermediate confining unit the simulation period was from august 2010 to december 2016 the surface water routing swr code hughes et al 2012 2015 implicitly coupled to modflow nwt was used to simulate groundwater and surface water interaction one two dimensional flow and the management of surface water using control structures the modflow nwt model domain 12 000 m 7 000 m fig 1 was greater than the area used for rzsi evaluation 6 210 m 5 130 m fig 1 a uniform grid of 30 m 30 m was applied to simulate groundwater and surface water interaction while the widths of canals ranged from 5 to 9 m as indicated by genereux and guardiario 1998 zero difference between piezometers were observed at various depths in the biscayne aquifer so a 2d one layer flow system should be adequate to represent the subsurface aquifer system the elevation of the top of the aquifer was extracted from high resolution lidar data provided by sfwmd daily data were used for model input and output table 2 a one day stress period was used for the simulation period 2010 2016 the bottom of the aquifer was considered as a no flow boundary due to horizontal flow the general head boundary ghb package was used to simulate boundary conditions of the model the evapotranspiration evt and recharge rch packages were used to simulate evapotranspiration and water recharging the groundwater respectively the elevation of the evapotranspiration surface was set to the ground surface elevation and the evapotranspiration extinction depth was set to 3 7 m as estimated by chin 2008 canals were simulated with the swr package fig 1 the canal reach geometry was defined as a rectangular cross section the s177 and s178 control structures were simulated as a fixed gate spillway water elevations at s18c were used as the model s south constant head boundary the basic open close criteria for the structures at s177 and s18c were set to 1 3 1 1 m and 0 8 0 7 m respectively starting on august 16 2011 if the headwater stage at s178 was below 0 85 m both gates at s178 were closed and if the headwater stage at s178 was above 1 22 m one or two gates were opened up to 2 44 m the structure at s178 has been in the open position in the last 1 2 years the model was calibrated using 590 average groundwater table elevation observations selected from 59 days from wells c 111vc1 c 111vc2 c 111ak5 c 111ak6 c 111ae c 111aw c111w12 c 111w14 c 111w15 and c 111w17 from january 1 to december 31 2016 to calibrate hydraulic conductivity and specific yield parameters 17 zones were assigned manually to the aquifer system fig 1 to calibrate aquifer reach conductance canal bed conductance five zones were assigned to canals c 111 and c111 e hydraulic conductance of the interface between the aquifer cell and the boundary was also calibrated calibration was implemented with ucode 2005 poeter et al 2006 to obtain reasonable parameter estimates we added penalty criteria to the objective function based on prior estimates information of the parameter to regularize the solution parameter optimization of the inverse model carrera and neuman 1986 poeter and hill 1998 the objective function was defined as the difference between the simulated and calculated groundwater levels prior estimates of the parameter were based on hydraulic conductivity specific yield canal bed conductance and hydraulic conductance of the interface between the aquifer cell and the boundary values determined from field experiments or data published by other researchers fish and stewart 1991 genereux and guardiario 1998 bolster et al 2001 chin 2008 canal flows were calibrated manually for spillway gates s177 and s178 based on the gate operation criteria provided by the sfwmd and manning s roughness coefficient model validation was implemented using the groundwater table elevation data from wells c 111vc1 c 111vc2 c 111ak5 c 111ak6 c 111ae c 111aw c 111w12 c 111w14 c 111w15 c 111w16 and c 111w17 between august 13 2010 and december 31 2015 model fit was evaluated with fiteval ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 2 4 methods for rzsi for years 2010 2016 the modflow nwt model developed for the c 111 agricultural basin predicted saturated conditions in the root zones that occurred from 2010 to 2016 locations were identified where saturation and duration criteria met the crop thresholds for avocado green beans and tomato the total number of days exceeding the threshold for the three crops was then summed by location for each year a rzsi was developed with values of 1 low 2 medium and 3 high from days of saturation table 1 for a specific crop the three category rzsi level 1 to 3 for each year were averaged and evaluated using arcmap s geometric interval classification scheme this method identifies geometric intervals of a spatial data set by minimizing the sum of squares of the number of elements in each class sorichetta et al 2011 the three category rzsi values were then reclassified into five classes low 1 to 1 14 low medium 1 15 to 1 50 medium 1 51 to 2 50 medium high 2 51 to 2 86 and high 2 87 to 3 00 2 5 methods for rzsi for combined rainfall and canal operation scenarios to more accurately investigate different rainfall events and canal operations scenarios a modified modflow nwt model with 1 hour temporal resolution was created from the daily model developed in section 2 3 the hourly time step model was verified by comparing simulated and observed hourly groundwater table elevations at each observation well twelve scenarios in dry seasons and wet seasons were identified based on time series of actual groundwater table elevation canal stage and rainfall fig 3 scenarios were implemented by selecting a point in the time series that reflected average wet dry season groundwater table elevations and canal stages conditions and had a rainfall event on the first day to make the scenario simulations more comparable and realistic for each scenario evapotranspiration and model boundary conditions were not changed from measured data conditions but rainfall events and canal operations were replaced with specific scenarios the start date of each identified scenario is shown in fig 3 and table 3 for each of the 12 start times identified a combination of three rainfall scenarios and six canal stages were evaluated table 4 through a total of 216 scenario simulations based on sfwmd nexrad rainfall data from 2010 to 2016 ninety percent of daily rainfall amounts were less than 2 5 cm ninety eight percent of daily rainfall amounts were less than 5 6 cm and ninety nine percent were less than 7 6 cm we considered 2 5 to 7 6 cm as reasonable rainfall amounts to develop rainfall scenarios greater rainfall amounts would be less common and likely result in saturated root conditions in most locations and therefore reduce the ability to distinguish different rzsi values for each rainfall scenario six canal stage scenarios including one original actual canal stage scenario was applied the five remaining canal stage scenarios were adjusted by using the 10 25 50 75 and 90 distribution values of the measured canal stage in a specific year and season respectively at all canal stations fig 4 the simulation period length was seven days and rainfall events were assumed to occur on the first day of scenario simulation root zone saturation duration was summed for each grid cell over the next seven days thus if the soil root zone was saturated for the entire period 168 h of saturation would be recorded root zone saturation duration results from scenario simulations were also categorized into a rzsi table 1 methods were similar to that previous described using arcmap s geometric interval classification scheme correlation coefficient r between predicted saturation durations and land surface elevation were calculated over the entire rzsi analysis study area using the results from the 216 scenario simulations correlation coefficients between the predicted saturation durations after rainfall event and land surface elevation represent the average statistic over the entire root zone saturation analysis area multiple regression was performed to investigate the linear relationship among the predicted saturation durations d from 108 scenario simulations and the associated rainfall amount p antecedent groundwater table elevation gw and average canal stage sg at individual grid cell multiple regressions were developed for the dry season and wet season separately for each of which a total of 108 scenario simulations were created from six start times table 3 three rainfall amounts table 4 six canal stages table 4 multicollinearity was detected between gw and sg in the study area zhang et al 2017 thus multiple linear regressions between d p and gw and the regressions between d p and sg were performed separately to compare the effect of explanatory variables on response variables in multiple regressions variables were standardized by subtracting the means and the differences were then divided by the standard deviations so the coefficients were comparable a spatial map of the coefficients of the variables were created the reason that we did not use actual rainfall event and canal stage in all 216 scenario simulations in regression analysis was that if all of the 216 scenario simulations use actual rainfall event and canal stage the regression analysis designed to identify the relationships among root zone saturation index elevation rainfall amount canal stage and antecedent groundwater levels would not be comparable for example if we select an actual rainfall amount that was close to 2 5cm 5 1cm and 7 6cm in each scenario the corresponding peak times high water level stage duration average water level canal stage and temporal pattern of the actual canal stage evapotranspiration or model boundary conditions may not be comparable during seven days simulation period this will make the regression analysis difficult because more factors would need to be considered but in our study we mainly focused on how the elevation rainfall amount canal stage and antecedent groundwater levels were predicted to influence root zone saturation of each crops 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration hydraulic conductivity was estimated to be 11 060 18 000 m day for the study area table 5 previous studies have reported values of 12 110 m day and 12 770 m day for the study area kisekka et al 2013 2014 16 770 m day and 7 320 m day for aquifer pumping tests fish and stewart 1991 and 13 000 16 000 m day for miami limestone formation and 7 600 8 200 m day for thompson formation genereux and guardiario 1998 specific yield was estimated as 0 15 to 0 31 in our calibration table 5 which is close to the bolster et al 2001 estimate of 0 15 using data from a large scale canal drawdown experiment chin 2008 estimated a mean specific yield value as 0 26 0 03 for the south florida area aquifer reach conductance for canal sections s177h s177 t s18c s178 t and s178h were estimated as 33 h m2 day 243 h m2 day 243 h m2 day 247 h m2 day and 246 h m2 day respectively where h represents the length of the reach in m table 6 there were no available measurement values for aquifer reach conductance for the reaches of c 111 and c 111e genereux and guardiario 1998 estimated that canal bed conductance was 720 h m2 day for canal l 31 w from a canal drawdown experiment calibrated hydraulic conductance of the interface between the aquifer cell and the boundary was 2 000 m2 day 3 2 model validation results the daily timestep modflow nwt validation results suggest that the majority of evaluations of nse for wells were good to very good ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 fig 5 table 7 the hourly time step model was verified by comparing the simulated and observed hourly groundwater table elevations at each observation well fig 6 results indicated that the hourly model was able to simulate the groundwater table elevation in the study area accurately the modflow nwt hourly time step model was applied to investigate rainfall and canal scenarios 3 3 rzsi results for years 2010 2016 with daily timestep model the total number of days that the rzsi was predicted at the medium level or greater table 1 for the three crops was plotted for the study area fig 6 variability in results was observed among years for the three different indicator crops the average number of days of root zone saturation per year was determined showing similar trends for green bean and tomato criteria with increases for avocado criteria table 8 average results for the 0 61 cm zone showed that wet season consistently had greater root zone saturation than dry season these results were expected as rainfall and groundwater tables are typically greater during wet season the greater average values observed for 2012 was related to the higher canal stage observed at s177h compared to other years fig 3 the average days of root zone saturation between 2010 and 2016 for avocado green beans and tomato were categorized into an index with low medium and high levels table 1 the percent of the study area that met each index level was calculated by crops and years table 9 results indicated that a greater area had a high rzsi level during the 2015 dry season as compared to other years which was attributed to the occurrence of 25 cm of rainfall between december 2 and december 6 2015 medium levels of rzsi were less often observed than low or high levels this suggests that considering the 2010 2016 data locations were likely to be characterized as low or high rzsi consistently thus predicting the likelihood of a saturated condition to exist may be dependent predominantly on one factor spatial distribution maps of the five category rzsi levels for each crop indicated a predominant low rzsi fig 7 however some areas were identified with medium and high rzsi values particularly areas around c 111e and loveland slough and towards the southeastern portion of the study area were identified with greater rzsi levels the rzsi in areas along canals provides an example where groundwater surface water interactions within a karst system can serve to both exacerbate and mitigate rzsi the crop with the greatest spatial area with high rzsi was avocado due to its deeper roots and perennial growth cycle high rzsi areas for root zone saturation for green beans and tomato crops were not as great as avocado this was expected due to their dry season production and shallower roots of the two vegetable crops areas with high rzsi also coincided with the locations where the land surface elevations were lower figs 2 and 7 3 4 rzsi analysis with hourly timestep model and rainfall and canal scenarios rzsi analyses results based on the criteria defined in table 1 for avocado green beans and tomato are presented in fig 8 fig 8 represented the results of the combined scenarios for rainfall and canal and was organized based on rainfall amount however each map fig 8 was obtained from six scenarios with different canal stages table 4 there were clear spatial differences in the root zone saturation index for different crops under various rainfall scenarios areas toward the head water of canal c 111e around loveland slough and areas towards the southeast are at higher rzsi than those on the northeast and middle areas table 10 shows ratio of areas with model predicted rzsi of high h medium m and low l levels for each crop under different scenarios the percentage of area that was identified as high rzsi for tomato and bean ranged from 10 to 13 and for avocado ranged from 34 to 38 this was similar to the ranges observed with measured data from 2010 to 2016 which were 8 to 27 for tomato and bean and 34 to 51 for avocado tables 9 and 10 scenarios with the greatest rainfall amount simulated the highest rzsi due to the longest root zone saturation durations and the highest height of water table response fig 8 and table 10 also a spatial correlation between land surface elevation and rzsi can be observed from figs 2 and 8 3 5 root zone saturation and associated parameters trends correlations between the root zone saturation durations and land surface elevation were negative and ranged from 0 48 to 0 82 thus lower surface elevations had a greater rzsi highlighting the effect of micro topography on root zone saturation variation the correlation between the root zone saturation durations and land surface elevation were stronger during wet season than dry season which implies that elevation played a more important role in determining the root zone saturation during the wet season than during the dry season land surface elevation was more highly correlated with the 0 to 61 cm root zone saturation durations than with 0 to 18 cm root zone saturations table 11 the lower correlations for the 0 to 18 cm root zone could be attributed to the high infiltration rates of the soils in this region which allows water to drain quickly to the shallow water table as water infiltrates and combines with the groundwater the water table rises depending on the initial depth of the water table and the amount of rainfall received the rising water table will saturate a portion of the soil profile thus saturated conditions in the root zone are likely more closely related to groundwater table rise resulting from rainfall or other factors than the rainfall itself correlation results suggest this as lower soil depths 0 to 61 cm would become saturated before shallow depths 0 to 18 cm of the soil profile under this process linear relationship between root zone saturation d and corresponding rainfall event sizes p and antecedent water table elevations gw developed for each cell for datasets of wet and dry seasons is shown in fig 9 a and the linear relationship between root zone saturation d and corresponding rainfall event sizes p and average canal stage sg using canal stage at s177h s177 t s178h s178 t and s18ct for wet and dry seasons is shown in fig 9b c near the northwest and towards the southeastern portion of the rzsi analysis area the coefficient of variables p and gw were significant at the 5 significance level based on the f test fig 9a similarly the coefficients of variables p and sg were significant at the 5 significance level based on the f test in the same area fig 9b c in the northwest and towards the southeastern portion of the rzsi analysis area the r2 values of the multiple linear regression between d p and gw and r2 values of regression between d p and sg were greater than those for the other area fig 9 in general positive correlations were found among the d and p and gw in the northwest and southeast of the rzsi analysis area where the greater rzsi levels were predicted figs 7 9 similarly positive correlations were found among the d p and sg in the northwest and southeast of the rzsi analysis area in general the coefficients for p were greater than the coefficients for antecedent gw and sg during the wet season however the coefficients for p were lower than the coefficients for antecedent gw and sg during the dry season results imply that rainfall amount played a more important role in determining the root zone saturation duration in the wet season while antecedent groundwater table elevation and average canal stage were more influential during the dry season groundwater table elevations and canal stages were generally higher in the wet season than in the dry season thus the arrival of a rainfall event exacerbated the risk of root zone saturation with a greater possibility in the wet season which can explain the greater coefficients of p in that season the study area is characterized by a highly permeable karstic aquifer and the high infiltration rate combined with the shallow groundwater depth create a strong interaction among rainfall canal stage and groundwater table response this circumstance further supports how the risk of root zone saturation is more likely to be exacerbated by rainfall events in the wet season because d depended predominantly on p in the wet season and on gw and sg in the dry season low and high levels of rzsi were more often observed as compared to medium level which may indicate that a location was influenced by more than one factor in a previous study in the c 111 basis kisekka et al 2013 found that net recharge and canal stage had significant effects on temporal variation of soil and bedrock water contents while the effect of water table evaporation was not significant they also reported that the overall contribution of canal stage on the respective soil and bedrock water content time series was higher than that of net recharge where net recharge was calculated as the difference between rainfall amount and evaportranspiration however their conclusion was obtained only using dataset from three sites near wells ak3 ae and aw in a study conducted in another area in south dunedin florida fordyce 2014 observed a linear relationship between groundwater table responses and heavy rainfall events they also found that groundwater flooding could occur in response to rainfall events with return periods of 5 years or more at some sites in south dunedin in the areas where the coefficients of p gw and sg were not significant and r2 values were low or equal to zero the root zone saturation duration was not influenced by rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation or canal stage at least under the current management practices and climate conditions the location of the insensitive area coincides with the portions where the rzsi was low and the land surface elevation was relatively high figs 2 8 and 9 this circumstance also indicates that rzsi is very sensitive to land surface elevation in low lying shallow aquifer our results showed that for 0 18 cm root zones the insensitive area had land surface elevations higher than 1 92 m while for 0 61 cm root zones the insensitive area had elevations greater than 2 33 m kisekka et al 2013 also reported for the same study area the effect of canal stage on soil and bedrock water content was stronger at low elevation sites kisekka et al 2014 found that increases in the c 111 canal stage of 9 and 12 cm resulted in occasional root zone saturation of low elevation sites for 3 out of the 5 well sites used in the study well sites with ground surface elevation exceeding 2 m were predicted to not be affected by any of the incremental raises in canal stage this implies that high elevation with low sensitivity of root zone saturation duration to rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage may be selected as the optimal crop sites for 0 61 cm root zone depth the area where d was significantly influenced by sg at s18ct was larger than the area where d was significantly influenced by sg at other canal stations during the wet season fig 9 this trend was more obvious near the southeastern portion of the rzsi analysis area which implies that canal stage at the most southern station s18c influenced groundwater table elevations more obviously during wet season the methods and results presented in this study are applicable to highly porous and shallow aquifers which have greater hydrologic connectivity and response to recharge and surface water management practices these aquifer systems are often found in coastal areas or deltas where surface waters and groundwater table exchange is dynamic for areas with less porous and deeper aquifers in arid or semi arid areas the lower susceptibility to root zone saturation due to aquifer fluctuations might be observed and thus the method applied in this study might not be suitable especially in areas with deep groundwater tables and rare rainfall events 4 conclusion a modflow nwt model was developed and used to investigate spatial differences in root zone saturation index rzsi considering historical data and a range of rainfall events and canal stages we were able to capture a wide range of variation in rainfall amount canal stage and groundwater table elevation scenarios were investigated using modflow nwt to develop spatially distributed rzsi data the key conclusions of the modeling results from the calibrated daily time step model considering historical data for years 2010 to 2016 follows 1 during the wet season there was greater rzsi for the 0 61 cm zone than during the dry season greater predicted total number of root zone saturation days were observed in 2012 than the other years due to the relatively higher canal stages in 2012 a larger area was predicted with high rzsi during the 2015 dry season as compared to other years which could be attributed to the occurrence of 25 cm of rainfall between december 2 and december 6 2015 2 most areas had low rzsi lower occurrence of predicted root zone saturation but areas towards the southeast had higher rzsi greater occurrence of predicted root zone saturation than those on the northeast and middle areas the key conclusions of the modeling results from the hourly time step model for scenarios investigating a combination of rainfall and canal stage levels are 1 scenario with the greatest rainfall amount simulated the longest root zone saturation durations and the greatest spatial area with highest rzsi 2 negative correlations were found between the predicted root zone saturation duration and land surface elevation correlations were stronger during the wet season than the dry season land with lower elevations were predicted to have a greater rzsi land surface elevation was more highly correlated with the 0 61 cm root zone saturation durations than with the 0 18 cm root zone saturations 3 in general positive correlations were found between the root zone saturation durations and rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation and average canal stages in the northwest and southeast of the rzsi analysis area where the higher rzsis were predicted rainfall amount played a more important role than antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage in determining the root zone saturation during wet season antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage played a more important role than rainfall amount in determining the root zone saturation during the dry season 4 in the northeast and middle areas where the land surface elevation is generally high the root zone saturation duration was not influenced by rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation or canal stage at least under the current management practices and climate conditions areas with elevation greater than 1 92 m and 2 33 m may be selected as the optimal crop sites for 0 18 cm root zones and 0 61 cm root zones respectively 5 canal stage at the most southern station s18c influenced the root zone saturation duration of the 0 61 cm zone in the southeastern portion of the rzsi area more during the wet season than the other canal stage stations finally the study suggested that groundwater modeling combined with multiple linear regression can be used as preliminary tools to relate the impacts of land surface elevation rainfall amount and groundwater surface water management

11027,shallow aquifers significantly impact crop growth as saturated soil conditions may occur canals are widely constructed in such areas to mitigate groundwater saturation or flooding we applied a simulation model to estimate the occurrence of root zone saturation root zone saturation index rzsi for agricultural crops and to identify factors that influence root zone saturation in a shallow coastal aquifer and canal system results indicated that groundwater modeling combined with multiple linear regression can relate the influencing factors and root zone saturation durations in low lying farmland adjacent to canal systems in our study most areas had a low rzsi but areas towards the northwest and southeast where the land surface elevation is generally low were predicted to have a greater rzsi in general positive correlations were found between the root zone saturation durations and rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation and average canal stages in areas where the higher rzsis were predicted rainfall amount played a more important role than antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage in determining the root zone saturation during the wet season while antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage played a more important role than rainfall amount during dry season correlations between the predicted root zone saturation duration and land surface elevation were negative and stronger during the wet season than the dry season and the correlations were stronger in the deep 0 61 cm root zone than with the shallow 0 18 cm root zone in area where the land surface elevation is relatively high the root zone saturation duration was not influenced by rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation or canal stage at least under the current management practices and climate conditions keywords root zone shallow aquifer groundwater model agriculture risk 1 introduction highly porous and shallow aquifers typically have greater hydrologic connectivity and response to recharge and surface water management practices than less porous and deeper aquifers therefore compared to deeper aquifers shallow aquifers often have higher susceptibility to root zone saturation due to aquifer fluctuations previous research has shown that groundwater systems in lowland karst formations are susceptible to root zone saturation and groundwater flooding due to low storage high transmissivity and strong interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies such as canals rivers and lakes ascott et al 2017 naughton et al 2017a b brenner et al 2018 groundwater flooding occurs when the water table in permeable and porous media such as soil or rocks rises to above the ground surface likewise shallow aquifers can significantly impact crop growth and vegetation development reilly et al 1994 zencich et al 2002 nayak et al 2006 rahman 2008 as saturated or near saturated soils in the rhizosphere of agricultural crops results in

injures agricultural crops is determined by several factors including the susceptibility of the crops species or cultivar to low soil oxygen content timing frequency air temperature soil type and duration of root zone saturation balerdi et al 2003 lauer 2004 while shallow aquifers and related hydrogeology contribute to root zone saturation additional characteristics such as rainfall intensity micro topography of land surface and distance to surface waters have also been identified as significant factors kisekka et al 2014 naughton et al 2017a land surface and subsurface processes are tightly coupled in regions with shallow groundwater tables ferguson and maxwell 2010 rihani et al 2010 fordyce 2014 kim and cha 2016 groundwater flooding may occur in such regions and poses unique challenges to policy makers and flood risk management agencies naughton et al 2017b groundwater flooding differs from surface water flooding in that the latter is mainly caused by heavy rain or large amount of water directly impacting the ground surface in such a way that rainfall rates exceed infiltration rates in contrast groundwater flooding is a relatively slow and long term processes compared to surface water flooding research efforts have investigated and mapped groundwater flood areas hughes et al 2011 mckenzie 2015 morris et al 2015 jimenez martinez et al 2016 kim and cha 2016 in these studies direct observations were supplemented with statistical and or modeling methods to predict the potential for groundwater flooding mckenzie 2015 modeling approaches range from simple gis based analysis to detailed numerical flow modeling for example kim and cha 2016 applied a numerical model to predict changes in flood risk due to riverside construction jimenez martinez et al 2016 predicted groundwater induced flooding using a frequency domain analysis to derive a transfer function the dynamics between shallow groundwater and surface waters are influenced by physical characteristics of the system physical characteristics such as topography rainfall intensity aspect clay content porosity hydraulic conductivity and antecedent groundwater tables can exert controlling influences on soil water content groundwater table elevation occurrence of a water table outcrop area where water table reaches the land surface and groundwater flooding grayson et al 1997 famiglietti et al 1998 western et al 1999 geroy 2010 gleeson et al 2011 fordyce 2014 condon and maxwell 2015 bresciani et al 2016 for example gleeson et al 2011 investigated factors that can influence groundwater behavior they used a dimensionless criterion water table ratio to classify topography controlled and recharge controlled water table regions over the contiguous united states their analysis indicated that recharge controlled groundwater tables are found in arid regions with mountainous topography and high hydraulic conductivity whereas topography controlled groundwater tables are found in humid regions with subdued topography and low hydraulic conductivity fordyce 2014 investigated the influence of rainfall intensity sea level rise urban land use and climate change on groundwater table and occurrence of groundwater flooding in a shallow coastal aquifer in south dunedin florida the study indicated a linear relationship between rainfall and the water table response when the groundwater response to extreme rainfall events was considered in combination with projections of elevated groundwater levels due to sea level rise the risk of groundwater flooding in south dunedin was exacerbated the study found that at silt dominated sites the groundwater table response to rainfall lagged and was prolonged whereas at sand dominated sites the water table responded and recovers quickly after rainfall shallow aquifers are often found in coastal areas or deltas where surface waters and groundwater table exchange is dynamic inclusion of different agricultural commodities and their response to saturated conditions created by these surface groundwater dynamics provides a complex system well suited for numerical model analyses an example where agriculture coexists with shallow aquifers is in southern florida usa c 111 agricultural basin the karst aquifer and surface waters in the basin dynamically interact and basin soils have high infiltration rates zhang et al 2017a canals structures and pumps which direct water to meet the needs of different users have significant effects on groundwater tables the combination of high infiltration rates and a shallow aquifer results in rainfall events contributing to a rising groundwater table in the soil profile if sufficient rainfall occurs groundwater tables or saturated soil conditions can rise into the plant root zone zhang et al 2017a previous work by zhang et al 2017a predicted groundwater table response to rainfall in this basin with an average response of 15 26 cm rise in groundwater table with a 3 cm rainfall event for highly responsive systems such as the c 111 agricultural basin surface and subsurface water management for specific objectives can be too complex to optimize by merely monitoring water levels numerical models offer the ability to explore a suite of scenarios to gain knowledge on system response to a variety of management options another strength of the numerical modeling approach is its ability to evaluate groundwater behavior at a high resolution previously kisekka et al 2014 applied a groundwater model to simulate aquifer response to large storms and a change in management of a structure in the c 111 agricultural basin while this study provided analysis of response in groundwater tables in six wells to one particular management modification at one canal station the modflow nwt groundwater model application did not include quantification of the root zone saturation or consider combinations of different rainfall and canal operational management scenarios in addition the study was limited to assessing the influence of land surface topography on root zone saturation and groundwater flooding at six specific well sites other factors such as rainfall intensity antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stages were not evaluated as far as we know limited work has been done to understand the controls on the root zone saturation in a shallow coastal aquifer with relatively flat topography and intensive surface water regulation structures our objectives were to classify the areas with greater or lesser likelihood of experiencing saturated soil conditions due to groundwater table rise in the plant root zone the objectives were achieved by developing a groundwater model that simulates the dynamic nature of surface waters and the shallow aquifer in the c 111 agricultural basin groundwater model simulations were designed considering different combination of rainfall and canal stages scenarios through which rzsi for the entire study area were identified our analyses also included identifying factors that influence root zone saturation and mapping locations that were predicted to be most suitable for particular crops in the study area by calculating correlation coefficients and implementing multiple regressions the methods presented provide an approach for simulating root zone saturation identifying significant factors that influencing root zone saturation at different sites and delineating optimal crop sites that can be used in agricultural and water management planning 2 study area and root zone saturation analysis methodology 2 1 study

characteristics vegetable and tree crops such as corn green beans okra squash tomato and avocado are cultivated in the study area each plant s tolerance to root zone water saturation differs in addition the depth of plant roots varies depending on the plant type and soil depth as roots do not penetrate the underlying limestone found in the study area the limited soil depth 10 20 cm requires that additional root space be created for fruit trees by trenching into the limestone trenches are created by plowing into the limestone 0 5 to 0 65 m deep in rows and across rows in a perpendicular pattern trees are planted in the intersection of the trenches trenches provide additional space for roots to increase tree stability three example crops were selected based on their prominence in the study area and their susceptibility to root zone saturation avocado persea americana mill green beans phaseolus vulgaris l and tomato solanum lycopersicum l avocado is produced on 2 780 ha which is the most important fruit crops produced in miami dade county nass usda 2009 2013 evans and nalampang 2014 with regard to the amount and value of production avocado trees are one of the most sensitive woody tree fruit crops to root zone flooding or low soil oxygen content and were shown to experience reductions in net photosynthesis transpiration xylem sap flow tree growth and nutrition under such conditions ploetz and schaffer 1987 1992 schaffer 1998 ploetz and schaffer observed a strong synergistic effect between flooding and phytophthora root rot of avocado trees in south florida ploetz and schaffer 1987 1989 schaffer and ploetz 1989 phytophthora root rot caused by the pathogen phytophthora cinnamomi which thrives in poorly drained soils is the major disease and limitation to avocado production worldwide although the pathogen exists in avocado orchards in southern florida under non saturated soil conditions it is not a problem since under normal conditions these very porous soils drain quickly however when flooding occurs in avocado orchards in miami dade county that have phythtophora negative effects on tree physiology such as reductions in photosynthesis and transpiration occur much more rapidly and are more drastic than in flooded soils without phytophthora schaffer and ploetz 1989 reductions in tree growth and fruit yield and tree mortality in south florida avocado orchards after flooding have primarily attributed to the combination of low soil oxygen and phytophthora root rot schaffer et al 1992 whiley and schaffer 1994 sanclemente et al 2013 wolstenholme 2013 sanclemente et al 2014 a major production region for fresh market green beans also called snap beans is miami dade county with 11 050 ha comprising almost 60 of florida s production usda 2017 zhang et al 2017b green beans are grown from september to may in the c 111 agricultural basin zhang et al 2017b two to three different vegetable crops may be grown in rotation during that time period only four days of flooding can result in severely reduced growth and production of green beans in southern florida rao and li 2003 in the area of the c 111 basin tomatoes are grown from september to may with acreage varying between 1 480 and 5 420 ha since 1980 li et al 2017 tomatoes are particularly sensitive to flooding after only 24 h of flooding tomato plants exhibited reductions in photosynthesis by almost 30 bradford 1983 transpiration by 40 50 bradford and hsiao 1982 and crop yields by 40 hubbell et al 1979 yield losses of tomato were observed after 2 to 4 days of flooding depending on cultivar ezin et al 2010 bhatt et al 2015 reported that flooding of tomato fields in india for two to three days resulted in yield loss and plant death after six days of flooding no yield was obtained from tomato rootstock that was not grafted bhatt et al 2015 crop damage thresholds for avocado green beans and tomato were estimated based on review of the literature and agricultural conditions in the study area avocado crop damage was predicted to occur if saturated soil conditions last longer than five days 120 h for within the root zone ploetz and schaffer 1989 schaffer and ploetz 1989 schaffer et al 1992 whiley and schaffer 1994 schaffer et al 2013 because avocado is a perennial crop saturated soil conditions in avocado orchards can happen at any time during the year maximum depth of avocado roots defined as 61 cm below the soil surface whiley and schaffer 1994 wolstenholme 2013 green bean crop damage was predicted to occur if the soil was saturated greater than four days 96 h in florida rao and li 2003 during the dry season october to april the time of year that beans are typically grown in the area zhang et al 2017b tomato crop damage was predicted to occur if saturated soil conditions existed for more than one day 24 h hubbell et al 1979 bradford and hsiao 1982 bradford 1983 during the dry season when they are typically grown in the area of the c 111 basin li et al 2017 maximum root depths of green bean and tomato plants were defined as 18 cm below the soil surface due to the shallow soil depth in the study area brown et al 2018 root zone saturation was evaluated considering saturation in the green bean and tomato root zone 0 to 18 cm depth from the ground surface and saturation in the avocado root zone 0 to 61 cm depth from the ground surface the total number of days of saturated conditions was calculated as the days when saturation occurred within any portion of two depths in the simulated model 0 to 18 cm from the ground surface and 0 to 61 cm from the ground surface for the vegetable crops and avocado respectively thus soil saturation was considered to occur if groundwater tables rose into the root zone root zone saturations were classified as low medium or high based on the duration that the root zone was saturated to create a root zone saturation index rzsi table 1 2 3 modflow nwt model modflow nwt harbaugh 2005 was used to simulate the biscayne aquifer system down to the top of the tamiami formation which was treated as an intermediate confining unit the simulation period was from august 2010 to december 2016 the surface water routing swr code hughes et al 2012 2015 implicitly coupled to modflow nwt was used to simulate groundwater and surface water interaction one two dimensional flow and the management of surface water using control structures the modflow nwt model domain 12 000 m 7 000 m fig 1 was greater than the area used for rzsi evaluation 6 210 m 5 130 m fig 1 a uniform grid of 30 m 30 m was applied to simulate groundwater and surface water interaction while the widths of canals ranged from 5 to 9 m as indicated by genereux and guardiario 1998 zero difference between piezometers were observed at various depths in the biscayne aquifer so a 2d one layer flow system should be adequate to represent the subsurface aquifer system the elevation of the top of the aquifer was extracted from high resolution lidar data provided by sfwmd daily data were used for model input and output table 2 a one day stress period was used for the simulation period 2010 2016 the bottom of the aquifer was considered as a no flow boundary due to horizontal flow the general head boundary ghb package was used to simulate boundary conditions of the model the evapotranspiration evt and recharge rch packages were used to simulate evapotranspiration and water recharging the groundwater respectively the elevation of the evapotranspiration surface was set to the ground surface elevation and the evapotranspiration extinction depth was set to 3 7 m as estimated by chin 2008 canals were simulated with the swr package fig 1 the canal reach geometry was defined as a rectangular cross section the s177 and s178 control structures were simulated as a fixed gate spillway water elevations at s18c were used as the model s south constant head boundary the basic open close criteria for the structures at s177 and s18c were set to 1 3 1 1 m and 0 8 0 7 m respectively starting on august 16 2011 if the headwater stage at s178 was below 0 85 m both gates at s178 were closed and if the headwater stage at s178 was above 1 22 m one or two gates were opened up to 2 44 m the structure at s178 has been in the open position in the last 1 2 years the model was calibrated using 590 average groundwater table elevation observations selected from 59 days from wells c 111vc1 c 111vc2 c 111ak5 c 111ak6 c 111ae c 111aw c111w12 c 111w14 c 111w15 and c 111w17 from january 1 to december 31 2016 to calibrate hydraulic conductivity and specific yield parameters 17 zones were assigned manually to the aquifer system fig 1 to calibrate aquifer reach conductance canal bed conductance five zones were assigned to canals c 111 and c111 e hydraulic conductance of the interface between the aquifer cell and the boundary was also calibrated calibration was implemented with ucode 2005 poeter et al 2006 to obtain reasonable parameter estimates we added penalty criteria to the objective function based on prior estimates information of the parameter to regularize the solution parameter optimization of the inverse model carrera and neuman 1986 poeter and hill 1998 the objective function was defined as the difference between the simulated and calculated groundwater levels prior estimates of the parameter were based on hydraulic conductivity specific yield canal bed conductance and hydraulic conductance of the interface between the aquifer cell and the boundary values determined from field experiments or data published by other researchers fish and stewart 1991 genereux and guardiario 1998 bolster et al 2001 chin 2008 canal flows were calibrated manually for spillway gates s177 and s178 based on the gate operation criteria provided by the sfwmd and manning s roughness coefficient model validation was implemented using the groundwater table elevation data from wells c 111vc1 c 111vc2 c 111ak5 c 111ak6 c 111ae c 111aw c 111w12 c 111w14 c 111w15 c 111w16 and c 111w17 between august 13 2010 and december 31 2015 model fit was evaluated with fiteval ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 2 4 methods for rzsi for years 2010 2016 the modflow nwt model developed for the c 111 agricultural basin predicted saturated conditions in the root zones that occurred from 2010 to 2016 locations were identified where saturation and duration criteria met the crop thresholds for avocado green beans and tomato the total number of days exceeding the threshold for the three crops was then summed by location for each year a rzsi was developed with values of 1 low 2 medium and 3 high from days of saturation table 1 for a specific crop the three category rzsi level 1 to 3 for each year were averaged and evaluated using arcmap s geometric interval classification scheme this method identifies geometric intervals of a spatial data set by minimizing the sum of squares of the number of elements in each class sorichetta et al 2011 the three category rzsi values were then reclassified into five classes low 1 to 1 14 low medium 1 15 to 1 50 medium 1 51 to 2 50 medium high 2 51 to 2 86 and high 2 87 to 3 00 2 5 methods for rzsi for combined rainfall and canal operation scenarios to more accurately investigate different rainfall events and canal operations scenarios a modified modflow nwt model with 1 hour temporal resolution was created from the daily model developed in section 2 3 the hourly time step model was verified by comparing simulated and observed hourly groundwater table elevations at each observation well twelve scenarios in dry seasons and wet seasons were identified based on time series of actual groundwater table elevation canal stage and rainfall fig 3 scenarios were implemented by selecting a point in the time series that reflected average wet dry season groundwater table elevations and canal stages conditions and had a rainfall event on the first day to make the scenario simulations more comparable and realistic for each scenario evapotranspiration and model boundary conditions were not changed from measured data conditions but rainfall events and canal operations were replaced with specific scenarios the start date of each identified scenario is shown in fig 3 and table 3 for each of the 12 start times identified a combination of three rainfall scenarios and six canal stages were evaluated table 4 through a total of 216 scenario simulations based on sfwmd nexrad rainfall data from 2010 to 2016 ninety percent of daily rainfall amounts were less than 2 5 cm ninety eight percent of daily rainfall amounts were less than 5 6 cm and ninety nine percent were less than 7 6 cm we considered 2 5 to 7 6 cm as reasonable rainfall amounts to develop rainfall scenarios greater rainfall amounts would be less common and likely result in saturated root conditions in most locations and therefore reduce the ability to distinguish different rzsi values for each rainfall scenario six canal stage scenarios including one original actual canal stage scenario was applied the five remaining canal stage scenarios were adjusted by using the 10 25 50 75 and 90 distribution values of the measured canal stage in a specific year and season respectively at all canal stations fig 4 the simulation period length was seven days and rainfall events were assumed to occur on the first day of scenario simulation root zone saturation duration was summed for each grid cell over the next seven days thus if the soil root zone was saturated for the entire period 168 h of saturation would be recorded root zone saturation duration results from scenario simulations were also categorized into a rzsi table 1 methods were similar to that previous described using arcmap s geometric interval classification scheme correlation coefficient r between predicted saturation durations and land surface elevation were calculated over the entire rzsi analysis study area using the results from the 216 scenario simulations correlation coefficients between the predicted saturation durations after rainfall event and land surface elevation represent the average statistic over the entire root zone saturation analysis area multiple regression was performed to investigate the linear relationship among the predicted saturation durations d from 108 scenario simulations and the associated rainfall amount p antecedent groundwater table elevation gw and average canal stage sg at individual grid cell multiple regressions were developed for the dry season and wet season separately for each of which a total of 108 scenario simulations were created from six start times table 3 three rainfall amounts table 4 six canal stages table 4 multicollinearity was detected between gw and sg in the study area zhang et al 2017 thus multiple linear regressions between d p and gw and the regressions between d p and sg were performed separately to compare the effect of explanatory variables on response variables in multiple regressions variables were standardized by subtracting the means and the differences were then divided by the standard deviations so the coefficients were comparable a spatial map of the coefficients of the variables were created the reason that we did not use actual rainfall event and canal stage in all 216 scenario simulations in regression analysis was that if all of the 216 scenario simulations use actual rainfall event and canal stage the regression analysis designed to identify the relationships among root zone saturation index elevation rainfall amount canal stage and antecedent groundwater levels would not be comparable for example if we select an actual rainfall amount that was close to 2 5cm 5 1cm and 7 6cm in each scenario the corresponding peak times high water level stage duration average water level canal stage and temporal pattern of the actual canal stage evapotranspiration or model boundary conditions may not be comparable during seven days simulation period this will make the regression analysis difficult because more factors would need to be considered but in our study we mainly focused on how the elevation rainfall amount canal stage and antecedent groundwater levels were predicted to influence root zone saturation of each crops 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration hydraulic conductivity was estimated to be 11 060 18 000 m day for the study area table 5 previous studies have reported values of 12 110 m day and 12 770 m day for the study area kisekka et al 2013 2014 16 770 m day and 7 320 m day for aquifer pumping tests fish and stewart 1991 and 13 000 16 000 m day for miami limestone formation and 7 600 8 200 m day for thompson formation genereux and guardiario 1998 specific yield was estimated as 0 15 to 0 31 in our calibration table 5 which is close to the bolster et al 2001 estimate of 0 15 using data from a large scale canal drawdown experiment chin 2008 estimated a mean specific yield value as 0 26 0 03 for the south florida area aquifer reach conductance for canal sections s177h s177 t s18c s178 t and s178h were estimated as 33 h m2 day 243 h m2 day 243 h m2 day 247 h m2 day and 246 h m2 day respectively where h represents the length of the reach in m table 6 there were no available measurement values for aquifer reach conductance for the reaches of c 111 and c 111e genereux and guardiario 1998 estimated that canal bed conductance was 720 h m2 day for canal l 31 w from a canal drawdown experiment calibrated hydraulic conductance of the interface between the aquifer cell and the boundary was 2 000 m2 day 3 2 model validation results the daily timestep modflow nwt validation results suggest that the majority of evaluations of nse for wells were good to very good ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 fig 5 table 7 the hourly time step model was verified by comparing the simulated and observed hourly groundwater table elevations at each observation well fig 6 results indicated that the hourly model was able to simulate the groundwater table elevation in the study area accurately the modflow nwt hourly time step model was applied to investigate rainfall and canal scenarios 3 3 rzsi results for years 2010 2016 with daily timestep model the total number of days that the rzsi was predicted at the medium level or greater table 1 for the three crops was plotted for the study area fig 6 variability in results was observed among years for the three different indicator crops the average number of days of root zone saturation per year was determined showing similar trends for green bean and tomato criteria with increases for avocado criteria table 8 average results for the 0 61 cm zone showed that wet season consistently had greater root zone saturation than dry season these results were expected as rainfall and groundwater tables are typically greater during wet season the greater average values observed for 2012 was related to the higher canal stage observed at s177h compared to other years fig 3 the average days of root zone saturation between 2010 and 2016 for avocado green beans and tomato were categorized into an index with low medium and high levels table 1 the percent of the study area that met each index level was calculated by crops and years table 9 results indicated that a greater area had a high rzsi level during the 2015 dry season as compared to other years which was attributed to the occurrence of 25 cm of rainfall between december 2 and december 6 2015 medium levels of rzsi were less often observed than low or high levels this suggests that considering the 2010 2016 data locations were likely to be characterized as low or high rzsi consistently thus predicting the likelihood of a saturated condition to exist may be dependent predominantly on one factor spatial distribution maps of the five category rzsi levels for each crop indicated a predominant low rzsi fig 7 however some areas were identified with medium and high rzsi values particularly areas around c 111e and loveland slough and towards the southeastern portion of the study area were identified with greater rzsi levels the rzsi in areas along canals provides an example where groundwater surface water interactions within a karst system can serve to both exacerbate and mitigate rzsi the crop with the greatest spatial area with high rzsi was avocado due to its deeper roots and perennial growth cycle high rzsi areas for root zone saturation for green beans and tomato crops were not as great as avocado this was expected due to their dry season production and shallower roots of the two vegetable crops areas with high rzsi also coincided with the locations where the land surface elevations were lower figs 2 and 7 3 4 rzsi analysis with hourly timestep model and rainfall and canal scenarios rzsi analyses results based on the criteria defined in table 1 for avocado green beans and tomato are presented in fig 8 fig 8 represented the results of the combined scenarios for rainfall and canal and was organized based on rainfall amount however each map fig 8 was obtained from six scenarios with different canal stages table 4 there were clear spatial differences in the root zone saturation index for different crops under various rainfall scenarios areas toward the head water of canal c 111e around loveland slough and areas towards the southeast are at higher rzsi than those on the northeast and middle areas table 10 shows ratio of areas with model predicted rzsi of high h medium m and low l levels for each crop under different scenarios the percentage of area that was identified as high rzsi for tomato and bean ranged from 10 to 13 and for avocado ranged from 34 to 38 this was similar to the ranges observed with measured data from 2010 to 2016 which were 8 to 27 for tomato and bean and 34 to 51 for avocado tables 9 and 10 scenarios with the greatest rainfall amount simulated the highest rzsi due to the longest root zone saturation durations and the highest height of water table response fig 8 and table 10 also a spatial correlation between land surface elevation and rzsi can be observed from figs 2 and 8 3 5 root zone saturation and associated parameters trends correlations between the root zone saturation durations and land surface elevation were negative and ranged from 0 48 to 0 82 thus lower surface elevations had a greater rzsi highlighting the effect of micro topography on root zone saturation variation the correlation between the root zone saturation durations and land surface elevation were stronger during wet season than dry season which implies that elevation played a more important role in determining the root zone saturation during the wet season than during the dry season land surface elevation was more highly correlated with the 0 to 61 cm root zone saturation durations than with 0 to 18 cm root zone saturations table 11 the lower correlations for the 0 to 18 cm root zone could be attributed to the high infiltration rates of the soils in this region which allows water to drain quickly to the shallow water table as water infiltrates and combines with the groundwater the water table rises depending on the initial depth of the water table and the amount of rainfall received the rising water table will saturate a portion of the soil profile thus saturated conditions in the root zone are likely more closely related to groundwater table rise resulting from rainfall or other factors than the rainfall itself correlation results suggest this as lower soil depths 0 to 61 cm would become saturated before shallow depths 0 to 18 cm of the soil profile under this process linear relationship between root zone saturation d and corresponding rainfall event sizes p and antecedent water table elevations gw developed for each cell for datasets of wet and dry seasons is shown in fig 9 a and the linear relationship between root zone saturation d and corresponding rainfall event sizes p and average canal stage sg using canal stage at s177h s177 t s178h s178 t and s18ct for wet and dry seasons is shown in fig 9b c near the northwest and towards the southeastern portion of the rzsi analysis area the coefficient of variables p and gw were significant at the 5 significance level based on the f test fig 9a similarly the coefficients of variables p and sg were significant at the 5 significance level based on the f test in the same area fig 9b c in the northwest and towards the southeastern portion of the rzsi analysis area the r2 values of the multiple linear regression between d p and gw and r2 values of regression between d p and sg were greater than those for the other area fig 9 in general positive correlations were found among the d and p and gw in the northwest and southeast of the rzsi analysis area where the greater rzsi levels were predicted figs 7 9 similarly positive correlations were found among the d p and sg in the northwest and southeast of the rzsi analysis area in general the coefficients for p were greater than the coefficients for antecedent gw and sg during the wet season however the coefficients for p were lower than the coefficients for antecedent gw and sg during the dry season results imply that rainfall amount played a more important role in determining the root zone saturation duration in the wet season while antecedent groundwater table elevation and average canal stage were more influential during the dry season groundwater table elevations and canal stages were generally higher in the wet season than in the dry season thus the arrival of a rainfall event exacerbated the risk of root zone saturation with a greater possibility in the wet season which can explain the greater coefficients of p in that season the study area is characterized by a highly permeable karstic aquifer and the high infiltration rate combined with the shallow groundwater depth create a strong interaction among rainfall canal stage and groundwater table response this circumstance further supports how the risk of root zone saturation is more likely to be exacerbated by rainfall events in the wet season because d depended predominantly on p in the wet season and on gw and sg in the dry season low and high levels of rzsi were more often observed as compared to medium level which may indicate that a location was influenced by more than one factor in a previous study in the c 111 basis kisekka et al 2013 found that net recharge and canal stage had significant effects on temporal variation of soil and bedrock water contents while the effect of water table evaporation was not significant they also reported that the overall contribution of canal stage on the respective soil and bedrock water content time series was higher than that of net recharge where net recharge was calculated as the difference between rainfall amount and evaportranspiration however their conclusion was obtained only using dataset from three sites near wells ak3 ae and aw in a study conducted in another area in south dunedin florida fordyce 2014 observed a linear relationship between groundwater table responses and heavy rainfall events they also found that groundwater flooding could occur in response to rainfall events with return periods of 5 years or more at some sites in south dunedin in the areas where the coefficients of p gw and sg were not significant and r2 values were low or equal to zero the root zone saturation duration was not influenced by rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation or canal stage at least under the current management practices and climate conditions the location of the insensitive area coincides with the portions where the rzsi was low and the land surface elevation was relatively high figs 2 8 and 9 this circumstance also indicates that rzsi is very sensitive to land surface elevation in low lying shallow aquifer our results showed that for 0 18 cm root zones the insensitive area had land surface elevations higher than 1 92 m while for 0 61 cm root zones the insensitive area had elevations greater than 2 33 m kisekka et al 2013 also reported for the same study area the effect of canal stage on soil and bedrock water content was stronger at low elevation sites kisekka et al 2014 found that increases in the c 111 canal stage of 9 and 12 cm resulted in occasional root zone saturation of low elevation sites for 3 out of the 5 well sites used in the study well sites with ground surface elevation exceeding 2 m were predicted to not be affected by any of the incremental raises in canal stage this implies that high elevation with low sensitivity of root zone saturation duration to rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage may be selected as the optimal crop sites for 0 61 cm root zone depth the area where d was significantly influenced by sg at s18ct was larger than the area where d was significantly influenced by sg at other canal stations during the wet season fig 9 this trend was more obvious near the southeastern portion of the rzsi analysis area which implies that canal stage at the most southern station s18c influenced groundwater table elevations more obviously during wet season the methods and results presented in this study are applicable to highly porous and shallow aquifers which have greater hydrologic connectivity and response to recharge and surface water management practices these aquifer systems are often found in coastal areas or deltas where surface waters and groundwater table exchange is dynamic for areas with less porous and deeper aquifers in arid or semi arid areas the lower susceptibility to root zone saturation due to aquifer fluctuations might be observed and thus the method applied in this study might not be suitable especially in areas with deep groundwater tables and rare rainfall events 4 conclusion a modflow nwt model was developed and used to investigate spatial differences in root zone saturation index rzsi considering historical data and a range of rainfall events and canal stages we were able to capture a wide range of variation in rainfall amount canal stage and groundwater table elevation scenarios were investigated using modflow nwt to develop spatially distributed rzsi data the key conclusions of the modeling results from the calibrated daily time step model considering historical data for years 2010 to 2016 follows 1 during the wet season there was greater rzsi for the 0 61 cm zone than during the dry season greater predicted total number of root zone saturation days were observed in 2012 than the other years due to the relatively higher canal stages in 2012 a larger area was predicted with high rzsi during the 2015 dry season as compared to other years which could be attributed to the occurrence of 25 cm of rainfall between december 2 and december 6 2015 2 most areas had low rzsi lower occurrence of predicted root zone saturation but areas towards the southeast had higher rzsi greater occurrence of predicted root zone saturation than those on the northeast and middle areas the key conclusions of the modeling results from the hourly time step model for scenarios investigating a combination of rainfall and canal stage levels are 1 scenario with the greatest rainfall amount simulated the longest root zone saturation durations and the greatest spatial area with highest rzsi 2 negative correlations were found between the predicted root zone saturation duration and land surface elevation correlations were stronger during the wet season than the dry season land with lower elevations were predicted to have a greater rzsi land surface elevation was more highly correlated with the 0 61 cm root zone saturation durations than with the 0 18 cm root zone saturations 3 in general positive correlations were found between the root zone saturation durations and rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation and average canal stages in the northwest and southeast of the rzsi analysis area where the higher rzsis were predicted rainfall amount played a more important role than antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage in determining the root zone saturation during wet season antecedent groundwater table elevation and canal stage played a more important role than rainfall amount in determining the root zone saturation during the dry season 4 in the northeast and middle areas where the land surface elevation is generally high the root zone saturation duration was not influenced by rainfall amount antecedent groundwater table elevation or canal stage at least under the current management practices and climate conditions areas with elevation greater than 1 92 m and 2 33 m may be selected as the optimal crop sites for 0 18 cm root zones and 0 61 cm root zones respectively 5 canal stage at the most southern station s18c influenced the root zone saturation duration of the 0 61 cm zone in the southeastern portion of the rzsi area more during the wet season than the other canal stage stations finally the study suggested that groundwater modeling combined with multiple linear regression can be used as preliminary tools to relate the impacts of land surface elevation rainfall amount and groundwater surface water management

during the 2017 18 season was around 8 61 million hectares and the total production reached about 626 million metric tons water deficit plays a major role contributing to reduce sugarcane yields in the state of são paulo monteiro and sentelhas 2014 sugarcane water requirement varies with crop phenological growth stages and ranges between 1500 and 2000 mm year 1 monteiro 2009 it depends on the sugarcane cultivar soil and climate conditions doorenbos and kassam 1979 silva et al 2012 as well as on crop management planting and harvesting dates inman bamber and smith 2005 previous studies quantified sugarcane irrigation requirement sir in northwestern são paulo specifically in araçatuba region where an average water deficit of 442 and 490 mm year 1 was found by damião et al 2010 and santos et al 2013 respectively crop water balance models have been extensively used to calculate sir and they already proved to be firmly reliable on quantifying it under different environmental conditions monteiro and sentelhas 2014 2017 dias and sentelhas 2018 2019 on the other hand hydrological models can be used to estimate and evaluate the available surface water asw in a specific region mi and iica 2014 wolff et al 2014 the combination of both types of models allows to quantify the potential of irrigation of a given region by considering the sir and how much surface water is available when the crop is being cultivated in brazil the implementation of an irrigation project requires the approval by a government regulatory organization national water agency ana and such approval depends on the crop irrigation requirement and the surface water availability according to ana 2013 and wolff et al 2014 hydrological models allow to estimate the surface water availability based on the discharge of a watershed which varies temporally and spatially two common discharge rates are used to estimate the surface water availability the ecological discharge q7 10 and the multiannual average discharge q vestena et al 2012 wolff et al 2014 the first is defined as the lowest average discharge during 7 day period with an average recurrence of 10 years and the second is a combined average during one year of measurements in the state of são paulo the total volume of water that can be withdrawn from a watershed for irrigation purposes is 50 of q7 10 ana 2013 fehidro 2012 to increase the asw a common practice disseminated between farmers is the construction of a water dam at the farm level or near to the production site to increase its water storage capacity when there is a water dam the asw increases and the estimation of the water available for irrigation purposes can be calculated as 60 of q fehidro 2012 therefore these discharges combined with sir are suitable variables to assess the potential of irrigation of a given region considering the importance of sugarcane production the benefits of irrigation for this crop and the relevance on the rational use of water resources this study aimed to evaluate the potential of sugarcane irrigation in northwestern são paulo brazil with that it is expected to answer common and lingering questions asked by farmers private sector and government authorities is it necessary to irrigate sugarcane in this region if so do we have enough surface water therefore the specific objectives of the study were i to estimate the annual sir in araçatuba northwestern são paulo ii to identify the asw based on q7 10 and q and iii to evaluate the potential of sugarcane irrigation for each municipality within the region based on different scenarios by dividing asw to sir 2 material and methods 2 1 study region the studied region is known as araçatuba latitude 20 30 00 s 21 36 00 s longitude 50 06 00 w 51 30 00 w and altitude 295 465 meters a m s l and it encompasses 33 municipalities in northwestern são paulo brazil fig 1 during the 2017 18 season the total sugarcane area in this region was around 606 3 thousand hectares which represented 8 of total sugarcane area in the state the region s mean of maximum air temperature is 30 5 2 1 c mean of minimum air temperature is 18 4 2 7 c and rainfall 1301 175 mm year 1 and has its climate classified as tropical with dry winter aw alvares et al 2013a b this region was selected due to its continuous expansion on sugarcane fields during the last decade silva et al 2012 and to the presence of a significant sir monteiro and sentelhas 2014 2 2 calculation of sir and asw sir was calculated based on the crop water balance determined by the method of thornthwaite and mather 1955 the daily water balance was calculated for 33 years 1980 2013 this water balance method has been extensively used in brazil providing reliable results for sugarcane as presented by monteiro and sentelhas 2014 2017 and dias and sentelhas 2017 2018 2019 the input variables for the crop water balance were rainfall r crop evapotranspiration etc and the soil water holding capacity swhc considering this method the outputs were soil water availability swa actual evapotranspiration eta water deficit wd and water surplus ws the sir in the present study was considered as the accumulated wd along the year for each location the final sir was calculated for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 the percentile was used to represent the sir for each municipality considering a daily scale and a time span of 33 years for instance a percentile of 60 means that 60 of the sir values are below this percentage score for each percentile a map was generated using the procedures that will be presented on the following subsections once these maps were created the values of sir for the pixels 90 x 90 m in a given municipality was extracted and described as the annual sir mm year 1 daily rainfall data were obtained from 28 meteorological stations from national water agency ana fig 1 the gaps observed in these time series were filled using the interpolated grid data generated by xavier et al 2016 rainfall from this grid data resolution 0 25 x 0 25 has been widely used by the scientific community souza et al 2016 monteiro et al 2017 paredes trejo et al 2017 although there are some uncertainties the use of this type of grid is very advantageous due to its temporal and spatial continuity melo et al 2015 the rainfall data used to calculate the water balance was adjusted to the effective rainfall which corresponds to 80 of the original data as proposed by sampaio et al 2000 this accounts for the effective amount of water that reaches the soil surface and contributes for the crop water balance the crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration eto by crop coefficient kc reference evapotranspiration was estimated by the penman monteith method eto allen et al 1998 which is a method extensively used around the world having a close relationship with eto measurements obtained from lysimeters allen et al 1989 pereira et al 2002 eto was extracted from the interpolated ground based grid xavier et al 2016 using the geographical coordinates of each meteorological station the kc values for each sugarcane phenological stage was weighted considering three different planting dates along the year april july and october which resulted in an average kc of 0 91 since in the sugarcane field there are several areas under different phenological stages at the same time the kc for each sugarcane phenological stage ranged from 0 5 to 1 2 doorenbos and kassam 1979 monteiro and sentelhas 2014 dias and sentelhas 2017 the predominant soils in the araçatuba region are typical ferralsols and entisols rossi and de oliveira 2000 which have an average swhc of 70 mm for 1 m depth according to the assessments of prado 2013 a digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm from national imagery and mapping agency nima and national aeronautics and space administration nasa was used to obtain values of latitude longitude and altitude for the studied region the srtm images for the brazilian territory are available in miranda 2005 asw was estimated using two discharges ecological discharges q7 10 and multiannual average discharge q both in m³ s 1 km 2 these information were obtained from wolff et al 2014 who proposed a new hydrological regionalization for the state of são paulo based on 176 fluviometric stations spread throughout the state with time series longer than 15 years for each fluviometric station one point location the authors calculated q7 10 and q m³ s 1 and divided it to the respective water basin area km2 these discharges measured in m3 s 1 km 2 were interpolated by inverse distance weighted idw method wolff et al 2014 to create a map of discharge as there are not enough points of q7 10 and q measurements in our study region we decided to follow with the interpolated from wolff et al 2014 later the mean value of these discharges was obtained by averaging the pixel s values within the boundaries of each municipality mean discharge values were transformed to annual asw mm year 1 and multiplied by 50 of q7 10 and 60 of q considering the amount of water that is available for irrigation purposes ana 2013 fehidro 2012 as asw was estimated based on the discharge rates it only includes water bodies that are connected with region or municipality watershed in other words we are not accounting for impounded water reservoirs and groundwater that are not connect with the watershed of the studied region the sir and the discharge values for each municipality were obtained using the tool zonal statistics as table available in the arcgis 10 5 this tool allows the extraction of the mean value of the pixels that are located within the boundaries of each municipality 2 3 multivariate linear interpolation and potential of sugarcane irrigation scenarios a multivariate linear approach was used to spatialize sir for the municipalities in the assessed region the model was developed using the map algebra tool which is available with the spatial analyst module an extension of the arcpy python site package both available with a licensed gis software arcgis 10 5 the multivariate linear analysis eq 1 was used to create different maps of sir based on the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 eq 1 is described below 1 s i r a b ф c λ d μ e ф λ f ф μ g λ μ h ф 2 i λ 2 j μ 2 e e r r o r where sir is the sugarcane irrigation requirement ф is the latitude decimal degrees λ is the longitude decimal degrees μ is the altitude meters a is the linear coefficient of the equation b c d e f g h i and j are the angular coefficients and eerror is the model error the values of latitude longitude and altitude were extracted from the digital elevation map dem srtm miranda 2005 using the function raster to point embedded on arcgis 10 5 software for each meteorological station values of latitude longitude and altitude were extracted from its individual raster layer respectively sir maps were created following a similar procedure used by monteiro and sentelhas 2014 and yamada and sentelhas 2014 the final sir map method was a summation of the interpolated layer using the multivariate linear analysis and an error map which was generated using the residual error of the multivariate linear equation universal kriging with default parameters from arcgis 10 5 was used to calculate the error map the potential sugarcane irrigation scenarios were created dividing the asw for the different discharges q7 10 and q by sir for each of percentile level 60 75 80 and 90 both in mm year 1 as follows 2 scenarios asw discharge sir perc level 2 4 validation of the multivariate linear model the multivariate linear model validation was done to ensure its reliability to estimate sir 60 75 80 and 90 and the maps of discharge q7 10 and q the multivariate linear model performance was analyzed by evaluating the following indices and errors me mean error mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute percentage error mape which are presented in below 3 r 2 s s r s s t 4 m e 1 n n 1 y i x i 5 m a e 1 n n 1 y i x i 6 r m s e 1 n y i x i 2 7 m a p e 100 n n 1 y i x i y i where x i is the calculated variable sir y i is the estimated value by the multivariate linear model ssr is the sum squared regression error and sst sum squared total error n is the number of locations considered for validation purposes n 7 further analysis to measure the performance of the models was done using the performance index pi this coefficient corresponds to the product of pearson s correlation coefficient r and the agreement index d willmott et al 1985 pi is an update of the confidence index c camargo and sentelhas 1997 and a combination of accuracy and precision analysis alvares et al 2013a b these indices are calculated as follows 8 r i 1 n x i x i y i y i i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 9 d 1 i 1 n y i x i i 1 n y i x i x i x i 2 10 p i d r where x i and y i are the average of the calculated and estimated values respectively the interpretation of pi can be done as follows pi 0 75 optimum performance 0 6 pi 0 75 very good performance 0 45 pi 0 60 good performance 0 3 pi 0 45 tolerable performance 0 15 pi 0 30 poor performance 0 pi 0 15 bad performance and pi 0 very bad performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 multivariate linear models and validation table 1 presents all the coefficients of the multivariate linear models used to calculate the sir for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 the r pearson s correlation obtained from the multivariate linear models fitting are in the range of other similar studies that used the same modeling approach to interpolate meteorological variables monteiro and sentelhas 2014 yamada and sentelhas 2014 soares colletti et al 2016 as showed in table 1 the sir map for percentile 60 had the lowest r 0 73 percentile 75 had r 0 76 and for the 80 and 90 the and r 0 82 which are acceptable since geographical coordinates and altitude can explain more than 70 of sir variation in the region such kind of method for a climatic related variables is becoming usual in the field of agrometeorology once it allows to represent the spatial variability of a given variable in a more accurate way astolpho et al 2005 feitoza et al 2008 alvares et al 2013a b monteiro and sentelhas 2014 yamada and sentelhas 2014 soares colletti et al 2016 as presented in table 2 the overall validation analysis showed that the values of me mae rmse and mape were relatively low the accuracy and precision for all models were moderate to high as the agreement index ranged from 0 59 to 0 92 and pearson s correlation for all models were higher than 0 80 based on the pi there was some variability on how the model performed the maps created for sir based on percentiles of 60 pi 0 50 and 75 pi 0 56 had a good performance the sir maps for percentile 80 pi 0 64 and 90 pi 0 64 were classified as a very good performance 3 2 sir and asw data table 3 shows for each municipality the annual sir mm year 1 for each percentile level and annual asw mm year 1 based on 50 q7 10 and 60 q discharges the values from table 3 were used to create the scenarios presented in fig 3 and fig 4 fig 2 presents the spatial distribution of the four different percentiles of the sir based on a 33 year period the interpolated variable presented the same spatial variability pattern for all the percentiles the lowest values of sir are observed at southeast of araçatuba region and these values increase towards the northwest direction for percentile of 60 fig 2a the average sir was 562 mm year 1 ranging from 505 mm year 1 for braúna 7 to 603 mm year 1 for itapura 18 for percentile 75 fig 2b the average sir was 750 mm year 1 ranging from 690 mm year 1 for braúna 7 to 806 mm year 1 for itapura 18 for percentile of 80 fig 2c the average was 932 mm year 1 ranging from 862 mm year 1 to 1012 mm year 1 respectively for the same locations whereas for percentile of 90 fig 2d sir average was 1062 mm year 1 ranging from 997 mm year 1 for gabriel monteiro 13 to 1141 mm year 1 for itapura 18 previous studies estimated the sir between 442 and 490 mm year 1 at two different municipalities in the araçatuba region damião et al 2010 santos et al 2013 our study shows values ranging between 591 and 601 mm year 1 for neighboring municipalities sir 60 the differences could be explained by the water balance time scale adopted that was monthly in the previous studies and daily in present analysis also our study considered an average weighted kc 0 91 while these referenced authors above used different values of kc based on a 12 month sugarcane cycle varying the kc with the crop phenology monteiro and sentelhas 2014 estimated the average sir in the municipality of araçatuba 3 and found values between 141 and 260 mm year 1 these authors used the mean sir and this could explain the difference found in relation to our study which was 561 mm year 1 sir percentile 60 vianna and sentelhas 2015 estimated the annual sir for three municipalities nearby our studied region named votuporanga presidente prudente and catanduva and found values of 358 266 and 309 mm year 1 respectively similarly dias and sentelhas 2018 estimated the annual average irrigation requirement for locations in the northwest and west of são paulo state and found 668 mm year 1 for votuporanga and 515 mm year 1 for presidente prudente these discrepancies when compared to our analysis are mainly related to the differences on the methods used it is also important to highlight that these studies had a broader assessed area including the entire state of são paulo as presented by monteiro and sentelhas 2014 and other states that cultivate sugarcane in brazil as presented by vianna and sentelhas 2015 and dias and sentelhas 2018 none of these studies presented an analysis specifically for a micro region which also explains part of the observed differences even considering the dissimilarities showed here all studies are aligned with the results obtained in our analysis showing that sugarcane has a relevant irrigation requirement in the araçatuba region justifying a study related to the potential of irrigation annual asw derived from the system proposed by wolff et al 2014 table 3 was calculated considering the discharges q7 10 and q variability along the studied region and interpolated using idw method the average values considering all the municipalities for 50 of q7 10 and 60 of q were respectively 35 and 164 mm year 1 which are much lower than the values of sir previously presented 3 3 scenarios of the potential of sugarcane irrigation the scenarios of the potential of sugarcane irrigation were created dividing asw by sir this ratio expresses the amount of the sir that is covered by the asw fig 3 q7 10 and fig 4 q present these scenarios for each municipality the municipalities with higher potential of irrigation are located on the southeast of the studied region for all scenarios this is a consequence of lower sir and higher aws monteiro and sentelhas 2014 found the same spatial distribution of the irrigation requirement for full irrigated sugarcane in the araçatuba region with lower values of sir at southeast and higher values towards northwest the potential of sugarcane irrigation based on the scenarios created using the 50 of q7 10 had a weighted average of 6 4 3 and 2 5 respectively for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 for any of the municipalities the potential of irrigation was higher than 15 of the annual sir the highest value was found in santópolis do aguapeí 29 with 11 sir 60 and the lowest in muritinga do sul 22 with 1 9 sir 90 on the other hand when considering 60 of q discharge assuming a presence of a water dam at the farm level or nearby there are several municipalities with potential to irrigate sugarcane higher than 25 of sir the weighted average values were 28 21 17 and 14 respectively for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 the highest value was 38 sir 60 for piacatu 26 and the lowest for castilho 10 with 23 sir 90 detailed information for each municipality and for all the scenarios can be found in table 4 the potential of sugarcane irrigation is expressed by the ratio between asw and sir and we have not considered the sugarcane production area for each municipality if we have had considered the sugarcane area for each municipality individually the potential of sugarcane irrigation could be seen from two different perspectives considering the irrigation of the entire sugarcane area and as consequence supplying water to only a portion of the sir or cover the sir thoroughly and irrigate only a portion of the sugarcane area questions regarding which standpoint should be considered can be answered with studies like the one conducted by dias and sentelhas 2019 these authors estimated the average sugarcane relative yield increments for different levels of water supply and as expected increasing irrigation contributed to increase the relative yield increment on table 4 it is shown that the potential of irrigation was higher than 35 only for a few municipalities when considering the percentiles of 60 and 75 and the annual average discharge q the highest percentile 90 had the smallest potential of irrigation for both discharges which means that the scenarios indicate that there are not enough surface water resources to irrigate sugarcane covering 100 of the crop irrigation requirement this study brings a novel approach on how climate data combined with agrometeorology remote sensing dem and gis tools can be used to address a major agricultural challenge such as the use of water resources to improve agricultural production the results of the sir analysis showed that sugarcane is grown under an adverse environment where there is lack or irregular amounts of rainfall which explains why local farmers and sugar mills are frequently considering the possibility of irrigating their sugarcane fields nevertheless there are only a few studies evaluating the sir on this region dias and sentelhas 2018 vianna and sentelhas 2015 monteiro and sentelhas 2014 and from our knowledge there is no study that estimates the sir and the asw to determine how much area can be irrigated from this perspective our study is a first step on filling the knowledge gap regarding the potential of sugarcane irrigation at this region the novelty of this study also lies on asnwering long standing questions is it necessary to irrigate sugarcane on this region if so do we have enough surface water the present study addressed both questions as demonstrated on table 3 figs 3 and 4 in fact there is a need for irrigating sugarcane in araçatuba region and for all the municipalities the annual asw is not enough to supply the whole crop irrigation requirement a comparable procedure was used by mi and iica 2014 to analyze the potential of irrigated croplands in brazil the authors used different values of discharges combined with water basin areas to calculate the water resources available to irrigation activities it is also important to highlight that our results are grounded on how much water is allowed to be withdrawn from the watershed 50 of q7 10 and 60 q ana 2013 fehidro 2012 and specially for q which considers a water dam close by or at farm level to increase water storage we should keep in mind that 60 of q is an estimation and that it can vary significantly from place to place also it is unrealistic that every land of sugarcane will have a nearby dam to supply water to irrigation even though 60 of q is based on an estimation it helps to understand that there is not sufficient asw to supply the total annual sir therefore the results of the present study can help government agencies and other stakeholders to manage irrigation plans in a more rational manner even considering the relevant aspects of this study it has limitations the constraints found are mainly related to the lack of a consistent and reliable time series data necessary to calculate the asw beyond that it is worth mentioning that the decision on how much water can be applied to a certain crop production site depends on a variety of factors such as electricity availability slope of the terrain government license approvals and others which are not addressed on our study also an irrigation project contemplates an economic analysis social and environmental impacts logistics and operational issues as highlighted by mi and iica 2014 although this study was done for a specific region the same approach could be used in other parts of the world further improvements can be done adding the effects of the terrain slope on run off considering the total cultivated crop area for each municipality and more prominently adding points of discharges values coupled with the water basin area for each municipality 4 conclusions our study showed that there is a significant annual sugarcane water deficit on the araçatuba region in northwestern sao paulo which is lower on southeast and increases towards the northwest part of this region the regional average sir for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 are respectively 562 750 932 and 1062 mm year 1 the percentiles encompass all daily sir for each of the four levels of probability the asw was calculated based on q7 10 and q and the regional averages were 35 and 165 mm year 1 respectively according with the modeled scenarios supplying the sir completely is highly implausible the region weighted average potential for sugarcane irrigation considering q7 10 were 6 4 3 and 2 5 and for q were 28 21 17 and 14 respectively for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 also this study shows that the combination of a crop water balance model and a hydrological model together with remote sensing and gis tools can be used to answer lingering questions regarding the necessity to irrigate sugarcane and the surface water availability 
11028,water deficit is one of the main limiting factors for sugarcane production around the world sugarcane yield is negatively affected by drought and irrigation can be an alternative to improve yield rates this study aimed to calculate the sugarcane irrigation requirement sir the available surface water asw for irrigation and create scenarios of the potential of sugarcane irrigation in northwestern são paulo brazil by integrating agrometeorological and gis tools this region was chosen due to its continuous expansion of sugarcane area and the presence of a significant water deficit during the year sir was calculated on a daily scale by implementing the crop water balance using rainfall and crop evapotranspiration etc of 28 locations for a 33 year time series 1980 2013 etc was calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration estimated by penman monteith equation and an average weighted crop coefficient kc the potential sugarcane irrigation was calculated dividing asw which was based on the ecological discharge q7 10 and multiannual average discharge q by the sir considering four percentiles 60 75 80 and 90 a multivariate linear approach was used to create maps of sir which varied between municipalities and had weighted average values for the entire region of 562 750 932 and 1062 mm year 1 respectively for the following percentiles 60 75 80 and 90 the potential for sugarcane irrigation were higher for q when compared to q7 10 for all percentiles this study pointed out that sugarcane should be irrigated in the araçatuba region northwestern são paulo brazil nonetheless in most of the scenarios considered it would only be possible when supplying part of the sir keywords saccharum spp irrigation requirement geospatial modeling irrigation potential 1 introduction the world rising demand for sugar and ethanol increased the need for an intensification of sugarcane production currently this intensification is mainly driven by crop area expansion rather than yield improvements however this expansion is occurring to marginal areas e g northwestern são paulo where more intense water deficit threatens the crop in these marginal areas sugarcane production can be intensified through irrigation monteiro and sentelhas 2014 silva et al 2014 dias and sentelhas 2019 nonetheless the use of natural water resources for irrigation purposes should be carefully analyzed as water resources preservation is a worldwide concern fao 2016 in addition current scenarios of climate change contribute to upsurge the need to preserve natural water bodies through rational irrigation planning cardozo et al 2016 sugarcane saccharum spp production has a great importance for the brazilian economy brazil is the world s largest sugarcane grower and são paulo state is responsible for more than 50 of the national total production conab 2018 usda 2018 according to the national food supply company conab 2018 the estimated total land cultivated with sugarcane during the 2017 18 season was around 8 61 million hectares and the total production reached about 626 million metric tons water deficit plays a major role contributing to reduce sugarcane yields in the state of são paulo monteiro and sentelhas 2014 sugarcane water requirement varies with crop phenological growth stages and ranges between 1500 and 2000 mm year 1 monteiro 2009 it depends on the sugarcane cultivar soil and climate conditions doorenbos and kassam 1979 silva et al 2012 as well as on crop management planting and harvesting dates inman bamber and smith 2005 previous studies quantified sugarcane irrigation requirement sir in northwestern são paulo specifically in araçatuba region where an average water deficit of 442 and 490 mm year 1 was found by damião et al 2010 and santos et al 2013 respectively crop water balance models have been extensively used to calculate sir and they already proved to be firmly reliable on quantifying it under different environmental conditions monteiro and sentelhas 2014 2017 dias and sentelhas 2018 2019 on the other hand hydrological models can be used to estimate and evaluate the available surface water asw in a specific region mi and iica 2014 wolff et al 2014 the combination of both types of models allows to quantify the potential of irrigation of a given region by considering the sir and how much surface water is available when the crop is being cultivated in brazil the implementation of an irrigation project requires the approval by a government regulatory organization national water agency ana and such approval depends on the crop irrigation requirement and the surface water availability according to ana 2013 and wolff et al 2014 hydrological models allow to estimate the surface water availability based on the discharge of a watershed which varies temporally and spatially two common discharge rates are used to estimate the surface water availability the ecological discharge q7 10 and the multiannual average discharge q vestena et al 2012 wolff et al 2014 the first is defined as the lowest average discharge during 7 day period with an average recurrence of 10 years and the second is a combined average during one year of measurements in the state of são paulo the total volume of water that can be withdrawn from a watershed for irrigation purposes is 50 of q7 10 ana 2013 fehidro 2012 to increase the asw a common practice disseminated between farmers is the construction of a water dam at the farm level or near to the production site to increase its water storage capacity when there is a water dam the asw increases and the estimation of the water available for irrigation purposes can be calculated as 60 of q fehidro 2012 therefore these discharges combined with sir are suitable variables to assess the potential of irrigation of a given region considering the importance of sugarcane production the benefits of irrigation for this crop and the relevance on the rational use of water resources this study aimed to evaluate the potential of sugarcane irrigation in northwestern são paulo brazil with that it is expected to answer common and lingering questions asked by farmers private sector and government authorities is it necessary to irrigate sugarcane in this region if so do we have enough surface water therefore the specific objectives of the study were i to estimate the annual sir in araçatuba northwestern são paulo ii to identify the asw based on q7 10 and q and iii to evaluate the potential of sugarcane irrigation for each municipality within the region based on different scenarios by dividing asw to sir 2 material and methods 2 1 study region the studied region is known as araçatuba latitude 20 30 00 s 21 36 00 s longitude 50 06 00 w 51 30 00 w and altitude 295 465 meters a m s l and it encompasses 33 municipalities in northwestern são paulo brazil fig 1 during the 2017 18 season the total sugarcane area in this region was around 606 3 thousand

1 and has its climate classified as tropical with dry winter aw alvares et al 2013a b this region was selected due to its continuous expansion on sugarcane fields during the last decade silva et al 2012 and to the presence of a significant sir monteiro and sentelhas 2014 2 2 calculation of sir and asw sir was calculated based on the crop water balance determined by the method of thornthwaite and mather 1955 the daily water balance was calculated for 33 years 1980 2013 this water balance method has been extensively used in brazil providing reliable results for sugarcane as presented by monteiro and sentelhas 2014 2017 and dias and sentelhas 2017 2018 2019 the input variables for the crop water balance were rainfall r crop evapotranspiration etc and the soil water holding capacity swhc considering this method the outputs were soil water availability swa actual evapotranspiration eta water deficit wd and water surplus ws the sir in the present study was considered as the accumulated wd along the year for each location the final sir was calculated for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 the percentile was used to represent the sir for each municipality considering a daily scale and a time span of 33 years for instance a percentile of 60 means that 60 of the sir values are below this percentage score for each percentile a map was generated using the procedures that will be presented on the following subsections once these maps were created the values of sir for the pixels 90 x 90 m in a given municipality was extracted and described as the annual sir mm year 1 daily rainfall data were obtained from 28 meteorological stations from national water agency ana fig 1 the gaps observed in these time series were filled using the interpolated grid data generated by xavier et al 2016 rainfall from this grid data resolution 0 25 x 0 25 has been widely used by the scientific community souza et al 2016 monteiro et al 2017 paredes trejo et al 2017 although there are some uncertainties the use of this type of grid is very advantageous due to its temporal and spatial continuity melo et al 2015 the rainfall data used to calculate the water balance was adjusted to the effective rainfall which corresponds to 80 of the original data as proposed by sampaio et al 2000 this accounts for the effective amount of water that reaches the soil surface and contributes for the crop water balance the crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration eto by crop coefficient kc reference evapotranspiration was estimated by the penman monteith method eto allen et al 1998 which is a method extensively used around the world having a close relationship with eto measurements obtained from lysimeters allen et al 1989 pereira et al 2002 eto was extracted from the interpolated ground based grid xavier et al 2016 using the geographical coordinates of each meteorological station the kc values for each sugarcane phenological stage was weighted considering three different planting dates along the year april july and october which resulted in an average kc of 0 91 since in the sugarcane field there are several areas under different phenological stages at the same time the kc for each sugarcane phenological stage ranged from 0 5 to 1 2 doorenbos and kassam 1979 monteiro and sentelhas 2014 dias and sentelhas 2017 the predominant soils in the araçatuba region are typical ferralsols and entisols rossi and de oliveira 2000 which have an average swhc of 70 mm for 1 m depth according to the assessments of prado 2013 a digital elevation model from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm from national imagery and mapping agency nima and national aeronautics and space administration nasa was used to obtain values of latitude longitude and altitude for the studied region the srtm images for the brazilian territory are available in miranda 2005 asw was estimated using two discharges ecological discharges q7 10 and multiannual average discharge q both in m³ s 1 km 2 these information were obtained from wolff et al 2014 who proposed a new hydrological regionalization for the state of são paulo based on 176 fluviometric stations spread throughout the state with time series longer than 15 years for each fluviometric station one point location the authors calculated q7 10 and q m³ s 1 and divided it to the respective water basin area km2 these discharges measured in m3 s 1 km 2 were interpolated by inverse distance weighted idw method wolff et al 2014 to create a map of discharge as there are not enough points of q7 10 and q measurements in our study region we decided to follow with the interpolated from wolff et al 2014 later the mean value of these discharges was obtained by averaging the pixel s values within the boundaries of each municipality mean discharge values were transformed to annual asw mm year 1 and multiplied by 50 of q7 10 and 60 of q considering the amount of water that is available for irrigation purposes ana 2013 fehidro 2012 as asw was estimated based on the discharge rates it only includes water bodies that are connected with region or municipality watershed in other words we are not accounting for impounded water reservoirs and groundwater that are not connect with the watershed of the studied region the sir and the discharge values for each municipality were obtained using the tool zonal statistics as table available in the arcgis 10 5 this tool allows the extraction of the mean value of the pixels that are located within the boundaries of each municipality 2 3 multivariate linear interpolation and potential of sugarcane irrigation scenarios a multivariate linear approach was used to spatialize sir for the municipalities in the assessed region the model was developed using the map algebra tool which is available with the spatial analyst module an extension of the arcpy python site package both available with a licensed gis software arcgis 10 5 the multivariate linear analysis eq 1 was used to create different maps of sir based on the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 eq 1 is described below 1 s i r a b ф c λ d μ e ф λ f ф μ g λ μ h ф 2 i λ 2 j μ 2 e e r r o r where sir is the sugarcane irrigation requirement ф is the latitude decimal degrees λ is the longitude decimal degrees μ is the altitude meters a is the linear coefficient of the equation b c d e f g h i and j are the angular coefficients and eerror is the model error the values of latitude longitude and altitude were extracted from the digital elevation map dem srtm miranda 2005 using the function raster to point embedded on arcgis 10 5 software for each meteorological station values of latitude longitude and altitude were extracted from its individual raster layer respectively sir maps were created following a similar procedure used by monteiro and sentelhas 2014 and yamada and sentelhas 2014 the final sir map method was a summation of the interpolated layer using the multivariate linear analysis and an error map which was generated using the residual error of the multivariate linear equation universal kriging with default parameters from arcgis 10 5 was used to calculate the error map the potential sugarcane irrigation scenarios were created dividing the asw for the different discharges q7 10 and q by sir for each of percentile level 60 75 80 and 90 both in mm year 1 as follows 2 scenarios asw discharge sir perc level 2 4 validation of the multivariate linear model the multivariate linear model validation was done to ensure its reliability to estimate sir 60 75 80 and 90 and the maps of discharge q7 10 and q the multivariate linear model performance was analyzed by evaluating the following indices and errors me mean error mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute percentage error mape which are presented in below 3 r 2 s s r s s t 4 m e 1 n n 1 y i x i 5 m a e 1 n n 1 y i x i 6 r m s e 1 n y i x i 2 7 m a p e 100 n n 1 y i x i y i where x i is the calculated variable sir y i is the estimated value by the multivariate linear model ssr is the sum squared regression error and sst sum squared total error n is the number of locations considered for validation purposes n 7 further analysis to measure the performance of the models was done using the performance index pi this coefficient corresponds to the product of pearson s correlation coefficient r and the agreement index d willmott et al 1985 pi is an update of the confidence index c camargo and sentelhas 1997 and a combination of accuracy and precision analysis alvares et al 2013a b these indices are calculated as follows 8 r i 1 n x i x i y i y i i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 9 d 1 i 1 n y i x i i 1 n y i x i x i x i 2 10 p i d r where x i and y i are the average of the calculated and estimated values respectively the interpretation of pi can be done as follows pi 0 75 optimum performance 0 6 pi 0 75 very good performance 0 45 pi 0 60 good performance 0 3 pi 0 45 tolerable performance 0 15 pi 0 30 poor performance 0 pi 0 15 bad performance and pi 0 very bad performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 multivariate linear models and validation table 1 presents all the coefficients of the multivariate linear models used to calculate the sir for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 the r pearson s correlation obtained from the multivariate linear models fitting are in the range of other similar studies that used the same modeling approach to interpolate meteorological variables monteiro and sentelhas 2014 yamada and sentelhas 2014 soares colletti et al 2016 as showed in table 1 the sir map for percentile 60 had the lowest r 0 73 percentile 75 had r 0 76 and for the 80 and 90 the and r 0 82 which are acceptable since geographical coordinates and altitude can explain more than 70 of sir variation in the region such kind of method for a climatic related variables is becoming usual in the field of agrometeorology once it allows to represent the spatial variability of a given variable in a more accurate way astolpho et al 2005 feitoza et al 2008 alvares et al 2013a b monteiro and sentelhas 2014 yamada and sentelhas 2014 soares colletti et al 2016 as presented in table 2 the overall validation analysis showed that the values of me mae rmse and mape were relatively low the accuracy and precision for all models were moderate to high as the agreement index ranged from 0 59 to 0 92 and pearson s correlation for all models were higher than 0 80 based on the pi there was some variability on how the model performed the maps created for sir based on percentiles of 60 pi 0 50 and 75 pi 0 56 had a good performance the sir maps for percentile 80 pi 0 64 and 90 pi 0 64 were classified as a very good performance 3 2 sir and asw data table 3 shows for each municipality the annual sir mm year 1 for each percentile level and annual asw mm year 1 based on 50 q7 10 and 60 q discharges the values from table 3 were used to create the scenarios presented in fig 3 and fig 4 fig 2 presents the spatial distribution of the four different percentiles of the sir based on a 33 year period the interpolated variable presented the same spatial variability pattern for all the percentiles the lowest values of sir are observed at southeast of araçatuba region and these values increase towards the northwest direction for percentile of 60 fig 2a the average sir was 562 mm year 1 ranging from 505 mm year 1 for braúna 7 to 603 mm year 1 for itapura 18 for percentile 75 fig 2b the average sir was 750 mm year 1 ranging from 690 mm year 1 for braúna 7 to 806 mm year 1 for itapura 18 for percentile of 80 fig 2c the average was 932 mm year 1 ranging from 862 mm year 1 to 1012 mm year 1 respectively for the same locations whereas for percentile of 90 fig 2d sir average was 1062 mm year 1 ranging from 997 mm year 1 for gabriel monteiro 13 to 1141 mm year 1 for itapura 18 previous studies estimated the sir between 442 and 490 mm year 1 at two different municipalities in the araçatuba region damião et al 2010 santos et al 2013 our study shows values ranging between 591 and 601 mm year 1 for neighboring municipalities sir 60 the differences could be explained by the water balance time scale adopted that was monthly in the previous studies and daily in present analysis also our study considered an average weighted kc 0 91 while these referenced authors above used different values of kc based on a 12 month sugarcane cycle varying the kc with the crop phenology monteiro and sentelhas 2014 estimated the average sir in the municipality of araçatuba 3 and found values between 141 and 260 mm year 1 these authors used the mean sir and this could explain the difference found in relation to our study which was 561 mm year 1 sir percentile 60 vianna and sentelhas 2015 estimated the annual sir for three municipalities nearby our studied region named votuporanga presidente prudente and catanduva and found values of 358 266 and 309 mm year 1 respectively similarly dias and sentelhas 2018 estimated the annual average irrigation requirement for locations in the northwest and west of são paulo state and found 668 mm year 1 for votuporanga and 515 mm year 1 for presidente prudente these discrepancies when compared to our analysis are mainly related to the differences on the methods used it is also important to highlight that these studies had a broader assessed area including the entire state of são paulo as presented by monteiro and sentelhas 2014 and other states that cultivate sugarcane in brazil as presented by vianna and sentelhas 2015 and dias and sentelhas 2018 none of these studies presented an analysis specifically for a micro region which also explains part of the observed differences even considering the dissimilarities showed here all studies are aligned with the results obtained in our analysis showing that sugarcane has a relevant irrigation requirement in the araçatuba region justifying a study related to the potential of irrigation annual asw derived from the system proposed by wolff et al 2014 table 3 was calculated considering the discharges q7 10 and q variability along the studied region and interpolated using idw method the average values considering all the municipalities for 50 of q7 10 and 60 of q were respectively 35 and 164 mm year 1 which are much lower than the values of sir previously presented 3 3 scenarios of the potential of sugarcane irrigation the scenarios of the potential of sugarcane irrigation were created dividing asw by sir this ratio expresses the amount of the sir that is covered by the asw fig 3 q7 10 and fig 4 q present these scenarios for each municipality the municipalities with higher potential of irrigation are located on the southeast of the studied region for all scenarios this is a consequence of lower sir and higher aws monteiro and sentelhas 2014 found the same spatial distribution of the irrigation requirement for full irrigated sugarcane in the araçatuba region with lower values of sir at southeast and higher values towards northwest the potential of sugarcane irrigation based on the scenarios created using the 50 of q7 10 had a weighted average of 6 4 3 and 2 5 respectively for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 for any of the municipalities the potential of irrigation was higher than 15 of the annual sir the highest value was found in santópolis do aguapeí 29 with 11 sir 60 and the lowest in muritinga do sul 22 with 1 9 sir 90 on the other hand when considering 60 of q discharge assuming a presence of a water dam at the farm level or nearby there are several municipalities with potential to irrigate sugarcane higher than 25 of sir the weighted average values were 28 21 17 and 14 respectively for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 the highest value was 38 sir 60 for piacatu 26 and the lowest for castilho 10 with 23 sir 90 detailed information for each municipality and for all the scenarios can be found in table 4 the potential of sugarcane irrigation is expressed by the ratio between asw and sir and we have not considered the sugarcane production area for each municipality if we have had considered the sugarcane area for each municipality individually the potential of sugarcane irrigation could be seen from two different perspectives considering the irrigation of the entire sugarcane area and as consequence supplying water to only a portion of the sir or cover the sir thoroughly and irrigate only a portion of the sugarcane area questions regarding which standpoint should be considered can be answered with studies like the one conducted by dias and sentelhas 2019 these authors estimated the average sugarcane relative yield increments for different levels of water supply and as expected increasing irrigation contributed to increase the relative yield increment on table 4 it is shown that the potential of irrigation was higher than 35 only for a few municipalities when considering the percentiles of 60 and 75 and the annual average discharge q the highest percentile 90 had the smallest potential of irrigation for both discharges which means that the scenarios indicate that there are not enough surface water resources to irrigate sugarcane covering 100 of the crop irrigation requirement this study brings a novel approach on how climate data combined with agrometeorology remote sensing dem and gis tools can be used to address a major agricultural challenge such as the use of water resources to improve agricultural production the results of the sir analysis showed that sugarcane is grown under an adverse environment where there is lack or irregular amounts of rainfall which explains why local farmers and sugar mills are frequently considering the possibility of irrigating their sugarcane fields nevertheless there are only a few studies evaluating the sir on this region dias and sentelhas 2018 vianna and sentelhas 2015 monteiro and sentelhas 2014 and from our knowledge there is no study that estimates the sir and the asw to determine how much area can be irrigated from this perspective our study is a first step on filling the knowledge gap regarding the potential of sugarcane irrigation at this region the novelty of this study also lies on asnwering long standing questions is it necessary to irrigate sugarcane on this region if so do we have enough surface water the present study addressed both questions as demonstrated on table 3 figs 3 and 4 in fact there is a need for irrigating sugarcane in araçatuba region and for all the municipalities the annual asw is not enough to supply the whole crop irrigation requirement a comparable procedure was used by mi and iica 2014 to analyze the potential of irrigated croplands in brazil the authors used different values of discharges combined with water basin areas to calculate the water resources available to irrigation activities it is also important to highlight that our results are grounded on how much water is allowed to be withdrawn from the watershed 50 of q7 10 and 60 q ana 2013 fehidro 2012 and specially for q which considers a water dam close by or at farm level to increase water storage we should keep in mind that 60 of q is an estimation and that it can vary significantly from place to place also it is unrealistic that every land of sugarcane will have a nearby dam to supply water to irrigation even though 60 of q is based on an estimation it helps to understand that there is not sufficient asw to supply the total annual sir therefore the results of the present study can help government agencies and other stakeholders to manage irrigation plans in a more rational manner even considering the relevant aspects of this study it has limitations the constraints found are mainly related to the lack of a consistent and reliable time series data necessary to calculate the asw beyond that it is worth mentioning that the decision on how much water can be applied to a certain crop production site depends on a variety of factors such as electricity availability slope of the terrain government license approvals and others which are not addressed on our study also an irrigation project contemplates an economic analysis social and environmental impacts logistics and operational issues as highlighted by mi and iica 2014 although this study was done for a specific region the same approach could be used in other parts of the world further improvements can be done adding the effects of the terrain slope on run off considering the total cultivated crop area for each municipality and more prominently adding points of discharges values coupled with the water basin area for each municipality 4 conclusions our study showed that there is a significant annual sugarcane water deficit on the araçatuba region in northwestern sao paulo which is lower on southeast and increases towards the northwest part of this region the regional average sir for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 are respectively 562 750 932 and 1062 mm year 1 the percentiles encompass all daily sir for each of the four levels of probability the asw was calculated based on q7 10 and q and the regional averages were 35 and 165 mm year 1 respectively according with the modeled scenarios supplying the sir completely is highly implausible the region weighted average potential for sugarcane irrigation considering q7 10 were 6 4 3 and 2 5 and for q were 28 21 17 and 14 respectively for the percentiles of 60 75 80 and 90 also this study shows that the combination of a crop water balance model and a hydrological model together with remote sensing and gis tools can be used to answer lingering questions regarding the necessity to irrigate sugarcane and the surface water availability 
11029,soil moisture status and knowledge of rooting systems are essential for improving winter wheat productivity in the semiarid areas the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting ri system in combination with deficit irrigation is the key strategy for improving winter wheat productivity therefore a research trail we conducted during 2015 16 and 2016 17 on ri system where the amount of irrigation was decreased by half due to the rainfall harvesting than that of traditional boarder irrigation bi the following two planting patterns were used 1 the ri system with 75 37 18 0 mm irrigation levels and 2 bi planting pattern with 150 75 37 0 mm deficit irrigation levels results showed that under the ri75 treatment soil water and soil respiration in topsoil increase significantly whereas there was reduction in et rate that was 44 2 and soil temperature thus therefore and the morphology of winter wheat rooting system owing to significant improvement in grain yield 14 6 and wue 64 8 as compared to bi150 treatment this treatment improved wheat root tissue density 4 9 root length ratio 16 3 root mass ratio 8 3 and root fineness 9 5 as compared with conventional border irrigation the ri75 treatment produced significantly greater rwd rld and rsd at 10 40 cm soil depth when compared with bi150 treatment the ri system increased the root bleeding sap rate and root dry weight as compared to bi planting pattern therefore the ri system combined with 75 mm deficit irrigation can be an efficient water saving strategy in semi arid regions due to increased soil moisture across the rooting zones a resulting in higher wue and wheat production keywords plastic film mulching root growth root bleeding sap wue grain yield deficit irrigation winter wheat 1 introduction erratic rainfall and drought are the main factors which limits crops productivity in semiarid areas of china zhao et al 2013 and insufficient rainfall occasionally causes total crop failure shao et al 2011 these arid and semi arid regions receive an annual rainfall of 230 520 mm and evapotranspiration rate ranging between 710 999 mm the long period precipitation of 46 years 1968 2014 indicated declining trend of yearly precipitation han et al 2008 still 68 of groundwater is used in these regions for crops production as a result the decline is a rate of 0 4 2 9 m year 1 of which is the significant decline in water table due to misuse of groundwater resources zhao et al 2013 currell et al 2012 and hence it is necessary to use water saving agriculture techniques which efficiently utilizes light rainfall events and at the same time store precipitation water in the root zones of crops for use during water stress conditions so to achieve maximum production wang et al 2011b the ridge furrow precipitation harvesting ri system significantly improves soil moisture content wue and what production zhang et al 1999 shao et al 2011 the ri system coupled with deficit irrigation has been applied in the dry land farming system of china to efficiently utilize light intensity precipitation chakraborty et al 2008 the ri technique improved water accessibility and increased wheat yields by saving light rainwater zhou et al 2009 the ri technique has become popular and part of the most efficient cultivation practices as it saves light precipitation decrease evaporation increase soil moisture content and crop production wang et al 2009 however very limited research work has been carried out on root bleeding sap root development and its association with soil water accessibility under ri planting pattern with deficit irrigation the rooting systems of the crop play a significant role in sensing ecological variations and efficient utilization of inadequate water resources wang et al 2011b hence knowledge of root morphology is essential to achieve the highest crop productivity in dry land cultivation system of china gan et al 2013 the roots contribute a primary organ through which plants uptake nutrients zhang et al 2014 studying the relationship of soil moisture with wheat rooting systems is gaining more attention as soil water enhances the accessibility of nutrients while nutrients increase root size and its distribution spedding et al 2004 the root growth distribution is an important determinant and its function is to uptake water and nutrients xia et al 2005 the key root morphological characteristics are root surface area density root length density and root weight density which directly influence the function of whole root system and ultimately the above dry matter and crop production lynch 2011 fageria 2004 drought stress significantly decreases nutrient uptake and limits root growth and development across the root zone doussan et al 2006 the ri planting pattern with plastic film mulching significantly affects root morphological characteristics of wheat as a result of which there is an improvement in water and nutrients uptake and reduced drought stress morita et al 2000 the root bleeding sap is a sign of root pressure and potential shen et al 2013 a few research studies are available as far as improving wheat yield through regulating root growth and root bleeding sap under the ri system is concerned the objective of this study is to determine the effect of ri system in combination with deficit irrigation on root growth distribution root bleeding sap reduced drought stress and improved winter wheat productivity in semiarid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 trial site description during the study year 2015 16 and 2016 17 field

research study consisted of two planting patterns 1 the ri system with 75 37 18 0 mm irrigation levels and 2 boarder irrigation bi planting pattern with 150 75 37 0 mm deficit irrigation levels with completely randomized design and having three replications half of the irrigation water was supplied with the help of a precise water meter on 12 december 2015 and 15 december 2016 while the remaining half was supplied on 28 march 2016 and 25 march 2017 in bi cultivation pattern consisted of 3 6 m wide and 10 cm high borders the irrigation area for bi planting was 22 m2 4 4 m 5 m and the irrigation volumes were 3 30 1 65 and 0 81 m3 under 150 75 and 37 mm the irrigation area of single furrow under ri system was 3 m2 0 6 m 5 m and the irrigation volumes of single furrow were 0 23 0 11 and 0 05 m3 under 75 37 and 18 mm irrigation level the ri system had a ridge height of 15 cm with 60 40 cm furrow and ridge widths a plastic film was used to cover all ridges and four rows of wheat were planted in furrows fig 2 the width and length of each treatment were 4 4 m 5 m and a 1 5 m wide space was maintained between adjacent plots to decrease water seepage wheat cultivar xinong 979 was planted 2 250 000 seeds ha 1 wheat seeds were sown on 15 october 2015 and on 10 october 2016 while it was harvested on 2 june 2016 and on 27 may 2017 all the nitrogen 75 kg ha 1 and phosphorus 225 kg ha 1 were applied at the time of sowing 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 soil water and temperature the soil water sw and temperature were measured at the sowing flowering grain filling and maturity stage during both the cropping season soil water in the soil layers of 0 2 m with 20 cm intervals was recorded using a tdr machine time domain reflectometry germany to measure soil temperature a set of mercury in glass geo thermometers were installed in the middle of the furrow in each plot at soil depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm the soil temperature was recorded at 8 12 14 18 and 20 h 2 3 2 evapotranspiration et the et was calculated on a seasonal basis ali et al 2017 1 et r i δw where r is the total rainfall i is the deficit irrigation δw is the soil water at soil depths of 0 2 m between sowing and maturity time the water use efficiency was calculated using eq 2 ali et al 2017 2 wue y et 2 3 3 root length weight surface area and diameter root samples were collected from each treatment at flowering and harvesting stages at each sampling soil auger with an 8 cm internal diameter was inserted at three different positions including planting spots intra plant spots within rows and intra row spots each core was taken at 10 cm increments down up to 90 cm soil depth the soil sample was poured into a 0 25 mm2 mesh sieve the live roots and dead roots on the sieve were carefully separated according to gregory et al 1994 root images from each soil core were obtained by using a scanner epson v700 indonesia to determine root length root surface area and root diameter root images were analysed by using winrhizo software version 5 0 canada the root length ratio root mass ratio root fineness root tissue density root dry weight density root length density and root surface area

bleeding sap was expressed as mg per plant per hour soil respiration rates were taken by using an li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system connected with temperature and moisture sensors li cor inc lincoln nebraska 68504 usa 2 3 5 wheat production four middle rows of wheat were harvested from each plot to determine yield components and grain yield the grain yield was calculated including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 3 6 statistical analysis the data were analysed using spss 18 0 and data obtained from each sampling event were analysed separately means were tested with a least significant difference test lsd at p 0 05 the differences in morphology of the wheat root system between the two study years were not significant so data from the 2016 17 year were only used 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content and soil temperature the moisture content mc at soil layers of 0 2 m during various growth stages of both the study years is presented in fig 3 the mc among the different treatments was significant variances within each of the planting patterns at the flowering seed filling and harvesting stage during 2015 16 and 2016 17 study years however during both experimental years at 0 2 m soil depth the mc under ri cultivation method was significantly greater as compared to bi planting the mc under the ri75 treatment was significantly increased by 29 at flowering stage as compared with bi150 treatment mc significantly improved by 31 in ri system compared to bi planting at 0 2 m soil layers at three different growth stages during 2016 17 the differences between ri75 and ri37 treatments were not significant at 0 2 m soil depths during seed filling and harvesting stage under both the planting patterns mc at 0 60 cm soil layers significantly increased however from 60 to 200 cm the mc showed decreasing trend at flowering and seed filling stages under both the planting patterns mc significantly improved at different soil layers as the deficit irrigation levels increased the mc under the ri method significantly increased by 55 than that of bi planting at 0 80 cm soil depth during maturity stage which suggests that under the ri method plants took up less soil moisture from the deeper soil layers than that of bi cultivation pattern under the bi0 treatment the soil temperature at soil depth of 0 25 cm was significantly higher compared with rest of all the treatments during different growth stages for both the study years fig 4 particularly at a flowering and harvesting stage the bi cultivation had significantly higher soil temperature 2 04 c than that of ri system under different deficit irrigation conditions at 0 25 cm soil layer depths in both the study years a significantly lower temperature 2 13 c was recorded under the ri75 treatment in contrast of bi150 at flowering stage when the winter wheat canopy improved the soil temperature at 0 5 cm soil depth under the ri75 and bi150 treatments were significantly lower by 11 77 c and 10 68 c than that of bi0 treatment during both the study years the soil temperatures significantly decreased where increasing deficit irrigation levels under both planting patterns furthermore the soil temperatures in the ri75 bi150 and ri37 treatments were significantly lower at 0 5 and 5 10 cm soil depths than that of bi0 treatment at flowering grain filling and maturity

growth and distribution responses to different planting patterns and deficit irrigation wheat roots are the major organ to uptake nutrients and water therefore roots distribution in soil is directly correlated to soil moisture and nutrient uptake capability liu et al 2009 earlier research works have revealed that excess or insufficiency rainwater significantly changed the winter wheat root size and distribution thus reduce root growth forde and lorenzo 2001 plastic film mulching treatments an efficient use of erratic precipitation by increasing water availability than that of flat planting pattern without plastic film mulching liu et al 2009 the ri cultivation reduces soil evaporation improves soil water content as a result significantly increased winter wheat wue jia et al 2018 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system significantly improves soil water status at the 0 60 cm soil depths improving root size and its distributions han et al 2015 the rld rwd and rsd are means consideration for illustrated wheat root systems mosaddeghi et al 2009 the root length density had significantly effect on nutrients and water uptake capability mu noz romero et al 2010 the ri cultivation pattern significantly increased soil water contents mainly through deeper rainfall penetration in the planting zone as a result significantly increased rld rwd and rsd doussan et al 2006 the crop roots were mostly accumulated in the topmost soil layer of 0 40 cm where water and nutrients were sufficient for the ri system compared with the bi planting pattern under the ri system the rld was significantly higher at the 0 40 cm soil depths than that of bi cultivation pattern during flowering and maturity stages the highest rld was measured under the ri75 treatment but had non significant difference between ri37 and bi150 treatments at the soil layers of 0 90 cm at the flowering and maturity stage during flowering and maturity stage the rld at the depths of 50 90 cm was no considerable variations among all the treatments in addition there was no considerable difference in rld under both planting patterns below 50 cm soil depth sharratt and gesch 2004 we found that the ri system with 75 mm deficit irrigation at flowering stage was significantly higher in the rwd and rsd at the 0 40 cm soil depths compared with bi planting patterns at different irrigation levels the ri75 treatment had significantly greater rwd and rsd at the 0 30 cm soil profile than that of bi150 treatment at the harvesting stage in the earlier study the ri system enhanced soil moisture temperature and fertility status of soil xue et al 2003 this leads to significantly increased water and nutrient uptake as a result improved rwd qin et al 2006 earlier study showed that irrigated wheat has higher rwd than that of rain fed wheat crop fang et al 2011 the rwd and rsd were significantly decreased at the maturity stage at various soil depths than that of flowering stage but the decreasing trend was slighter under ri system compared with bi planting patterns at different deficit irrigation levels our finding is agreed with fang et al 2011 the ri planting soil water was considerably increased in the topmost soil layers which significantly affected the root distribution as a result increased rld and rsd than that of bi planting yuhong et al 2014 fageria 2004 study that 79 of the total rld and rsd are accumulated at the soil layers of 40 cm under high moisture conditions root length and diameter are two essential morphological root factors that influence nutrients and water uptake li et al 2010 root diameter plays a significant role in deeper root infiltration and allowing more nutrients uptake from deeper soil layer li et al 2001 the root length and diameter of crops significantly depended on water availability ren et al 2008 we also found that at the flowering and harvesting stage the ri system with 75 mm deficit irrigation produced a significantly thicker root diameter at the depths of 0 90 cm than that of bi planting pattern with 150 mm deficit irrigation fig 8 while the root diameter decrease regularly between all the treatments except ri75 treatment at harvesting stage under both planting patterns showed that the root diameter was not significantly varied at the depths of 20 90 cm at the flowering and maturity stages except

with deficit irrigation levels can be complex guo et al 2001 our study illustrated that the root dry weight was considerably increased under the ri75 and bi150 treatments by 125 0 and 65 0 than that of bi0 treatment the ri system significantly increased the root dry weight by 32 5 compared with the bi planting pattern under the bi planting pattern with increasing the deficit irrigation from 37 mm to 75 mm there was non significant difference in the root dry weight the highest shoot biomass is directly correlated to the highest root biomass which contribute to higher wheat yields zhang et al 2009 noguchi et al 2005 confirmed that root dry matter per plant was considerably highest in the ri system than that of bi cultivation pattern the root bleeding sap flow reflects the physiological root activity and directly correlated to water absorption morita et al 2000 sheng et al 2012 confirmed the close correlation between the root bleeding sap flow and soil water contents the variation in the root bleeding sap flow between the different planting patterns may be depending on the root size and its distributions noguchi et al 2005 the root bleeding rate is significantly correlated with nutrient and water uptake by wheat crop ansari et al 2004 our results illustrated that at tillering and maturity stage under the ri system in combination with 75 mm deficit irrigation showed a significantly maximum root bleeding sap rate than that of rest of treatments in 2015 16 during tillering jointing flowering and harvesting stages the root bleeding sap of the ri75 treatment was significantly higher by 64 130 69 and 50 then that of bi0 treatment 4 3 effect of planting patterns on soil moisture et wue and what production the ri system significantly reduced rainwater losses and

treatment at the flowering stage the ri system mc significantly improved by 31 compared to bi planting at the soil layers of 0 200 cm at three different growth stages under both planting patterns the mc significantly improved at different soil layers as increasing deficit irrigation levels the mc under the ri method significantly increased 55 than that of bi planting during maturity stage the ri system increased mc at key growth stages as a result significantly increased crops production ren et al 2016 in the current study under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments the mean of two years et was considerably reduced by 31 33 28 and 23 then that of bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments the grain yield under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments was considerably improved by 15 19 14 and 7 then that of bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments compared with the bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments the wue under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments was considerably improved by 65 76 59 and 40 our results are consistent with fang et al 2011 ren et al 2016 also confirmed that the ri system reduced soil evaporation increased mc and wheat productivity soil respiration rate is an important sign of soil quality soil water storage and crops rooting systems pan et al 2003 the mean of two years soil respiration rate data indicated that under the ri75 treatment was significantly higher by 66 respectively compared to bi0 treatment zhang et al 2014 also reported that the soil respiration considerably increased with increasing irrigation under the ri cultivation but over irrigation reduced soil respiration therefore further mechanistic research works are necessary to clarify the interactive effect of planting patterns and deficit irrigation on crop water uptake and soil nutrients availability 5 conclusions the results of current field trail confirmed that ri system in combination with deficit irrigation significantly increased agronomic parameters and production of winter wheat than that of bi planting pattern the ri75 treatment significantly increased soil water and soil respiration in topsoil reduced et rate soil temperature and therefore aided in regulating the root distribution morphology of the winter wheat rooting system as a result wheat production and wue significantly improving as compared to bi150 treatment the ri75 treatment improved winter wheat production root tissue density root length ratio root mass ratio and root fineness as compared with to flat planting pattern the ri75 treatment produced significantly greater rwd rld and rsd at 10 40 cm soil depth when compared with bi150 treatment the ri system increased the root bleeding sap rate and root dry weight at different growth stages therefore the ri system combined with 75 mm deficit irrigation can be an efficient water saving strategy owing to enhanced rooting systems and soil moisture across the rooting zones thereby resulting in higher wue and wheat production further

11029,soil moisture status and knowledge of rooting systems are essential for improving winter wheat productivity in the semiarid areas the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting ri system in combination with deficit irrigation is the key strategy for improving winter wheat productivity therefore a research trail we conducted during 2015 16 and 2016 17 on ri system where the amount of irrigation was decreased by half due to the rainfall harvesting than that of traditional boarder irrigation bi the following two planting patterns were used 1 the ri system with 75 37 18 0 mm irrigation levels and 2 bi planting pattern with 150 75 37 0 mm deficit irrigation levels results showed that under the ri75 treatment soil water and soil respiration in topsoil increase significantly whereas there was reduction in et rate that was 44 2 and soil temperature thus therefore and the morphology of winter wheat rooting system owing to significant improvement in grain yield 14 6 and wue 64 8 as compared to bi150 treatment this treatment improved wheat root tissue density 4 9 root length ratio 16 3 root mass ratio 8 3 and root fineness 9 5 as compared with conventional border irrigation the ri75 treatment produced significantly greater rwd rld and rsd at 10 40 cm soil depth when compared with bi150 treatment the ri system increased the root bleeding sap rate and root dry weight as compared to bi planting pattern therefore the ri system combined with 75 mm deficit irrigation can be an efficient water saving strategy in semi arid regions due to increased soil moisture across the rooting zones a resulting in higher wue and wheat production keywords plastic film mulching root growth root bleeding sap wue grain yield deficit irrigation winter wheat 1 introduction erratic rainfall and drought are the main factors which limits crops productivity in semiarid areas of china zhao et al 2013 and insufficient rainfall occasionally causes total crop failure shao et al 2011 these arid and semi arid regions receive an annual rainfall of 230 520 mm and evapotranspiration rate ranging between 710 999 mm the long period precipitation of 46 years 1968 2014 indicated declining trend of yearly precipitation han et al 2008 still 68 of groundwater is used in these regions for crops production as a result the decline is a rate of 0 4 2 9 m year 1 of which is the significant decline in water table due to misuse of groundwater resources zhao et al 2013 currell et al 2012 and hence it is necessary to use water saving agriculture techniques which efficiently utilizes light rainfall events and at the same time store precipitation water in the root zones of crops for use during water stress conditions so to achieve maximum production wang et al 2011b the ridge furrow precipitation harvesting ri system significantly improves soil moisture content wue and what production zhang et al 1999 shao et al 2011 the ri system coupled with deficit irrigation has been applied in the dry land farming system of china to efficiently utilize light intensity precipitation chakraborty et al 2008 the ri technique improved water accessibility and increased wheat yields by saving light rainwater zhou et al 2009 the ri technique has become popular and part of the most efficient cultivation practices as it saves light precipitation decrease evaporation increase soil moisture content and crop production wang et al 2009 however very limited research work has been carried out on root bleeding sap root development and its association with soil water accessibility under ri planting pattern with deficit irrigation the rooting systems of the crop play a significant role in sensing ecological variations and efficient utilization of inadequate water resources wang et al 2011b hence knowledge of root morphology is essential to achieve the highest crop productivity in dry land cultivation system of china gan et al 2013 the roots contribute a primary organ through which plants uptake nutrients zhang et al 2014 studying the relationship of soil moisture with wheat rooting systems is gaining more attention as soil water enhances the accessibility of nutrients while nutrients increase root size and its distribution spedding et al 2004 the root growth distribution is an important determinant and its function is to uptake water and nutrients xia et al 2005 the key root morphological characteristics are root surface area density root length density and root weight density which directly influence the function of whole root system and ultimately the above dry matter and crop production lynch 2011 fageria 2004 drought stress significantly decreases nutrient uptake and limits root growth and development across the root zone doussan et al 2006 the ri planting pattern with plastic film mulching significantly affects root morphological characteristics of wheat as a result of which there is an improvement in water and nutrients uptake and reduced drought stress morita et al 2000 the root bleeding sap is a sign of root pressure and potential shen et al 2013 a few research studies are available as far as improving wheat yield through regulating root growth and root bleeding sap under the ri system is concerned the objective of this study is to determine the effect of ri system in combination with deficit irrigation on root growth distribution root bleeding sap reduced drought stress and improved winter wheat productivity in semiarid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 trial site description during the study year 2015 16 and 2016 17 field

growth and distribution responses to different planting patterns and deficit irrigation wheat roots are the major organ to uptake nutrients and water therefore roots distribution in soil is directly correlated to soil moisture and nutrient uptake capability liu et al 2009 earlier research works have revealed that excess or insufficiency rainwater significantly changed the winter wheat root size and distribution thus reduce root growth forde and lorenzo 2001 plastic film mulching treatments an efficient use of erratic precipitation by increasing water availability than that of flat planting pattern without plastic film mulching liu et al 2009 the ri cultivation reduces soil evaporation improves soil water content as a result significantly increased winter wheat wue jia et al 2018 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system significantly improves soil water status at the 0 60 cm soil depths improving root size and its distributions han et al 2015 the rld rwd and rsd are means consideration for illustrated wheat root systems mosaddeghi et al 2009 the root length density had significantly effect on nutrients and water uptake capability mu noz romero et al 2010 the ri cultivation pattern significantly increased soil water contents mainly through deeper rainfall penetration in the planting zone as a result significantly increased rld rwd and rsd doussan et al 2006 the crop roots were mostly accumulated in the topmost soil layer of 0 40 cm where water and nutrients were sufficient for the ri system compared with the bi planting pattern under the ri system the rld was significantly higher at the 0 40 cm soil depths than that of bi cultivation pattern during flowering and maturity stages the highest rld was measured under the ri75 treatment but had non significant difference between ri37 and bi150 treatments at the soil layers of 0 90 cm at the flowering and maturity stage during flowering and maturity stage the rld at the depths of 50 90 cm was no considerable variations among all the treatments in addition there was no considerable difference in rld under both planting patterns below 50 cm soil depth sharratt and gesch 2004 we found that the ri system with 75 mm deficit irrigation at flowering stage was significantly higher in the rwd and rsd at the 0 40 cm soil depths compared with bi planting patterns at different irrigation levels the ri75 treatment had significantly greater rwd and rsd at the 0 30 cm soil profile than that of bi150 treatment at the harvesting stage in the earlier study the ri system enhanced soil moisture temperature and fertility status of soil xue et al 2003 this leads to significantly increased water and nutrient uptake as a result improved rwd qin et al 2006 earlier study showed that irrigated wheat has higher rwd than that of rain fed wheat crop fang et al 2011 the rwd and rsd were significantly decreased at the maturity stage at various soil depths than that of flowering stage but the decreasing trend was slighter under ri system compared with bi planting patterns at different deficit irrigation levels our finding is agreed with fang et al 2011 the ri planting soil water was considerably increased in the topmost soil layers which significantly affected the root distribution as a result increased rld and rsd than that of bi planting yuhong et al 2014 fageria 2004 study that 79 of the total rld and rsd are accumulated at the soil layers of 40 cm under high moisture conditions root length and diameter are two essential morphological root factors that influence nutrients and water uptake li et al 2010 root diameter plays a significant role in deeper root infiltration and allowing more nutrients uptake from deeper soil layer li et al 2001 the root length and diameter of crops significantly depended on water availability ren et al 2008 we also found that at the flowering and harvesting stage the ri system with 75 mm deficit irrigation produced a significantly thicker root diameter at the depths of 0 90 cm than that of bi planting pattern with 150 mm deficit irrigation fig 8 while the root diameter decrease regularly between all the treatments except ri75 treatment at harvesting stage under both planting patterns showed that the root diameter was not significantly varied at the depths of 20 90 cm at the flowering and maturity stages except ri75 treatment chenyang et al 2014 also reported that water deficiency plays a significant role in root morphology of wheat and prevented root growth the root morphological parameters under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments the root tissue density was significantly increased by 5 10 13 and 9 then that of bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments the root fineness for the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments was considerably improved by 9 9 9 and 27 then that of bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments compared with the bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments the root length ratio for the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments was considerably improved by 16 9 9 and 15 the root mass ratio was significantly increased by 8 8 9 and 0 under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments compared with bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments respectively 4 2 effect of planting patterns on root dry weight g per plant and root bleeding sap the wheat rooting system response to different planting patterns in combination with deficit irrigation levels can be complex guo et al 2001 our study illustrated that the root dry weight was considerably increased under the ri75 and bi150 treatments by 125 0 and 65 0 than that of bi0 treatment the ri system significantly increased the root dry weight by 32 5 compared with the bi planting pattern under the bi planting pattern with increasing the deficit irrigation from 37 mm to 75 mm there was non significant difference in the root dry weight the highest shoot biomass is directly correlated to the highest root biomass which contribute to higher wheat yields zhang et al 2009 noguchi et al 2005 confirmed that root dry matter per plant was considerably highest in the ri system than that of bi cultivation pattern the root bleeding sap flow reflects the physiological root activity and directly correlated to water absorption morita et al 2000 sheng et al 2012 confirmed the close correlation between the root bleeding sap flow and soil water contents the variation in the root bleeding sap flow between the different planting patterns may be depending on the root size and its distributions noguchi et al 2005 the root bleeding rate is significantly correlated with nutrient and water uptake by wheat crop ansari et al 2004 our results illustrated that at tillering and maturity stage under the ri system in combination with 75 mm deficit irrigation showed a significantly maximum root bleeding sap rate than that of rest of treatments in 2015 16 during tillering jointing flowering and harvesting stages the root bleeding sap of the ri75 treatment was significantly higher by 64 130 69 and 50 then that of bi0 treatment 4 3 effect of planting patterns on soil moisture et wue and what production the ri system significantly reduced rainwater losses and soil evaporation as a result significantly improved soil water status wang et al 2012 in our result we find out that the mc under the ri75 treatment was considerably improved by 29 than that of bi150 treatment at the flowering stage the ri system mc significantly improved by 31 compared to bi planting at the soil layers of 0 200 cm at three different growth stages under both planting patterns the mc significantly improved at different soil layers as increasing deficit irrigation levels the mc under the ri method significantly increased 55 than that of bi planting during maturity stage the ri system increased mc at key growth stages as a result significantly increased crops production ren et al 2016 in the current study under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments the mean of two years et was considerably reduced by 31 33 28 and 23 then that of bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments the grain yield under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments was considerably improved by 15 19 14 and 7 then that of bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments compared with the bi150 bi75 bi37 and bi0 treatments the wue under the ri75 ri37 ri18 and ri0 treatments was considerably improved by 65 76 59 and 40 our results are consistent with fang et al 2011 ren et al 2016 also confirmed that the ri system reduced soil evaporation increased mc and wheat productivity soil respiration rate is an important sign of soil quality soil water storage and crops rooting systems pan et al 2003 the mean of two years soil respiration rate data indicated that under the ri75 treatment was significantly higher by 66 respectively compared to bi0 treatment zhang et al 2014 also reported that the soil respiration considerably increased with increasing irrigation under the ri cultivation but over irrigation reduced soil respiration therefore further mechanistic research works are necessary to clarify the interactive effect of planting patterns and deficit irrigation on crop water uptake and soil nutrients availability 5 conclusions the results of current field trail confirmed that ri system in combination with deficit irrigation significantly increased agronomic parameters and production of winter wheat than that of bi planting pattern the ri75 treatment significantly increased soil water and soil respiration in topsoil reduced et rate soil temperature and therefore aided in regulating the root distribution morphology of the winter wheat rooting system as a result wheat production and wue significantly improving as compared to bi150 treatment the ri75 treatment improved winter wheat production root tissue density root length ratio root mass ratio and root fineness as compared with to flat planting pattern the ri75 treatment produced significantly greater rwd rld and rsd at 10 40 cm soil depth when compared with bi150 treatment the ri system increased the root bleeding sap rate and root dry weight at different growth stages therefore the ri system combined with 75 mm deficit irrigation can be an efficient water saving strategy owing to enhanced rooting systems and soil moisture across the rooting zones thereby resulting in higher wue and wheat production further
