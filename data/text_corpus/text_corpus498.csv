2490,error correction methods are widely used to improve the performance of streamflow modeling the dynamic system response curve dsrc is a newly developed error correction method that utilizes error feedback correction to obtain updated variables and thus enhances model accuracy while the dsrc method is simple and practical its objectivity has not been systematically demonstrated to address this issue the paper proposes an experiment to verify its objectivity first three hydrological models xinanjiang xaj hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hbv and vertically hybrid yielding vhy were calibrated and three corrected areal mean rainfall series were obtained by using the dsrc based models xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc the corrected rainfall series from one hydrological model was then used as input to other hydrological models and its performance was compared to those of using the original rainfall series by five performance measures nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r finally this objectivity verification experiment was applied to different model combinations for further demonstration case studies of the sunshui river and shiquan catchments in china showed that when the dsrc corrected rainfall series from either hydrological model was applied to the original or other hydrological models an increase in nse and r values and a decrease in rmse and mae values were observed the absolute values of pbias were within 10 accordingly the hypothesis that the dsrc method is objective is not rejected based on the results of the experiment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological models have become an essential tool for flood warning and water resources management beven and young 2013 paul et al 2021 however model performance may be compromised by various sources of errors including inaccuracies in input data imperfections in model structure and misestimations in model parameters götzinger and bárdossy 2008 gupta et al 2012 fraga et al 2019 therefore error correction techniques are often applied to bridge the gap between streamflow observations and their model simulations looper and vieux 2012 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 for example the autoregressive ar model has been used to enhance runoff forecasts by predicting simulated errors xiong and o connor 2002 bogner and pappenberger 2011 pulukuri et al 2018 data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter wang et al 2009 rakovec et al 2012 sun et al 2020 and particle filter salamon and feyen 2009 plaza et al 2013 fan et al 2017 have also been introduced to update model states and parameters however the above data assimilation methods and ar models are subject to a weak physical basis and unsatisfactory correction effects liang et al 2021 the dynamic system response curve dsrc method originally proposed by bao et al 2014 bao and zhao 2014 is based on the differential response of a hydrologic system to obtain updated estimates of the corrected variable it is based on the physical mechanism of flow concentration the dsrc method approximates the nonlinear relationships between model outputs and the corrected variables such as state variables and input variables with first order taylor linearization and describes these complex behaviors in simple matrix forms sun et al 2018 a the correction is then achieved by the least squares ls estimation in recent years the dsrc method has been used for areal mean rainfall updating si et al 2015 si et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b state variables updating sun et al 2018 and comprehensive error updating liang et al 2021 these applications show that the dsrc method can improve hydrological simulations and forecasts without adding any parameters while the dsrc method is simple and practical the objectivity of dsrc correction has not been systematically demonstrated for example when the dsrc method is applied to correct the areal mean rainfall it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in streamflow calculation the quality of rainfall correction is assessed by comparing the flow simulation results before and after rainfall correction there are still other sources of errors in hydrological modeling such as errors in the model structure butts et al 2004 gupta and govindaraju 2019 therefore it is difficult to determine whether the corrected areal mean rainfall is closer to the real areal mean rainfall that is whether the corrected mean rainfall is objective to address this issue this study tries to demonstrate the objectivity of the dsrc method with experiments 2 methodology the objectivity verification experiment of the dsrc method and the involved streamflow simulations were described in fig 1 this framework includes three steps first three lumped hydrological models including the xinanjiang xaj hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hbv and vertically hybrid yield vhy models were calibrated in the study area then the corrected areal mean rainfall series was obtained by the dsrc method and thus the corrected streamflow was calculated based on the corrected daily rainfall series and hydrological models finally the corrected rainfall series were used as inputs to other hydrological models as shown in fig 1 the original hydrological simulation such as the hbv simulation and corrected simulation of other models such as the xaj p hbv and vhy p hbv simulations were compared here xaj p hbv refers to the streamflow simulation results of inputting the corrected rainfall calculated by the xaj and dsrc methods into the hbv model similarly vhy p hbv refers to the streamflow simulation results of inputting the corrected rainfall calculated by the vhy and dsrc methods into the hbv model this objectivity verification experiment was used for different model combinations for further validation through this procedure we can explore whether the corrected rainfall sequence obtained by the dsrc method is closer to the real rainfall and whether the streamflow simulation of other hydrological models will be improved with the input of the corrected rainfall series based on this the objectivity of the correction results of the dsrc method can be analyzed 2 1 hydrological models the xinanjiang model xaj is a classic conceptual hydrological model developed in the 1970 s it has been widely used in humid and semihumid regions of china runoff formation of the xaj model is based on a saturation excess mechanism which means that no runoff is generated until the soil moisture deficit is replenished the runoff distribution is usually nonuniform across the catchment since soil moisture deficits are heterogeneous shi et al 2011 therefore the xaj model introduces a statistical tension water curve to describe the spatial distribution of storage capacity which is the essence of this model lu and li 2015 fang et al 2017 the generated runoff is then divided into surface runoff interflow and groundwater the xaj model consists of four main modules including a three layer evapotranspiration module a runoff generation module a runoff separation module and a runoff concentration module the hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hbv model is a simple conceptual rainfall runoff model of swedish origin bergström and forsman 1973 it has been successfully applied to catchments of various sizes and in a large range of geographic and climatic settings deckers et al 2010 dakhlaoui et al 2012 the hbv model consists of four main routines precipitation excess and snow melt soil moisture accounting runoff response and routing in the stream seibert and vis 2012 in hbv precipitation can be in the form of rainfall or snow which can be converted to snowmelt by the degree day method both rainfall and snowmelt contribute to infiltration into the soil box evapotranspiration and surface runoff the runoff response subroutine transforms excess water from the soil moisture routine to streamflow using two reservoir layers for fast and slow flow abebe et al 2010 finally the generated outflows are converted using a triangular weighting function as it rarely snows in the study area the snow module was not used in the case study the vertically hybrid yield model vhy developed by bao and wang 1997 is a lumped rainfall runoff model and has been applied to many catchments in china wang and ren 2009 li et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 lin et al 2020 in the vhy model surface runoff depends on rainfall intensity and infiltration referred to as the infiltration excess mechanism while subsurface runoff depends on soil water deficit and infiltrated water referred to as the saturation excess mechanism wang et al 2022a the core of the vhy model is this combined runoff yielding theory which postulates that saturation excess and infiltration excess mechanisms occur simultaneously in the vertical direction these three models are selected because they are all parsimonious for streamflow simulation at a daily scale these models only require daily rainfall evapotranspiration and flow series further descriptions of these models can be found in the mentioned literature 2 2 dynamic system response curve in general the hydrological model can be represented mathematically as follows 1 q f p e x θ where q q 1 q 2 q n t represents the streamflow vector at the outlet output of the hydrological model p p 1 p 2 p n t and e e 1 e 2 e n t represents areal mean rainfall and evapotranspiration vector x x 1 x 2 x m t is the vector of model state variable and θ is the model parameters vector n denotes the number of streamflows and m denotes the number of model state variables the model parameters θ can be adjusted to describe the hydrological response characteristics of the basin once calibrated they will not be changed in the short term bárdossy and singh 2008 smith et al 2014 in this study we consider the areal mean rainfall p as the main contributor to the error in hydrological modeling therefore eq 1 can be written more simply as 2 q p f p the above equation can be differentiated from the changes in the areal mean rainfall si et al 2015 3 dq q p p p p 0 d p where p 0 represents the current best estimate of the areal mean rainfall while q p p p p 0 denotes the sensitivity coefficient of the system response when the areal mean rainfall is p 0 so the observed streamflow for some other areal mean rainfall series p can be approximately rewritten as eq 4 by the first order taylor expansion technique 4 q p q p 0 q p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q p p k p p 0 δ p k where k k n is the number of periods of areal mean rainfall involved in the correction for the streamflow sequence q q 1 q 2 q n t the above equation can be expressed as follows 5 q 1 p q 1 p 0 q 1 p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q 1 p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q 1 p p k p p 0 δ p k q 2 p q 2 p 0 q 2 p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q 2 p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q 2 p p k p p 0 δ p k q n p q n p 0 q n p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q n p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q n p p k p p 0 δ p k written in matrix form as 6 q p δ p q p u δ p with 7 u q 1 p p 1 q 1 p p 2 q 1 p p k q 2 p p 1 q 2 p p 2 q 2 p p k q n p p 1 q n p p 2 q n p p k where the matrix u is defined as a system response matrix δ p denotes the correction term to be solved in addition each term in the matrix u can be calculated by differential approximation as 8 q j p p i q j p 1 p i δ p i q j p 1 p i δ p i i 1 k j 1 n where q p 1 p i denotes the vector of streamflow series computed using the current estimate of the areal mean rainfall series and q p 1 p i δ p i is the vector of streamflow series computed by adding a perturbation δ p i to the ith current rainfall value it is assumed that δ q can be approximately substituted by q obs q as displayed in eq 9 so the correction vector δ p can be updated with known δ q and u according to eq 10 9 u δ p δ q q obs q 10 δ p u t u 1 u t q obs q the procedure for the dsrc method when applied to streamflow correction is described below si et al 2015 it is worth noting that when the areal mean rainfall is zero the dsrc method is not run for that period step 1 set δ p i to a small constant to reduce differential errors increase the areal mean rainfall p i i 1 2 k by δ p i and meanwhile keep the other rainfall values p j i j unchanged this leads to a new areal mean rainfall sequence in this experiment we set δp i 10 5 step 2 use the new areal mean rainfall sequence as the model input to calculate the streamflow series q j p 1 p i δ p i for eq 8 step 3 compute the difference in calculated flows resulting from the perturbed and original rainfall series so the q j p p i can be estimated according to eq 8 step 4 repeat for each value in the rainfall sequence to obtain all the columns of matrix u step 5 according to eq 10 δ p can be calculated based on matrix u observed and simulated streamflow the corrected rainfall series can be obtained by adding δ p to p i and then the corrected streamflow can be calculated by using the corrected rainfall as the input to the calibrated hydrological model 2 3 performance measures the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r are employed to assess the performance of hydrological simulations the related equations are shown below moriasi et al 2007 11 nse 1 t 1 t q obs t q sim t 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 12 rmse 1 t t 1 t q obs t q sim t 2 13 pbias t 1 t q obs t q sim t 100 t 1 t

being optimal rmse pbias and mae values of 0 indicate a perfect fit between observations and simulations mae describes the average magnitude of simulation errors while r measures the success in replicating the overall timing and magnitude of discharge but disregards differences in absolute values chadalawada and babovic 2019 3 study area and data this study was conducted in the sunshui river ssr and shiquan sq catchments which are located in the yangtze river basin as shown in fig 2 the sunshui river catchment 1611 km2 is located in the lower reaches of the yalong river and has a subtropical monsoon climate that is mild and humid the sunshui river is a typical rainfall rechargeable river the annual runoff of the catchment is about 11 1 108 m3 and the average annual rainfall is 1100 mm the rainfall during the flood season from may to september accounts for 80 of the year in the sunshui river catchment the daily rainfall of 8 rain gauges observed evapotranspiration and streamflow data of the outlet station from 2008 to 2015 were used the shiquan catchment 23 805 km2 is located upstream of the han river as the source of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project the han river basin plays an important role in water supply and grain production the shiquan catchment belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate zone and it receives an annual rainfall amount of about 800 mm the temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven throughout the year and is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn in the shiquan catchment daily rainfall of 38 rain gauges evapotranspiration of 9 weather stations and streamflow observations of the outlet station from 2003 to 2014 were used all involved data were collected from the china hydrological yearbooks published by the yangtze river water resources commission china there were no missing values in the data series the lumped hydrological models were used and run on a daily scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and comparison of hydrological models we first calibrated and validated three hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy models using data from the ssr and sq catchments in the ssr catchment daily observations from 2008 to 2012 were used for calibration and data from 2013 to 2015 were used for validation in the sq catchment data from the first 8 years were used for calibration and the rest were used for validation in addition the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 was applied to find the optimal values of the model parameters the nse rmse and pbias measures were given the same weight and converted to a combined objective f for parameter optimization i e f nse rmse q obs pbias 3 the parameters calibrated were described and listed in table 1 it is worth noting that the division of calibration and validation periods is to obtain parameters appropriate to the hydrological model the dsrc method itself does not require the division of calibration and validation periods table 2 showed the streamflow simulations for two catchments ssr and sq with three hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy during the calibration and validation periods in the ssr catchment the vhy model achieved higher nse and r values and lower rmse values than the xaj and hbv models the pbias of the three models showed a slight underestimation in the calibration period and a minor overestimation in the validation period but in general all pbias were less than 5 in absolute value which was acceptable the mae values ranged from 7 m3 s to 8 m3 s for all models during calibration and validation in the sq catchment the hbv model exhibited the highest nse and r values and lowest rmse values in both calibration and validation periods the nse values of the xaj and vhy models were 0 81 and 0 79 in calibration and 0 82 and 0 83 respectively in validation respectively in terms of pbias both the xaj and hbv models were underestimated to varying degrees in streamflow simulation while the vhy model yielded much smaller absolute values of pbias 1 8 in calibration and 2 1 in validation the mae values of xaj hbv and vhy models were 116 m3 s 130 m3 s and 135 m3 s respectively in calibration and 153 m3 s 155 m3 s and 164 m3 s respectively in validation compared to the xaj and hbv models the vhy model performed well at ssr but was slightly poor at sq overall all hydrological models had nse values higher than 0 8 and pbias values within the range of 15 which is acceptable in daily streamflow simulations noori and kalin 2016 the results showed that the calibrated hydrological models can effectively describe the hydrological processes in the ssr and sq catchments and be used to simulate the daily streamflow series fig 3 provided scatter plots of the observed and simulated streamflow by the xaj hbv and vhy models in the ssr and sq catchments in the ssr catchment the estimates of the vhy model were closer to the corresponding observed daily streamflow values than those of the xaj and hbv models the vhy model had a higher r 0 924 than the xaj model r 0 912 and hbv model r 0 914 in ssr the high flows larger than 500 m3 s were underestimated although all hydrological models exhibited good overall performances in ssr in the sq catchment the r values of the xaj hbv and vhy models were 0 914 0 931 and 0 904 respectively the hbv model showed a better agreement of observations and simulations than the other models particularly in medium streamflow lower than 5500 m3 s 4 2 application of dsrc method the comparison between observations and three dsrc based streamflow simulations xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc were described in fig 4 and the associated performance statistics were listed in table 3 it can be observed in fig 4 that the scatters of dsrc based simulations were more concentrated to the 1 1 line than the original hydrological simulations in both ssr and sq compared to the original simulations xaj hbv and vhy the r values of the xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc models were increased by 0 074 0 055 and 0 069 in ssr and increased by 0 031 0 033 and 0 024 in sq respectively therefore the dsrc based simulations produced a significant improvement especially for the high flows in ssr but its accuracy improvement in sq was not so obvious moreover the vhy dsrc model had less scattered streamflow estimates and was closer to the 1 1 line compared to the xaj dsrc and hbv dsrc models in ssr in the sq catchment the hbv dsrc yielded better performance than the other models in daily streamflow simulation as indicated in table 3 the dsrc method increased the nse values of original simulations xaj hbv and vhy by 0 15 0 11 and 0 13 in the ssr catchment and 0 07 0 09 and 0 05 in the sq catchment respectively moreover compared to the original simulations the rmse values decreased by 60 40 68 4 in ssr and 23 33 5 13 8 in sq with the xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc methods all the dsrc based models had a pbias within 6 the mae values of original simulations ranged from 7 m3 s to 8 m3 s in ssr and 128 m3 s to 145 m3 s in sq while the mae values of the dsrc based models ranged from 5 m3 s to 6 m3 s in ssr and 107 m3 s to 134 m3 s in sq based on the r values in table 3 the correlation between the observed streamflow and the dsrc corrected simulated streamflow was higher than its correlation with the original simulations according to fig 4 and table 3 the accuracy improvements in the ssr catchment were more obvious than those in the sq catchment the primary reason for this result was that the rain gauge density in the ssr catchment 201 km2 gauge was higher than that in the sq catchment 626 km2 gauge for larger catchments with lower rain gauge densities the spatial distribution of rainfall especially the location of the storm center is harder to capture which leads to a tendency to misrepresent the amount of actual rainfall falling over the catchment as reported in si et al 2015 in summary the dsrc method is a very useful post processing technique for enhancing daily streamflow simulations to illustrate the corrected rainfall results using the dsrc method fig 5 showed scatter plots of the original and corrected rainfall associated with the different hydrological models for the ssr and sq catchments it can be noted that the observed and corrected values of areal mean rainfall had a good agreement with all r values larger than 0 95 the r values of corrected results using xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc models were 0 969 0 988 and 0 967 in the ssr catchment and 0 990 0 989 and 0 996 in the sq catchment respectively overall the corrected areal mean rainfall series was in line with the actual situation reflecting the rationality of the correction results 4 3 objectivity discussion of dsrc method according to section 4 2 the simulation performance of each hydrological model was apparently improved after correction by the dsrc method this section replaced the original rainfall series for each model with the corrected rainfall series and used it as input for the other two hydrological models therefore six new daily streamflow simulations xaj p hbv xaj p vhy hbv p xaj hbv p vhy vhy p xaj and vhy p hbv using corrected rainfall series were conducted their scatter plots of observations and simulations were depicted in fig 6 and the model performance was summarized in table 4 based on the plot diagram the observations and new streamflow simulations with corrected rainfall series were mostly concentrated near the ideal fit 1 1 line which showed a higher consistency than the original streamflow simulations by hydrological models in both ssr and sq catchments the peak values in the ssr catchment were still slightly underestimated but much better than those from the original simulations similar improvements can be noticed in the sq catchment in comparison to the original streamflow simulations as reported in table 4 compared to the original simulations xaj hbv and vhy those new simulations hbv p xaj vhy p xaj xaj p hbv vhy p hbv hbv p vhy xaj p vhy using corrected rainfall series as model inputs exhibited a stronger capacity for streamflow modeling the new daily streamflow simulations offered at least 0 10 and 0 04 growth in terms of nse in the ssr and sq catchments respectively for instance the hbv p xaj and vhy p xaj models lifted the nse value of the xaj model from 0 82 to 0 92 and 0 94 respectively by adopting the corrected rainfall series in the ssr catchment meanwhile their corresponding rmse reduced from 20 m3 s to approximately 12 m3 s a similar trend can be found in the streamflow simulation results for the sq catchment with only slightly fewer improvements in accuracy than in the ssr catchment the pbias values of the new simulations ranged from 6 9 to 7 2 in addition the corrected rainfall series obtained by the vhy dsrc method was well applied in the ssr catchment increasing the nse values of the xaj and hbv models by 0 12 and 0 13 respectively using corrected rainfall series by the xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc methods the nse of all other models in the sq basin increased by 0 05 0 04 and 0 04 respectively the hydrological models using the corrected rainfall series had lower mae values and much higher r values than those using the original rainfall series fig 7 compared the annual nse values of streamflow simulations with original rainfall series xaj hbv and vhy models dsrc based simulations xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc models and simulations using dsrc corrected rainfall series xaj p hbv xaj p vhy hbv p xaj hbv p vhy vhy p xaj and vhy p hbv models it can be concluded from fig 7 that 1 the results in both catchments showed that annual nse values increased when the dsrc corrected rainfall series from either hydrological model was applied to the original or other hydrological models 2 in most cases the corrected rainfall series employed in the original model such as xaj dsrc had a higher nse than that used for other hydrological models such as xaj p hbv and xaj p vhy and 3 compared to the sq catchment the ssr catchment with a smaller size and higher rain gauge density had a more evident enhancement in annual nse values with the use of the corrected rainfall series in the ssr catchment the corrected rainfall series obtained by the vhy dsrc method greatly improved the annual nse values of hydrological models it is clear that the use of dsrc corrected rainfall series enhanced the accuracy of streamflow simulations in different hydrological models this means that the corrected areal mean rainfall series are more reliable and objective than the original series illustrating the objectivity of the correction results by the dsrc method 5 conclusions hydrological modeling is critical to flood warnings and water resource utilization however modeling precision is often hampered by various error factors such as errors in the model inputs and structures therefore error correction methods are essential postprocessing techniques in operations the dsrc method has been shown to effectively use error feedback correction to obtain updated variables such as areal mean rainfall thereby improving the model precision si et al 2019 while the dsrc method is simple and practical its objectivity has not been systematically demonstrated for example when the dsrc method is employed to modify the areal mean rainfall it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in the streamflow calculation based on the dsrc correction different series of corrected areal mean rainfall would be obtained using different hydrological models in fact there are still other sources of error in hydrological simulations such as errors in the model structure therefore it is difficult to say whether the corrected areal mean rainfall is closer to the real areal mean rainfall which can be called the objectivity of the correction results of the dsrc method this paper investigates the objectivity of the dsrc method in this study we used the corrected rainfall series from one hydrological model as inputs to other hydrological models and compared their performance with the hydrological models using the original rainfall series this objectivity verification experiment was applied to different combinations of models for further validation in two real catchments ssr and sq catchments the results suggest that 1 increasing nse and r values and decreasing rmse and mae values were detected when the dsrc corrected rainfall series from either hydrological model was applied to the original or other hydrological models 2 the corrected rainfall series of different hydrological models were consistent with the observed areal mean rainfall series this indicated the reasonableness of the corrected rainfall results 3 the corrected rainfall series applied to the original model like xaj dsrc usually had a higher nse than those used in other hydrological models like xaj p hbv and xaj p vhy in conclusion the use of dsrc corrected rainfall series in each hydrological model showed a growth in simulation accuracy in different hydrological models these results indicated that the corrected areal mean rainfall was more reliable and objective than the original series therefore the hypothesis that the dsrc corrected results are objective was not rejected based on the current work when confronted with different correction results generated by different hydrological models it is often difficult to choose which is optimal in practice we can opt for any of them since whichever correction result will be at least better than its original simulation or use ensemble methods such as model averaging and stacking zounemat kermani et al 2021 to produce a result the dsrc method can provide some useful information in practice first the corrected streamflow and more accurate intermediate variables such as soil moisture content can be obtained by inputting the dsrc corrected rainfall series into the hydrological model this helps to improve future flood forecasting second when applied to real time scenarios the dsrc method can be used for rolling correction that is for each newly observed streamflow the dsrc method can be used for rainfall correction to obtain the new corrected streamflow future work is needed for multivariable correction based on the dsrc method and its application to other environmental models in addition developing the dsrc method for analyzing multiple error sources from model parameters and structures will be required in the future credit authorship

2490,error correction methods are widely used to improve the performance of streamflow modeling the dynamic system response curve dsrc is a newly developed error correction method that utilizes error feedback correction to obtain updated variables and thus enhances model accuracy while the dsrc method is simple and practical its objectivity has not been systematically demonstrated to address this

calibrated and three corrected areal mean rainfall series were obtained by using the dsrc based models xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc the corrected rainfall series from one hydrological model was then

mean squared error rmse percent bias pbias mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r finally this objectivity verification experiment was applied to different model combinations for further demonstration case studies of the sunshui river and shiquan catchments in china showed that when the dsrc corrected rainfall series from either hydrological model was applied to the original or other hydrological models an increase in nse and r values and a decrease in rmse and mae values were observed the absolute values of pbias were within 10 accordingly the hypothesis that the dsrc method is objective is not rejected based on the results of the experiment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrological models have become an essential tool for flood warning and water resources management beven and young 2013 paul et al 2021 however model performance may be compromised by various sources of errors including inaccuracies in input data imperfections in model structure and misestimations in model parameters götzinger and bárdossy 2008 gupta et al 2012 fraga et al 2019 therefore error correction techniques are often applied to bridge the gap between streamflow observations and their model simulations looper and vieux 2012 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 for example the autoregressive ar model has been used to enhance runoff forecasts by predicting simulated errors xiong and o connor 2002 bogner and pappenberger 2011 pulukuri et al 2018 data assimilation methods such as the ensemble kalman filter wang et al 2009 rakovec et al 2012 sun et al 2020 and particle filter salamon and feyen 2009 plaza et al 2013 fan et al 2017 have also been introduced to update model states and parameters however the above data assimilation methods and ar models are subject to a weak physical basis and unsatisfactory correction effects liang et al 2021 the dynamic system response curve dsrc method originally proposed by bao et al 2014 bao and zhao 2014 is based on the differential response of a hydrologic system to obtain updated estimates of the corrected variable it is based on the physical mechanism of flow concentration the dsrc method approximates the nonlinear relationships between model outputs and the corrected variables such as state variables and input variables with first order taylor linearization and describes these complex behaviors in simple matrix forms sun et al 2018 a the correction is then achieved by the least squares ls estimation in recent years the dsrc method has been used for areal mean rainfall updating si et al 2015 si et al 2019 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b state variables updating sun et al 2018 and comprehensive error updating liang et al 2021 these applications show that the dsrc method can improve hydrological simulations and forecasts without adding any parameters while the dsrc method is simple and practical the objectivity of dsrc correction has not been systematically demonstrated for example when the dsrc method is applied to correct the areal mean rainfall it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in streamflow calculation the quality of rainfall correction is assessed by comparing the flow simulation results before and after rainfall correction there are still other sources of errors in hydrological modeling such as errors in the model structure butts et al 2004 gupta and govindaraju 2019 therefore it is difficult to determine whether the corrected areal mean rainfall is closer to the real areal mean rainfall that is whether the corrected mean rainfall is objective to address this issue this study tries to demonstrate the objectivity of the dsrc method with experiments 2 methodology the objectivity verification experiment of the dsrc method and the involved streamflow simulations were described in fig 1 this framework includes three steps first three lumped hydrological models including the xinanjiang xaj hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hbv and vertically hybrid yield vhy models were calibrated in the study area then the corrected areal mean rainfall series was obtained by the dsrc method and thus the corrected streamflow was calculated based on the corrected daily rainfall series and hydrological models finally the corrected rainfall series were used as inputs to other hydrological models as shown in fig 1 the original hydrological simulation such as the hbv simulation and corrected simulation of other models such as the xaj p hbv and vhy p hbv simulations were compared here xaj p hbv refers to the streamflow simulation results of inputting the corrected rainfall calculated by the xaj and dsrc methods into the hbv model similarly vhy p hbv refers to the streamflow simulation results of inputting the corrected rainfall calculated by the vhy and dsrc methods into the hbv model this objectivity verification experiment was used for different model combinations for further validation through this procedure we can explore whether the corrected rainfall sequence obtained by the dsrc method is closer to the real rainfall and whether the streamflow simulation of other hydrological models will be improved with the input of the corrected rainfall series based on this the objectivity of the correction results of the dsrc method can be analyzed 2 1 hydrological models the xinanjiang model xaj is a classic conceptual hydrological model developed in the 1970 s it has been widely used in humid and semihumid regions of china runoff formation of the xaj model is based on a saturation excess mechanism which means that no runoff is generated until the soil moisture deficit is replenished the runoff distribution is usually nonuniform across the catchment since soil moisture deficits are heterogeneous shi et al 2011 therefore the xaj model introduces a statistical tension water curve to describe the spatial distribution of storage capacity which is the essence of this model lu and li 2015 fang et al 2017 the generated runoff is then divided into surface runoff interflow and groundwater the xaj model consists of four main modules including a three layer evapotranspiration module a runoff generation module a runoff separation module and a runoff concentration module the hydrologiska byråns vattenavdelning hbv model is a simple conceptual rainfall runoff model of swedish origin bergström and forsman 1973 it has been successfully applied to catchments of various sizes and in a large range of geographic and climatic settings deckers et al 2010 dakhlaoui et al 2012 the hbv model consists of four main routines precipitation excess and snow melt soil moisture accounting runoff response and routing in the stream seibert and vis 2012 in hbv precipitation can be in the form of rainfall or snow which can be converted to snowmelt by the degree day method both rainfall and snowmelt contribute to infiltration into the soil box evapotranspiration and surface runoff the runoff response subroutine transforms excess water from the soil moisture routine to streamflow using two reservoir layers for fast and slow flow abebe et al 2010 finally the generated outflows are converted using a triangular weighting function as it rarely snows in the study area the snow module was not used in the case study the vertically hybrid yield model vhy developed by bao and wang 1997 is a lumped rainfall runoff model and has been applied to many catchments in china wang and ren 2009 li et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 lin et al 2020 in the vhy model surface runoff depends on rainfall intensity and infiltration referred to as the infiltration excess mechanism while subsurface runoff depends on soil water deficit and infiltrated water referred to as the saturation excess mechanism wang et al 2022a the core of the vhy model is this combined runoff yielding theory which postulates that saturation excess and infiltration excess mechanisms occur simultaneously in the vertical direction these three models are selected because they are all parsimonious for streamflow simulation at a daily scale these models only require daily rainfall evapotranspiration and flow series further descriptions of these models can be found in the mentioned literature 2 2 dynamic system response curve in general the hydrological model can be represented mathematically as follows 1 q f p e x θ where q q 1 q 2 q n t represents the streamflow vector at the outlet output of the hydrological model p p 1 p 2 p n t and e e 1 e 2 e n t represents areal mean rainfall and evapotranspiration vector x x 1 x 2 x m t is the vector of model state variable and θ is the model parameters vector n denotes the number of streamflows and m denotes the number of model state variables the model parameters θ can be adjusted to describe the hydrological response characteristics of the basin once calibrated they will not be changed in the short term bárdossy and singh 2008 smith et al 2014 in this study we consider the areal mean rainfall p as the main contributor to the error in hydrological modeling therefore eq 1 can be written more simply as 2 q p f p the above equation can be differentiated from the changes in the areal mean rainfall si et al 2015 3 dq q p p p p 0 d p where p 0 represents the current best estimate of the areal mean rainfall while q p p p p 0 denotes the sensitivity coefficient of the system response when the areal mean rainfall is p 0 so the observed streamflow for some other areal mean rainfall series p can be approximately rewritten as eq 4 by the first order taylor expansion technique 4 q p q p 0 q p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q p p k p p 0 δ p k where k k n is the number of periods of areal mean rainfall involved in the correction for the streamflow sequence q q 1 q 2 q n t the above equation can be expressed as follows 5 q 1 p q 1 p 0 q 1 p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q 1 p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q 1 p p k p p 0 δ p k q 2 p q 2 p 0 q 2 p p 1 p p

p p 2 q 1 p p k q 2 p p 1 q 2 p p 2 q 2 p p k q n p p 1 q n p p 2 q n p p k where the matrix u is defined as a system response matrix δ p denotes the correction term to be solved in addition each term in the matrix u can be calculated by differential approximation as 8 q j p p i q j p 1 p i δ p i q j p 1 p i δ p i i 1 k j 1 n where q p 1 p i denotes the vector of streamflow series computed using the current estimate of the areal mean rainfall series and q p 1 p i δ p i is the vector of streamflow series computed by adding a perturbation δ p i to the ith current rainfall value it is assumed that δ q can be approximately substituted by q obs q as displayed in eq 9 so the correction vector δ p can be updated with known δ q and u according to eq 10 9 u δ p δ q q obs q 10 δ p u t u 1 u t q obs q the procedure for the dsrc method when applied to streamflow correction is described below si et al 2015 it is worth noting that when the areal mean rainfall is zero the dsrc method is not run for that period step 1 set δ p i to a small constant to reduce differential errors increase the areal mean rainfall p i i 1 2 k by δ p i and meanwhile keep the other rainfall values p j i j unchanged this leads to a new areal mean rainfall sequence in this experiment we set δp i 10 5 step 2 use the new areal mean rainfall sequence as the model input to calculate the streamflow series q j p 1 p i δ p i for eq 8 step 3 compute the difference in calculated flows resulting from the perturbed and original rainfall series so the q j p p i can be estimated according to eq 8 step 4 repeat for each value in the rainfall sequence to obtain all the columns of matrix u step 5 according to eq 10 δ p can be calculated based on matrix u observed and simulated streamflow the corrected rainfall series can be obtained by adding δ p to p i and then the corrected streamflow can be calculated by using the corrected rainfall as the input to the calibrated hydrological model 2 3 performance measures the

ssr and shiquan sq catchments which are located in the yangtze river basin as shown in fig 2 the sunshui river catchment 1611 km2 is located in the lower reaches of the yalong river and has a subtropical monsoon climate that is mild and humid the sunshui river is a typical rainfall rechargeable river the annual runoff of the catchment is about 11 1 108 m3 and the average annual rainfall is 1100 mm the rainfall during the flood season from may to september accounts for 80 of the year in the sunshui river catchment the daily rainfall of 8 rain gauges observed evapotranspiration and streamflow data of the outlet station from 2008 to 2015 were used the shiquan catchment 23 805 km2 is located upstream of the han river as the source of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project the han river basin plays an important role in water supply and grain production the shiquan catchment belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate zone and it receives an annual rainfall amount of about 800 mm the temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven throughout the year and is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn in the shiquan catchment daily rainfall of 38 rain gauges evapotranspiration of 9 weather stations and streamflow observations of the outlet station from 2003 to 2014 were used all involved data were collected from the china hydrological yearbooks published by the yangtze river water resources commission china there were no missing values in the data series the lumped hydrological models were used and run on a daily scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and comparison of hydrological models we first calibrated and validated three hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy models using data from the ssr and sq catchments in the ssr catchment daily observations from 2008 to 2012 were used for calibration and data from 2013 to 2015 were used for validation in the sq catchment data from the first 8 years were used for calibration and the rest were used for validation in addition the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 was applied to find the optimal values of the model parameters the nse rmse and pbias measures were given the same weight and converted to a combined objective f for parameter optimization i e f nse rmse q obs pbias 3 the parameters calibrated were described and listed in table 1 it is worth noting that the division of calibration and validation periods is to obtain parameters appropriate to the hydrological model the dsrc method itself does not require the division of calibration and validation periods table 2 showed the streamflow simulations for two catchments ssr and sq with three hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy during the calibration and validation periods in the ssr catchment the vhy model achieved higher nse and r values and lower rmse values than the xaj and hbv models the pbias of the three models showed a slight underestimation in the calibration period and a minor overestimation in the validation period but in general all pbias were less than 5 in absolute value which was acceptable the mae values ranged from 7 m3 s to 8 m3 s for all models during calibration and validation in the sq catchment the hbv model exhibited the highest nse and r values and lowest rmse values in both calibration and validation periods the nse values of the xaj and vhy models were 0 81 and 0 79 in calibration and 0 82 and 0 83 respectively in validation respectively in terms of pbias both the xaj and hbv models were underestimated to varying degrees in streamflow simulation while the vhy model yielded much smaller absolute values of pbias 1 8 in calibration and 2 1 in validation the mae values of xaj hbv and vhy models were 116 m3 s 130 m3 s and 135 m3 s respectively in calibration and 153 m3 s 155 m3 s and 164 m3 s respectively in validation compared to the xaj and hbv models the vhy model performed well at ssr but was slightly poor at sq overall all hydrological models had nse values higher than 0 8 and pbias values within the range of 15 which is acceptable in daily streamflow simulations noori and kalin 2016 the results showed that the calibrated hydrological models can effectively describe the hydrological processes in the ssr and sq catchments and be used to simulate the daily streamflow series fig 3 provided scatter plots of the observed and simulated streamflow by the xaj hbv and vhy models in the ssr and sq catchments in the ssr catchment the estimates of the vhy model were closer to the corresponding observed daily streamflow values than those of the xaj and hbv models the vhy model had a higher r 0 924 than the xaj model r 0 912 and hbv model r 0 914 in ssr the high flows larger than 500 m3 s were underestimated although all hydrological models exhibited good overall performances in ssr in the sq catchment the r values of the xaj hbv and vhy models were 0 914 0 931 and 0 904 respectively the hbv model showed a better agreement of observations and simulations than the other models particularly in medium streamflow lower than 5500 m3 s 4 2 application of dsrc method the comparison between observations and three dsrc based streamflow simulations xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc were described in fig 4 and the associated performance statistics were listed in table 3 it can be observed in fig 4 that the scatters of dsrc based simulations were more concentrated to the 1 1 line than the original hydrological simulations in both ssr and sq compared to the original simulations xaj hbv and vhy the r values of the xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc models were increased by 0 074 0 055 and 0 069 in ssr and increased by 0 031 0 033 and 0 024 in sq respectively therefore the dsrc based simulations produced a significant improvement especially for the high flows in ssr but its accuracy improvement in sq was not so obvious moreover the vhy dsrc model had less scattered streamflow estimates and was closer to the 1 1 line compared to the xaj dsrc and hbv dsrc models in ssr in the sq catchment the hbv dsrc yielded better performance than the other models in daily streamflow simulation as indicated in table 3 the dsrc method increased the nse values of original simulations xaj hbv and vhy by 0 15 0 11 and 0 13 in the ssr catchment and 0 07 0 09 and 0 05 in the sq catchment respectively moreover compared to the original simulations the rmse values decreased by 60 40 68 4 in ssr and 23 33 5 13 8 in sq with the xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc methods all the dsrc based models had a pbias within 6 the mae values of original simulations ranged from 7 m3 s to 8 m3 s in ssr and 128 m3 s to 145 m3 s in sq while the mae values of the dsrc based models ranged from 5 m3 s to 6 m3 s in ssr and 107 m3 s to 134 m3 s in sq based on the r values in table 3 the correlation between the observed streamflow and the dsrc corrected simulated streamflow was higher than its correlation with the original simulations according to fig 4 and table 3 the accuracy improvements in the ssr catchment were more obvious than those in the sq catchment the primary reason for this result was that the rain gauge density in the ssr catchment 201 km2 gauge was higher than that in the sq catchment 626 km2 gauge for larger catchments with lower rain gauge densities the spatial distribution of rainfall especially the location of the storm center is harder to capture which leads to a tendency to misrepresent the amount of actual rainfall falling over the catchment as reported in si et al 2015 in summary the dsrc method is a very useful post processing technique for enhancing daily streamflow simulations to illustrate the corrected rainfall results using the dsrc method fig 5 showed scatter plots of the original and corrected rainfall associated with the different hydrological models for the ssr and sq catchments it can be noted that the observed and corrected values of areal mean rainfall had a good agreement with all r values larger than 0 95 the r values of corrected results using xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc models were 0 969 0 988 and 0 967 in the ssr catchment and 0 990 0 989 and 0 996 in the sq catchment respectively overall the corrected areal mean rainfall series was in line with the actual situation reflecting the rationality of the correction results 4 3 objectivity discussion of dsrc method according to section 4 2 the simulation performance of each hydrological model was apparently improved after correction by the dsrc method this section replaced the original rainfall series for each model with the corrected rainfall series and used it as input for the other two hydrological models therefore six new daily streamflow simulations xaj p hbv xaj p vhy hbv p xaj hbv p vhy vhy p xaj and vhy p hbv using corrected rainfall series were conducted their scatter plots of observations and simulations were depicted in fig 6 and the model performance was summarized in table 4 based on the plot diagram the observations and new streamflow simulations with corrected rainfall series were mostly concentrated near the ideal fit 1 1 line which showed a higher consistency than the original streamflow simulations by hydrological models in both ssr and sq catchments the peak values in the ssr catchment were still slightly underestimated but much better than those from the original simulations similar improvements can be noticed in the sq catchment in comparison to the original streamflow simulations as reported in table 4 compared to the original simulations xaj hbv and vhy those new simulations hbv p xaj vhy p xaj xaj p hbv vhy p hbv hbv p vhy xaj p vhy using corrected rainfall series as model inputs exhibited a stronger capacity for streamflow modeling the new daily streamflow simulations offered at least 0 10 and 0 04 growth in terms of nse in the ssr and sq catchments respectively for instance the hbv p xaj and vhy p xaj models lifted the nse value of the xaj model from 0 82 to 0 92 and 0 94 respectively by adopting the corrected rainfall series in the ssr catchment meanwhile their corresponding rmse reduced from 20 m3 s to approximately 12 m3 s a similar trend can be found in the streamflow simulation results for the sq catchment with only slightly fewer improvements in accuracy than in the ssr catchment the pbias values of the new simulations ranged from 6 9 to 7 2 in addition the corrected rainfall series obtained by the vhy dsrc method was well applied in the ssr catchment increasing the nse values of the xaj and hbv models by 0 12 and 0 13 respectively using corrected rainfall series by the xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc methods the nse of all other models in the sq basin increased by 0 05 0 04 and 0 04 respectively the hydrological models using the corrected rainfall series had lower mae values and much higher r values than those using the original rainfall series fig 7 compared the annual nse values of streamflow simulations with original rainfall series xaj hbv and vhy models dsrc based simulations xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc models and simulations using dsrc corrected rainfall series xaj p hbv xaj p vhy hbv p xaj hbv p vhy vhy p xaj and vhy p hbv models it can be concluded from fig 7 that 1 the results in both catchments showed that annual nse values increased when the dsrc corrected rainfall series from either hydrological model was applied to the original or other hydrological models 2 in most cases the corrected rainfall series employed in the original model such as xaj dsrc had a higher nse than that used for other hydrological models such as xaj p hbv and xaj p vhy and 3 compared to the sq catchment the ssr catchment with a smaller size and higher rain gauge density had a more evident enhancement in annual nse values with the use of the corrected rainfall series in the ssr catchment the corrected rainfall series obtained by the vhy dsrc method greatly improved the annual nse values of hydrological models it is clear that the use of dsrc corrected rainfall series enhanced the accuracy of streamflow simulations in different hydrological models this means that the corrected areal mean rainfall series are more reliable and objective than the original series illustrating the objectivity of the correction results by the dsrc method 5 conclusions hydrological modeling is critical to flood warnings and water resource utilization however modeling precision is often hampered by various error factors such as errors in the model inputs and structures therefore error correction methods are essential postprocessing techniques in operations the dsrc method has been shown to effectively use error feedback correction to obtain updated variables such as areal mean rainfall thereby improving the model precision si et al 2019 while the dsrc method is simple and practical its objectivity has not been systematically demonstrated for example when the dsrc method is employed to modify the areal mean rainfall it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in the streamflow calculation based on the dsrc correction different series of corrected areal mean rainfall would be obtained using different hydrological models in fact there are still other sources of error in hydrological simulations such as errors in the model structure therefore it is difficult to say whether the corrected areal mean rainfall is closer to the real areal mean rainfall which can be called the objectivity of the correction results of the dsrc method this paper investigates the objectivity of the dsrc method in this study we used the corrected rainfall series from one hydrological model as inputs to other hydrological models and compared their performance with the hydrological models using the original rainfall series this objectivity verification experiment was applied to different combinations of models for further validation in two real catchments ssr and sq catchments the results suggest that 1 increasing nse and r values and decreasing rmse and mae values were detected when the dsrc corrected rainfall series from either hydrological model was applied to the original or other hydrological models 2 the corrected rainfall series of different hydrological models were consistent with the observed areal mean rainfall series this indicated the reasonableness of the corrected rainfall results 3 the corrected rainfall series applied to the original model like xaj dsrc usually had a higher nse than those used in other hydrological models like xaj p hbv and xaj p vhy in conclusion the use of dsrc corrected rainfall series in each hydrological model showed a growth in simulation accuracy in different hydrological models these results indicated that the corrected areal mean rainfall was more reliable and objective than the original series therefore the hypothesis that the dsrc corrected results are objective was not rejected based on the current work when confronted with different correction results generated by different hydrological models it is often difficult to choose which is optimal in practice we can opt for any of them since whichever correction result will be at least better than its original simulation or use ensemble methods such as model averaging and stacking zounemat kermani et al 2021 to produce a result the dsrc method can provide some useful information in practice first the corrected streamflow and more accurate intermediate variables such as soil moisture content can be obtained by inputting the dsrc corrected rainfall series into the hydrological model this helps to improve future flood forecasting second when applied to real time scenarios the dsrc method can be used for rolling correction that is for each newly observed streamflow the dsrc method can be used for rainfall correction to obtain the new corrected streamflow future work is needed for multivariable correction based on the dsrc method and its application to other environmental models in addition developing the dsrc method for analyzing multiple error sources from model parameters and structures will be required in the future credit authorship

2491,the source region of the yellow river sryr in the northeastern tibetan plateau is critical for supplying water resources to downstream areas however streamflow in the sryr declined despite a slight increase in precipitation during the past few decades the sryr experienced significant frozen ground degradation with climate warming but how frozen ground degradation influences runoff remains unclear this study investigated the changes of the precipitation runoff relationship using the double mass curve method and examined the impact of long term spatiotemporal changes in frozen ground on the water balance components using the geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm the results showed that the precipitation runoff relationship changed significantly since 1989 in the sryr from 1960 to 2019 in the same period the areal mean value of the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground mtsfg decreased by 0 10 m 10a and the areal mean active layer thickness alt of permafrost increased by 0 06 m 10a besides 21 0 of the entire sryr has degraded from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground sfg runoff decreased mainly in the region with elevation below 4200 m where the evapotranspiration increase exceeded the precipitation increase frozen ground degradation significantly altered the hydrological processes which is reflected by the increased subsurface runoff and the decreased surface runoff the total water storage increased by 2 9 mm a in the permafrost region due to the increase in active layer thickness and by 5 7 mm a in the degradation region where permafrost completely thawed during 1960 2019 the runoff seasonality was also altered being indicated as an increase in winter runoff these findings help provide a better understanding of the runoff change under climate warming in permafrost affected regions and provide insights into future water resources management in the yellow river basin under the climate warming keywords yellow river frozen ground hydrological processes runoff changes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction frozen ground an essential landscape characteristic of the cryosphere underlies about 50 of the exposed land surface in the northern hemisphere zhang et al 1999 frozen ground contains two major categories permafrost where the ground temperature maintains below 0 c at least two consecutive years cuo et al 2015 and seasonally frozen ground sfg where the ground experiences yearly freeze and thaw wang et al 2019 due to the susceptibility of frozen ground to climate warming it often serves as one of the climate change indicators vaughan et al 2013 in the permafrost region frozen ground degradation manifests as the active layer thickening or complete permafrost thaw while in the sfg region the degradation is reflected by the decreasing annual maximum frozen depth jin et al 2009 cheng and jin 2013 zhao et al 2020 due to the low permeability of permafrost frozen ground serves as an aquitard that controls the hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater bring et al 2016 ma et al 2021 the freeze thaw processes in the permafrost active layer and the sfg control hydrological processes including infiltration soil water movement rainfall runoff base flow process and evapotranspiration ala aho et al 2021 gao et al 2021 with rapid rising air temperature frozen ground degradation has dramatically altered the hydrological regimes in cold regions significantly influencing the downstream water resources frozen ground degradation could boost infiltration expand soil water storage capacity change the runoff seasonality and increase the base flow walvoord and kurylyk 2016 duan et al 2017 jin et al 2022a therefore the frozen ground degradation and its consequent hydrological impacts have aroused growing concern worldwide walvoord and kurylyk 2016 gao et al 2021 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b which needs more in depth quantitative analysis the tibet plateau tp also known as the asian water tower contains several source regions of large asian rivers which provide water for 1 4 billion people downstream immerzeel et al 2010 underlain by the world s largest extent of alpine permafrost the hydrological impacts of permafrost degradation on the tp remain largely unknown the streamflow responses to permafrost degradation may vary in space with different climatic and geographic characteristics multiple factors including climate frozen ground types and vegetation would alter the streamflow responses in the cold basins song et al 2021 for instance in the arctic regions river flows were observed to have increased in recent decades spence et al 2015 bring et al 2016 with increasing atmospheric moisture precipitation as well as late summer rain rawlins et al 2010 spence et al 2015 bring et al 2016 however in the tp despite increased streamflow observed in the glacier fed rivers yi et al 2021 the streamflow in many permafrost dominated basins declined woo et al 2008 liang et al 2010 wang et al 2018b thawing permafrost and concomitant hydrological changes have been extensively studied in the pan arctic bring et al 2016 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 lafreniere and lamoureux 2019 koch et al 2022 but have been relatively less investigated in the tp gao et al 2021 the streamflow responses at different frozen ground types including permafrost region sfg region and degradation region where permafrost degraded to sfg remain elusive the source region of the yellow river sryr located in the northeastern tp provides about 38 of the yellow river s yearly total runoff serving as one of the most crucial runoff generation regions for the yellow river hu et al 2011 wu et al 2018b jin et al 2022b the sryr is located in the transition area of permafrost and sfg with a semi humid and cold climate and has experienced considerable frozen ground degradation due to climate warming jin et al 2009 wang et al 2018a in sryr permafrost degradation has been evidently proved by observations from the shrinkage of permafrost extent the thickening of permafrost active layer and ground temperature rising jin et al 2009 cheng and jin 2013 luo et al 2020 sheng et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 a series of environmental and ecological problems have emerged with these permafrost changes and hydrological regimes have also experienced profound changes in this region jin et al 2022b recently many studies have noticed the divergent changing trends in precipitation and runoff in the sryr meng et al 2016 wang et al 2018b ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 over the past few decades the runoff exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend although precipitation exhibited a significant increase p 0 05 in the sryr the sryr experienced a low flow period in the 1990 s when both precipitation and runoff were relatively low still the annual runoff did not recover as much as precipitation since the 21st century wang et al 2018b contrasting precipitation and runoff changes are not specific to the sryr but also observed in other parts of the world accompanied by dramatic changes in climate and land use cover destouni et al 2010 jarsjo et al 2012 destouni et al 2013 jaramillo et al 2013 karlsson et al 2015 karlsson et al 2015 investigated the divergent precipitation and runoff trends in some arctic river basins they found that the landscape changes were needed to explain such divergences in precipitation and runoff trends besides atmospheric climate warming in sryr the widespread permafrost is highly vulnerable to climate warming and cannot be neglected when discussing the impacts of climate change on runoff wang et al 2018b wu et al 2018a although some researchers have attempted to explain such inconsistent variability between precipitation and runoff in the sryr the conclusions were mixed wang et al 2018b ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 statistical analysis results cannot explain the mechanism by which frozen ground degradation affects hydrological processes moreover the factors leading to the long term runoff decline despite the increased precipitation in the sryr remain unclear statistical analysis based on observations from hydrological stations can only reflect the runoff changes of the entire basin but cannot accurately reflect the spatial variations within the catchment specifically frozen ground degradation is highly correlated with climate warming and it s hard to separate the effects of frozen ground degradation on runoff based on statistical approaches therefore physically based models can serve as a powerful tool to depict the hydrological processes in high mountain catchments with high spatial heterogeneity physically based models coupled with water heat dynamics can be useful in unraveling the impacts of soil freeze thaw on hydrological processes gao et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 gao et al 2021 gao et al 2022 the geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm developed by yang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 has been applied to several cold catchments in the tp and showed good performances in simulating permafrost and hydrological processes qin et al 2017 gao et al 2018 shi et al 2020 hence can be useful in estimating the long term spatiotemporal changes of frozen ground and analyzing its impacts on the hydrological processes in the sryr over the past 60 years based on the previous studies this paper aims to identify the forms and degrees of frozen ground degradation in the sryr during the past 60 years and the corresponding effect on the hydrological processes to better understand the characteristics and causes of runoff change in this region therefore the objectives are i to comprehend the precipitation runoff relationship change in the sryr based on long term observations during the past 60 years ii to examine the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological processes over the past 60 years by the distributed hydrological modeling iii to explore the hydrological impacts of frozen ground degradation in the sryr 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the sryr in the northeastern tp spanning a longitude range of 95 50 e to 103 30 e and a latitude range of 32 n to 35 40 n encompasses an area of about 123 800 km2 16 of the yellow river basin fig 1 with elevation ranging from 2650 m to 6250 m the sryr is in the transitional region between the permafrost and the sfg regions in the sryr there are three hydrological stations jimai jm maqu mq and tnh according to the hydrological stations the sryr was separated into 3 sub regions the area upstream of jm jm the area between jm and mq jm mq and the area between mq and tnh mq tnh jm has the highest mean elevation of 4465 m whereas jm mq and mq tnh have lower mean elevations of 3902 m and 3946 m respectively the regions jm jm mq and mq tnh contribute 21 51 and 28 respectively to the overall flow of the sryr meng et al 2016 the sryr produces 35 of the total runoff of yellow river basin and is the primary runoff generation zone for yellow river 2 2 data the precipitation runoff and air temperature data were analyzed to determine the long term climatic and hydrological changes in the sryr the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa with a 0 25 0 25 resolution is a gridded daily precipitation dataset interpolated from gauge data using the optimal interpolation method provided by shen and xiong 2016 the inherent uncertainty of cgdpa mainly arises from the interpolation of gauged data over the sparse gauged areas despite the uncertainty the cgdpa is widely used in climate change studies over mainland china due to its long data record from 1955 to the present and data reliability by incorporating quality controlled observed data from about 2400 gauge stations shen and xiong 2016 the monthly streamflow data for the jm mq and tnh stations were taken from the hydrological yearbook published by the ministry of water resources of china https www mwr gov cn english in this study we collected the most recent data expanding the period of river discharge data to 1960 2019 at mq and tnh and to 1965 2019 at jm to reduce the error of air temperature interpolation in sparse gauged areas this study generated the gridded daily air temperature mean maximum and minimum data the gridded air temperature merged the climatic

photosynthetically active radiation fpar which reflect the vegetation dynamics were obtained from the lai3g and frar3g datasets respectively zhu et al 2013 this work employed field observations and remote sensing data for calibrating and validating the gbehm model as for field observations besides the monthly river discharge data in the three hydrological stations the frozen depth measurements were taken at 11 cma sites within the research area frozen ground types of 53 boreholes were collected from published articles luo et al 2012 qin et al 2017 zou et al 2017 luo et al 2018 zheng et al

the evapotranspiration derived from gbehm the total water storage anomaly twsa from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo during 2003 2019 were used to evaluate the model simulation results because of the intermittent data within grace and the data gap between grace and grace fo the reconstruction of grace twsa data by rateb et al 2022 were used in this study by using a bayesian framework rateb et al 2022 has filled all the 33 missing solutions including the missing data within grace and the 11 months data gap july 2017 may 2018 between grace and grace fo 3 methods 3 1 statistical analysis methods the double mass curve method is a visual practical and effective way to check the consistency and long term trend of hydrometeorological data mu et al 2010 gao et al 2013 it was first put forward by merriam when analyzing the consistency of precipitation data in susquehanna watershed in the united states in 1937 merriam 1937 the double mass curve method was further systematically explained by searcy searcy et al 1960 in terms of the theory basis and practical applications this method is based on the fact that the plot of the cumulative data of one variable versus the cumulative data of another variable would exhibit a straight line if the relationship between the two variables is a fixed ratio if the relation between such two variables changes a break will be shown in the double mass curve these changes may be caused by changes of data collection or from the physical changes that influence the relation searcy et al 1960 the double mass curve method is widely used in exploring the precipitation runoff relation change and analyzing the impact of water and soil conservation works or land use cover changes on runoff and sedimentation in the recent 30 years in china mu et al 2010 in this study the double mass curve of precipitation versus runoff in sryr is plotted to examine whether the precipitation runoff relation has changed the regression slope change in the double mass curve of precipitation vs runoff reflects that the runoff generation has changed per unit of precipitation and the change point year represents when the change happens gao et al 2011 gao et al 2013 the runoff change between the pre change and post change periods can be calculated as 1 δ r r 2 r 1 where δ r is the change in mean annual runoff r 1 is the mean value of annual runoff observed in the pre change period r 2 is mean value of annual runoff observed in the post change period in the pre change period a linear regression between the cumulative precipitation and cumulative runoff can be established as 2 r a p b where r and p are the annual runoff and precipitation respectively and a and b are the linear regression coefficients if the precipitation runoff relation keeps unchanged the predicted runoff r 2 in the post change period can be calculated using the observed precipitation in the post change period as input and the established linear regression as eq 2 the change in runoff δ r pre can be thought only caused by precipitation variations which can be calculated by 3 δ r pre r 2 r 1 where δ r pre is the runoff change caused by precipitation variations r 2 is the predicted runoff in the post change period r 1 is the mean annual runoff observed in the pre change period the total runoff change δ r between the pre change and post change periods is caused by both precipitation variations and precipitation runoff relation change thus can be calculated as 4 δ r δ r pre δ r other where δ r other is runoff change caused by factors other than precipitation variations and the other factors concludes physical changes which affect the precipitation runoff relationship combining eq 1 eq 3 and eq 4 the runoff change due to precipitation runoff change δ r other can be calculated by 5 δ r other δ r δ r pre r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 2 statistical tests are often used for the significance of the breaks in the slope of double mass curves searcy et al 1960 the moving t test was used in this work to identify the possible abrupt changes in the slope of the double mass curves as well as abrupt changes in the annual runoff time series before and after the potential abrupt change point the series is divided into two subseries and the moving t test is a method to determine if the difference between the two subseries averages is statistically significant the formula is expressed as yin et al 2015 6 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 7 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where n i x i and s i 2 are the data length average value and variance of the two subseries i 1 2 the fixed length n of the two subseries were defined before and after the possible change points n n 1 n 2 following eq 6 the t m m 1 2 n was calculated successively applying the moving method to a set of datum points the point is identified as an abrupt change so long as the t m t α where α is the significance level in this work the subseries length n and significance level α were set to 10 and 0 05 respectively in addition when detecting the significance of long term trends of precipitation runoff and air temperature we adopted mann kendall nonparametric test yang et al 2014 3 2 model description and performance evaluation this study used a distributed process based model gbehm to simulate the long term changes in the frozen ground and hydrological components gao et al 2018 gbehm has been developed based on the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 2002a yang et al 2015 gbehm keeps the basic structure of gbhm with the hillslope as the fundamental unit of hydrological modelling compared with gbhm gbehm incorporates new modules related to cryospheric processes including glacier ablation snow melting and soil freezing thawing yang et al 2015 qin et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the coupled soil water and heat transfer simulations are achieved by solving the energy balance equation as follows flerchinger and saxton 1989 8 c s t t ρ ice l f θ ice t z k s t z ρ liq c liq q liq t z 0 where ρ ice and ρ liq are the density of ice and liquid water kg m 3 c s is the volumetric heat capacity at each soil layer j m 3 k 1 t is the soil temperature k in each layer k s is the thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 l f is the latent heat of fusion j kg 1 θ ice is the volumetric ice content in each layer m3 m 3 t is the time step s z is the soil depth m q liq is the vertical liquid water flux m s 1 c liq is the specific heat capacity of water j kg 1 k 1 the thermal conductivity of unsaturated soil k s as an important parameter is calculated using the method of farouki 1981 and it is calibrated using the frozen depth measurements within sryr other details of these cryospheric processes are in the supplementary materials text s1 gbehm also coupled the methods of the simple biosphere model 2 sib2 in solving canopy interception radiation transfer and land surface energy balance gao et al 2018

observations table 1 shows the long term trends in air temperature precipitation runoff and runoff ratio of all sub regions and the entire sryr during 1960 2019 the mean annual air temperature shows significant increasing trends for all sub regions with a warming rate of 0 37 c 10a in the entire region all sub regions exhibited rising trends in annual precipitation with rates of 17 6 mm 10a 4 3 mm 10a and 12 3 mm 10a for jm jm mq and mq tnh respectively and 11 7 mm 10a for the whole sryr except for jm mq all sub regions had significant precipitation trends p 0 05 in contrast the annual runoff decreased by 2 61 mm 10a for the whole sryr during the same period with negative trends for all sub regions except jm table 1 the runoff trend was only statistically significant at jm mq as a result the runoff ratio in the sryr showed a significant decrease 0 011 10a over the past 60 years fig 2 a d shows the inter annual variations of precipitation and runoff in the sryr and the sub regions the corresponding double mass curves of precipitation versus runoff for each region are shown in fig 2 e h the moving t test identified two abrupt changes 1989 and 2004 in the annual runoff approximate to the change point years reported in previous studies wang et al 2018b wu et al 2020 therefore we define the period of 1960 1989 as the reference period p1 which denotes the natural undisturbed condition according to the annual runoff change points 1989 and 2004 we divided the period of 1990 2019 into 2 periods period 2 p2 1990 2004 and period 3 p3 2005 2019 during p1 precipitation and runoff values ranged around the multi year average in all sub regions from p1 to p2 almost all sub regions showed declines in both runoff and precipitation except for jm the magnitudes of the runoff decline were larger than those of precipitation decline in all sub regions since 2005 the precipitation and runoff have increased in all regions during p3 the averageannual precipitation is much higher than the multi year average with the average annual runoff just rising to around the multi year average value of 1960 2019 in the double mass curves fig 2e h there exist two change point years in jm 1984 and 2005 and mq tnh 1989 and 2003 which are close to the two abrupt change years in the annual runoff from fig 2e and fig 2g the runoff ratio the regression line slope in jm and mq tnh experienced a decrease during 1989 2004 and then increased since 2004 but the runoff ratio during 2005 2019 is still smaller than that during 1960 1989 according to the double mass curves there is only one significant change point year 1989 in jm mq and sryr fig 2f and fig 2h which indicates that the precipitation runoff relationship has changed since 1989 and the runoff generated by per unit precipitation has decreased such changes in the double mass curves may be caused by the rising air temperature and consequent changes in potential evapotranspiration and land surface characteristics applying the double mass curve method the runoff change from p1 to p2 p3 δr can be divided into the part explained by the change in mean annual precipitation δrpre and the part induced by other factors δrother table 2 from p1 to p2 δrother is more negative than δrpre indicating the precipitation runoff relationship change accounts for a larger part of the runoff decrease at all sub regions of sryr in p3 compared with p1 if the precipitation runoff relationship keeps the same as that in p1 runoff should increase by 20 0 mm for the entire sryr however the precipitation runoff relationship change caused a runoff decrease of 26 5 mm which led to an overall runoff decrease of 6 5 mm table 2 it is possible that human actions such as soil and water conservation measures and changes in land use cover will result in a shift in the precipitation runoff relationship mu et al 2010 for sryr the frozen ground is a critical landscape feature and its degradation due to climate warming might contribute to the precipitation runoff relationship change and the consequent runoff decrease wang et al 2018b in the following sections we will focus on the mechanism by which the frozen ground degradation affects the precipitation runoff relationship and runoff generation processes based on the physically based model 4 2 validation of the gbehm the simulation results from gbehm are needed to explore the connections between frozen ground degradation and hydrological changes here we evaluate the performance of model results using multi source observations long term data at 11 sites during 1967 2017 were used to verify the frozen ground depth simulation the simulated frozen depths are highly associated with the measurements r2 0 77 and p 0 05 and the variations are within an accepted level rmse 0 28 m and mean bias 0 02 m fig s1a fig s1b shows that the model can well capture the monthly variations of the frozen ground depth at different elevation ranges the simulated permafrost distribution during 2010 2019 fig 3 a has also been validated using the field observations at 53 boreholes drilled during 2009 2016 luo et al 2012 qin et al 2017 zou et al 2017 luo et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 supplementary table s1 the simulated frozen ground distribution obtained a high accuracy with all 21 21 sfg boreholes and 93 8 30 32 of permafrost boreholes being accurately identified the permafrost map in the 2010 s is fairly similar to the permafrost map derived from zheng et al 2020 in the sryr fig 3b fig 4 compares the observed and simulated monthly streamflow at the jm mq and tnh stations from 1960 to 1989 calibration period and from 1990 to 2019 validation period table 3 displays the assessment metrics for river discharge simulations at the three hydrological sites in general the simulation results at mq and tnh were better than those at jm tnh station is the outlet of the basin in the calibration period the nse and r2 at tnh station were 0 90 and 0 90 with the pbias of 6 0 in the validation period the nse and r2 were 0 88 and 0 88 at tnh station with the pbias of 0 3 the simulation results in mq were comparable to those at tnh these results imply that the simulated results can reproduce the observed monthly streamflow variations the monthly twsa from model simulation and grace grace fo datasets for the period of 2003 2019 were compared as shown in fig 5 results from grace grace fo showed a slightly increasing trend of total water storage in the sryr with a rate of 0 15 mm per month p 0 05 and the simulated twsa by gbehm increased by 0 31 mm per month p 0 05 the difference in twsa trends may arise from the sharp decrease during 2016 2017 from grace fig 5 which is related to possible operational issues in the final phase of the grace satellite mission chen et al 2020 the twsa increase in sryr may be related to permafrost degradation wang et al 2018b meanwhile the monthly twsa by gbehm was consistent with the twsa from grace grace fo with a correlation coefficient r of 0 76 p 0 05 which indicates that the model can simulate the temporal variability of twsa reasonably besides with an rmse of 7 41 mm and a correlation coefficient r of 0 98 p 0 05 the monthly evapotranspiration from gbehm was consistent with the evapotranspiration from gleam at the catchment scale supplementary fig s2 4 3 changes of the frozen ground and water balance components in the sryr as simulated permafrost distribution from the gbehm permafrost accounts for 52 5 65016 km2 of the sryr in the 1960 s whereas the area ratio underlain by permafrost decreased to 31 5 39060 km2 in the 2010 s indicating that approximately 40 of the permafrost has degraded into sfg in the past 60 years fig 6 the area where permafrost degraded to sfg is mainly located in the central and northwestern sryr covering an elevation range of 4000 4600 m the percentage of permafrost area decreased continuously at a rate of 3 7 10a due to the constant rising air temperature fig 7 a fig 7b shows the long term variations of the areal mean maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground mtsfg and active layer thickness alt of the permafrost the mtsfg decreased by 0 10 m 10a while the alt increased by 0 06 m 10a during 1960 2019 and both trends were statistically significant p 0 05 fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of the long term mean value and trends in water balance components including annual precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration changes in the past 60 years the mean annual precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest with a range of 310 mm to 885 mm with an average basin value of 540 mm fig 8a the precipitation increased considerably upstream of jm and in mq tnh fig 8d where the precipitation is relatively low however precipitation changed insignificantly in large areas in jm mq and mq tnh where precipitation is relatively high fig 8d the spatial pattern of mean annual evapotranspiration distribution is similar to that of mean annual precipitation decreasing from southeast to northwest with an average basin value of 375 mm fig 8b evapotranspiration generally increased in the whole basin and showed a larger increase in the upstream of jm where precipitation also increased the most fig 8e the distribution of mean annual runoff also resembles that of precipitation with the main runoff generation area located in the southeast fig 8c the runoff trends showed considerable spatial heterogeneity due to the joint influence of precipitation and evapotranspiration in jm mq and mq tnh where precipitation changed insignificantly runoff showed a decreasing trend in contrast runoff increased significantly in the high altitude area in jm and mq tnh where the precipitation increased significantly comparing fig 8c and fig 8f the runoff decreased in the major runoff generation region jm mq which is the main reason why the average basin runoff decreased in sryr over the last 60 years fig 9 shows the water balance components change along the elevation gradient precipitation increased at all elevation ranges generally with larger increases at higher elevations the evapotranspiration also showed increasing trends at all elevation ranges while the most significant increase occurred in the elevation range between 3700 and 3900 m the runoff trend showed an evident dependence on elevation with an increasing trend above 4200 m and a decreasing trend below 4200 m the runoff decreased in the elevation ranges where the increasing trend of evapotranspiration exceeds that of precipitation the runoff generation capacity indicated by the simulated runoff ratio has also been examined the value of runoff ratio decreased below 4400 m and the decreasing trend is significant below 4000 m while the runoff ratio increased insignificantly above 4400 m indicating elevation dependent precipitation runoff relationship changes 4 4 hydrological impacts of frozen ground degradation in different frozen ground regions from 1960 to 2019 the considerable rise in air temperature has resulted in a remarkable degradation of the sryr s frozen ground fig 6 fig 7 to further explore the changes of hydrological processes in different frozen ground regions according to fig 6 we divided the entire study area into three frozen ground regions i e the permafrost region persistent permafrost throughout 1960 2019 the sfg region persistent sfg throughout 1960 2019 and the degradation region area where permafrost degraded into sfg some studies have reported improved hydraulic connectivity due to permafrost degradation in the sryr through isotope tracing methods zheng et al 2016 wan et al 2019 in this study this phenomenon was also reflected by the changing composition of runoff components in the gbehm the runoff can be divided into two components i e surface runoff and subsurface runoff the subsurface runoff includes the groundwater flow and the lateral flow via the unsaturated zone table 4 shows the changes in the proportions of the two runoff components during p1 p2 and p3 at the three frozen ground regions and the entire sryr for all frozen ground regions the proportion of surface runoff to total runoff exhibited a decline whereas the proportion of subsurface runoff to total runoff showed an increase in p2 and p3 compared with p1 but the degreeofchangevaries withdifferentfrozen ground types in the degradation region the changes of the runoff components were the largest and the ratio of surface runoff to total runoff showed a decrease of 6 0 and 6 7 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 respectively indicating an increasing proportion of subsurface runoff in the permafrost region the ratio of surface runoff to total runoff decreased by 4 8 and 3 3 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 respectively meanwhile in the sfg region the ratios of two runoff components didn t change much only 1 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 the above results indicated that permafrost degradation played an essential role in enhancing subsurface runoff in the permafrost region and degradation region grace grace fo data have revealed the increased total water storage in sryr during the last two decades xu et al 2013 xu et al 2016 furthermore this study investigated the twsa trend with elevation fig 9c shows the simulated twsa trend along elevation and the area percentage of degradation region where permafrost degraded into sfg at each elevation range from 1960 to 2019 in the elevation between 4000 m and 4500 m the area percentage of degradation region is within 38 to 57 with the largest percentage occurring at 4200 4300 m significant increasing trends of twsa with a range of 2 6 mm a to 4 7 mm a also happened at the elevation of 4000 4500 m with significant degradation with the most prominent twsa trend occurring at 4100 4200 m corroborating the linkage between permafrost degradation and increases in groundwater storage xu et al 2013 wang et al 2018b at elevations above 4600 m the twsa also showed an increasing trend larger than 3 2 mm a which could be associated with the permafrost active layer thickening and the consequent increase in soil water storage capacity fig s3 shows the temporal changes in mean annual soil moisture and alt in the permafrost region the mean annual soil moisture shows a significant increase 0 004 cm 3 cm 3 a with the alt increasing from 1960 to 2019 and there is a positive correlation between annual soil moisture and alt with a correlation coefficient of 0 94 fig s4 shows the basin average twsa trends in three regions the twsa significantly increased by 2 9 mm a 5 7 mm a and 1 0 mm a in the permafrost region degradation region and seasonally frozen ground region respectively the results indicated that the degradation of frozen ground significantly increased the total water storage of the sryr to better understand soil water movement with permafrost thawing we select the elevation zone of 4300 4400 m as a typical permafrost region where the permafrost degradation area 7839 km2 in this elevation range accounts for 30 2 of the total degradation area 25956 km2 fig 10 shows the soil profile of temperature ice and liquid water content between 4300 and 4400 m the soil temperature in this elevation range rose continuously and reached 0 c in deeper layers around 10 m for a relatively long period 1976 2008 when soil water existed in a liquid solid mixture with the temperature rising the soil ice content decreased and the soil liquid water content increased especially at a depth of 1 5 m to 2 5 m below the ground surface fig 10b c such changes in soil profiles suggest that the disappearance of permafrost as an impermeable layer allows water to move deeper which is in accordance with the opinion that permafrost degradation could boost the hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater cheng and wu 2007 qin et al 2017 gao et al 2018 unlike the decrease in the annual runoff the winter december to february runoff showed a slightly increasing trend over the entire sryr over the past 60 years fig 11 shows the inter annual variations of areal mean winter runoff in different frozen ground types the winter runoff increased by 0 52 mm 10a in the permafrost region and by 1 59 mm 10a in the degradation region fig s5 shows the trends of mean winter soil moisture at different soil depths in the permafrost degradation regions significant positive trends were shown in both regions especially in deeper layers the deep soil moisture 1 5 2 5 m depth below the ground surface increased by 0 002 cm 3 cm 3 a in the permafrost region and by 0 005 cm 3 cm 3 a in the degradation region fig s5 in the permafrost region the soil moisture increased the most at a rate of 0 003 cm 3 cm 3 a at 1 5 1 7 m depth which is close to the alt in the permafrost region as the active layer thickens soil water percolates deeper and accumulates near the permafrost table and the supra permafrost groundwater could in turn form base flow in the degradation region the soil moisture showed increasing trends at all layers except for the third layer 0 15 0 3 m and fourth layer 0 3 0 5 m at 2 2 2 5 m depth the most prominent soil moisture increasing rate is 0 008 cm 3 cm 3 a larger than in the permafrost region such soil moisture increases indicated that the disappearance of permafrost as an impermeable layer led to water draining to deeper soil layers this phenomenon has also reported by researches in arctic rivers peterson et al 2002 yang et al 2002b these results indicated that permafrost active layer thickening and the transition from permafrost to sfg could significantly enhance subsurface hydrological processes and change the streamflow seasonality by increasing base flow and winter runoff walvoord and kurylyk 2016 5 discussion there have been numerous efforts to comprehend the long term variations of runoff in sryr but the conclusions are varied most of the previous studies adopted top down approaches which can be divided into two categories one type was through statistical analysis among precipitation runoff and air temperature as in hu et al 2011 and ma et al 2019 which could only examine the statistical relationships without physical mechanisms another type was using budyko framework which implicitly consider physical mechanism by landscape factor n to quantify the impact of climate change and land surface change on runoff wang et al 2018b however this approach was still lacking in direct evidence from physical processes such studies underscored the role of permafrost degradation in the runoff change of the sryr but whether permafrost degradation increases or decreases runoff remains debatable wang et al 2018b wu et al 2018a in comparison this study adopted the bottom up approach i e a physically based model gbehm to unravel the physical mechanism through which the frozen ground degradation affects runoff on the basis of the precipitation runoff relationship change revealed by the double mass curve method in sryr in the past 60 years the gbehm model further provides a mechanism explanation for the decrease in runoff generation capacity the results show that in the past 60 years the frozen ground in the sryr has degraded significantly which changed the regional hydrological processes the changes include increased soil water capacity and soil moisture figs s3 s4 increased groundwater storage fig 9 altered runoff components more subsurface runoff and less surface runoff table 4 and modified runoff seasonality more winter runoff fig 11 these results indicate that frozen ground degradation would enhance surface hydrological processes by boosting the hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater fig 10 corroborating the hypothesis proposed by previous studies cheng and wu 2007 yang et al 2019 with evidence from process based modelling this study also verifies the hypothesis that frozen ground degradation would enlarge the catchment water storage capacity wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c shi et al 2020 including soil water storage increase due to larger alt fig s3 and groundwater storage increase especially in the degradation region fig 9 which could in turn decrease the runoff generation capacity at the basin scale but some questions such as the tipping point of the groundwater increase and separation of increased evapotranspiration caused by increased soil water storage capacity vegetation greening or the direct impact of rising air temperature remain unanswered and need to be further explored by future studies in addition in order to accurately reproduce the frozen ground and hydrological changes of the sryr in the past 60 years great efforts have also been made to improve the simulation accuracy since air temperature is essential in accurately simulating the soil freezing process and evapotranspiration process we merged the air temperature background field data terraclimate 2020 with the meteorological data before data merging at several stations with insufficient data during 1960 2019 data extension was carried out using the correlation between them and adjacent stations to ensure the consistency multiple source data including remote sensing data and sites data were used for model evaluation which proves the overall satisfying performance in reproducing streamflow frozen ground type frozen ground depth groundwater storage and evapotranspiration furthermore we compared the permafrost map and degradation rate with other studies in the area between elevation 4300 and 4400 m the area of permafrost degrading to sfg is 7839 km2 accounting for 30 2 of the total degradation area 25956 km2 this result is in accordance with that the permafrost lower altitudinal limit in sryr is located at 4250 4400 m reported by jin et al 2009 based on observations several previous studies have also estimated the degrading rates of permafrost in the sryr the permafrost area percentage in the sryr is estimated to have decreased by 11 1 throughout 1971 2010 by wang et al 2018a utilizing the temperature at the top of permafrost ttop model while in this study the average permafrost percentage decreased by 11 1 from the 1970 s 1970 1979 to 2000 s 2000 2009 indicating a similar permafrost decreasing rate which further proved that the permafrost change in this study is within a reasonable range this study unravels the possible effects of permafrost degradation on hydrological processes runoff components and seasonality by enhanced surface water groundwater connectivity and increased subsurface water storage using the simulation results from a physically based model it should be noted that there can also be other mechanisms that have not been considered in this study for example permafrost degradation could also lead to changes in vegetation growth or even vegetation succession which could in turn affect the hydrological cycle jin et al 2021 jin et al 2022b wang et al 2022 the effects of frozen ground change on runoff via other mechanisms like vegetation modulated changes can be explored by future research 6 conclusion this study explored the long term variations in the annual precipitation runoff relationship as well as the impacts of frozen ground changes from 1960 to 2019 based on the simulations by a distributed eco hydrological model gbehm the main findings are as follows 1 the observed data showed that the precipitation runoff relationship changed since 1989 over the entire sryr and the runoff ratio declined from 0 34 during 1960 1989 to 0 28 during 1990 2019 based on the double mass curve method compared with p1 1960 1989 the basin averaged runoff decreased by 44 3 mm and 6 5 mm during p2 1990 2004 and p3 2005 2019 in which the precipitation runoff relationship change led to a decrease of 37 8 mm in p2 and a decrease of 26 5 mm in p3 respectively 2 from 1960 to 2019 the mtsfg decreased by 0 10 m 10a while the alt increased by 0 06 m 10a the permafrost area decreased from 65016 km2 to 39060 km2 with a total decrease of 25956 km2 accounting for 21 0 of the sryr area the runoff reduction mainly occurred in the area with elevation below 4200 m where the evapotranspiration increase exceeded the precipitation increase 3 from 1960 to 2019 in the permafrost region the soil moisture increased by 0 004 cm 3 cm 3 a and the twsa increased by 2 9 mm a in the degradation region where permafrost completely thawed the twsa increased by 5 7 mm a the ratio of subsurface runoff to the total runoff increased by 6 0 and 6 7 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 in the degradation region highlighting the critical role of permafrost degradation in increasing the total water storage 4 the winter runoff increased significantly at the rate of 0 52 mm 10a and 1 59 mm 10a in the permafrost region and the degradation region respectively indicating that the frozen ground degradation has changed the runoff seasonality the findings of this study could help provide a better understanding of the changes in hydrological processes considering frozen ground degradation under a warming climate additionally the findings have significant implications for policymakers seeking to develop sustainable policies for water resources management in the yellow river basin credit

2491,the source region of the yellow river sryr in the northeastern tibetan plateau is critical for supplying water resources to downstream areas however streamflow in the sryr declined despite a slight increase in precipitation during the past few decades the sryr experienced significant frozen ground degradation with climate warming but how frozen ground degradation influences runoff remains unclear this study investigated the changes of the precipitation runoff relationship using the double mass curve method and examined the impact of long term spatiotemporal changes in frozen ground on the water balance components using the geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm the results showed that the precipitation runoff relationship changed significantly since 1989 in the sryr from 1960 to 2019 in the same period the areal mean value of the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground mtsfg decreased by 0 10 m 10a and the areal mean active layer thickness alt of permafrost increased by 0 06 m 10a besides 21 0 of the entire sryr has degraded from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground sfg runoff decreased mainly in the region with elevation below 4200 m where the evapotranspiration increase exceeded the precipitation increase frozen ground degradation significantly altered the hydrological processes which is reflected by the increased subsurface runoff and the decreased surface runoff the total water storage increased by 2 9 mm a in the permafrost region due to the increase in active layer thickness and by 5 7 mm a in the degradation region where permafrost completely thawed during 1960 2019 the runoff seasonality was also altered being indicated as an increase in winter runoff these findings help provide a better understanding of the runoff change under climate warming in permafrost affected regions and provide insights into future water resources management in the yellow river basin under the climate warming keywords yellow river frozen ground hydrological processes runoff changes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction frozen ground an essential landscape characteristic of the cryosphere underlies about 50 of the exposed land surface in the northern hemisphere zhang et al 1999 frozen ground contains two major categories permafrost where the ground temperature maintains below 0 c at least two consecutive years cuo et al 2015 and seasonally frozen ground sfg where the ground experiences yearly freeze and thaw wang et al 2019 due to the susceptibility of frozen ground to climate warming it often serves as one of the climate change indicators vaughan et al 2013 in the permafrost region frozen ground degradation manifests as the active layer thickening or complete permafrost thaw while in the sfg region the degradation is reflected by the decreasing annual maximum frozen depth jin et al 2009 cheng and jin 2013 zhao et al 2020 due to the low permeability of permafrost frozen ground serves as an aquitard that controls the hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater bring et al 2016 ma et al 2021 the freeze thaw processes in the permafrost active layer and the sfg control hydrological processes including infiltration soil water movement rainfall runoff base flow process and evapotranspiration ala aho et al 2021 gao et al 2021 with rapid rising air temperature frozen ground degradation has dramatically altered the hydrological regimes in cold regions significantly influencing the downstream water resources frozen ground degradation could boost infiltration expand soil water storage capacity change the runoff seasonality and increase the base flow walvoord and kurylyk 2016 duan et al 2017 jin et al 2022a therefore the frozen ground degradation and its consequent hydrological impacts have aroused growing concern worldwide walvoord and kurylyk 2016 gao et al 2021 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b which needs more in depth quantitative analysis the tibet plateau tp also known as the asian water tower contains several source regions of large asian rivers which provide water for 1 4 billion people downstream immerzeel et al 2010 underlain by the world s largest extent of alpine permafrost the hydrological impacts of permafrost degradation on the tp remain largely unknown the streamflow responses to permafrost degradation may vary in space with different climatic and geographic characteristics multiple factors including climate frozen ground types and vegetation would alter the streamflow responses in the cold basins song et al 2021 for instance in the arctic regions river flows were observed to have increased in recent decades spence et al 2015 bring et al 2016 with increasing atmospheric moisture precipitation as well as late summer rain rawlins et al 2010 spence et al 2015 bring et al 2016 however in the tp despite increased streamflow observed in the glacier fed rivers yi et al 2021 the streamflow in many permafrost dominated basins declined woo et al 2008 liang et al 2010 wang et al 2018b thawing permafrost and concomitant hydrological changes have been extensively studied in the pan arctic bring et al 2016 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 lafreniere and lamoureux 2019 koch et al 2022 but have been relatively less investigated in the tp gao et al 2021 the streamflow responses at different frozen ground types including permafrost region sfg region and degradation region where permafrost degraded to sfg remain elusive the source region of the yellow river sryr located in the northeastern tp provides about 38 of the yellow river s yearly total runoff serving as one of the most crucial runoff generation regions for the yellow river hu et al 2011 wu et al 2018b jin et al 2022b the sryr is located in the transition area of permafrost and sfg with a semi humid and cold climate and has experienced considerable frozen ground degradation due to climate warming jin et al 2009 wang et al 2018a in sryr permafrost degradation has been evidently proved by observations from the shrinkage of permafrost extent the thickening of permafrost active layer and ground temperature rising jin et al 2009 cheng and jin 2013 luo et al 2020 sheng et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 a series of environmental and ecological problems have emerged with these permafrost changes and hydrological regimes have also experienced profound changes in this region jin et al 2022b recently many studies have noticed the divergent changing trends in precipitation and runoff in the sryr meng et al 2016 wang et al 2018b ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 over the past few decades the runoff exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend although precipitation exhibited a significant increase p 0 05 in the sryr the sryr experienced a low flow period in the 1990 s when both precipitation and runoff were relatively low still the annual runoff did not recover as much as precipitation since the 21st century wang et al 2018b contrasting precipitation and runoff changes are not specific to the sryr but also observed in other parts of the world accompanied by dramatic changes in climate and land use cover destouni et al 2010 jarsjo et al 2012 destouni et al 2013 jaramillo et al 2013 karlsson et al 2015 karlsson et al 2015 investigated the divergent precipitation and runoff trends in some arctic river basins they found that the landscape changes were needed to explain such divergences in precipitation and runoff trends besides atmospheric climate warming in sryr the widespread permafrost is highly vulnerable to climate warming and cannot be neglected when discussing the impacts of climate change on runoff wang et al 2018b wu et al 2018a although some researchers have attempted to explain such inconsistent variability between precipitation and runoff in the sryr the conclusions were mixed wang et al 2018b ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 statistical analysis results cannot explain the mechanism by which frozen ground degradation affects hydrological processes moreover the factors leading to the long term runoff decline despite the increased precipitation in the sryr remain unclear statistical analysis based on observations from hydrological stations can only reflect the runoff changes of the entire basin but cannot accurately reflect the spatial variations within the catchment specifically frozen ground degradation is highly correlated with climate warming and it s hard to separate the effects of frozen ground degradation on runoff based on statistical approaches therefore physically based models can serve as a powerful tool to depict the hydrological processes in high mountain catchments with high spatial heterogeneity physically based models coupled with water heat dynamics can be useful in unraveling the impacts of soil freeze thaw on hydrological processes gao et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 gao et al 2021 gao et al 2022 the geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm developed by yang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 has been applied to several cold catchments in the tp and showed good performances in simulating permafrost and hydrological processes qin et al 2017 gao et al 2018 shi et al 2020 hence can be useful in estimating the long term spatiotemporal changes of frozen ground and analyzing its impacts on the hydrological processes in the sryr over the past 60 years based on the previous studies this paper aims to identify the forms and degrees of frozen ground degradation in the sryr during the past 60 years and the corresponding effect on the hydrological processes to better understand the characteristics and causes of runoff change in this region therefore the objectives are i to comprehend the precipitation runoff relationship change in the sryr based on long term observations during the past 60 years ii to examine the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological processes over the past 60 years by the distributed hydrological modeling iii to explore the hydrological impacts of frozen ground degradation in the sryr 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the sryr in the northeastern tp spanning a longitude range

the transitional region between the permafrost and the sfg regions in the sryr there are three hydrological stations jimai jm maqu mq and tnh according to the hydrological stations the sryr was separated into 3 sub regions the area upstream of jm jm the area between jm and mq jm mq and the area between mq and tnh mq tnh jm has the highest mean elevation of 4465 m whereas jm mq and mq tnh have lower mean elevations of 3902 m and 3946 m respectively the regions jm jm mq and mq tnh contribute 21 51 and 28 respectively to the overall flow of the sryr meng et al 2016 the sryr produces 35 of the total runoff of yellow river basin and is the primary runoff generation zone for yellow river 2 2 data the precipitation runoff and air temperature data were analyzed to determine the long term climatic and hydrological changes in the sryr the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa with a 0 25 0 25 resolution is a gridded daily precipitation dataset interpolated from gauge data using the optimal interpolation method provided by shen and xiong 2016 the inherent uncertainty of cgdpa mainly arises from the interpolation of gauged data over the sparse gauged areas despite the uncertainty the cgdpa is widely used in climate change studies over mainland china due to its long data record from 1955 to the present and data reliability by incorporating quality controlled observed data from about 2400 gauge stations shen and xiong 2016 the monthly streamflow data for the jm mq and tnh stations were taken from the hydrological yearbook published by the ministry of water resources of china https www mwr gov cn english in this study we collected the most recent data expanding the period of river discharge data to 1960 2019 at mq and tnh and to 1965 2019 at jm to reduce the error of air temperature interpolation in sparse gauged areas this study generated the gridded daily air temperature mean maximum and minimum data the gridded air temperature merged the climatic

were taken at 11 cma sites within the research area frozen ground types of 53 boreholes were collected from published articles luo et al 2012 qin et al 2017 zou et al 2017 luo et al 2018 zheng et al

et al 2010 gao et al 2013 it was first put forward by merriam when analyzing the consistency of precipitation data in susquehanna watershed in the united states in 1937 merriam 1937 the double mass curve method was further systematically explained by searcy searcy et al 1960 in terms of the theory basis and practical applications this method is based on the fact that the plot of the cumulative data of one variable versus the cumulative data of another variable would exhibit a straight line if the relationship between the two variables is a fixed ratio if the relation between such two variables changes a break will be shown in the double mass curve these changes may be caused by changes of data collection or from the physical changes that influence the relation searcy et al 1960 the double mass curve method is widely used in exploring the precipitation runoff relation change and analyzing the impact of water and soil conservation works or land use cover changes on runoff and sedimentation in the recent 30 years in china mu et al 2010 in this study the double mass curve of precipitation versus runoff in sryr is plotted to examine whether the precipitation runoff relation has changed the regression slope change in the double mass curve of precipitation vs runoff reflects that the runoff generation has changed per unit of precipitation and the change point year represents when the change happens gao et al 2011 gao et al 2013 the runoff change between the pre change and post change periods can be calculated as 1 δ r r 2 r 1 where δ r is the change in mean annual runoff r 1 is the mean value of annual runoff observed in the pre change period r 2 is mean value of annual runoff observed in the post change period in the pre change period a linear regression between the cumulative precipitation and cumulative runoff can be established as 2 r a p b where r and p are the annual runoff and precipitation respectively and a and b are the linear regression coefficients if the precipitation runoff relation keeps unchanged the predicted runoff r 2 in the post change period can be calculated using the observed precipitation in the post change period as input and the established linear regression as eq 2 the change in runoff δ r pre can be thought only caused by precipitation variations which can be calculated by 3 δ r pre r 2 r 1 where δ r pre is the runoff change caused by precipitation variations r 2 is the predicted runoff in the post change period r 1 is the mean annual runoff observed in the pre change period the total runoff change δ r between the pre change and post change periods is caused by both precipitation variations and precipitation runoff relation change thus can be calculated as 4 δ r δ r pre δ r other where δ r other is runoff change caused by factors other than precipitation variations and the other factors concludes physical changes which affect the precipitation runoff relationship combining eq 1 eq 3 and eq 4 the runoff change due to precipitation runoff change δ r other can be calculated by 5 δ r other δ r δ r pre r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 2 statistical tests are often used for the significance of the breaks in the slope of double mass curves searcy et al 1960 the moving t test was used in this work to identify the possible abrupt changes in the slope of the double mass curves as well as abrupt changes in the annual runoff time series before and after the potential abrupt change point the series is divided into two subseries and the moving t test is a method to determine if the difference between the two subseries averages is statistically significant the formula is expressed as yin et al 2015 6 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 7 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where n i x i and s i 2 are the data length average value and variance of the two subseries i 1 2 the fixed length n of the two subseries were defined before and after the possible change points n n 1 n 2 following eq 6 the t m m 1 2 n was calculated successively applying the moving method to a set of datum points the point is identified as an abrupt change so long as the t m t α where α is the significance level in this work the subseries length n and significance level α were set to 10 and 0 05 respectively in addition when detecting the significance of long term trends of precipitation runoff and air temperature we adopted mann kendall nonparametric test yang et al 2014 3 2 model description and performance evaluation this study used a distributed process based model gbehm to simulate the long term changes in the frozen ground and hydrological components gao et al 2018 gbehm has been developed based on the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 2002a yang et al 2015 gbehm keeps the basic structure of gbhm with the hillslope as the fundamental unit of hydrological modelling compared with gbhm gbehm incorporates new modules related to cryospheric processes including glacier ablation snow melting and soil freezing thawing yang et al 2015 qin et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the coupled soil water and heat transfer simulations are achieved by solving the energy balance equation as follows flerchinger and saxton 1989 8 c s t t ρ ice l f θ ice t z k s t z ρ liq c liq q liq t z 0 where ρ ice and ρ liq are the density of ice and liquid water kg m 3 c s is the volumetric heat capacity at each soil layer j m 3 k 1 t is the soil temperature k in each layer k s is the thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 l f is the latent heat of fusion j kg 1 θ ice is the volumetric ice content in each layer m3 m 3 t is the time step s z is the soil depth m q liq is the vertical liquid water flux m s 1 c liq is the specific heat capacity of water j kg 1 k 1 the thermal conductivity of unsaturated soil k s as an important parameter is calculated using the method of farouki 1981 and it is calibrated using the frozen depth measurements within sryr other details of these cryospheric processes are in the supplementary materials text s1 gbehm also coupled the methods of the simple biosphere model 2 sib2 in solving canopy interception radiation transfer and land surface energy balance gao et al 2018

observations table 1 shows the long term trends in air temperature precipitation runoff and runoff ratio of all sub regions and the entire sryr during 1960 2019 the mean annual air temperature shows significant increasing trends for all sub regions with a warming rate of 0 37 c 10a in the entire region all sub regions exhibited rising trends in annual precipitation with rates of 17 6 mm 10a 4 3 mm 10a and 12 3 mm 10a for jm jm mq and mq tnh respectively and 11 7 mm 10a for the whole sryr except for jm mq all sub regions had significant precipitation trends p 0 05 in contrast the annual runoff decreased by 2 61 mm 10a for the whole sryr during the same period with negative trends for all sub regions except jm table 1 the runoff trend was only statistically significant at jm mq as a result the runoff ratio in the sryr showed a significant decrease 0 011 10a over the past 60 years fig 2 a d shows the inter annual variations of precipitation and runoff in the sryr and the sub regions the corresponding double mass curves of precipitation versus runoff for each region are shown in fig 2 e h the moving t test identified two abrupt changes 1989 and 2004 in the annual runoff approximate to the change point years reported in previous studies wang et al 2018b wu et al 2020 therefore we define the period of 1960 1989 as the reference period p1 which denotes the natural undisturbed condition according to the annual runoff change points 1989 and 2004 we divided the period of 1990 2019 into 2 periods period 2 p2 1990 2004 and period 3 p3 2005 2019 during p1 precipitation and runoff values ranged around the multi year average in all sub regions from p1 to p2 almost all sub regions showed declines in both runoff and precipitation except for jm the magnitudes of the runoff decline were larger than those of precipitation decline in all sub regions since 2005 the precipitation and runoff have increased in all regions during p3 the averageannual precipitation is much higher than the multi year average with the average annual runoff just rising to around the multi year average value of 1960 2019 in the double mass curves fig 2e h there exist two change point years in jm 1984 and 2005 and mq tnh 1989 and 2003 which are close to the two abrupt change years in the annual runoff from fig 2e and fig 2g the runoff ratio the regression line slope in jm and mq tnh experienced a decrease during 1989 2004 and then increased since 2004 but the runoff ratio during 2005 2019 is still smaller than that during 1960 1989 according to the double mass curves there is only one significant change point year 1989 in jm mq and sryr fig 2f and fig 2h which indicates that the precipitation runoff relationship has changed since 1989 and the runoff generated by per unit precipitation has decreased such changes in the double mass curves may be caused by the rising air temperature and consequent changes in potential evapotranspiration and land surface characteristics applying the double mass curve method the runoff change from p1 to p2 p3 δr can be divided into the part explained by the change in mean annual precipitation δrpre and the part induced by other factors δrother table 2 from p1 to p2 δrother is more negative than δrpre indicating the precipitation runoff relationship change accounts for a larger part of the runoff decrease at all sub regions of sryr in p3 compared with p1 if the precipitation runoff relationship keeps the same as that in p1 runoff should increase by 20 0 mm for the entire sryr however the precipitation runoff relationship change caused a runoff decrease of 26 5 mm which led to an overall runoff decrease of 6 5 mm table 2 it is possible that human actions such as soil and water conservation measures and changes in land use cover will result in a shift in the precipitation runoff relationship mu et al 2010 for sryr the frozen ground is a critical landscape feature and its degradation due to climate warming might contribute to the precipitation runoff relationship change and the consequent runoff decrease wang et al 2018b in the following sections we will focus on the mechanism by which the frozen ground degradation affects the precipitation runoff relationship and runoff generation processes based on the physically based model 4 2 validation of the gbehm the simulation results from gbehm are needed to explore the connections between frozen ground degradation and hydrological changes here we evaluate the performance of model results using multi source observations long term data at 11 sites during 1967 2017 were used to verify the frozen ground depth simulation the simulated frozen depths are highly associated with the measurements r2 0 77 and p 0 05 and the variations are within an accepted level rmse 0 28 m and mean bias 0 02 m fig s1a fig s1b shows that the model can well capture the monthly variations of the frozen ground depth at different elevation ranges the simulated permafrost distribution during 2010 2019 fig 3 a has also been validated using the field observations at 53 boreholes drilled during 2009 2016 luo et al 2012 qin et al 2017 zou et al 2017 luo et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 supplementary table s1 the simulated frozen ground distribution obtained a high accuracy with all 21 21 sfg boreholes and 93 8 30 32 of permafrost boreholes being accurately identified the permafrost map in the 2010 s is fairly similar to the permafrost map derived from zheng et al 2020 in the sryr fig 3b fig 4 compares the observed and simulated monthly streamflow at the jm mq and tnh stations from 1960 to 1989 calibration period and from 1990 to 2019 validation period table 3 displays the assessment metrics for river discharge simulations at the three hydrological sites in general the simulation results at mq and tnh were better than those at jm tnh station is the outlet of the basin in the calibration period the nse and r2 at tnh station were 0 90 and 0 90 with the pbias of 6 0 in the validation period the nse and r2 were 0 88 and 0 88 at tnh station with the pbias of 0 3 the simulation results in mq were comparable to those at tnh these results imply that the simulated results can reproduce the observed monthly streamflow variations the monthly twsa from model simulation and grace grace fo datasets for the period of 2003 2019 were compared as shown in fig 5 results from grace grace fo showed a slightly increasing trend of total water storage in the sryr with a rate of 0 15 mm per month p 0 05 and the simulated twsa by gbehm increased by 0 31 mm per month p 0 05 the difference in twsa trends may arise from the sharp decrease during 2016 2017 from grace fig 5 which is related to possible operational issues in the final phase of the grace satellite mission chen et al 2020 the twsa increase in sryr may be related to permafrost degradation wang et al 2018b meanwhile the monthly twsa by gbehm was consistent with the twsa from grace grace fo with a correlation coefficient r of 0 76 p 0 05 which indicates that the model can simulate the temporal variability of twsa reasonably besides with an rmse of 7 41 mm and a correlation coefficient r of 0 98 p 0 05 the monthly evapotranspiration from gbehm was consistent with the evapotranspiration from gleam at the catchment scale supplementary fig s2 4 3 changes of the frozen ground and water balance components in the sryr as simulated permafrost distribution from the gbehm permafrost accounts for 52 5 65016 km2 of the sryr in the 1960 s whereas the area ratio underlain by permafrost decreased to 31 5 39060 km2 in the 2010 s indicating that approximately 40 of the permafrost has degraded into sfg in the past 60 years fig 6 the area where permafrost degraded to sfg is mainly located in the central and northwestern sryr covering an elevation range of 4000 4600 m the percentage of permafrost area decreased continuously at a rate of 3 7 10a due to the constant rising air temperature fig 7 a fig 7b shows the long term variations of the areal mean maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground mtsfg and active layer thickness alt of the permafrost the mtsfg decreased by 0 10 m 10a while the alt increased by 0 06 m 10a during 1960 2019 and both trends were statistically significant p 0 05 fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of the long term mean value and trends in water balance components including annual precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration changes in the past 60 years the mean annual precipitation decreases from southeast to northwest with a range of 310 mm to 885 mm with an average basin value of 540 mm fig 8a the precipitation increased considerably upstream of jm and in mq tnh fig 8d where the precipitation is relatively low however precipitation changed insignificantly in large areas in jm mq and mq tnh where precipitation is relatively high fig 8d the spatial pattern of mean annual evapotranspiration distribution is similar to that of mean annual precipitation decreasing from southeast to northwest with an average basin value of 375 mm fig 8b evapotranspiration generally increased in the whole basin and showed a larger increase in the upstream of jm where precipitation also increased the most fig 8e the distribution of mean annual runoff also resembles that of precipitation with the main runoff generation area located in the southeast fig 8c the runoff trends showed considerable spatial heterogeneity due to the joint influence of precipitation and evapotranspiration in jm mq and mq tnh where precipitation changed insignificantly runoff showed a decreasing trend in contrast runoff increased significantly in the high altitude area in jm and mq tnh where the precipitation increased significantly comparing fig 8c and fig 8f the runoff decreased in the major runoff generation region jm mq which is the main reason why the average basin runoff decreased in sryr over the last 60 years fig 9 shows the water balance components change along the elevation gradient precipitation increased at all elevation ranges generally with larger increases at higher elevations the evapotranspiration also showed increasing trends at all elevation ranges while the most significant increase occurred in the elevation range between 3700 and 3900 m the runoff trend showed an evident dependence on elevation with an increasing trend above 4200 m and a decreasing trend below 4200 m the runoff decreased in the elevation ranges where the increasing trend of evapotranspiration exceeds that of precipitation the runoff generation capacity indicated by the simulated runoff ratio has also been examined the value of runoff ratio decreased below 4400 m and the decreasing trend is significant below 4000 m while the runoff ratio increased insignificantly above 4400 m indicating elevation dependent precipitation runoff relationship changes 4 4 hydrological impacts of frozen ground degradation in different frozen ground regions from 1960 to 2019 the considerable rise in air temperature has resulted in a remarkable degradation of the sryr s frozen ground fig 6 fig 7 to further explore the changes of hydrological processes in different frozen ground regions according to fig 6 we divided the entire study area into three frozen ground regions i e the permafrost region persistent permafrost throughout 1960 2019 the sfg region persistent sfg throughout 1960 2019 and the degradation region area where permafrost degraded into sfg some studies have reported improved hydraulic connectivity due to permafrost degradation in the sryr through isotope tracing methods zheng et al 2016 wan et al 2019 in this study this phenomenon was also reflected by the changing composition of runoff components in the gbehm the runoff can be divided into two components i e surface runoff and subsurface runoff the subsurface runoff includes the groundwater flow and the lateral flow via the unsaturated zone table 4 shows the changes in the proportions of the two runoff components during p1 p2 and p3 at the three frozen ground regions and the entire sryr for all frozen ground regions the proportion of surface runoff to total runoff exhibited a decline whereas the proportion of subsurface runoff to total runoff showed an increase in p2 and p3 compared with p1 but the degreeofchangevaries withdifferentfrozen ground types in the degradation region the changes of the runoff components were the largest and the ratio of surface runoff to total runoff showed a decrease of 6 0 and 6 7 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 respectively indicating an increasing proportion of subsurface runoff in the permafrost region the ratio of surface runoff to total runoff decreased by 4 8 and 3 3 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 respectively meanwhile in the sfg region the ratios of two runoff components didn t change much only 1 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 the above results indicated that permafrost degradation played an essential role in enhancing subsurface runoff in the permafrost region and degradation region grace grace fo data have revealed the increased total water storage in sryr during the last two decades xu et al 2013 xu et al 2016 furthermore this study investigated the twsa trend with elevation fig 9c shows the simulated twsa trend along elevation and the area percentage of degradation region where permafrost degraded into sfg at each elevation range from 1960 to 2019 in the elevation between 4000 m and 4500 m the area percentage of degradation region is within 38 to 57 with the largest percentage occurring at 4200 4300 m significant increasing trends of twsa with a range of 2 6 mm a to 4 7 mm a also happened at the elevation of 4000 4500 m with significant degradation with the most prominent twsa trend occurring at 4100 4200 m corroborating the linkage between permafrost degradation and increases in groundwater storage xu et al 2013 wang et al 2018b at elevations above 4600 m the twsa also showed an increasing trend larger than 3 2 mm a which could be associated with the permafrost active layer thickening and the consequent increase in soil water storage capacity fig s3 shows the temporal changes in mean annual soil moisture and alt in the permafrost region the mean annual soil moisture shows a significant increase 0 004 cm 3 cm 3 a with the alt increasing from 1960 to 2019 and there is a positive correlation between annual soil moisture and alt with a correlation coefficient of 0 94 fig s4 shows the basin average twsa trends in three regions the twsa significantly increased by 2 9 mm a 5 7 mm a and 1 0 mm a in the permafrost region degradation region and seasonally frozen ground region respectively the results indicated that the degradation of frozen ground significantly increased the total water storage of the sryr to better understand soil water movement with permafrost thawing we select the elevation zone of 4300 4400 m as a typical permafrost region where the permafrost degradation area 7839 km2 in this elevation range accounts for 30 2 of the total degradation area 25956 km2 fig 10 shows the soil profile of temperature ice and liquid water content between 4300 and 4400 m the soil temperature in this elevation range rose continuously and reached 0 c in deeper layers around 10 m for a relatively long period 1976 2008 when soil water existed in a liquid solid mixture with the temperature rising the soil ice content decreased and the soil liquid water content increased especially at a depth of 1 5 m to 2 5 m below the ground surface fig 10b c such changes in soil profiles suggest that the disappearance of permafrost as an impermeable layer allows water to move deeper which is in accordance with the opinion that permafrost degradation could boost the hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater cheng and wu 2007 qin et al 2017 gao et al 2018 unlike the decrease in the annual runoff the winter december to february runoff showed a slightly increasing trend over the entire sryr over the past 60 years fig 11 shows the inter annual variations of areal mean winter runoff in different frozen ground types the winter runoff increased by 0 52 mm 10a in the permafrost region and by 1 59 mm 10a in the degradation region fig s5 shows the trends of mean winter soil moisture at different soil depths in the permafrost degradation regions significant positive trends were shown in both regions especially in deeper layers the deep soil moisture 1 5 2 5 m depth below the ground surface increased by 0 002 cm 3 cm 3 a in the permafrost region and by 0 005 cm 3 cm 3 a in the degradation region fig s5 in the permafrost region the soil moisture increased the most at a rate of 0 003 cm 3 cm 3 a at 1 5 1 7 m depth which is close to the alt in the permafrost region as the active layer thickens soil water percolates deeper and accumulates near the permafrost table and the supra permafrost groundwater could in turn form base flow in the degradation region the soil moisture showed increasing trends at all layers except for the third layer 0 15 0 3 m and fourth layer 0 3 0 5 m at 2 2 2 5 m depth the most prominent soil moisture increasing rate is 0 008 cm 3 cm 3 a larger than in the permafrost region such soil moisture increases indicated that the disappearance of permafrost as an impermeable layer led to water draining to deeper soil layers this phenomenon has also reported by researches in arctic rivers peterson et al 2002 yang et al 2002b these results indicated that permafrost active layer thickening and the transition from permafrost to sfg could significantly enhance subsurface hydrological processes and change the streamflow seasonality by increasing base flow and winter runoff walvoord and kurylyk 2016 5 discussion there have been numerous efforts to comprehend the long term variations of runoff in sryr but the conclusions are varied most of the previous studies adopted top down approaches which can be divided into two categories one type was through statistical analysis among precipitation runoff and air temperature as in hu et al 2011 and ma et al 2019 which could only examine the statistical relationships without physical mechanisms another type was using budyko framework which implicitly consider physical mechanism by landscape factor n to quantify the impact of climate change and land surface change on runoff wang et al 2018b however this approach was still lacking in direct evidence from physical processes such studies underscored the role of permafrost degradation in the runoff change of the sryr but whether permafrost degradation increases or decreases runoff remains debatable wang et al 2018b wu et al 2018a in comparison this study adopted the bottom up approach i e a physically based model gbehm to unravel the physical mechanism through which the frozen ground degradation affects runoff on the basis of the precipitation runoff relationship change revealed by the double mass curve method in sryr in the past 60 years the gbehm model further provides a mechanism explanation for the decrease in runoff generation capacity the results show that in the past 60 years the frozen ground in the sryr has degraded significantly which changed the regional hydrological processes the changes include increased soil water capacity and soil moisture figs s3 s4 increased groundwater storage fig 9 altered runoff components more subsurface runoff and less surface runoff table 4 and modified runoff seasonality more winter runoff fig 11 these results indicate that frozen ground degradation would enhance surface hydrological processes by boosting the hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater fig 10 corroborating the hypothesis proposed by previous studies cheng and wu 2007 yang et al 2019 with evidence from process based modelling this study also verifies the hypothesis that frozen ground degradation would enlarge the catchment water storage capacity wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c shi et al 2020 including soil water storage increase due to larger alt fig s3 and groundwater storage increase especially in the degradation region fig 9 which could in turn decrease the runoff generation capacity at the basin scale but some questions such as the tipping point of the groundwater increase and separation of increased evapotranspiration caused by increased soil water storage capacity vegetation greening or the direct impact of rising air temperature remain unanswered and need to be further explored by future studies in addition in order to accurately reproduce the frozen ground and hydrological changes of the sryr in the past 60 years great efforts have also been made to improve the simulation accuracy since air temperature is essential in accurately simulating the soil freezing process and evapotranspiration process we merged the air temperature background field data terraclimate 2020 with the meteorological data before data merging at several stations with insufficient data during 1960 2019 data extension was carried out using the correlation between them and adjacent stations to ensure the consistency multiple source data including remote sensing data and sites data were used for model evaluation which proves the overall satisfying performance in reproducing streamflow frozen ground type frozen ground depth groundwater storage and evapotranspiration furthermore we compared the permafrost map and degradation rate with other studies in the area between elevation 4300 and 4400 m the area of permafrost degrading to sfg is 7839 km2 accounting for 30 2 of the total degradation area 25956 km2 this result is in accordance with that the permafrost lower altitudinal limit in sryr is located at 4250 4400 m reported by jin et al 2009 based on observations several previous studies have also estimated the degrading rates of permafrost in the sryr the permafrost area percentage in the sryr is estimated to have decreased by 11 1 throughout 1971 2010 by wang et al 2018a utilizing the temperature at the top of permafrost ttop model while in this study the average permafrost percentage decreased by 11 1 from the 1970 s 1970 1979 to 2000 s 2000 2009 indicating a similar permafrost decreasing rate which further proved that the permafrost change in this study is within a reasonable range this study unravels the possible effects of permafrost degradation on hydrological processes runoff components and seasonality by enhanced surface water groundwater connectivity and increased subsurface water storage using the simulation results from a physically based model it should be noted that there can also be other mechanisms that have not been considered in this study for example permafrost degradation could also lead to changes in vegetation growth or even vegetation succession which could in turn affect the hydrological cycle jin et al 2021 jin et al 2022b wang et al 2022 the effects of frozen ground change on runoff via other mechanisms like vegetation modulated changes can be explored by future research 6 conclusion this study explored the long term variations in the annual precipitation runoff relationship as well as the impacts of frozen ground changes from 1960 to 2019 based on the simulations by a distributed eco hydrological model gbehm the main findings are as follows 1 the observed data showed that the precipitation runoff relationship changed since 1989 over the entire sryr and the runoff ratio declined from 0 34 during 1960 1989 to 0 28 during 1990 2019 based on the double mass curve method compared with p1 1960 1989 the basin averaged runoff decreased by 44 3 mm and 6 5 mm during p2 1990 2004 and p3 2005 2019 in which the precipitation runoff relationship change led to a decrease of 37 8 mm in p2 and a decrease of 26 5 mm in p3 respectively 2 from 1960 to 2019 the mtsfg decreased by 0 10 m 10a while the alt increased by 0 06 m 10a the permafrost area decreased from 65016 km2 to 39060 km2 with a total decrease of 25956 km2 accounting for 21 0 of the sryr area the runoff reduction mainly occurred in the area with elevation below 4200 m where the evapotranspiration increase exceeded the precipitation increase 3 from 1960 to 2019 in the permafrost region the soil moisture increased by 0 004 cm 3 cm 3 a and the twsa increased by 2 9 mm a in the degradation region where permafrost completely thawed the twsa increased by 5 7 mm a the ratio of subsurface runoff to the total runoff increased by 6 0 and 6 7 in p2 and p3 compared with p1 in the degradation region highlighting the critical role of permafrost degradation in increasing the total water storage 4 the winter runoff increased significantly at the rate of 0 52 mm 10a and 1 59 mm 10a in the permafrost region and the degradation region respectively indicating that the frozen ground degradation has changed the runoff seasonality the findings of this study could help provide a better understanding of the changes in hydrological processes considering frozen ground degradation under a warming climate additionally the findings have significant implications for policymakers seeking to develop sustainable policies for water resources management in the yellow river basin credit

2492,it is crucial to determine the factors affecting the carbon use efficiency cue and water use efficiency wue of vegetation in ecosystems however the relationships between climate changes and cue and wue by karst vegetation in china are still unclear the response of the cue and wue to regional climate change was studied by using trend analysis and partial derivative method in addition the distribution characteristics of the cue and wue of different land use types were analyzed the following results were found 1 from 2000 to 2018 the average of cue in karst areas of china was 0 557 and the average value of wue was 1 237g c kg 1 h2o 2 the cue of grassland was higher than that of forest land 0 051 whereas the wue value of grassland was far lower than that of forest land 1 415 g c kg 1 h2o 3 cue was affected by precipitation p exhibiting an increasing trend 5 5 10 3 yr 1 and the most obvious increase occurred in the grassland 7 2 10 3 yr 1 under the influence of solar radiation sr the wue decreased 1 5 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 and the largest decrease occurred in the shrub land 8 4 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 4 90 31 cue increase depended on p and sr while 78 32 of the decrease in the wue was due to p and sr this study makes important contributions to clarifying the responses of the cue and wue of ecosystems to climate changes in karst areas optimizing the management of regional water and soil resources and promoting healthy development of the ecological environment keywords climate change karst carbon use efficiency water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbon use efficiency cue and water use efficiency wue are important indicators for analyzing the interaction between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems are tightly coupled through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes el masri et al 2019 cue and wue are increasingly considered as important parameters for the formation of carbon and water storage in ecosystems gifford 2003 piao et al 2010 campioli et al 2015 temperature precipitation and solar radiation have direct impacts on cue zhang et al 2009 and wue li et al 2016 wue changes with the change of rainfall adams et al 2019 many scholars have analyzed the relationship between temperature and precipitation and wue zheng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b solar radiation also affects wue brümmer et al 2012 yang et al 2022 therefore this study mainly selected temperature precipitation and solar radiation as the climatic factors vegetation that grows in cooler drier environments is more resilient primarily because plants use less energy to sustain life in such environments and are therefore more efficient at storing carbon gower 2002 low cue indicate that the carbon consumption by vegetation is higher because of the rising temperatures prolonged growing seasons and lack of nutrition delucia et al 2007 on the contrary high cue means that vegetation has adaptability in harsh environmental conditions such as low temperature and dryness kim et al 2018 in addition climate change is the leading factor to promote the changes of terrestrial ecosystems in cue and wue pan et al 2016 cui et al 2019 therefore quantitative evaluation of the impact of climate factors on cue and wue is of great significance for understanding cue and wue the wue of ecosystem in the karst area is obviously lower than that in the non karst area but it is increasing rapidly wue in the karst area is more sensitive to rainfall ding et al 2021 different vegetation types respond differently to climate change resulting in an inconsistent interannual rate of change in wue zhang et al 2019 the interaction of land use and bedrock has strongly changed the response of vegetation to climate change leading to differences in cue and wue for different land use types jiang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to study the responses of cue and wue in chinese karst areas to climate change and analyze the cue and wue of different land use types the cue and wue are considered to be important overall indicators of the carbon and water cycles which connect terrestrial ecosystems with the atmosphere so they are helpful in evaluating the responses of ecosystems to changes in environmental conditions huang et al 2015 keenan et al 2013 the changes in and potential mechanisms of the cue and wue have been well studied on different biological scales such as plant leaves individual plants and the canopy yu et al 2004 it is still challenging to use the proposed theory to evaluate the long term changes in the cue and wue on a larger spatial scale niu et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to study the temporal and spatial changes of cue and wue in chinese karst areas and their responses to climate changes the goal of this study was to investigate the responses of climate changes to the cue and wue in the karst areas of china from 2000 to 2018 the specific objectives are as follows 1 to reveal the temporal and spatial distributions and changes in the cue and wue in karst areas 2 to analyze the responses of the cue and wue to climate change 3 to compare the cue and wue of each land use type on different scales the results of this study are of great significance to and necessary for improving our understanding of cue and wue in the karst areas of china and to enriching related global change research 2 data and methods 2 1 study area karst landforms were widely distributed in china with a total area of 3 44 million km2 which exceeds 1 3 of china s total land area wu et al 2020 according to the statistics of spatial data the exposed karst area in china was approximately 1 88 million km2 accounted for 19 58 of china s total land area fig 1 however the karst area was only 1 51 million km2 covered by vegetation which accounted for 80 35 of the total karst areas 1 88 million km2 in china it was worth noting that the area of the karst area in the eight southwestern provinces is 0 54 million km2 in this study china s karst area was divided into three parts namely south china karst area north china karst area and qinghai tibet plateau karst area 2 2 cue and wue calculations in this study the cue is defined as the ratio of the net primary production npp to the gross primary production gpp zhang et al 2014 and the ecosystem wue is defined as the ratio of the gpp to the actual evapotranspiration et beer et al 2009 which calculated as follows 1 cue npp gpp 2 wue gpp et where cue refers to carbon use efficiency dimensionless wue is vegetation water use efficiency g c kg 1 h2o gpp g c m 2 npp g c m 2 et mm 2 3 gpp npp and et data the 2000 2015 gpp and npp data were obtained from the mod17a3 with a

equal longitude and latitude projection of wgs 84 and the ratio coefficient were 0 1 2016 2018 gpp and npp data was from the national aeronautics and space administration https search earthdata nasa

resolution of 0 25 from the monthly evapotranspiration datasets gldas data combines satellite and ground observations and utilize the land surface model lsm and data assimilation technology to provide multiple types of high quality data sets 2 4 climate and land use data from 2000 to 2018 meteorological data including precipitation p temperature t and solar radiation sr data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were collected the data collected from the gldas 2 1 data sets https www nasa gov of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa with the global space coverage 60s 180 w 90 n 180e a large number of studies and evaluation results showed that gldas 2 1 data had high reliability kato et al 2007 li et al 2018 piao et al 2015 the land use data were collected from the european space agency the land cover data with a spatial resolution of 300 m https maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php it can be seen from the table 1 that the data used in this study come from data sources of different temporal and spatial scales in order to make the spatial scale of the data consistent we use gpp data as the benchmark and use arcgis10 2 to resample all data to a spatial resolution of 0 1 because the research time scale is 2000 2018 the time scale of all data is selected as 2000 2018 2 5 methods the spatial patterns of cue and wue in the karst area was analyzed according to their averages from 2000 to 2018 in order to evaluate the time change of cue and wue we used the least square regression method to calculate the linear trend of cue and wue per pixel from 2000 to 2018 in addition partial correlation methods are also used to analyze the contribution of climate factors p t sr to cue and wue xu et al 2010 2 5 1 trend analysis firstly ordinary least squares regression was used on each pixel to determine the slope value the linear tendency estimation was used to analyse the temporal dynamics of cue and wue and statistical test of correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the significant change trend the linear tendency value was estimated by using the least square method gong et al 2021 li et al 2022 3 k j 1 n m j t j 1 n j 1 n m j j 1 n t j j 1 n t j 2 1 n j 1 n t j 2 where n represents the time span from 2000 to 2018 tj represents the year and mj is the independent variable corresponding to year j k is the linear tendency value this method can be calculated to pixel level and the increased and decreased areas can be seen intuitively however there may be some error between the calculated value and the actual value 2 5 2 partial derivative we used the method provided by roderick et al 2007 which has been widely applied into assessing the impacts of various interfering factor on hydrological and meteorological changes you et al 2013 liu and sun 2016 therefore partial derivatives are used to estimate the influence of climatic factors on the changes of cue and wue 4 dy dt y x a dx a dt y x b dx b dt y x c dx c dt y x n dx n dt where dy dt x a c o n x b c o n x c c o n x n c o n dy dt represents the linear trend of y change x a c o n x b c o n x c c o n and x n c o n represent the contributions of x a x b x c and x n to y variations respectively y x a y x b y x c y x n represents the variation of y and the partial derivatives of each variables the each partial derivatives is equal to the corresponding second order partial correlation coefficient this study assumes that p t and sr are the main reasons for the changes of cue and wue and k is the trend of cue change caused by the interaction of p t and sr as shown in the below 5 k p c o n t c o n s r c o n c u e p dp dt c u e t dt dt c u e s r dsr dt p con was the contribution of precipitation p while t con and sr con were the contributions of temperature t and solar radiation sr to the changes of cue respectively the contribution of climate factors to wue is calculated using the same method considering that all types of factors have linear influence on the changes of cue and wue the second order partial correlation coefficient between one factor and cue and wue could be obtained by respectively eliminating the other two factors the second order partial correlation coefficients were calculated as follows xu et al 2010 song et al 2022 6 r x y z λ r x y z r x λ z r y λ z 1 r 2 x λ z 1 r 2 y λ z where r x y z λ represents the second order partial correlation coefficient between x and y by eliminating the impact of factors z and λ r x y z and r y λ z has a similar definition as shown above in addition t test to judge the significance of the correlation between two variables if p is less than 0 05 it will pass the 95 confidence significance test otherwise it is not significant 2 5 3 evaluate the relative effects of climatic factors to cue and wue to separate the influence of climate factors on cue and wue from other influencing factors we assumed that the other influencing factors remain unchanged and use p t and sr data to quantify the contribution rate of climate factors to cue and wue ge et al 2021 the effects of climate factors on cue and wue are measured similarly by using constant climate simulations so the relative effects of climate factors on cue and wue can be described by the following equation 7 contr c u e δ c lim p δ c lim p δ c lim t δ c lim s r 100 where contr c u e represents the contribution rate of climatic factors to cue δ c lim p δ c lim t δ c lim sr respectively represent the partial correlation coefficients between climatic factors such as precipitation temperature and solar radiation and cue in the same way the contribution rate of climate factors to wue was calculated 3 results and analysis 3 1 spatial patterns of the cue and wue under the influences of vegetation cover and climate change the spatial patterns of the cue and wue in karst areas are changing according to statistics the average cue in the karst areas is 0 557 and that in the non karst areas is 0 547 fig 2 the spatial pattern of the cue throughout the entire karst areas is high in the west and low in the east the areas with cue values of greater than 0 5 are mainly distributed on qinghai tibetan plateau and in the karst areas in southern china accounting for 73 6 of the total area the high cue value areas are always located in cold and dry environments because plants in these environments have a strong carbon storage capacity and the energy consumed during the growth of plants is also low usually the cue of the forest ecosystem was lower than that of the shrub and herb zhang et al 2009 the high cue value areas are mainly located in the karst areas with high altitudes and low temperatures on the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 2a the high value areas of wue are mainly concentrated in southern china and the areas with a multi year average of greater than 1 5 g c kg 1 h2o account for 38 25 of the total area the high wue value areas are usually distributed in warm and humid areas because the canopy of vegetation in these areas flourishes and thus can intercept more solar radiation utilize more soil and promote plant growth hu et al 2009 niu et al 2011 the high wue values mainly occurs in warm and humid karst area in southern china fig 2b low co2 partial pressures low temperatures and high altitudes will limit plant growth and reduce the wue of plants zhu et al 2015 which may be the reason why the wue values are the lowest in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau during the study period the average wue in the karst area was 1 237 g c kg 1 h2o the average wue in the non karst area was 1 245 g c kg 1 h2o and the value in the karst area was slightly lower than that in the non karst area fig 2 it should be noted that some of the low wue value areas and high value areas of cue value areas are located in the same area for example the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau 3 2 temporal changes in the cue and wue during the study period the cue in the karst area exhibited an increasing trend of 5 5 10 3 yr 1 p 0 05 of which the area with an increasing trend accounted for 86 72 of the total area fig 3 a and the increasing trend in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau was the most significant the wue exhibited a decreasing trend of 1 5 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 p 0 05 fig 3b and the areas in which the wue decreased were mainly distributed in the karst areas of southern china from the perspective of land use types the significant increases in the cue and wue of the grassland accounted for the largest proportions 93 52 and 80 59 of the total area respectively fig s4 and the largest reduction in the wue occurred in the forest land 58 88 of the total area from 2000 to 2018 cue generally increased mainly contain two types the regions in which the npp increased the gpp decreased and the cue increased area accounted for 29 71 of the total area the regions in which the npp decreased the gpp decreased and the cue increased area accounted for 56 36 of the total area fig 3e the area in which the wue decreased accounted for a larger proportion mainly including the following two types the areas where the gpp and wue decreased and the et increased accounted for 45 06 and the areas where the gpp and et increased and the wue decreased accounted for 32 6 which are mainly distributed in the karst areas of southern china and the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 3f during the study period the gpp rapidly increased the increase in p caused a greater increase in the et than the gpp which led to a decrease in the wue during the study period the cue of all of the land use types exhibited overall upward trends and the cue of the grassland 7 2 10 3 yr 1 exhibited the most significant increase the cue was the highest in the grassland 0 574 and the lowest in the forest land 0 523 fig 4 the cue was generally higher in the cold and dry areas the wue of the various land use types in the karst areas exhibited downward trends and the wue of the shrub land decreased the most significantly 8 4 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 compared with the other land use types the forest land had the highest wue 1 821 g c kg 1 h2o and the grassland had the lowest wue 0 406 g c kg 1 h2o the cue of sparsely vegetated ecosystems was higher than that of densely vegetated the cue of the grassland was higher than that of the forest land and the forest land had the lowest cue of all of the land use types fig 4 these findings are consistent with the results of previous studies härkönen et al 2010 which reported that in large plant ecosystems tall trees may have lower photosynthetic rates and productivities because their stems and branches have a higher hydraulic resistance hubbard et al 1999 zhang et al 2009 certainly the wue of forest land was higher than those of other ecosystems because an increase in the ratio of plant transpiration tr to ecosystem et i e tr et leads to an increase in wue in forested lands in wetter areas the cue and wue of the forest land dry land and rice fields in the karst areas were higher than those in the non karst areas fig 4 and there was enough water input in the rice fields to ensure the growth of crops without worrying about evaporation the forest land has developed root lush foliage and rich vegetation coverage so the water retention in this area is strong 3 3 contribution rates of the climate factors to the cue and wue here we analyze the correlation of climatic factors with cue and wue the average values of partial correlation coefficients of the cue with p t and sr are 0 27 0 15 and 0 1 respectively and the wue with p t and sr are 0 03 0 05 and 0 2 respectively fig 5 we found that 73 8 of the p was positively correlated with the cue mainly in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau and in southern china while 37 of the sr was positively correlated with the cue moreover 53 of the p was negatively correlated with the wue mainly distributed in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau and 55 of the t was positively correlated with the wue especially in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau to further accurately identify the contribution rates of the climatic factors to the cue and wue fig 6 the contribution rates of the climatic factors to the cue and wue were calculated p dominated the increase in the cue 60 28 and t and sr contributed 26 72 and 23 12 to the increase in the cue respectively unexpectedly p dominated the decrease in the wue 39 53 and t and sr contributed 28 4 and 32 07 to the increase in the wue respectively 3 4 main climatic factors controlling the cue and wue in different areas the contributions of p t and sr to the cue and wue exhibited significant spatial differences in the karst areas fig 7 overall p made the largest positive contribution to the cue in the entire karst region 7 33 from 2000 to 2018 while p made a negative contribution to the wue 1 47 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 the positive contributions of the sr to the cue and wue were 1 74 and 1 98 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 while t made the smallest positive contributions of 0 23 and 0 23 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 respectively in addition the contributions of the three climatic factors to the changes in the cue and wue were also distributed differently in the three karst areas the negative contribution of p to the wue was the greatest in the karst areas in southern china while the positive contribution of p to the cue was the greatest in the karst areas of southern china t made positive contributions to the cue and wue in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau in order to determine the main climatic factors that controlled the changes in the cue and wue in the karst areas the climatic factor that made the greatest absolute contribution to the pixel was selected as the main influencing factor as shown in fig 8 for the impacts of the three factors on the cue the areas dominated by p con t con and sr con accounted for 57 21 9 69 and 33 1 of the total area respectively the area controlled by p and sr accounted for 90 31 of the total area indicating that they were the two main factors affecting the change in the cue in the karst areas p was very important to the increase in the cue in the karst areas of southern china and the qinghai tibetan plateau for the wue is concerned the areas controlled by p con t con and sr con accounted for 33 1 21 68 and 45 22 of the total area respectively and the areas controlled by p and sr accounted for 78 32 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other related research to further illustrate the reliability of our results we compared the results of this study with those of other research fields table 2 the wue has been widely verified in asia china northern china the loess plateau the po yang lake basin and other places and the results have been demonstrated to be reliable du et al 2019 liu et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 zheng et al 2019a the wue in northern china is higher than that in other areas mainly because this area has an arid to semi arid climate the wue increases rapidly with increasing precipitation in addition many scholars around have also carried out cue research in china po yang lake basin the three rivers region and other places and their results have been widely verified he et al 2018 chuai et al 2020 liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 the cue is the highest in the three rivers region mainly because of the low precipitation and low temperatures in this region which make the vegetation breathe weakly resulting in a higher cue 4 2 changes in the cue and wue at different latitudes and precipitation in terms of latitude the high cue values of each land use type occurred near 28 n because this latitude passes through the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 9 a although the vegetation growth in this area is limited and the npp and gpp values are low in a cold environment vegetation needs to consume less energy to support metabolism the cue values of the forest land were higher than in the low latitude areas and the higher the latitude the lower the cue value in addition the wue was greatly influenced by latitude and it decreased with increasing latitude fig 9b which is consistent with the results of previous studies zheng et al 2019a the wue values of the dry land and paddy fields were greatly affected by precipitation and the wue decreased significantly in the area north of 32 n the values in the grassland were affected by the latitude and fluctuated greatly the wue was higher in the low latitude areas with the lowest value occurring at 32 n and increased in the higher latitude areas in the semi arid area with 200 400 mm of precipitation the cue and wue values in the karst areas reached the lowest values 0 497 and 0 34 g c kg 1 h2o respectively and the cue in the non karst area reached the highest value 0 598 fig 10 a indicating that in semi arid non karst regions the cue increases with increasing precipitation in humid areas with precipitation of greater than 800 mm the wue 1 57 g c kg 1 h2o in the karst areas was higher than that in the non karst areas 1 51 g c kg 1 h2o fig 10b the leaves of karst forest trees have a higher phosphorus concentration and photosynthetic capacity and thicker greater thickness of the front and back epidermises than those of non karst forest trees so they have a higher wue fu et al 2019 the relatively high cue and wue values of the dry land and paddy fields may be due to fertilization when the precipitation was less than 200 mm the wue values of the grassland forest land and other forested lands were the highest in all of the areas fig 10 we speculate these high wue values may be due to the different plant compositions and the unique soil water conditions dong et al 2021 the severe atmospheric drought and low soil water potential in saline alkali land stimulates the movement of the et and deep soil water to the surface soil dong et al 2011 snow melt supplies soil water for et and the wue increases as the soil drought stress index dsi increases yue et al 2020 due to long term adaptation to water shortages and the continuous decrease in the gpp vegetation growth in arid ecosystems responds rapidly to drought disturbances vicente serrano et al 2013 therefore the decrease in the gpp is less than the decrease in the et resulting in an increase in the wue under drought conditions the wue in humid atmosphere regions increases significantly as the amount of available water increases and precipitation decreases the severe soil water stress gang et al 2016 the shrub land 1 85 g c kg 1 h2o and forest land 1 22 g c kg 1 h2o had the highest wue values when the precipitation was greater than 800 mm 4 3 main factors driving the temporal changes in the cue and wue the different vegetation types different physiological characteristics and different soil textures in the same ecosystem will affect the cue fu et al 2016 the responses of the wue to various factors e g vegetation coverage t and p depends on the main processes driving the photosynthesis of the plants the water loss from the ecosystem and the relative change in the gpp compared to the et niu et al 2011 huang et al 2015 during the study period the npp gpp and et derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiomete modis products all increased significantly positive r values and the rate of increase of the npp 5 21 was higher than that of the gpp 2 35 which is the internal reason for the increase in the cue fig s2 the rate of increase of the gpp 2 35 was slower than that of the et 3 52 which lead to the decrease in the wue the rate of increase of the p during the study period was 13 02 p was affecting the increase in the cue and the decrease in the wue the p and cue were positively correlated which is consistent with the results of previous studies zheng et al 2020 precipitation is usually negatively correlated with changes in the wue because it causes the et to increase more quickly than the gpp when the soil water decreases significantly the gpp also decreases zhang et al 2021a luo et al 2022 soil moisture can control the concentration of co2 in the soil by controlling the activity of the microorganisms in arid areas or by changing the redox conditions of the soil jiang et al 2013 xiong et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b the soil moisture in the karst areas decreased deng et al 2020 which may be one of the reasons for the decrease in the wue 4 4 uncertainty and future outlook in this study the temporal and spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of the cue and wue in karst areas were studied which effectively improves our understanding of the cue and wue in these karst ecosystems however our research still has certain uncertainties and limitations the modis17a3 data used in this paper have a resolution of 1 km the areas contain different vegetation types and a large number of ecological restoration projects have been implemented in the karst areas which pose a challenge to the accurate identification of vegetation changes there are few meteorological stations in the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau in this study global scale climate data were used so the data may deviate from the actual values in addition the et data used in this study were obtained from the gldas 2 1 dataset although this type of dataset is widely used its resolution is relatively low vegetation responses to climate change usually have a lag effect which may affect the cue and wue values but the lag effect caused by the climate factors was not considered in this study these uncertainties and limitations may affect our overall understanding of the cue and wue of vegetation in ecosystems early terrestrial carbon cycle models such as the casa potter et al 1993 and forest bg c running and coughlan 1988 often assumed a fixed cue value to quantify ra delucia et al 2007 however increasing evidence shows that the cue actually varies with many factors including the vegetation type climate conditions site fertility and forest age ryan et al 1996 amthor 2000 delucia et al 2007 piao et al 2010 campioli et al 2015 the factors influencing an factors of ecosystem s wue mainly include the vapor pressure deficit vpd soil moisture and atmospheric co2 concentration nitrogen deposition etc hu et al 2009 wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 of course wue is also affected by water and sediment discharge in karst areas li et al 2016 in future research other factors can be considered to comprehensively analyze the cue and wue 5 conclusions based on correlation analysis and the partial derivative method in this study the responses of the cue and wue to climate changes were analyzed the relationships between the cue and wue and climatic factors and the differences in the cue and wue of different land use types were analyzed and the contributions of the climate factors to the cue and wue were further evaluated the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the average cue in the karst area was 0 557 and the average value of wue was 1 237 g c kg 1 h2o the cue of the grassland was higher than that of the forest land 0 051 while the wue of the grassland was much lower than that of the forest land 1 415 2 from 2000 to 2018 the cue and wue of the entire karst area exhibited an insignificant increasing trend of 5 5 10 3 yr 1 the areas with increasing trends accounted for 86 72 of the total area and the wue exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend of 1 5 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 3 in terms of land use types the areas with the largest significant increases in the cue and wue were the grasslands 93 52 and 80 59 of the total area respectively and the largest decrease in the wue occurred in the forest land 58 88 of the total area in the karst areas the cue and wue values of the forest land dry land and paddy fields were higher than in the non karst areas 4 among the climatic factors p t and sr all made positive contributions to the cue and the area controlled by p and sr accounted for 90 31 of the total area p made a negative contribution to the wue and the area it controlled area accounted for 33 1 of the total area data availability statement the fundamental data used in our study is available in the public and their websites are provided in the 2

2492,it is crucial to determine the factors affecting the carbon use efficiency cue and water use efficiency wue of vegetation in ecosystems however the relationships between climate changes and cue and wue by karst vegetation in china are still unclear the response of the cue and wue to regional climate change was studied by using trend analysis and partial derivative method in addition the distribution characteristics of the cue and wue of different land use types were analyzed the following results were found 1 from 2000 to 2018 the average of cue in karst areas of china was 0 557 and the average value of wue was 1 237g c kg 1 h2o 2 the cue of grassland was higher than that of forest land 0 051 whereas the wue value of grassland was far lower than that of forest land 1 415 g c kg 1 h2o 3 cue was affected by precipitation p exhibiting an increasing trend 5 5 10 3 yr 1 and the most obvious increase occurred in the grassland 7 2 10 3 yr 1 under the influence of solar radiation sr the wue decreased 1 5 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 and the largest decrease occurred in the shrub land 8 4 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 4 90 31 cue increase depended on p and sr while 78 32 of the decrease in the wue was due to p and sr this study makes important contributions to clarifying the responses of the cue and wue of ecosystems to climate changes in karst areas optimizing the management of regional water and soil resources and promoting healthy development of the ecological environment keywords climate change karst carbon use efficiency water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbon use efficiency cue and water use efficiency wue are important indicators for analyzing the interaction between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems are tightly coupled through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes el masri et al 2019 cue and wue are increasingly considered as important parameters for the formation of carbon and water storage in ecosystems gifford 2003 piao et al 2010 campioli et al 2015 temperature precipitation and solar radiation have direct impacts on cue zhang et al 2009 and wue li et al 2016 wue changes with the change of rainfall adams et al 2019 many scholars have analyzed the relationship between temperature and precipitation and wue zheng et al 2019a zheng et al 2019b solar radiation also affects wue brümmer et al 2012 yang et al 2022 therefore this study mainly selected temperature precipitation and solar radiation as the climatic factors vegetation that grows in cooler drier environments is more resilient primarily because plants use less energy to sustain life in such environments and are therefore more efficient at storing carbon gower 2002 low cue indicate that the carbon consumption by vegetation is higher because of the rising temperatures prolonged growing seasons and lack of nutrition delucia et al 2007 on the contrary high cue means that vegetation has adaptability in harsh environmental conditions such as low temperature and dryness kim et al 2018 in addition climate change is the leading factor to promote the changes of terrestrial ecosystems in cue and wue pan et al 2016 cui et al 2019 therefore quantitative evaluation of the impact of climate factors on cue and wue is of great significance for understanding cue and wue the wue of ecosystem in the karst area is obviously lower than that in the non karst area but it is increasing rapidly wue in the karst area is more sensitive to rainfall ding et al 2021 different vegetation types respond differently to climate change resulting in an inconsistent interannual rate of change in wue zhang et al 2019 the interaction of land use and bedrock has strongly changed the response of vegetation to climate change leading to differences in cue and wue for different land use types jiang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to study the responses of cue and wue in chinese karst areas to climate change and analyze the cue and wue of different land use types the cue and wue are considered to be important overall indicators of the carbon and water cycles which connect terrestrial ecosystems with the atmosphere so they are helpful in evaluating the responses of ecosystems to changes in environmental conditions huang et al 2015 keenan et al 2013 the changes in and potential mechanisms of the cue and wue have been well studied on different biological scales such as plant leaves individual plants and the canopy yu et al 2004 it is still challenging to use the proposed theory to evaluate the long term changes in the cue and wue on a larger spatial scale niu et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to study the temporal and spatial changes of cue and wue in chinese karst areas and their responses to climate changes the goal of this study was to investigate the responses of climate changes to the cue and wue in the karst areas of china from 2000 to 2018 the specific objectives are as follows 1 to reveal the temporal and spatial distributions and changes in the cue and wue in karst areas 2 to analyze the responses of the cue and wue to climate change 3 to compare the cue and wue of each land use type on different scales the results of this study are of great significance to and necessary for improving our understanding of cue and wue in the karst areas of china and to enriching related global change research 2 data and methods 2 1 study area karst landforms were widely distributed in china with a total area of 3 44 million km2 which exceeds 1 3 of china s total land area wu et al 2020 according to the statistics of spatial data the exposed karst area in china was approximately 1 88 million km2 accounted for 19 58 of china s total land area fig 1 however the karst area was only 1 51 million km2 covered by vegetation which accounted for 80 35 of the total karst areas 1 88 million km2 in china it was worth noting that the area of the karst area in the eight southwestern provinces is 0 54 million km2 in this study china s karst area was divided into three parts namely south china karst area north china karst area and qinghai tibet plateau karst area 2 2 cue and wue calculations in this study the cue is defined as the ratio of the net primary production npp to the gross primary production gpp zhang et al 2014 and the ecosystem wue is defined as the ratio of the gpp to the actual evapotranspiration et beer et al 2009 which calculated as follows 1 cue npp gpp 2 wue gpp et where cue refers to carbon use efficiency dimensionless wue is vegetation water use efficiency g c kg 1 h2o gpp g c m 2 npp g c m 2 et mm 2 3 gpp npp and et data the 2000 2015 gpp and npp data were obtained from the mod17a3 with a resolution of 1 km and an interval of 8 days the data were produced by the numerical terrain simulation group ntsg of the university of montana umt https www ntsg umt edu the projection format was the equal longitude and latitude projection of wgs 84 and the ratio coefficient were 0 1 2016 2018 gpp and npp data was from the national aeronautics and space administration https search earthdata nasa

resolution of 0 25 from the monthly evapotranspiration datasets gldas data combines satellite and ground observations and utilize the land surface model lsm and data assimilation technology to provide multiple types of high quality data sets 2 4 climate and land use data from 2000 to 2018 meteorological data including precipitation p temperature t and solar radiation sr data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were collected the data collected from the gldas 2 1 data sets https www nasa gov of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa with the global space coverage 60s 180 w 90 n 180e a large number of studies and evaluation results showed that gldas 2 1 data had high reliability kato et al 2007 li et al 2018 piao et al 2015 the land use data were collected from the european space agency the land cover data with a spatial resolution of 300 m https maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php it can be seen from the table 1 that the data used in this study come from data sources of different temporal and spatial scales in order to make the spatial scale of the data consistent we use gpp data as the benchmark and use arcgis10 2 to resample all data to a spatial resolution of 0 1 because the research time scale is 2000 2018 the time scale of all data is selected as 2000 2018 2 5 methods the spatial patterns of cue and wue in the karst area was analyzed according to their averages from 2000 to 2018 in order to evaluate the time change of cue and wue we used the least square regression method to calculate the linear trend of cue and wue per pixel from 2000 to 2018 in addition partial correlation methods are also used to analyze the contribution of climate factors p t sr to cue and wue xu et al 2010 2 5 1 trend analysis firstly ordinary least squares regression was used on each pixel to determine the slope value the linear tendency estimation was used to analyse the temporal dynamics of cue and wue and statistical test of correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the significant change trend the linear tendency value was estimated by using the least square method gong et al 2021 li et al 2022 3 k j 1 n m j t j 1 n j 1 n m j j 1 n t j j 1 n t j 2 1 n j 1 n t j 2 where n represents the time span from 2000 to 2018 tj represents the year and mj is the independent variable corresponding to year j k is the linear tendency value this method can be calculated to pixel level and the increased and decreased areas can be seen intuitively however there may be some error between the calculated value and the actual value 2 5 2 partial derivative we used the method provided by roderick et al 2007 which has been widely applied into assessing the impacts of various interfering factor on hydrological and meteorological changes you et al 2013 liu and sun 2016 therefore partial derivatives are used to estimate the influence of climatic factors on the changes of cue and wue 4 dy dt y x a dx a dt y x b dx b dt y x c dx c dt y x n dx n dt where dy dt x a c o n x b c o n x c c o n x n c o n dy dt represents the linear trend of y change x a c o n x b c o n x c c o n and x n c o n represent the contributions of x a x b x c and x n to y variations respectively y x a y x b y x c y x n represents the variation of y and the partial derivatives of each variables the each partial derivatives is equal to the corresponding second order partial correlation coefficient this study assumes that p t and sr are the main reasons for the changes of cue and wue and k is the trend of cue change caused by the interaction of p t and sr as shown in the below 5 k p c o n t c o n s r c o n c u e p dp dt c u e t dt dt c u e s r dsr dt p con was the contribution of precipitation p while t con and sr con were the contributions of temperature t and solar radiation sr to the changes of cue respectively the contribution of climate factors to wue is calculated using the same method considering that all types of factors have linear influence on the changes of cue and wue the second order partial correlation coefficient between one factor and cue and wue could be obtained by respectively eliminating the other two factors the second order partial correlation coefficients were calculated as follows xu et al 2010 song et al 2022 6 r x y z λ r x y z r x λ z r y λ z 1 r 2 x λ z 1 r 2 y λ z where r x y z λ represents the second order partial correlation coefficient between x and y by eliminating the impact of factors z and λ r x y z and r y λ z has a similar definition as shown above in addition t test to judge the significance of the correlation between two variables if p is less than 0 05 it will pass the 95 confidence significance test otherwise it is not significant 2 5 3 evaluate the relative effects of climatic factors to cue and wue to separate the influence of climate factors on cue and wue from other influencing factors we assumed that the other influencing factors remain unchanged and use p t and sr data to quantify the contribution rate of climate factors to cue and wue ge et al 2021 the effects of climate factors on cue and wue are measured similarly by using constant climate simulations so the relative effects of climate factors on cue and wue can be described by the following equation 7 contr c u e δ c lim p δ c lim p δ c lim t δ c lim s r 100 where contr c u e represents the contribution rate of climatic factors to cue δ c lim p δ c lim t δ c lim sr respectively represent the partial correlation coefficients between climatic factors such as precipitation temperature and solar radiation and cue in the same way the contribution rate of climate factors to wue was calculated 3 results and analysis 3 1 spatial patterns of the cue and wue under the influences of vegetation cover and climate change the spatial patterns of the cue and wue in karst areas are changing according to statistics the average cue in the karst areas is 0 557 and that in the non karst areas is 0 547 fig 2 the spatial pattern of the cue throughout the entire karst areas is high in the west and low in the east the areas with cue values of greater than 0 5 are mainly distributed on qinghai tibetan plateau and in the karst areas in southern china accounting for 73 6 of the total area the high cue value areas are always located in cold and dry environments because plants in these environments have a strong carbon storage capacity and the energy consumed during the growth of plants is also low usually the cue of the forest ecosystem was lower than that of the shrub and herb zhang et al 2009 the high cue value areas are mainly located in the karst areas with high altitudes and low temperatures on the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 2a the high value areas of wue are mainly concentrated in southern china and the areas with a multi year average of greater than 1 5 g c kg 1 h2o account for 38 25 of the total area the high wue value areas are usually distributed in warm and humid areas because the canopy of vegetation in these areas flourishes and thus can intercept more solar radiation utilize more soil and promote plant growth hu et al 2009 niu et al 2011 the high wue values mainly occurs in warm and humid karst area in southern china fig 2b low co2 partial pressures low temperatures and high altitudes will limit plant growth and reduce the wue of plants zhu et al 2015 which may be the reason why the wue values are the lowest in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau during the study period the average wue in the karst area was 1 237 g c kg 1 h2o the average wue in the non karst area was 1 245 g c kg 1 h2o and the value in the karst area was slightly lower than that in the non karst area fig 2 it should be noted that some of the low wue value areas and high value areas of cue value areas are located in the same area for example the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau 3 2 temporal changes in the cue and wue during the study period the cue in the karst area exhibited an increasing trend of 5 5 10 3 yr 1 p 0 05 of which the area with an increasing trend accounted for 86 72 of the total area fig 3 a and the increasing trend in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau was the most significant the wue exhibited a decreasing trend of 1 5 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 p 0 05 fig 3b and the areas in which the wue decreased were mainly distributed in the karst areas of southern china from the perspective of land use types the significant increases in the cue and wue of the grassland accounted for the largest proportions 93 52 and 80 59 of the total area respectively fig s4 and the largest reduction in the wue occurred in the forest land 58 88 of the total area from 2000 to 2018 cue generally increased mainly contain two types the regions in which the npp increased the gpp decreased and the cue increased area accounted for 29 71 of the total area the regions in which the npp decreased the gpp decreased and the cue increased area accounted for 56 36 of the total area fig 3e the area in which the wue decreased accounted for a larger proportion mainly including the following two types the areas where the gpp and wue decreased and the et increased accounted for 45 06 and the areas where the gpp and et increased and the wue decreased accounted for 32 6 which are mainly distributed in the karst areas of southern china and the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 3f during the study period the gpp rapidly increased the increase in p caused a greater increase in the et than the gpp which led to a decrease in the wue during the study period the cue of all of the land use types exhibited overall upward trends and the cue of the grassland 7 2 10 3 yr 1 exhibited the most significant increase the cue was the highest in the grassland 0 574 and the lowest in the forest land 0 523 fig 4 the cue was generally higher in the cold and dry areas the wue of the various land use types in the karst areas exhibited downward trends and the wue of the shrub land decreased the most significantly 8 4 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 compared with the other land use types the forest land had the highest wue 1 821 g c kg 1 h2o and the grassland had the lowest wue 0 406 g c kg 1 h2o the cue of sparsely vegetated ecosystems was higher than that of densely vegetated the cue of the grassland was higher than that of the forest land and the forest land had the lowest cue of all of the land use types fig 4 these findings are consistent with the results of previous studies härkönen et al 2010 which reported that in large plant ecosystems tall trees may have lower photosynthetic rates and productivities because their stems and branches have a higher hydraulic resistance hubbard et al 1999 zhang et al 2009 certainly the wue of forest land was higher than those of other ecosystems because an increase in the ratio of plant transpiration tr to ecosystem et i e tr et leads to an increase in wue in forested lands in wetter areas the cue and wue of the forest land dry land and rice fields in the karst areas were higher than those in the non karst areas fig 4 and there was enough water input in the rice fields to ensure the growth of crops without worrying about evaporation the forest land has developed root lush foliage and rich vegetation coverage so the water retention in this area is strong 3 3 contribution rates of the climate factors to the cue and wue here we analyze the correlation of climatic factors with cue and wue the average values of partial correlation coefficients of the cue with p t and sr are 0 27 0 15 and 0 1 respectively and the wue with p t and sr are 0 03 0 05 and 0 2 respectively fig 5 we found that 73 8 of the p was positively correlated with the cue mainly in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau and in southern china while 37 of the sr was positively correlated with the cue moreover 53 of the p was negatively correlated with the wue mainly distributed in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau and 55 of the t was positively correlated with the wue especially in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau to further accurately identify the contribution rates of the climatic factors to the cue and wue fig 6 the contribution rates of the climatic factors to the cue and wue were calculated p dominated the increase in the cue 60 28 and t and sr contributed 26 72 and 23 12 to the increase in the cue respectively unexpectedly p dominated the decrease in the wue 39 53 and t and sr contributed 28 4 and 32 07 to the increase in the wue respectively 3 4 main climatic factors controlling the cue and wue in different areas the contributions of p t and sr to the cue and wue exhibited significant spatial differences in the karst areas fig 7 overall p made the largest positive contribution to the cue in the entire karst region 7 33 from 2000 to 2018 while p made a negative contribution to the wue 1 47 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 the positive contributions of the sr to the cue and wue were 1 74 and 1 98 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 while t made the smallest positive contributions of 0 23 and 0 23 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 respectively in addition the contributions of the three climatic factors to the changes in the cue and wue were also distributed differently in the three karst areas the negative contribution of p to the wue was the greatest in the karst areas in southern china while the positive contribution of p to the cue was the greatest in the karst areas of southern china t made positive contributions to the cue and wue in the karst areas of the qinghai tibetan plateau in order to determine the main climatic factors that controlled the changes in the cue and wue in the karst areas the climatic factor that made the greatest absolute contribution to the pixel was selected as the main influencing factor as shown in fig 8 for the impacts of the three factors on the cue the areas dominated by p con t con and sr con accounted for 57 21 9 69 and 33 1 of the total area respectively the area controlled by p and sr accounted for 90 31 of the total area indicating that they were the two main factors affecting the change in the cue in the karst areas p was very important to the increase in the cue in the karst areas of southern china and the qinghai tibetan plateau for the wue is concerned the areas controlled by p con t con and sr con accounted for 33 1 21 68 and 45 22 of the total area respectively and the areas controlled by p and sr accounted for 78 32 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with other related research to further illustrate the reliability of our results we compared the results of this study with those of other research fields table 2 the wue has been widely verified in asia china northern china the loess plateau the po yang lake basin and other places and the results have been demonstrated to be reliable du et al 2019 liu et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 zheng et al 2019a the wue in northern china is higher than that in other areas mainly because this area has an arid to semi arid climate the wue increases rapidly with increasing precipitation in addition many scholars around have also carried out cue research in china po yang lake basin the three rivers region and other places and their results have been widely verified he et al 2018 chuai et al 2020 liu et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 the cue is the highest in the three rivers region mainly because of the low precipitation and low temperatures in this region which make the vegetation breathe weakly resulting in a higher cue 4 2 changes in the cue and wue at different latitudes and precipitation in terms of latitude the high cue values of each land use type occurred near 28 n because this latitude passes through the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau fig 9 a although the vegetation growth in this area is limited and the npp and gpp values are low in a cold environment vegetation needs to consume less energy to support metabolism the cue values of the forest land were higher than in the low latitude areas and the higher the latitude the lower the cue value in addition the wue was greatly influenced by latitude and it decreased with increasing latitude fig 9b which is consistent with the results of previous studies zheng et al 2019a the wue values of the dry land and paddy fields were greatly affected by precipitation and the wue decreased significantly in the area north of 32 n the values in the grassland were affected by the latitude and fluctuated greatly the wue was higher in the low latitude areas with the lowest value occurring at 32 n and increased in the higher latitude areas in the semi arid area with 200 400 mm of precipitation the cue and wue values in the karst areas reached the lowest values 0 497 and 0 34 g c kg 1 h2o respectively and the cue in the non karst area reached the highest value 0 598 fig 10 a indicating that in semi arid non karst regions the cue increases with increasing precipitation in humid areas with precipitation of greater than 800 mm the wue 1 57 g c kg 1 h2o in the karst areas was higher than that in the non karst areas 1 51 g c kg 1 h2o fig 10b the leaves of karst forest trees have a higher phosphorus concentration and photosynthetic capacity and thicker greater thickness of the front and back epidermises than those of non karst forest trees so they have a higher wue fu et al 2019 the relatively high cue and wue values of the dry land and paddy fields may be due to fertilization when the precipitation was less than 200 mm the wue values of the grassland forest land and other forested lands were the highest in all of the areas fig 10 we speculate these high wue values may be due to the different plant compositions and the unique soil water conditions dong et al 2021 the severe atmospheric drought and low soil water potential in saline alkali land stimulates the movement of the et and deep soil water to the surface soil dong et al 2011 snow melt supplies soil water for et and the wue increases as the soil drought stress index dsi increases yue et al 2020 due to long term adaptation to water shortages and the continuous decrease in the gpp vegetation growth in arid ecosystems responds rapidly to drought disturbances vicente serrano et al 2013 therefore the decrease in the gpp is less than the decrease in the et resulting in an increase in the wue under drought conditions the wue in humid atmosphere regions increases significantly as the amount of available water increases and precipitation decreases the severe soil water stress gang et al 2016 the shrub land 1 85 g c kg 1 h2o and forest land 1 22 g c kg 1 h2o had the highest wue values when the precipitation was greater than 800 mm 4 3 main factors driving the temporal changes in the cue and wue the different vegetation types different physiological characteristics and different soil textures in the same ecosystem will affect the cue fu et al 2016 the responses of the wue to various factors e g vegetation coverage t and p depends on the main processes driving the photosynthesis of the plants the water loss from the ecosystem and the relative change in the gpp compared to the et niu et al 2011 huang et al 2015 during the study period the npp gpp and et derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiomete modis products all increased significantly positive r values and the rate of increase of the npp 5 21 was higher than that of the gpp 2 35 which is the internal reason for the increase in the cue fig s2 the rate of increase of the gpp 2 35 was slower than that of the et 3 52 which lead to the decrease in the wue the rate of increase of the p during the study period was 13 02 p was affecting the increase in the cue and the decrease in the wue the p and cue were positively correlated which is consistent with the results of previous studies zheng et al 2020 precipitation is usually negatively correlated with changes in the wue because it causes the et to increase more quickly than the gpp when the soil water decreases significantly the gpp also decreases zhang et al 2021a luo et al 2022 soil moisture can control the concentration of co2 in the soil by controlling the activity of the microorganisms in arid areas or by changing the redox conditions of the soil jiang et al 2013 xiong et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b the soil moisture in the karst areas decreased deng et al 2020 which may be one of the reasons for the decrease in the wue 4 4 uncertainty and future outlook in this study the temporal and spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of the cue and wue in karst areas were studied which effectively improves our understanding of the cue and wue in these karst ecosystems however our research still has certain uncertainties and limitations the modis17a3 data used in this paper have a resolution of 1 km the areas contain different vegetation types and a large number of ecological restoration projects have been implemented in the karst areas which pose a challenge to the accurate identification of vegetation changes there are few meteorological stations in the karst area of the qinghai tibetan plateau in this study global scale climate data were used so the data may deviate from the actual values in addition the et data used in this study were obtained from the gldas 2 1 dataset although this type of dataset is widely used its resolution is relatively low vegetation responses to climate change usually have a lag effect which may affect the cue and wue values but the lag effect caused by the climate factors was not considered in this study these uncertainties and limitations may affect our overall understanding of the cue and wue of vegetation in ecosystems early terrestrial carbon cycle models such as the casa potter et al 1993 and forest bg c running and coughlan 1988 often assumed a fixed cue value to quantify ra delucia et al 2007 however increasing evidence shows that the cue actually varies with many factors including the vegetation type climate conditions site fertility and forest age ryan et al 1996 amthor 2000 delucia et al 2007 piao et al 2010 campioli et al 2015 the factors influencing an factors of ecosystem s wue mainly include the vapor pressure deficit vpd soil moisture and atmospheric co2 concentration nitrogen deposition etc hu et al 2009 wei et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 of course wue is also affected by water and sediment discharge in karst areas li et al 2016 in future research other factors can be considered to comprehensively analyze the cue and wue 5 conclusions based on correlation analysis and the partial derivative method in this study the responses of the cue and wue to climate changes were analyzed the relationships between the cue and wue and climatic factors and the differences in the cue and wue of different land use types were analyzed and the contributions of the climate factors to the cue and wue were further evaluated the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the average cue in the karst area was 0 557 and the average value of wue was 1 237 g c kg 1 h2o the cue of the grassland was higher than that of the forest land 0 051 while the wue of the grassland was much lower than that of the forest land 1 415 2 from 2000 to 2018 the cue and wue of the entire karst area exhibited an insignificant increasing trend of 5 5 10 3 yr 1 the areas with increasing trends accounted for 86 72 of the total area and the wue exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend of 1 5 10 3 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 3 in terms of land use types the areas with the largest significant increases in the cue and wue were the grasslands 93 52 and 80 59 of the total area respectively and the largest decrease in the wue occurred in the forest land 58 88 of the total area in the karst areas the cue and wue values of the forest land dry land and paddy fields were higher than in the non karst areas 4 among the climatic factors p t and sr all made positive contributions to the cue and the area controlled by p and sr accounted for 90 31 of the total area p made a negative contribution to the wue and the area it controlled area accounted for 33 1 of the total area data availability statement the fundamental data used in our study is available in the public and their websites are provided in the 2

2493,agriculture is one of the sectors most directly and severely affected by droughts therefore information regarding the water required wr to recover from agricultural drought and the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios is of great importance for drought risk management in this study we developed a quantitative evaluation method to estimate the wr of agricultural drought event recovery and a probabilistic drought recovery framework based on the copula function to calculate the probabilities of recovery from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios the developed method and framework were demonstrated in the yangtze river basin yrb using the improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi the average duration of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb was 28 d the difference in soil moisture persistence was the main factor affecting the spatial pattern of the grid mean drought recovery characteristics for individual drought events precipitation was the most important factor affecting drought recovery followed by drought development intensity there is a clear nonlinear relationship between the pcp value percentage of cumulative precipitation during drought recovery to its corresponding climatological mean and the drought recovery duration in most grids the three parameter power function can be used to characterize this relationship and further estimate the wr to recover from an agricultural drought event under different expected recovery durations we estimated the probabilities of extreme and severe agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios when the expected recovery durations were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 d based on the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework for example when the cumulative precipitation is no less than its climatological mean within 30 d the probability of recovering from extreme agricultural drought is 0 59 these findings are important for decision making in water and drought management keywords agricultural drought improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index recovery duration water required recovery probability data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as one of the most devastating natural disasters drought often imposes widespread negative impacts on various natural systems and socioeconomic sectors of the affected region ahmadi et al 2019a gibson et al 2020 wu et al 2021a xu et al 2021 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 the evaluation of drought recovery is important for proactive drought management huang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 wu et al 2021b this is because when drought occurs more information on how long the current drought situation might continue and how much precipitation would be required for drought recovery is valuable for optimizing the water resource management system during drought and effective drought mitigation margariti et al 2019 pan et al 2013 parry et al 2018 wu et al 2021b according to previous studies the drought event lifecycle can be separated into the drought development stage and drought recovery stage by the maximum intensity mi during a drought parry et al 2016a parry et al 2016b wu et al 2020 wu et al 2021a xu et al 2022a drought recovery is often characterized as rapid but may also proceed over monthly to seasonal timescales which means that drought recovery is less predictable than drought onset parry et al 2018 singh et al 2021 wu et al 2021a therefore determining the possible factors affecting drought recovery is essential to improve drought recovery predictions and has attracted increasing attention in recent studies for example parry et al 2016b found that hydrological drought recovery duration is moderately negatively correlated with elevation and catchment average precipitation and both drought recovery duration and recovery rate correlate significantly with drought development duration yang et al 2017 pointed out that the precipitation recovery rate is the dominant factor controlling the recovery of hydrological droughts wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and xu et al 2022a quantified the impact of human activities on hydrological drought recovery using an observed simulated comparison approach because reservoir regulation is often considered the most dominant human intervention for hydrological drought recovery in these studies and different reservoirs are operated with different scheduling rules the influence of anthropogenic components on the recovery of hydrological drought cannot be generalized and requires a case by case analysis margariti et al 2019 found that groundwater abstractions reservoirs and mixed influences increase the average drought recovery duration whereas water transfer into the catchment decreases the drought recovery duration however these previous studies have mainly focused on identifying factors affecting hydrological drought recovery and factors affecting agricultural drought recovery have not been widely discussed there is a tremendous need to deepen our understanding of the agricultural drought recovery process and its influencing factors as agricultural droughts directly impact crop growth which may lead to reduced agricultural productivity and in the worst case to famines mishra et al 2019 moreover most of these studies were conducted at the basin scale which means that the spatial variation of drought recovery characteristics and its influencing factors may be insufficient to be detected as drought recovery characteristics are spatially heterogeneous parry et al 2016b yao et al 2022 therefore more attempts are needed to improve drought recovery analysis to a finer spatial resolution by introducing grid based data to accurately represent the spatial differences in drought recovery characteristics and their influencing factors apart from the factors affecting drought recovery information on the water required wr for drought recovery is crucial for water resource management and has attracted increasing attention parry et al 2016a antofie et al 2015 computed the precipitation required for drought termination and amelioration for periods of 1 3 and 6 months based on the assumptions of the palmer drought model wu et al 2020 established a linear relationship between runoff and corresponding precipitation to estimate the amount of precipitation required to recover from a certain hydrological drought singh et al 2021 estimated the precipitation required to fill a storage deficit by deriving a linear relationship between precipitation and storage variability huang et al 2021 calculated the drought index value for the next month using the predicted precipitation and then used the predicted precipitation as the water required to terminate a drought if the drought index value for the next month approaches zero the results of these studies are useful for water conservation managers to further optimize the allocation of water resources during droughts however the drought indices of these studies were calculated on a monthly timescale which may be insufficient for accurate identification of the drought recovery process especially in drought events with shorter durations drought recovery characteristics cannot be obtained when drought duration is less than 3 months wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a as heavy rainfall in a short period may terminate drought and drought recovery is usually rapid ahmadi et al 2019b parry et al 2018 parry et al 2016b singh et al 2021 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a therefore more attempts are needed to improve drought recovery identification to a finer temporal resolution by introducing sub monthly drought indices which may help to accurately estimate the wr for drought recovery moreover the likelihood that drought could be recovered under the given precipitation scenario has not been fully elucidated apart from the amount of precipitation the temporal variability of precipitation and other factors can result in large uncertainty in drought recovery therefore the deterministic approach for estimating wr for drought recovery does not provide sufficient information for drought risk assessment pan et al 2013 found significant uncertainty in drought recovery given the same precipitation and suggested introducing probabilistic analysis methods to provide indispensable risk information for drought managers recently several studies have attempted to estimate the climatological probability of receiving the precipitation that needs to end the drought and then take it as the drought recovery probability directly antofie et al 2015 huang et al 2021 which may be unreasonable because the conditional probability derived from the joint probability distribution function established using a copula function is more suitable for representing the likelihood of drought recovery under a given precipitation scenario pan et al 2013 this study aims to 1 determine the potential factors affecting agricultural drought recovery 2 construct a statistical relationship model between wr and drought recovery duration to estimate wr to recover from a certain agricultural drought event and 3 propose a probabilistic drought recovery framework using a copula based joint distribution function to estimate the probabilities of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios as china s main commercial crop base agricultural development in the yangtze river basin yrb is vital for china s food security tian et al 2022 however the increased agricultural drought frequency in the yrb has caused extensive losses in agricultural production and further economic sun et al 2019 quantitative evaluation of the water requirements and the probability of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb are important for proactive drought management therefore the developed model and framework were demonstrated in the drought prone yrb with the improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi based on the daily soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 0 05 simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model the results of this study will be helpful for water managers to optimize drought resistant water resources during agricultural droughts 2 methods this section introduces the framework developed fig 1 to estimate wr to recover from a given agricultural drought event and the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios the four main steps in the developed framework are introduced in section 2 1 to section 2 5 2 1 improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index in this study the ismapi proposed by xu et al 2021 was used to characterize agricultural drought the ismapi applicability was well validated in the yrb by xu et al 2021 who found that the ismapi has high reliability for agricultural drought monitoring the ismapi calculation process is summarized as follows non normally distributed soil moisture was transformed into a normally distributed soil moisture series using the box cox transformation 1 s m λ s m λ 1 λ λ 0 ln sm λ 0 where sm and s m λ are the simulated soil moisture and the corresponding value estimated by the box cox transformation respectively and λ is the power exponent of the box cox transformation which was determined using the maximum likelihood method the transformed soil moisture data s m λ are standardized 2 ismapi s m λ s m λ δ s m λ where s m λ and δ s m λ are the mean value and standard deviation of s m λ the drought categories of ismapi are listed in table 1 2 2 identification of agricultural drought events and drought recovery characteristics in this study the run theory was used to identify agricultural drought events from the ismapi series drought duration is defined as the number of consecutive days with ismapi values below 0 5 we used 30 d as the minimum threshold for drought duration to identify drought events moreover two adjacent drought events would be merged into one new drought event if the time interval between these two drought events is less than 5 d wu et al 2015 agricultural drought events can be divided by mi into drought development and recovery stages parry et al 2016a wu et al 2019 compared with the drought development stage the drought recovery stage might last for a short period as heavy rain can end the drought immediately that is mi may occur on the last day of the drought event drought 2 in fig 2 therefore if the last day of a drought event is considered as the last day of the drought recovery stage the recovery characteristics of some drought events cannot be determined in this study the drought recovery duration ddr in fig 2 was defined as the number of days from the mi t2 in fig 2 to a day after drought termination t3 in fig 2 the drought recovery rate rdr refers to the variation rate of the ismapi during the drought recovery stage that is the ratio of the difference between the ismapi values at t3 and t2 in fig 2 to the drought recovery duration the drought recovery intensity idr is the mean value of the ismapi during the drought recovery stage and the drought recovery severity sdr in fig 2 is the total absolute value of the ismapi during the drought recovery stage similarly the drought development duration ddd in fig 2 is defined as the number of days from the beginning of the drought event t1 in fig 2 to mi t2 in fig 2 the drought development intensity idd is the mean value of the ismapi during the drought development stage and the drought development severity sdd in fig 2 is the total absolute value of the ismapi during the drought development period 2 3 identification of factors affecting agricultural drought recovery in this study we selected three drought development characteristics ddd idd and sdd and two meteorological variables pcp and pmt to identify the most significant factors affecting agricultural drought recovery at a grid scale pcp refers to the ratio of cumulative precipitation during drought recovery to its corresponding climatological mean average cumulative precipitation over the same period computed for the period 1979 2020 expressed as a percentage pmt refers to the anomaly percentage of the mean temperature during drought recovery to its corresponding climatological mean average temperature over the same period computed for the period 1979 2020 in addition to the different drought events significant differences were observed in the drought recovery characteristics in different regions therefore factors affecting the spatial distribution of drought recovery characteristics were also identified from 15 alternative climate characteristics soil properties and vegetation parameters including the following the lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture smcc with a lag time of 10 d mean elevation dem quartz content of soil quartz fractional soil moisture content at the critical point wcr fractional soil moisture content at the wilting point wpwp mean annual precipitation p mean annual temperature t mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet aridity index ai coefficient of variation of mean monthly precipitation cv p coefficient of variation of mean monthly temperature cv t coefficient of variation of mean monthly potential evapotranspiration cv pet coefficient of variation of mean monthly aridity index cv ai leaf area index lai and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi pet was estimated using the penman monteith method based on the meteorological data mentioned in section 3 2 it should be noted out that the smcc selected in this study mainly reflects the persistence characteristics of soil moisture xu et al 2021 the smcc with a lag time of 10 d was selected because we found that the lag time did not influence the relationship between soil moisture persistence and drought recovery characteristics the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to estimate the correlation between drought recovery characteristics and alternative factors and a higher absolute value correlation coefficient with statistically significant indicated that the selected factors might have a significant influence on the target drought recovery characteristics 2 4 determination of water required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event in this study we used the ensemble streamflow prediction method to create an ensemble of meteorological forcing from historical meteorological records day 1985 pan et al 2013 and then used it as inputs to the vic model to obtain the samples of d dr and corresponding pcp we defined wr for agricultural drought recovery as the amount of cumulative precipitation required for agricultural drought to recover to normal ismapi 0 5 for comparative purposes the cumulative precipitation during drought recovery is denoted by the pcp value the procedure for estimating wr to recover from the typical agricultural drought event can be summarized as follows 1 determine the typical agricultural drought event the agricultural drought event with the maximum mi was selected as the typical drought event to facilitate the description we considered the agricultural drought event of the typical grid in region iv as an example to introduce the following steps the mi of this typical drought event occurred on april 6 2011 and there were 3556 days from april 7 2011 the first day of drought recovery to december 31 2020 the last day of the study period 2 construct a forcing data ensemble with 42 members first we sampled exhaustively and uniquely from the 42 year 1979 2020 historical database to create 42 sample sets that is the precipitation data from april 7 of every year to december 31 2020 were all sampled exactly once then a 42 member ensemble with a time series length of 3556 days for each member was created based on the above 42 sample sets specifically for members before 2011 the data for the first 3556 days of the corresponding samples were selected for members after 2011 since the length of the time series of the samples d was less than 3556 days the data of the first d days of the members were from the corresponding samples and the data of the last 3556 d days of the members were supplemented with measured data for example there were 2095 days from april 7 2015 to december 31 2020 and the observed data from january 1 2017 2095 days after april 7 2011 to december 31 2020 were used to extend the sequence of the member to 3556 days 3 generate samples of d dr and the corresponding pcp the vic model was initialized on april 6 2011 and the initial conditions were obtained from xu et al 2022b who ran the vic model continuously with the observed precipitation the 42 member ensemble was input to the vic model to simulate soil moisture from april 7 2011 to december 31 2020 subsequently the ismapi calculated based on the simulated soil moisture was used to determine the d dr and its corresponding pcp value 4 determine the optimal function type between d dr and its corresponding pcp value leave one out cross validation technology was used to determine the optimal function type specifically each sample was taken as the test sample in turn that is this sample was not used for function fitting and the other 41 samples were used to fit the three parameter power and exponential functions pcp value was then estimated using the fitted parameters and d dr of the test sample this process was repeated 42 times and the pcp for drought recovery corresponding to each d dr was estimated the root mean square error rmse between the actual and estimated pcp was calculated and the function type with the smaller rmse was the optimal function type of the target grid 5 determine the parameters of the selected function type using all samples and then use them to estimate wr for agricultural drought recovery 2 5 determination of the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios for a specific agricultural drought grade its corresponding drought index value is not constant but varies in a range which results in large uncertainty in recovering from a specific grade of agricultural drought under given precipitation conditions therefore it is necessary to evaluate the possibility of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation conditions using probability statistics in this study using severe and extreme agricultural droughts as examples we estimated the recovery probability of agricultural drought under different precipitation scenarios by constructing the joint distribution of ismapi value for the last day of expected recovery duration and corresponding pcp using the copula function considering the difference in the occurrence probability of severe and extreme agricultural droughts the sample sizes of the ismapi and pcp values for severe and extreme agricultural droughts in each grid were set to 200 and 100 respectively taking extreme agricultural drought as an example the procedure for constructing the joint distribution of ismapi and pcp values can be summarized as follows 1 obtain ismapi and pcp samples for each grid with expected recovery durations of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 d respectively count the number of ismapi values n not exceeding 2 0 and then select 100 samples from it using the isometric sampling method the dates for these 100 samples were dn n 1 2 99 and 100 determine the ismapi values 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 days after dn and calculate the corresponding pcp values 2 determine the marginal distributions of the ismapi and pcp values commonly used normal logistic generalized extreme value right skewed gumbel and left skewed gumbel distributions were applied to fit the ismapi value the exponential exponentiated weibull gamma log normal and weibull minimum extreme value distributions were applied to fit the pcp values in this study the fitter package https pypi org project fitter in python was used to fit the marginal distribution of the two random variables the aic method in the fitter package is used to determine the best fitted marginal distribution function of the two random variables 3 the joint distribution of the ismapi and pcp values is determined based on the copula function in this study five commonly used copulas from the archimedean family are considered the ali mikhail haq clayton frank gumbel and joe copulas the rmse between the empirical and theoretical values is used for the goodness of fit test of the copula functions and the best fitted copula for each expected recovery duration in each grid cell should have the smallest rmse value once the marginal distributions of the two variables and the best fitted copula function are determined the probability of agricultural drought recovery ismapi 0 5 conditioned on different precipitation scenarios can be estimated based on the bayesian network renard et al 2006 as follows 3 p ismapi 0 5 p cp p 1 0 f p p f i 0 5 c f i 0 5 f p p 1 0 f p p where f i and f p are the marginal cumulative distribution of the ismapi and pcp value f i 0 5 and f p p represents the cumulative probability of ismapi 0 5 and p cp p respectively c f i 0 5 f p p represents the joint cumulative probability of ismapi 0 5 and p cp p based on the conditional probability idea the probability of agricultural drought recovery will be infinitely close to 1 0 with an increase in pcp value in this study the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought was introduced to further explore the resilience to agricultural drought specifically we iterated the pcp value at an interval of 5 0 from 5 0 to 300 0 and the probability of agricultural drought recovery was estimated under different pcp values when the conditional probability is not less than 0 75 the corresponding pcp value is taken as the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought taking the expected recovery duration of 30 d as an example if the recovery probability of extreme agricultural drought is no less than 0 75 when the pcp value is no less than 130 0 this means that the threshold of wr to recover from extreme agricultural drought is 130 0 when the recovery duration is 30 d a higher wr threshold indicates lower resilience to agricultural drought 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the yrb fig 3 is the longest river in asia and the third longest river in the world with a length of approximately 6300 km the yrb has a drainage area of approximately 1 8 106 km2 accounting for 18 8 of china s territory the terrain of the yrb is high in the west and low in the east with complex topography including plateaus mountains hills basins and plains the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in the yrb is significantly uneven precipitation is concentrated mainly from may to october the yrb suffers from frequent drought disasters influenced by complex terrain and a changeable climate the annual occurrence of drought in the yrb was 3 77 times from 1961 to 2015 li et al 2020 the yrb has experienced frequent and severe agricultural droughts in recent years for example in 2018 droughts occurred in the mid lower reaches of the yrb and the area of affected crops reached 7 927 105 ha lu et al 2022 since july 2022 the yrb has been hit by the most severe drought since 1961 at the drought peak on august 25 approximately 4 421 106 ha of cultivated lands in the yrb were affected by the drought xia et al 2022 therefore a comprehensive analysis of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb is crucial for agricultural drought prevention and mitigation strategies in this study the yrb was divided into four hydroclimatic regions according to lang et al 2014 fig 3 3 2 data sources and processing daily soil moisture data with a spatial resolution of 0 05 from 1981 to 2020 were simulated using a well calibrated vic model which was evaluated by xu et al 2022b the meteorological data used in this study include precipitation air temperature sunshine duration pressure specific humidity and wind speed the daily precipitation air temperature and sunshine duration data from 322 meteorological stations fig 3 within and around the yrb provided by the national meteorological science data center https data cma cn were interpolated into a 0 05 spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighted idw method pressure specific humidity and wind speed were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which is a gridded meteorological dataset with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 10 he et al 2020 raw cmfd was downscaled from the original spatial resolution to a 0 05 0 05 resolution using bilinear interpolation the soil property data used in this study were derived from a dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling in china dai et al 2013 lai and ndvi were derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis dataset https modis gsfc nasa gov data 4 results 4 1 spatial patterns of agricultural drought recovery characteristics in the yrb fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of agricultural drought recovery characteristics in the yrb the average ddr of each grid was mostly between 10 and 50 d approximately 96 1 of the total grids with an average ddr of 28 d in the yrb generally the ddr in the east of region ii and west of region iii was shorter than that in other regions the average ddr in regions i ii iii and iv were 35 27 25 and 29 d respectively the spatial distribution of rdr fig 4 b was closely related to that of ddr that is regions with longer ddr often correspond to smaller rdr the average rdr was below 0 50 in approximately 98 1 of the total grids and the rdr did not exceed 0 35 in approximately 86 1 of the total grids the average rdr in regions i ii iii and iv were 0 21 0 26 0 27 and 0 25 respectively the idr was generally concentrated between 1 30 and 0 80 approximately 97 0 of the total grids the spatial distribution pattern of idr gradually strengthens from west to east and the average idr in regions i ii iii and iv were 0 96 0 97 1 02 and 1 04 respectively the spatial distribution of sdr is in good agreement with that of ddr that is regions with a longer ddr often correspond to a greater sdr the sdr was generally concentrated between 10 0 and 70 0 approximately 98 3 of the total grids among the four subregions region i had the largest sdr 39 9 on average followed by region iv 35 9 on average and the sdr in regions ii and iii was the smallest 31 2 and 30 5 on average respectively 4 2 factors affecting agricultural drought recovery 4 2 1 factors affecting the spatial patterns of agricultural drought recovery characteristics as discussed in section 4 1 there are significant differences in the agricultural drought recovery characteristics in different grids therefore we first analyzed the possible reasons for the spatial differences in agricultural drought recovery characteristics as shown in fig 5 the persistence of soil moisture characterized by smcc was positively correlated with ddr idr and sdr whereas negatively correlated with rdr the correlations between smcc and ddr rdr and sdr were significantly higher than those between other potential drivers and these three drought recovery characteristics indicating that differences in soil moisture persistence were the main factor causing the differences in agricultural drought recovery characteristics in different regions generally smcc p ai and cv p were the main factors affecting the ddr and the negative correlation between ddr and p suggests that wetter regions in the yrb tend to experience shorter ddr which is consistent with the results of parry et al 2016b smcc was the main factor affecting the rdr dem cv p and cv ai were the most important factors affecting idr smcc and ai were the most important factors affecting sdr these results indicate that the influence of climate characteristics on the spatial distribution of agricultural drought recovery characteristics is greater than that of the soil properties and vegetation parameters from the results of the four subregions most selected factors had significant influences on the spatial distribution of ddr rdr and sdr in region i whereas smcc was the dominant factor affecting the spatial distribution of these agricultural drought recovery characteristics in regions iii and iv the factors affecting the spatial distribution of idr vary significantly in the four subregions and p was the dominant factor affecting the spatial distribution of idr in region i the spatial distribution of idr in regions ii and iii was mainly related to cv p and cv ai whereas the correlations between idr and all alternative factors in region iv were weaker than that in other regions 4 2 2 factors affecting the recovery characteristics of agricultural drought events fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the agricultural drought development characteristics and agricultural drought recovery characteristics no significant correlations were observed between agricultural drought recovery characteristics and ddd in most grids fig 6 a1 a4 indicating ddd had little influence on agricultural drought recovery characteristics only in 47 4 of the total grids fig 6 b1 was there a significant negative correlation between ddr and idd which indicates that the smaller the idd the more severe the agricultural drought event the longer the time required for drought recovery in these grids there was no significant correlation between idd and rdr fig 6 b2 indicating that idd was not the main factor affecting rdr there was a significant positive correlation between the idr and idd in 96 1 of the grids the significance of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between these two variables was not greater than 0 05 and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 64 fig 6 b3 these results indicate that agricultural drought events with severe intensity during drought development are also expected to have severe drought intensity during drought recovery in approximately 76 1 of the total grids there was a significant negative correlation between the sdr and idd fig 6 b4 generally sdd has little impact on ddr rdr and sdr whereas in approximately 48 0 of the total grids sdd has a significant negative correlation with idr fig 6 c3 the above results show that agricultural drought development characteristics have little impact on the rdr and the idd is the main factor affecting the idr it should be noted that idd is closely related to mi and the relationships between mi and the four agricultural drought recovery characteristics are similar to those between idd and agricultural drought recovery characteristics therefore the relationships between the mi and agricultural drought recovery characteristics are not presented here there was a significant correlation between pcp and drought recovery characteristics in most grids fig 7 a1 a4 in approximately 94 2 of the total grids pcp had a significant negative correlation with ddr and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 76 indicating that the greater the pcp the shorter the ddr of the agricultural drought event in approximately 91 8 of the total grids there was a significant positive correlation between pcp and rdr and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 71 indicating that the greater the pcp the faster the agricultural drought recovery in only 58 5 of the total grids there was a significant positive correlation between pcp and idr with an average spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0 51 in 93 8 of the total grids pcp had a significant negative correlation with sdr and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 74 indicating that the smaller the pcp the more severe the agricultural drought in the recovery stage these results indicate that precipitation during drought recovery is the primary factor affecting drought recovery which is consistent with the results of yang et al 2017 there was no significant correlation between the pmt and the drought recovery characteristics in most grids the reason for this may be related to the fact that temperature indirectly affects agricultural drought evolution through evapotranspiration however the actual evapotranspiration during drought recovery may be limited by the soil moisture deficit and soil water supplemented by precipitation is significantly higher than the soil water consumed by evapotranspiration during drought recovery which results in the temperature is not the main factor affecting agricultural drought recovery 4 3 water required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event according to the results in section 4 2 pcp is the most important factor affecting ddr followed by idd or mi during drought therefore for a certain agricultural drought event we can only consider the impact of pcp on the ddr that is wr denoted by the pcp value to recover from a certain agricultural drought event can be estimated by establishing quantitative relationships between ddr and pcp values based on the method described in section 2 4 we obtained samples of the ddr and the corresponding pcp values for each grid fig 8 presents the spatial distribution of the optimal fitted function type and the corresponding goodness of fit of ddr and pcp required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event the three parameter power function performed better than the three parameter exponential function in reflecting the relationship between pcp and ddr specifically in 72 9 of the total grids the optimal function type was the power function from the results of the goodness of fit the r2 values in 99 5 of total grids were greater than or equal to 0 50 and the mean r2 in the yrb was 0 92 indicating that the fitted power function or exponential function in this study can be used to estimate the pcp required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event under a given expected recovery duration considering that the occurrence time and mi for the selected typical agricultural drought event vary with grids the spatial difference in wr to recover from the selected typical agricultural drought event is not discussed here to further validate the proposed method we randomly selected a grid in each subregion of the yrb the longitude and latitude of the grid center in region i are 99 175 e and 29 225 n longitude and latitude of the grid center in region ii are 105 775 e and 31 725 n longitude and latitude of the grid center in region iii are 113 075 e and 31 175 n and the longitude and latitude of the grid center in region iv are 116 525 e and 27 725 n fig 3 to compare the observed and estimated pcp required to recover from the typical agricultural drought fig 9 the observed pcp was determined by the actual drought recovery process and the estimated pcp was calculated based on the fitted curve equation the actual ddr and corresponding pcp were excluded when fitting the cure equation and the actual ddr there is a good nonlinear relationship between the ddr and pcp values when the ddr was short the pcp required for drought recovery decreased rapidly with an increase in the ddr after the ddr increases to a certain value the pcp required for drought recovery changes little with the ddr as shown in fig 9 the relationship between ddr and pcp required for drought recovery in the four typical grids can be expressed by a power function and their r2 ranges from 0 91 to 0 98 the estimated pcp values blue dots in fig 9 for the typical agricultural drought recovery were in good agreement with the observations red dots in fig 9 based on the fitted curve equation the wr to recover from the typical agricultural drought event can be estimated under the given expected recovery duration taking the typical grid in region i fig 9 a as an example when the expected recovery duration was 10 d the pcp value to recover from the typical agricultural drought event was approximately 230 2 of the precipitation during the same period and when the expected recovery duration was 60 d the pcp value for drought recovery was approximately 85 4 of the precipitation during the same period it is worth noting that the climatological mean of the cumulative precipitation increases with the expected recovery duration that is the decrease in wr characterized by the pcp value does not mean a decrease in the actual amount of precipitation required for agricultural drought recovery 4 4 probabilities of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios the significant correlation between the ismapi and pcp values is a prerequisite for constructing a joint distribution of the two variables using the copula function and for further estimating the probabilities of agricultural drought recovery conditioned on different precipitation scenarios in this study we focused on the probabilities of agricultural drought recovery conditioned on different precipitation scenarios when the expected recovery durations were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 d thus there are six pairs of ismapi and pcp samples in each grid for a specific grade of agricultural drought only grids that met the significance level of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between at least four pairs of ismapi and pcp samples no greater than 0 05 were selected to analyze the probabilities of agricultural drought recovery conditioned on different precipitation scenarios for extreme and severe agricultural droughts approximately 96 8 and 99 8 of the grids respectively met this restriction due to space limitations the results of severe agricultural drought recovery are presented in the supplementary materials based on the joint distribution of ismapi and pcp values the probabilities of extreme severe agricultural drought recovery were estimated with the pcp values ranging from 0 0 to 300 0 at a step size of 5 0 i e pcp values of 0 0 5 0 295 0 and 300 0 fig 10 and fig s1 present the regional average probability of recovering from extreme and severe agricultural droughts under multiple expected recovery durations and precipitation scenarios as well as the climatological probability of receiving the corresponding precipitation meanwhile taking the expected recovery duration is 30 d as an example fig 11 and fig s2 present the spatial distribution of the probability of recovering from extreme and severe agricultural droughts when the pcp is greater than or equal to 50 0 75 0 100 0 125 0 and 150 0 as well as the climatological probability of receiving the corresponding cumulative precipitation generally the probability of agricultural drought recovery increases with pcp for example when the expected recovery duration is 30 d and the pcp is no less than 50 0 75 0 100 0 125 0 and 150 0 the probabilities of recovering from extreme agricultural drought are 0 43 0 51 0 59 0 65 and 0 70 respectively overall the probability of agricultural drought recovery increased with the expected drought recovery duration conditioned on the same precipitation scenario for example the probabilities of extreme agricultural recovery are 0 51 and 0 62 when the pcp is no less than 75 0 and the expected recovery durations are 30 and 60 d respectively this is because the pcp rather than the amount of precipitation was used in our developed probabilistic framework and the climatological mean of the cumulative precipitation increased with the expected recovery duration when the pcp value was fixed however it is worth noting that under some precipitation scenarios the drought recovery probabilities when the expected recovery duration is 50 d may even be slightly higher than that when the expected recovery duration is 60 d which may be because the temporal pattern of precipitation was not considered in this study and the influence of the initial soil moisture condition is diminished with the increase in the expected recovery duration pan et al 2013 finally the probability of recovery from severe agricultural drought was higher than that from extreme agricultural drought conditioned on the same expected recovery duration and pcp value for example the probability of recovering from severe and extreme agricultural drought is 0 55 and 0 43 respectively when the pcp is greater than or equal to 50 0 and the expected recovery duration is 30 d fig 11 and fig s2 this is because the shortage of soil moisture under extreme drought is more critical than that under severe drought and more precipitation is required to recover from extreme agricultural drought these results are in line with our understanding of drought recovery and further prove that the probabilistic framework developed in this study is reliable for estimating the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios with an increase in pcp value the climatological probability of receiving the corresponding precipitation gradually decreased for example the climatological probabilities that the pcp value in the next 30 d is greater than or equal to 50 0 75 0 100 0 125 0 and 150 0 are 0 68 0 51 0 36 0 25 and 0 17 respectively fig 11 these results indicate that sometimes it is less likely to obtain the precipitation required for drought recovery under natural conditions and in this situation considering irrigation and other measures to supplement soil moisture will contribute to rapid recovery from agricultural drought the agricultural drought recovery probability has clear regional differences conditioned on the same precipitation scenario and expected recovery duration generally the possibility of drought recovery in region ii was higher than that in the other regions whereas region i had the overall least possibility of recovery from agricultural drought however regions with the least possibility of drought recovery may change with the precipitation scenario and the expected recovery duration for example the average recovery probability in region iv is comparable to or even less than that in region i when the expected recovery duration is greater than 30 d and a lower pcp value regional differences in drought recovery probability may be related to differences in the climatic characteristics of different subregions the average precipitation in region i was the lowest among the four regions that is the amount of precipitation in region i conditioned on the same pcp value was lower than in other regions which may be the reason for the overall least probability of recovery from agricultural drought in region i there was more precipitation in region ii than in region i to supplement the soil moisture conditioned on the same precipitation scenario therefore the probability of drought recovery in region ii was higher than that in region i the average precipitation in region iv was the largest among the four subregions that is the amount of precipitation in region iv was larger than that in other regions conditioned on the same precipitation scenario when the expected recovery duration was short e g 10 and 20 d and the pcp value was small the amount of precipitation in region iv was higher than that in other regions therefore the possibility of drought recovery in region iv was higher than that in other regions the amount of precipitation in the four subregions increased with the expected recovery duration conditioned on the same pcp value however water loss caused by evapotranspiration in region iv was significantly larger than that in other regions with an increase in expected recovery duration resulting in a lower drought recovery probability in region iv under the condition of longer expected recovery duration and smaller pcp value when the pcp value was relatively large the amount of precipitation in different regions was also large however the evapotranspiration in regions iii and iv was significantly higher than that in region ii and the supplemented soil moisture by the temporarily alleviated precipitation during drought recovery may have been rapidly lost in the form of evapotranspiration resulting in the drought recovery probability in region ii being higher than that in regions iii and iv 4 5 threshold of water required to recover from agricultural drought fig 12 and fig s3 present the spatial distribution of the wr threshold to recover from extreme and severe agricultural droughts under different expected recovery durations generally the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought gradually decreased with an increase in the expected recovery duration for example the average thresholds of wr to recover from extreme agricultural drought are 211 4 and 103 1 when the expected recovery durations are 10 d and 60 d respectively it is worth noting that the pcp value was used in this study to characterize the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought and the climatological mean of cumulative precipitation increases with the expected recovery duration that is a decrease in the threshold of wr characterized by the pcp value does not mean a decrease of in the actual amount of precipitation required the wr for extreme agricultural drought is higher than that for severe agricultural drought that is the precipitation required for drought recovery increases with drought severity which is consistent with previous studies antofie et al 2015 huang et al 2021 there are some grids except for some grids that are not included in the calculation mentioned in section 4 4 in the yrb that do not have a wr threshold to recover from agricultural drought which indicates that these grids have a probability of less than 0 75 to recover from agricultural drought conditioned on the given precipitation scenario the case of this phenomenon first depends on the predefined conditional probability 0 75 and maximum pcp value 300 0 with a decrease in the predefined conditional probability or an increase in the maximum pcp value the number of grids with a wr threshold is expected to increase additionally the probability of drought recovery calculated in this study is an average probability of agricultural drought recovery under given conditions therefore there may be some grids whose probability of drought recovery cannot reach the predefined conditional probability that is there is no wr threshold in these grids possible reasons for this result may include the following first extreme severe agricultural drought is defined as ismapi 2 0 1 5 ismapi 2 0 so multiple different ismapi values may be selected when determining the extreme severe agricultural drought samples taking extreme drought as an example ismapi equal to 2 0 and 3 5 correspond to extreme drought but the probabilities of recovering from the two extreme agricultural droughts may be differently conditioned on the same expected recovery duration and pcp value second only pcp values were considered in calculating the recovery probability the temporal pattern of precipitation which also affects the possibility of agricultural drought recovery pan et al 2013 wu et al 2020 was not considered in this study for example assuming that the pcp value in the next 30 d is 90 0 the recovery probability will be significantly different when all precipitation in the next 30 d occurs in the first 5 d and the last 5 d finally the samples selected in section 2 5 may be distributed in all four seasons and the recovery probability under the same conditions may vary with seasons due to the seasonal variations of climatic conditions antofie et al 2015 parry et al 2016b table 2 and table s1 summarize the average thresholds of wr to recover from extreme and severe agricultural drought and the percentages of grids with a threshold of drought recovery in the yrb and its four subregions the number of grids without a wr threshold increases significantly with a decrease in the expected recovery duration indicating the improbability of recovering from agricultural drought in a short period antofie et al 2015 the number of grids with a recovery threshold for severe agricultural drought was greater than that for extreme agricultural drought under the same expected recovery duration for example when the expected recovery duration was 10 d the percentage of grids with a wr threshold for extreme and severe agricultural droughts was approximately 43 4 and 56 2 respectively among the four subregions the percentage of grids with a wr threshold in region ii was generally higher than that in other regions and the average wr threshold in region ii was less than that in other regions indicating that it is easier to recover from agricultural drought in region ii than in other regions however the percentage of grids with a wr threshold in region i was lower than that in other regions except for the results when the expected recovery duration was 10 d indicating that there were more grids in region i with a wr threshold exceeding 300 0 and the agricultural drought resilience in region i was the lowest 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with previous studies information on wr for drought event recovery and the probability of recovery from different grades of drought under given precipitation scenarios could be useful in decisions concerning water resource management antofie et al 2015 in this study we developed a quantitative evaluation method to estimate wr to recover from agricultural drought events and a probabilistic drought recovery framework using a copula based joint distribution function to calculate the probability of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios although we focused on recovery from agricultural drought in the yrb the developed quantitative evaluation method and probabilistic drought recovery framework are flexible for application to other regions worldwide or other types of drought in this study we analyzed the quantitative relationship between wr and expected recovery duration we can use the developed quantitative evaluation method to predict the wr of agricultural drought recovery by establishing a nonlinear relationship model between ddr and the corresponding pcp value estimated using historical meteorological records note that the wr prediction here is performed under any user given expected recovery duration which may be inconsistent with the actual wr for a specific agricultural drought recovery as the actual ddr is unavailable moreover the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework can be used to calculate the probability of drought mitigation over a defined period this study for the first time used simulated soil moisture to determine the agricultural drought recovery duration at a finer spatiotemporal resolution 0 05 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution significant divergences in agricultural drought recovery characteristics occurred between different regions fig 4 indicating significant differences in the drought resilience of different regions this highlights the importance of identifying drought recovery characteristics at finer spatial resolutions the agricultural drought recovery duration obtained in this study the average ddr in the yrb was 28 days was shorter than that estimated by previous studies that determined the drought recovery duration on a monthly timescale wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021b yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 considering that drought recovery is often characterized as rapid ahmadi et al 2019b parry et al 2018 parry et al 2016b singh et al 2021 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a improving the drought recovery identification to a finer temporal resolution by introducing sub monthly drought indices may help to accurately estimate drought recovery characteristics our results suggest that grids in the yrb with high ai values have a long ddr fig 5 indicating that grids with relatively high excess rainfall are more easily recovered from agricultural drought however zhang et al 2019 found that the hydrological drought recovery time for eight tributaries of the yrb based on downscaled gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data was positively correlated with the climate moisture index cmi reciprocal of ai the disagreement between the results of the two studies may be because the former focused on the soil moisture recovery whereas the latter focused on the total water storage recovery and tributaries of the yrb with high cmi typically have a relatively high surface subsurface storage and more water is needed for the water storage deficit to recover to normal once hydrological droughts occur moreover this disagreement highlights the importance of identifying and comparing the factors that affect recovery from different types of droughts however our findings are generally consistent with those of the previous studies for example for grid mean drought recovery characteristics fig 5 we found that ddr is positively correlated with smcc meaning that grids with high smcc large soil moisture memory have a slower drought recovery speed this result agrees well with that of xu et al 2022a who found that the baseflow index a key variable representing catchment memory presented a significant positive correlation with the hydrological drought recovery duration moreover both this study and parry et al 2016b found that ddr is negatively correlated with the mean average precipitation precipitation during drought recovery is the most important factor affecting drought recovery for individual drought events fig 6 and fig 7 which has also been demonstrated in previous studies antofie et al 2015 wu et al 2020 among the four subregions of yrb region ii is easier to recover from agricultural drought whereas the resilience to agricultural drought in region i is the lowest this result agrees well with the findings of huang et al 2021 who explored the meteorological drought recovery patterns in the yrb the overall relatively low probabilities for drought recovery in region i could be partly related to the low precipitation in this region leading to the soil moisture deficit having a lesser chance to return to normal conditions than that in other subregions under the same pcp value 5 2 limitations and future study the approach developed in this study is based on a well calibrated vic model by xu et al 2022b according to the results of xu et al 2022b the vic model performs well in simulating soil moisture in the yrb and the accuracy of the simulated soil moisture can satisfy the requirements of this study and the results of this study are reliable however any study using a hydrological model is associated with uncertainties and simulation uncertainty affects the identification results of drought recovery margariti et al 2019 wang et al 2020 therefore more efforts should be made in future research to improve the accuracy of the simulation results to reduce the uncertainty of drought recovery identification considering that cumulative precipitation during drought recovery is the main driver for drought recovery fig 7 we developed a probabilistic drought recovery framework based on the joint distribution between the ismapi and pcp values and then estimated the probability of recovering from different grades of agricultural droughts under given precipitation scenarios which can provide indispensable risk information for drought managers however we found that some grids do not have a threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought fig 12 one of the reasons for this result may be that only the amount of precipitation during drought recovery was considered in this study the timing of precipitation and precipitation intensity are certainly related to drought recovery pan et al 2013 wu et al 2020 and quantification of the impact of the temporal pattern of precipitation on drought recovery requires further research finally we evaluated agricultural drought recovery based on the ismapi assuming that agricultural drought recovery was complete once the soil moisture deficit was relieved ismapi 0 5 however the return of precipitation or soil moisture is not necessarily sufficient for complete ecosystem recovery parry et al 2016a crops may experience water deficits at various stages of their growth cycle and the water required for different crops to recover from agricultural drought may vary in different regions and seasons therefore more attempts are needed to identify agricultural drought recovery and to estimate the water required to recover from agricultural drought by considering the recovery of crop growth and ecosystem production 6 conclusions in this study we developed a useful framework to estimate the water required wr to recover from a typical agricultural drought event and the probability of recovery from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation conditions the developed framework was tested in the drought prone yangtze river basin yrb we found that the average duration of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb is 28 d precipitation during drought recovery was the most important factor affecting agricultural drought recovery followed by drought development intensity wr for typical agricultural drought event recovery was estimated under the given expected recovery duration based on the established nonlinear relationship model between wr for drought recovery and drought recovery duration the probability of extreme and severe agricultural drought recovery under the given expected recovery duration and precipitation scenario was estimated based on the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework for example when the cumulative precipitation is no less than its climatological mean within 30 d the probability of recovering from extreme agricultural drought is 0 59 among the four subregions of yrb region ii recovered more easily from agricultural drought whereas the resilience to agricultural drought in region i was the lowest this study proposes a useful framework to analyze agricultural drought recovery from the perspective of the regression model and probabilistic analysis method the wr to recover from the agricultural drought event and the probability of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under the given precipitation conditions were then estimated such knowledge is important for decision makers in water resource management and drought risk assessment although this study mainly focused on agricultural drought recovery in the yrb the developed framework can also be applied to other regions more attempts are needed to quantify the impact of the temporal pattern of precipitation on agricultural drought recovery and estimate wr for different crops to recover from agricultural drought in different seasons credit authorship contribution statement zhengguang xu

2493,agriculture is one of the sectors most directly and severely affected by droughts therefore information regarding the water required wr to recover from agricultural drought and the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios is of great importance for drought risk management in this study we developed a quantitative evaluation method to estimate the wr of agricultural drought event recovery and a probabilistic drought recovery framework based on the copula function to calculate the probabilities of recovery from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios the developed method and framework were demonstrated in the yangtze river basin yrb using the improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi the average duration of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb was 28 d the difference in soil moisture persistence was the main factor affecting the spatial pattern of the grid mean drought recovery characteristics for individual drought events precipitation was the most important factor affecting drought recovery followed by drought development intensity there is a clear nonlinear relationship between the pcp value percentage of cumulative precipitation during drought recovery to its corresponding climatological mean and the drought recovery duration in most grids the three parameter power function can be used to characterize this relationship and further estimate the wr to recover from an agricultural drought event under different expected recovery durations we estimated the probabilities of extreme and severe agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios when the expected recovery durations were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 d based on the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework for example when the cumulative precipitation is no less than its climatological mean within 30 d the probability of recovering from extreme agricultural drought is 0 59 these findings are important for decision making in water and drought management keywords agricultural drought improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index recovery duration water required recovery probability data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as one of the most devastating natural disasters drought often imposes widespread negative impacts on various natural systems and socioeconomic sectors of the affected region ahmadi et al 2019a gibson et al 2020 wu et al 2021a xu et al 2021 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 the evaluation of drought recovery is important for proactive drought management huang et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 wu et al 2021b this is because when drought occurs more information on how long the current drought situation might continue and how much precipitation would be required for drought recovery is valuable for optimizing the water resource management system during drought and effective drought mitigation margariti et al 2019 pan et al 2013 parry et al 2018 wu et al 2021b according to previous studies the drought event lifecycle can be separated into the drought development stage and drought recovery stage by the maximum intensity mi during a drought parry et al 2016a parry et al 2016b wu et al 2020 wu et al 2021a xu et al 2022a drought recovery is often characterized as rapid but may also proceed over monthly to seasonal timescales which means that drought recovery is less predictable than drought onset parry et al 2018 singh et al 2021 wu et al 2021a therefore determining the possible factors affecting drought recovery is essential to improve drought recovery predictions and has attracted increasing attention in recent studies for example parry et al 2016b found that hydrological drought recovery duration is moderately negatively correlated with elevation and catchment average precipitation and both drought recovery duration and recovery rate correlate significantly with drought development duration yang et al 2017 pointed out that the precipitation recovery rate is the dominant factor controlling the recovery of hydrological droughts wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 and xu et al 2022a quantified the impact of human activities on hydrological drought recovery using an observed simulated comparison approach because reservoir regulation is often considered the most dominant human intervention for hydrological drought recovery in these studies and different reservoirs are operated with different scheduling rules the influence of anthropogenic components on the recovery of hydrological drought cannot be generalized and requires a case by case analysis margariti et al 2019 found that groundwater abstractions reservoirs and mixed influences increase the average drought recovery duration whereas water transfer into the catchment decreases the drought recovery duration however these previous studies have mainly focused on identifying factors affecting hydrological drought recovery and factors affecting agricultural drought recovery have not been widely discussed there is a tremendous need to deepen our understanding of the agricultural drought recovery process and its influencing factors as agricultural droughts directly impact crop growth which may lead to reduced agricultural productivity and in the worst case to famines mishra et al 2019 moreover most of these studies were conducted at the basin scale which means that the spatial variation of drought recovery characteristics and its influencing factors may be insufficient to be detected as drought recovery characteristics are spatially heterogeneous parry et al 2016b yao et al 2022 therefore more attempts are needed to improve drought recovery analysis to a finer spatial resolution by introducing grid based data to accurately represent the spatial differences in drought recovery characteristics and their influencing factors apart from the factors affecting drought recovery information on the water required wr for drought recovery is crucial for water resource management and has attracted increasing attention parry et al 2016a antofie et al 2015 computed the precipitation required for drought termination and amelioration for periods of 1 3 and 6 months based on the assumptions of the palmer drought model wu et al 2020 established a linear relationship between runoff and corresponding precipitation to estimate the amount of precipitation required to recover from a certain hydrological drought singh et al 2021 estimated the precipitation required to fill a storage deficit by deriving a linear relationship between precipitation and storage variability huang et al 2021 calculated the drought index value for the next month using the predicted precipitation and then used the predicted precipitation as the water required to terminate a drought if the drought index value for the next month approaches zero the results of these studies are useful for water conservation managers to further optimize the allocation of water resources during droughts however the drought indices of these studies were calculated on a monthly timescale which may be insufficient for accurate identification of the drought recovery process especially in drought events with shorter durations drought recovery characteristics cannot be obtained when drought duration is less than 3 months wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a as heavy rainfall in a short period may terminate drought and drought recovery is usually rapid ahmadi et al 2019b parry et al 2018 parry et al 2016b singh et al 2021 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a therefore more attempts are needed to improve drought recovery identification to a finer temporal resolution by introducing sub monthly drought indices which may help to accurately estimate the wr for drought recovery moreover the likelihood that drought could be recovered under the given precipitation scenario has not been fully elucidated apart from the amount of precipitation the temporal variability of precipitation and other factors can result in large uncertainty in drought recovery therefore the deterministic approach for estimating wr for drought recovery does not provide sufficient information for drought risk assessment pan et al 2013 found significant uncertainty in drought recovery given the same precipitation and suggested introducing probabilistic analysis methods to provide indispensable risk information for drought managers recently several studies have attempted to estimate the climatological probability of receiving the precipitation that needs to end the drought and then take it as the drought recovery probability directly antofie et al 2015 huang et al 2021 which may be unreasonable because the conditional probability derived from the joint probability distribution function established using a copula function is more suitable for representing the likelihood of drought recovery under a given precipitation scenario pan et al 2013 this study aims to 1 determine the potential factors affecting agricultural drought recovery 2 construct a statistical relationship model between wr and drought recovery duration to estimate wr to recover from a certain agricultural drought event and 3 propose a probabilistic drought recovery framework using a copula based joint distribution function to estimate the probabilities of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios as china s main commercial crop base agricultural development in the yangtze river basin yrb is vital for china s food security tian et al 2022 however the increased agricultural drought frequency in the yrb has caused extensive losses in agricultural production and further economic sun et al 2019 quantitative evaluation of the water requirements and the probability of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb are important for proactive drought management therefore the developed model and framework were demonstrated in the drought prone yrb with the improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index ismapi based on the daily soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 0 05 simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic model the results of this study will be helpful for water managers to optimize drought resistant water resources during agricultural droughts 2 methods this section introduces the framework developed fig 1 to estimate wr to recover from a given agricultural drought event and the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios the four main steps in the developed framework are introduced in section 2 1 to section 2 5 2 1 improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index in this study the ismapi proposed by xu et al 2021 was used to characterize agricultural drought the ismapi applicability was well validated in the yrb by xu et al 2021 who found that the ismapi has high reliability for agricultural drought monitoring the ismapi calculation process is summarized as follows non normally distributed soil moisture was transformed into a normally distributed soil moisture series using the box cox transformation 1 s m λ s m λ 1 λ λ 0 ln sm λ 0 where sm and s m λ are the simulated soil moisture and the corresponding value estimated by the box cox transformation respectively and λ is the power exponent of the box cox transformation which was determined using the maximum likelihood method the transformed soil moisture data s m λ are standardized 2 ismapi s m λ s m λ δ s m λ where s m λ and δ s m λ are the mean value and standard deviation of s m λ the drought categories of ismapi are listed in table 1 2 2 identification of agricultural drought events and drought recovery characteristics in this study the run theory was used to identify agricultural drought events from the ismapi series drought duration is defined as the number of consecutive days with ismapi values below 0 5 we used 30 d as the minimum threshold for drought duration to identify drought events moreover two adjacent drought events would be merged into one new drought event if the time interval between these two drought events is less than 5 d wu et al 2015 agricultural drought events can be divided by mi into drought development and recovery stages parry et al 2016a wu et al 2019 compared with the drought development stage the drought recovery stage might last for a short period as heavy rain can end the drought immediately that is mi may occur on the last day of the drought event drought 2 in fig 2 therefore if the last day of a drought event is considered as the last day of the drought recovery stage the recovery characteristics of some drought events cannot be determined in this study the drought recovery duration ddr in fig 2 was defined as the number of days from the mi t2 in fig 2 to a day after drought termination t3 in fig 2 the drought recovery rate rdr refers to the variation rate of the ismapi during the drought recovery stage that is the ratio of the difference between the ismapi values at t3 and t2 in fig 2 to the drought recovery duration the drought recovery intensity idr is the mean value of the ismapi during the drought recovery stage and the drought recovery severity sdr in fig 2 is the total absolute value of the ismapi during the drought recovery stage similarly the drought development duration ddd in fig 2 is defined as the number of days from the beginning of the drought event t1 in fig 2 to mi t2 in fig 2 the drought development intensity idd is the mean value of the ismapi during the drought development stage and the drought development severity sdd in fig 2 is the total absolute value of the ismapi during the drought development period 2 3 identification of factors affecting agricultural drought recovery in this study we selected three drought development characteristics ddd idd and sdd and two meteorological variables pcp and pmt to identify the most significant factors affecting agricultural drought recovery at a grid scale pcp refers to the ratio of cumulative precipitation during drought recovery to its corresponding climatological mean average cumulative precipitation over the same period computed for the period 1979 2020 expressed as a percentage pmt refers to the anomaly percentage of the mean temperature during drought recovery to its corresponding climatological mean average temperature over the same period computed for the period 1979 2020 in addition to the different drought events significant differences were observed in the drought recovery characteristics in different regions therefore factors affecting the spatial distribution of drought recovery characteristics were also identified from 15 alternative climate characteristics soil properties and vegetation parameters including the following the lag correlation coefficient of soil moisture smcc with a lag time of 10 d mean elevation dem quartz content of soil quartz fractional soil moisture content at the critical point wcr fractional soil moisture content at the wilting point wpwp mean annual precipitation p mean annual temperature t mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet aridity index ai coefficient of variation of mean monthly precipitation cv p coefficient of variation of mean monthly temperature cv t coefficient of variation of mean monthly potential evapotranspiration cv pet coefficient of variation of mean monthly aridity index cv ai leaf area index lai and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi pet was estimated using the penman monteith method based on the meteorological data mentioned in section 3 2 it should be noted out that the smcc selected in this study mainly reflects the persistence characteristics of soil moisture xu et al 2021 the smcc with a lag time of 10 d was selected because we found that the lag time did not influence the relationship between soil moisture persistence and drought recovery characteristics the spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to estimate the correlation between drought recovery characteristics and alternative factors and a higher absolute value correlation coefficient with statistically significant indicated that the selected factors might have a significant influence on the target drought recovery characteristics 2 4 determination of water required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event in this study we used the ensemble streamflow prediction method to create an ensemble of meteorological forcing from historical meteorological records day 1985 pan et al 2013 and then used it as inputs to the vic model to obtain the samples of d dr and corresponding pcp we defined wr for agricultural drought recovery as the amount of cumulative precipitation required for agricultural drought to recover to normal ismapi 0 5 for comparative purposes the cumulative precipitation during drought recovery is denoted by the pcp value the procedure for estimating wr to recover from the typical agricultural drought event can be summarized as follows 1 determine the typical agricultural drought event the agricultural drought event with the maximum mi was selected as the typical drought event to facilitate the description we considered the agricultural drought event of the typical grid in region iv as an example to introduce the following steps the mi of this typical drought event occurred on april 6 2011 and there were 3556 days from april 7 2011 the first day of drought recovery to december 31 2020 the last day of the study period 2 construct a forcing data ensemble with 42 members first we sampled exhaustively and uniquely from the 42 year 1979 2020 historical database to create 42 sample sets that is the precipitation data from april 7 of every year to december 31 2020 were all sampled exactly once then a 42 member ensemble with a time series length of 3556 days for each member was created based on the above 42 sample sets specifically for members before 2011 the data for the first 3556 days of the corresponding samples were selected for members after 2011 since the length of the time series of the samples d was less than 3556 days the data of the first d days of the members were from the corresponding samples and the data of the last 3556 d days of the members were supplemented with measured data for example there were 2095 days from april 7 2015 to december 31 2020 and the observed data from january 1 2017 2095 days after april 7 2011 to december 31 2020 were used to extend the sequence of the member to 3556 days 3 generate samples of d dr and the corresponding pcp the vic model was initialized on april 6 2011 and the initial conditions were obtained from xu et al 2022b who ran the vic model continuously with the observed precipitation the 42 member ensemble was input to the vic model to simulate soil moisture from april 7 2011 to december 31 2020 subsequently the ismapi calculated based on the simulated soil moisture was used to determine the d dr and its corresponding pcp value 4 determine the optimal function type between d dr and its corresponding pcp value leave one out cross validation technology was used to determine the optimal function type specifically each sample was taken as the test sample in turn that is this sample was not used for function fitting and the other 41 samples were used to fit the three parameter power and exponential functions pcp value was then estimated using the fitted parameters and d dr of the test sample this process was repeated 42 times and the pcp for drought recovery corresponding to each d dr was estimated the root mean square error rmse between the actual and estimated pcp was calculated and the function type with the smaller rmse was the optimal function type of the target grid 5 determine the parameters of the selected function type using all samples and then use them to estimate wr for agricultural drought recovery 2 5 determination of the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios for a specific agricultural drought grade its corresponding drought index value is not constant but varies in a range which results in large uncertainty in recovering from a specific grade of agricultural drought under given precipitation conditions therefore it is necessary to evaluate the possibility of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation conditions using probability statistics in this study using severe and extreme agricultural droughts as examples we estimated the recovery probability of agricultural drought under different precipitation scenarios by constructing the joint distribution of ismapi value for the last day of expected recovery duration and corresponding pcp using the copula function considering the difference in the occurrence probability of severe and extreme agricultural droughts the sample sizes of the ismapi and pcp values for severe and extreme agricultural droughts in each grid were set to 200 and 100 respectively taking extreme agricultural drought as an example the procedure for constructing the joint distribution of ismapi and pcp values can be summarized as follows 1 obtain ismapi and pcp samples for each grid with expected recovery durations of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 d respectively count the number of ismapi values n not exceeding 2 0 and then select 100 samples from it using the isometric sampling method the dates for these 100 samples were dn n 1 2 99 and 100 determine the ismapi values 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 days after dn and calculate the corresponding pcp values 2 determine the marginal distributions of the ismapi and pcp values commonly used normal logistic generalized extreme value right skewed gumbel and left skewed gumbel distributions were applied to fit the ismapi value the exponential exponentiated weibull gamma log normal and weibull minimum extreme value distributions were applied to fit the pcp values in this study the fitter package https pypi org project fitter in python was used to fit the marginal distribution of the two random variables the aic method in the fitter package is used to determine the best fitted marginal distribution function of the two random variables 3 the joint distribution of the ismapi and pcp values is determined based on the copula function in this study five commonly used copulas from the archimedean family are considered the ali mikhail haq clayton frank gumbel and joe copulas the rmse between the empirical and theoretical values is used for the goodness of fit test of the copula functions and the best fitted copula for each expected recovery duration in each grid cell should have the smallest rmse value once the marginal distributions of the two variables and the best fitted copula function are determined the probability of agricultural drought recovery ismapi 0 5 conditioned on different precipitation scenarios can be estimated based on the bayesian network renard et al 2006 as follows 3 p ismapi 0 5 p cp p 1 0 f p p f i 0 5 c f i 0 5 f p p 1 0 f p p where f i and f p are the marginal cumulative distribution of the ismapi and pcp value f i 0 5 and f p p represents the cumulative probability of ismapi 0 5 and p cp p respectively c f i 0 5 f p p represents the joint cumulative probability of ismapi 0 5 and p cp p based on the conditional probability idea the probability of agricultural drought recovery will be infinitely close to 1 0 with an increase in pcp value in this study the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought was introduced to further explore the resilience to agricultural drought specifically we iterated the pcp value at an interval of 5 0 from 5 0 to 300 0 and the probability of agricultural drought recovery was estimated under different pcp values when the conditional probability is not less than 0 75 the corresponding pcp value is taken as the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought taking the expected recovery duration of 30 d as an example if the recovery probability of extreme agricultural drought is no less than 0 75 when the pcp value is no less than 130 0 this means that the threshold of wr to recover from extreme agricultural drought is 130 0 when the recovery duration is 30 d a higher wr threshold indicates lower resilience to agricultural drought 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the yrb fig 3 is the longest river in asia and the third longest river in the world with a length of approximately 6300 km the yrb has a drainage area of approximately 1 8 106 km2 accounting for 18 8 of china s territory the terrain of the yrb is high in the west and low in the east with complex topography including plateaus mountains hills basins and plains the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in the yrb is significantly uneven precipitation is concentrated mainly from may to october the yrb suffers from frequent drought disasters influenced by complex terrain and a changeable climate the annual occurrence of drought in the yrb was 3 77 times from 1961 to 2015 li et al 2020 the yrb has experienced frequent and severe agricultural droughts in recent years for example in 2018 droughts occurred in the mid lower reaches of the yrb and the area of affected crops reached 7 927 105 ha lu et al 2022 since july 2022 the yrb has been hit by the most severe drought since 1961 at the drought peak on august 25 approximately 4 421 106 ha of cultivated lands in the yrb were affected by the drought xia et al 2022 therefore a comprehensive analysis of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb is crucial for agricultural drought prevention and mitigation strategies in this study the yrb was divided into four hydroclimatic regions according to lang et al 2014 fig 3 3 2 data sources and processing daily soil moisture data with a spatial resolution of 0 05 from 1981 to 2020 were simulated using a well calibrated vic model which was evaluated by xu et al 2022b the meteorological data used in this study include precipitation air temperature sunshine duration pressure specific humidity and wind speed the daily precipitation air temperature and sunshine duration data from 322 meteorological stations fig 3 within and around the yrb provided by the national meteorological science data center https data cma cn were interpolated into a 0 05 spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighted idw method pressure specific humidity and wind speed were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which is a gridded meteorological dataset with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 10 he et al 2020 raw cmfd was downscaled from the original spatial resolution to a 0 05 0 05 resolution using bilinear interpolation the soil property data used in this study were derived from a dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling in china dai et al 2013 lai and ndvi were derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis dataset https modis gsfc nasa gov data 4 results 4 1 spatial patterns of agricultural drought recovery characteristics in the yrb fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of agricultural drought recovery characteristics in the yrb the average ddr of each grid was mostly between 10 and 50 d approximately 96 1 of the total grids with an average ddr of 28 d in the yrb generally the ddr in the east of region ii and west of region iii was shorter than that in other regions the average ddr in regions i ii iii and iv were 35 27 25 and 29 d respectively the spatial distribution of rdr fig 4 b was closely related to that of ddr that is regions with longer ddr often correspond to smaller rdr the average rdr was below 0 50 in approximately 98 1 of the total grids and the rdr did not exceed 0 35 in approximately 86 1 of the total grids the average rdr in regions i ii iii and iv were 0 21 0 26 0 27 and 0 25 respectively the idr was generally concentrated between 1 30 and 0 80 approximately 97 0 of the total grids the spatial distribution pattern of idr gradually strengthens from west to east and the average idr in regions i ii iii and iv were 0 96 0 97 1 02 and 1 04 respectively the spatial distribution of sdr is in good agreement with that of ddr that is regions with a longer ddr often correspond to a greater sdr the sdr was generally concentrated between 10 0 and 70 0 approximately 98 3 of the total grids among the four subregions region i had the largest sdr 39 9 on average followed by region iv 35 9 on average and the sdr in regions ii and iii was the smallest 31 2 and 30 5 on average respectively 4 2 factors affecting agricultural drought recovery 4 2 1 factors affecting the spatial patterns of agricultural drought recovery characteristics as discussed in section 4 1 there are significant differences in the agricultural drought recovery characteristics in different grids therefore we first analyzed the possible reasons for the spatial differences in agricultural drought recovery characteristics as shown in fig 5 the persistence of soil moisture characterized by smcc was positively correlated with ddr idr and sdr whereas negatively correlated with rdr the correlations between smcc and ddr rdr and sdr were significantly higher than those between other potential drivers and these three drought recovery characteristics indicating that differences in soil moisture persistence were the main factor causing the differences in agricultural drought recovery characteristics in different regions generally smcc p ai and cv p were the main factors affecting the ddr and the negative correlation between ddr and p suggests that wetter regions in the yrb tend to experience shorter ddr which is consistent with the results of parry et al 2016b smcc was the main factor affecting the rdr dem cv p and cv ai were the most important factors affecting idr smcc and ai were the most important factors affecting sdr these results indicate that the influence of climate characteristics on the spatial distribution of agricultural drought recovery characteristics is greater than that of the soil properties and vegetation parameters from the results of the four subregions most selected factors had significant influences on the spatial distribution of ddr rdr and sdr in region i whereas smcc was the dominant factor affecting the spatial distribution of these agricultural drought recovery characteristics in regions iii and iv the factors affecting the spatial distribution of idr vary significantly in the four subregions and p was the dominant factor affecting the spatial distribution of idr in region i the spatial distribution of idr in regions ii and iii was mainly related to cv p and cv ai whereas the correlations between idr and all alternative factors in region iv were weaker than that in other regions 4 2 2 factors affecting the recovery characteristics of agricultural drought events fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the agricultural drought development characteristics and agricultural drought recovery characteristics no significant correlations were observed between agricultural drought recovery characteristics and ddd in most grids fig 6 a1 a4 indicating ddd had little influence on agricultural drought recovery characteristics only in 47 4 of the total grids fig 6 b1 was there a significant negative correlation between ddr and idd which indicates that the smaller the idd the more severe the agricultural drought event the longer the time required for drought recovery in these grids there was no significant correlation between idd and rdr fig 6 b2 indicating that idd was not the main factor affecting rdr there was a significant positive correlation between the idr and idd in 96 1 of the grids the significance of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between these two variables was not greater than 0 05 and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 64 fig 6 b3 these results indicate that agricultural drought events with severe intensity during drought development are also expected to have severe drought intensity during drought recovery in approximately 76 1 of the total grids there was a significant negative correlation between the sdr and idd fig 6 b4 generally sdd has little impact on ddr rdr and sdr whereas in approximately 48 0 of the total grids sdd has a significant negative correlation with idr fig 6 c3 the above results show that agricultural drought development characteristics have little impact on the rdr and the idd is the main factor affecting the idr it should be noted that idd is closely related to mi and the relationships between mi and the four agricultural drought recovery characteristics are similar to those between idd and agricultural drought recovery characteristics therefore the relationships between the mi and agricultural drought recovery characteristics are not presented here there was a significant correlation between pcp and drought recovery characteristics in most grids fig 7 a1 a4 in approximately 94 2 of the total grids pcp had a significant negative correlation with ddr and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 76 indicating that the greater the pcp the shorter the ddr of the agricultural drought event in approximately 91 8 of the total grids there was a significant positive correlation between pcp and rdr and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 71 indicating that the greater the pcp the faster the agricultural drought recovery in only 58 5 of the total grids there was a significant positive correlation between pcp and idr with an average spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0 51 in 93 8 of the total grids pcp had a significant negative correlation with sdr and the average spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0 74 indicating that the smaller the pcp the more severe the agricultural drought in the recovery stage these results indicate that precipitation during drought recovery is the primary factor affecting drought recovery which is consistent with the results of yang et al 2017 there was no significant correlation between the pmt and the drought recovery characteristics in most grids the reason for this may be related to the fact that temperature indirectly affects agricultural drought evolution through evapotranspiration however the actual evapotranspiration during drought recovery may be limited by the soil moisture deficit and soil water supplemented by precipitation is significantly higher than the soil water consumed by evapotranspiration during drought recovery which results in the temperature is not the main factor affecting agricultural drought recovery 4 3 water required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event according to the results in section 4 2 pcp is the most important factor affecting ddr followed by idd or mi during drought therefore for a certain agricultural drought event we can only consider the impact of pcp on the ddr that is wr denoted by the pcp value to recover from a certain agricultural drought event can be estimated by establishing quantitative relationships between ddr and pcp values based on the method described in section 2 4 we obtained samples of the ddr and the corresponding pcp values for each grid fig 8 presents the spatial distribution of the optimal fitted function type and the corresponding goodness of fit of ddr and pcp required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event the three parameter power function performed better than the three parameter exponential function in reflecting the relationship between pcp and ddr specifically in 72 9 of the total grids the optimal function type was the power function from the results of the goodness of fit the r2 values in 99 5 of total grids were greater than or equal to 0 50 and the mean r2 in the yrb was 0 92 indicating that the fitted power function or exponential function in this study can be used to estimate the pcp required to recover from the typical agricultural drought event under a given expected recovery duration considering that the occurrence time and mi for the selected typical agricultural drought event vary with grids the spatial difference in wr to recover from the selected typical agricultural drought event is not discussed here to further validate the proposed method we randomly selected a grid in each subregion of the yrb the longitude and latitude of the grid center in region i are 99 175 e and 29 225 n longitude and latitude of the grid center in region ii are 105 775 e and 31 725 n longitude and latitude of the grid center in region iii are 113 075 e and 31 175 n and the longitude and latitude of the grid center in region iv are 116 525 e and 27 725 n fig 3 to compare the observed and estimated pcp required to recover from the typical agricultural drought fig 9 the observed pcp was determined by the actual drought recovery process and the estimated pcp was calculated based on the fitted curve equation the actual ddr and corresponding pcp were excluded when fitting the cure equation and the actual ddr there is a good nonlinear relationship between the ddr and pcp values when the ddr was short the pcp required for drought recovery decreased rapidly with an increase in the ddr after the ddr increases to a certain value the pcp required for drought recovery changes little with the ddr as shown in fig 9 the relationship between ddr and pcp required for drought recovery in the four typical grids can be expressed by a power function and their r2 ranges from 0 91 to 0 98 the estimated pcp values blue dots in fig 9 for the typical agricultural drought recovery were in good agreement with the observations red dots in fig 9 based on the fitted curve equation the wr to recover from the typical agricultural drought event can be estimated under the given expected recovery duration taking the typical grid in region i fig 9 a as an example when the expected recovery duration was 10 d the pcp value to recover from the typical agricultural drought event was approximately 230 2 of the precipitation during the same period and when the expected recovery duration was 60 d the pcp value for drought recovery was approximately 85 4 of the precipitation during the same period it is worth noting that the climatological mean of the cumulative precipitation increases with the expected recovery duration that is the decrease in wr characterized by the pcp value does not mean a decrease in the actual amount of precipitation required for agricultural drought recovery 4 4 probabilities of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios the significant correlation between the ismapi and pcp values is a prerequisite for constructing a joint distribution of the two variables using the copula function and for further estimating the probabilities of agricultural drought recovery conditioned on different precipitation scenarios in this study we focused on the probabilities of agricultural drought recovery conditioned on different precipitation scenarios when the expected recovery durations were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 d thus there are six pairs of ismapi and pcp samples in each grid for a specific grade of agricultural drought only grids that met the significance level of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between at least four pairs of ismapi and pcp samples no greater than 0 05 were selected to analyze the probabilities of agricultural drought recovery conditioned on different precipitation scenarios for extreme and severe agricultural droughts approximately 96 8 and 99 8 of the grids respectively met this restriction due to space limitations the results of severe agricultural drought recovery are presented in the supplementary materials based on the joint distribution of ismapi and pcp values the probabilities of extreme severe agricultural drought recovery were estimated with the pcp values ranging from 0 0 to 300 0 at a step size of 5 0 i e pcp values of 0 0 5 0 295 0 and 300 0 fig 10 and fig s1 present the regional average probability of recovering from extreme and severe agricultural droughts under multiple expected recovery durations and precipitation scenarios as well as the climatological probability of receiving the corresponding precipitation meanwhile taking the expected recovery duration is 30 d as an example fig 11 and fig s2 present the spatial distribution of the probability of recovering from extreme and severe agricultural droughts when the pcp is greater than or equal to 50 0 75 0 100 0 125 0 and 150 0 as well as the climatological probability of receiving the corresponding cumulative precipitation generally the probability of agricultural drought recovery increases with pcp for example when the expected recovery duration is 30 d and the pcp is no less than 50 0 75 0 100 0 125 0 and 150 0 the probabilities of recovering from extreme agricultural drought are 0 43 0 51 0 59 0 65 and 0 70 respectively overall the probability of agricultural drought recovery increased with the expected drought recovery duration conditioned on the same precipitation scenario for example the probabilities of extreme agricultural recovery are 0 51 and 0 62 when the pcp is no less than 75 0 and the expected recovery durations are 30 and 60 d respectively this is because the pcp rather than the amount of precipitation was used in our developed probabilistic framework and the climatological mean of the cumulative precipitation increased with the expected recovery duration when the pcp value was fixed however it is worth noting that under some precipitation scenarios the drought recovery probabilities when the expected recovery duration is 50 d may even be slightly higher than that when the expected recovery duration is 60 d which may be because the temporal pattern of precipitation was not considered in this study and the influence of the initial soil moisture condition is diminished with the increase in the expected recovery duration pan et al 2013 finally the probability of recovery from severe agricultural drought was higher than that from extreme agricultural drought conditioned on the same expected recovery duration and pcp value for example the probability of recovering from severe and extreme agricultural drought is 0 55 and 0 43 respectively when the pcp is greater than or equal to 50 0 and the expected recovery duration is 30 d fig 11 and fig s2 this is because the shortage of soil moisture under extreme drought is more critical than that under severe drought and more precipitation is required to recover from extreme agricultural drought these results are in line with our understanding of drought recovery and further prove that the probabilistic framework developed in this study is reliable for estimating the probability of agricultural drought recovery under different precipitation scenarios with an increase in pcp value the climatological probability of receiving the corresponding precipitation gradually decreased for example the climatological probabilities that the pcp value in the next 30 d is greater than or equal to 50 0 75 0 100 0 125 0 and 150 0 are 0 68 0 51 0 36 0 25 and 0 17 respectively fig 11 these results indicate that sometimes it is less likely to obtain the precipitation required for drought recovery under natural conditions and in this situation considering irrigation and other measures to supplement soil moisture will contribute to rapid recovery from agricultural drought the agricultural drought recovery probability has clear regional differences conditioned on the same precipitation scenario and expected recovery duration generally the possibility of drought recovery in region ii was higher than that in the other regions whereas region i had the overall least possibility of recovery from agricultural drought however regions with the least possibility of drought recovery may change with the precipitation scenario and the expected recovery duration for example the average recovery probability in region iv is comparable to or even less than that in region i when the expected recovery duration is greater than 30 d and a lower pcp value regional differences in drought recovery probability may be related to differences in the climatic characteristics of different subregions the average precipitation in region i was the lowest among the four regions that is the amount of precipitation in region i conditioned on the same pcp value was lower than in other regions which may be the reason for the overall least probability of recovery from agricultural drought in region i there was more precipitation in region ii than in region i to supplement the soil moisture conditioned on the same precipitation scenario therefore the probability of drought recovery in region ii was higher than that in region i the average precipitation in region iv was the largest among the four subregions that is the amount of precipitation in region iv was larger than that in other regions conditioned on the same precipitation scenario when the expected recovery duration was short e g 10 and 20 d and the pcp value was small the amount of precipitation in region iv was higher than that in other regions therefore the possibility of drought recovery in region iv was higher than that in other regions the amount of precipitation in the four subregions increased with the expected recovery duration conditioned on the same pcp value however water loss caused by evapotranspiration in region iv was significantly larger than that in other regions with an increase in expected recovery duration resulting in a lower drought recovery probability in region iv under the condition of longer expected recovery duration and smaller pcp value when the pcp value was relatively large the amount of precipitation in different regions was also large however the evapotranspiration in regions iii and iv was significantly higher than that in region ii and the supplemented soil moisture by the temporarily alleviated precipitation during drought recovery may have been rapidly lost in the form of evapotranspiration resulting in the drought recovery probability in region ii being higher than that in regions iii and iv 4 5 threshold of water required to recover from agricultural drought fig 12 and fig s3 present the spatial distribution of the wr threshold to recover from extreme and severe agricultural droughts under different expected recovery durations generally the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought gradually decreased with an increase in the expected recovery duration for example the average thresholds of wr to recover from extreme agricultural drought are 211 4 and 103 1 when the expected recovery durations are 10 d and 60 d respectively it is worth noting that the pcp value was used in this study to characterize the threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought and the climatological mean of cumulative precipitation increases with the expected recovery duration that is a decrease in the threshold of wr characterized by the pcp value does not mean a decrease of in the actual amount of precipitation required the wr for extreme agricultural drought is higher than that for severe agricultural drought that is the precipitation required for drought recovery increases with drought severity which is consistent with previous studies antofie et al 2015 huang et al 2021 there are some grids except for some grids that are not included in the calculation mentioned in section 4 4 in the yrb that do not have a wr threshold to recover from agricultural drought which indicates that these grids have a probability of less than 0 75 to recover from agricultural drought conditioned on the given precipitation scenario the case of this phenomenon first depends on the predefined conditional probability 0 75 and maximum pcp value 300 0 with a decrease in the predefined conditional probability or an increase in the maximum pcp value the number of grids with a wr threshold is expected to increase additionally the probability of drought recovery calculated in this study is an average probability of agricultural drought recovery under given conditions therefore there may be some grids whose probability of drought recovery cannot reach the predefined conditional probability that is there is no wr threshold in these grids possible reasons for this result may include the following first extreme severe agricultural drought is defined as ismapi 2 0 1 5 ismapi 2 0 so multiple different ismapi values may be selected when determining the extreme severe agricultural drought samples taking extreme drought as an example ismapi equal to 2 0 and 3 5 correspond to extreme drought but the probabilities of recovering from the two extreme agricultural droughts may be differently conditioned on the same expected recovery duration and pcp value second only pcp values were considered in calculating the recovery probability the temporal pattern of precipitation which also affects the possibility of agricultural drought recovery pan et al 2013 wu et al 2020 was not considered in this study for example assuming that the pcp value in the next 30 d is 90 0 the recovery probability will be significantly different when all precipitation in the next 30 d occurs in the first 5 d and the last 5 d finally the samples selected in section 2 5 may be distributed in all four seasons and the recovery probability under the same conditions may vary with seasons due to the seasonal variations of climatic conditions antofie et al 2015 parry et al 2016b table 2 and table s1 summarize the average thresholds of wr to recover from extreme and severe agricultural drought and the percentages of grids with a threshold of drought recovery in the yrb and its four subregions the number of grids without a wr threshold increases significantly with a decrease in the expected recovery duration indicating the improbability of recovering from agricultural drought in a short period antofie et al 2015 the number of grids with a recovery threshold for severe agricultural drought was greater than that for extreme agricultural drought under the same expected recovery duration for example when the expected recovery duration was 10 d the percentage of grids with a wr threshold for extreme and severe agricultural droughts was approximately 43 4 and 56 2 respectively among the four subregions the percentage of grids with a wr threshold in region ii was generally higher than that in other regions and the average wr threshold in region ii was less than that in other regions indicating that it is easier to recover from agricultural drought in region ii than in other regions however the percentage of grids with a wr threshold in region i was lower than that in other regions except for the results when the expected recovery duration was 10 d indicating that there were more grids in region i with a wr threshold exceeding 300 0 and the agricultural drought resilience in region i was the lowest 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with previous studies information on wr for drought event recovery and the probability of recovery from different grades of drought under given precipitation scenarios could be useful in decisions concerning water resource management antofie et al 2015 in this study we developed a quantitative evaluation method to estimate wr to recover from agricultural drought events and a probabilistic drought recovery framework using a copula based joint distribution function to calculate the probability of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation scenarios although we focused on recovery from agricultural drought in the yrb the developed quantitative evaluation method and probabilistic drought recovery framework are flexible for application to other regions worldwide or other types of drought in this study we analyzed the quantitative relationship between wr and expected recovery duration we can use the developed quantitative evaluation method to predict the wr of agricultural drought recovery by establishing a nonlinear relationship model between ddr and the corresponding pcp value estimated using historical meteorological records note that the wr prediction here is performed under any user given expected recovery duration which may be inconsistent with the actual wr for a specific agricultural drought recovery as the actual ddr is unavailable moreover the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework can be used to calculate the probability of drought mitigation over a defined period this study for the first time used simulated soil moisture to determine the agricultural drought recovery duration at a finer spatiotemporal resolution 0 05 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution significant divergences in agricultural drought recovery characteristics occurred between different regions fig 4 indicating significant differences in the drought resilience of different regions this highlights the importance of identifying drought recovery characteristics at finer spatial resolutions the agricultural drought recovery duration obtained in this study the average ddr in the yrb was 28 days was shorter than that estimated by previous studies that determined the drought recovery duration on a monthly timescale wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021b yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 considering that drought recovery is often characterized as rapid ahmadi et al 2019b parry et al 2018 parry et al 2016b singh et al 2021 wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021a improving the drought recovery identification to a finer temporal resolution by introducing sub monthly drought indices may help to accurately estimate drought recovery characteristics our results suggest that grids in the yrb with high ai values have a long ddr fig 5 indicating that grids with relatively high excess rainfall are more easily recovered from agricultural drought however zhang et al 2019 found that the hydrological drought recovery time for eight tributaries of the yrb based on downscaled gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data was positively correlated with the climate moisture index cmi reciprocal of ai the disagreement between the results of the two studies may be because the former focused on the soil moisture recovery whereas the latter focused on the total water storage recovery and tributaries of the yrb with high cmi typically have a relatively high surface subsurface storage and more water is needed for the water storage deficit to recover to normal once hydrological droughts occur moreover this disagreement highlights the importance of identifying and comparing the factors that affect recovery from different types of droughts however our findings are generally consistent with those of the previous studies for example for grid mean drought recovery characteristics fig 5 we found that ddr is positively correlated with smcc meaning that grids with high smcc large soil moisture memory have a slower drought recovery speed this result agrees well with that of xu et al 2022a who found that the baseflow index a key variable representing catchment memory presented a significant positive correlation with the hydrological drought recovery duration moreover both this study and parry et al 2016b found that ddr is negatively correlated with the mean average precipitation precipitation during drought recovery is the most important factor affecting drought recovery for individual drought events fig 6 and fig 7 which has also been demonstrated in previous studies antofie et al 2015 wu et al 2020 among the four subregions of yrb region ii is easier to recover from agricultural drought whereas the resilience to agricultural drought in region i is the lowest this result agrees well with the findings of huang et al 2021 who explored the meteorological drought recovery patterns in the yrb the overall relatively low probabilities for drought recovery in region i could be partly related to the low precipitation in this region leading to the soil moisture deficit having a lesser chance to return to normal conditions than that in other subregions under the same pcp value 5 2 limitations and future study the approach developed in this study is based on a well calibrated vic model by xu et al 2022b according to the results of xu et al 2022b the vic model performs well in simulating soil moisture in the yrb and the accuracy of the simulated soil moisture can satisfy the requirements of this study and the results of this study are reliable however any study using a hydrological model is associated with uncertainties and simulation uncertainty affects the identification results of drought recovery margariti et al 2019 wang et al 2020 therefore more efforts should be made in future research to improve the accuracy of the simulation results to reduce the uncertainty of drought recovery identification considering that cumulative precipitation during drought recovery is the main driver for drought recovery fig 7 we developed a probabilistic drought recovery framework based on the joint distribution between the ismapi and pcp values and then estimated the probability of recovering from different grades of agricultural droughts under given precipitation scenarios which can provide indispensable risk information for drought managers however we found that some grids do not have a threshold of wr to recover from agricultural drought fig 12 one of the reasons for this result may be that only the amount of precipitation during drought recovery was considered in this study the timing of precipitation and precipitation intensity are certainly related to drought recovery pan et al 2013 wu et al 2020 and quantification of the impact of the temporal pattern of precipitation on drought recovery requires further research finally we evaluated agricultural drought recovery based on the ismapi assuming that agricultural drought recovery was complete once the soil moisture deficit was relieved ismapi 0 5 however the return of precipitation or soil moisture is not necessarily sufficient for complete ecosystem recovery parry et al 2016a crops may experience water deficits at various stages of their growth cycle and the water required for different crops to recover from agricultural drought may vary in different regions and seasons therefore more attempts are needed to identify agricultural drought recovery and to estimate the water required to recover from agricultural drought by considering the recovery of crop growth and ecosystem production 6 conclusions in this study we developed a useful framework to estimate the water required wr to recover from a typical agricultural drought event and the probability of recovery from different grades of agricultural drought under given precipitation conditions the developed framework was tested in the drought prone yangtze river basin yrb we found that the average duration of agricultural drought recovery in the yrb is 28 d precipitation during drought recovery was the most important factor affecting agricultural drought recovery followed by drought development intensity wr for typical agricultural drought event recovery was estimated under the given expected recovery duration based on the established nonlinear relationship model between wr for drought recovery and drought recovery duration the probability of extreme and severe agricultural drought recovery under the given expected recovery duration and precipitation scenario was estimated based on the developed probabilistic drought recovery framework for example when the cumulative precipitation is no less than its climatological mean within 30 d the probability of recovering from extreme agricultural drought is 0 59 among the four subregions of yrb region ii recovered more easily from agricultural drought whereas the resilience to agricultural drought in region i was the lowest this study proposes a useful framework to analyze agricultural drought recovery from the perspective of the regression model and probabilistic analysis method the wr to recover from the agricultural drought event and the probability of recovering from different grades of agricultural drought under the given precipitation conditions were then estimated such knowledge is important for decision makers in water resource management and drought risk assessment although this study mainly focused on agricultural drought recovery in the yrb the developed framework can also be applied to other regions more attempts are needed to quantify the impact of the temporal pattern of precipitation on agricultural drought recovery and estimate wr for different crops to recover from agricultural drought in different seasons credit authorship contribution statement zhengguang xu

2494,monitoring flood dynamics is important to provide optimal flood mitigation practices and understand their hydrological responses recently applications of travel time principles have gained a growing interest in hydrological research and river engineering in this study flood dynamics were monitored using the fluvial acoustic tomography system fat based on travel time principles the primary objective of this study is to continuously measure the mean cross sectional velocity river flow direction and river discharge using an innovative tomographic system during two flood events in this regard three fat systems were placed in a gravel bed stream forming a triangle shape to measure stream velocity along two cross sections by investigating the magnitude of the cross sectional mean velocity vectors and the cross sectional areas we proposed new equations to evaluate the expected flow direction the performance of flow measurement by the fat system was verified with another reference record importantly we demonstrated that the minimum number of acoustic stations to determine river flow direction in unidirectional streams can be reduced to three stations which can be more practical and easier further one of the novel aspects of this study is offering new guidelines to continuously estimate flow direction using a triangular distribution of tomographic systems in general this study presents a promising method for monitoring flow dynamics in rivers keywords velocity flow direction flow underwater acoustic tomography travel time data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate measurement of streams such as unidirectional and bidirectional has been a great challenge faced by hydrologists and water resources engineers for many years in addition continuous and long term monitoring of reliable status of river dynamics is essential to provide best operation and management plans of water resources systems understand their hydrological processes and minimize the effects of related climate extremes hannah et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2017 worldwide extensive endeavors have been made to compute river flow continuously using various methods despite the latest developments in river monitoring methods and applications determination of stream velocity remains a challenging task particularly in gravel bed rivers due to several reasons including uneven river bed shape complex bathymetries and high flow resistance fujita et al 2007 holmes jr 2016 kawanisi et al 2016 2015 mihailović et al 2014 sawaf et al 2021 in practice at a stream gauging station streamflow is mainly derived using stage discharge relationships rantz 1982 by calibrating river discharge readings obtained from some direct observations with stage records long term investigations and assessments were conducted to correct discharge estimation acquired by the rating curves and decrease the related uncertainties bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 holmes jr 2016 jalbert et al 2011 mansanarez et al 2016 recently the index velocity method has been emerged as another advanced approach that is increasingly used as an alternative to the rating curves to acquire continuous streamflow records specifically at river stations with notable rating complexity holmes jr 2016 kawanisi et al 2018 levesque and oberg 2012 in this method river flow at a specific site can be estimated by finding empirical relationships between two main ratings namely average stream velocity and cross sectional area as a function of stream stage levesque and oberg 2012 river discharge estimation using the index velocity method is still an active research topic cheng et al 2019 in this regard cheng et al 2019 investigated the performance of the rating curves and the index velocity approach to estimate the discharge in the snake river idaho usa within complex flow situations their findings demonstrate that the discharge estimated by the index velocity method performed better during unsteady flows in contrast to the rating curves estimates commonly stream average velocity is measured by means of the acoustic doppler current profilers adcps kästner et al 2018 levesque and oberg 2012 although adcps offer great benefits over other traditional instruments approaches there exist some limitations that constrain the functionality and efficiency of applying adcps in riverine applications effectively for example the major limitations of measurements using moving boats adcp are i imprecise under very turbulent environment as a result of boat instability malcolm et al 2008 ii direct measurement is not safe in case of extreme weather and hydrological conditions hence peak hydrograph cannot be easily captured kawanisi et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 and iii accurate measurement necessitates significant time and experienced hands williams et al 2015 another option to obtain accurate cross sectional average velocity is to use the horizontal acoustic doppler profiler h adcp that measures water currents and flow structures fixed at a single depth horizontally from its mounting structure nonetheless the main limitation is the maximum range that can be covered up to 200 m approximately besides the measurement accuracy of the adcp goes down as the concentration of suspended sediment increases wall et al 2006 similarly multi deployment of one point nodal sensors e g vertical acoustic doppler profiler current meters along a stream cross section may achieve desirable measurements nevertheless the main limitation of this measurement style resides in restricting high number of stream related activities such as fishing and transportation al sawaf et al 2022 in terms of underwater acoustic measurements the most popular utilized method is the doppler shift method i e adcps where sound rays are emitted along or diagonal to a streamline and the frequency shift in the backscattered signal is measured alternatively the only rival approach to the doppler shift is the travel time method where reciprocal sound rays are transmitted and received along a specific cross section in both directions at certain times laenen and smith 1982 initially applications of the travel time approach in underwater acoustics were restricted in oceanography and coastal research using the ocean acoustic tomography oat and the coastal acoustic tomography cat systems the aforementioned systems were used to perform several applications including monitoring subsurface velocity and temperature structures in the open ocean dushaw and colosi 1998 munk and wunsch 1979 and mapping both 2d and 3d structures of sound speeds and sea currents hanifa et al 2020 kaneko et al 2020 park and kaneko 2000 however in recent years applications of travel time approach have received a growing interest in river engineering and hydrological research the fluvial acoustic tomography system fat system was made and developed as an advanced technology to extend the applications of reciprocal sound transmission in shallower water bodies compared to oceans and seas such as rivers and estuaries previous works used the fat system had studied and investigated various hydrological topics including high quality monitoring of river discharge danial et al 2019 kawanisi et al 2018 dam flush characteristics al sawaf and kawanisi 2019 reconstructing 2d currents and salinity profiles in a tidal junction xiao et al 2021 and monitoring dam lake dynamics al sawaf et al 2022 one of the most interesting and important applications of travel time principles using the fat is determination of flow direction estimation of streamflow direction using travel time principles was investigated by sloat and gain 1995 and bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 these works mainly proposed a cross path configuration to estimate flow direction while bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 estimated flow direction in a unidirectional stream al sawaf et al 2022 fully discussed flow direction computation in a dam lake by dividing the cross path formed by two acoustic lines into four quadrants and examining the time difference between each pair of transducers another method to estimate flow direction using the travel time approach was proposed by sloat and gain 1995 is the multi sectional paths that employed more than four acoustic stations in light of the foregoing the primary gap of previous works was lack of studies focusing on effective utilization of travel time principles in flow direction estimation and streamflow monitoring in other words past studies sought to estimate flow direction carried out using a set of four tomographic systems or more bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 xiao et al 2021 which can be impractical in long term applications however there is no work indicated the minimum number of acoustic stations required to estimate flow direction particularly during flood events hence the purpose of this study is to shed light on continuous monitoring of streamflow direction as well as river discharge using an innovative underwater acoustic tomography system the key questions of this research are i how travel time principles can advance the estimation of river flow compared to other current approaches and ii what is the minimum number of acoustic stations needed to estimate flow direction according to travel time principles the major contribution of this research is to provide a first guideline on flow direction estimation in unsteady rivers using a triangular distribution of underwater acoustic tomography systems another important contribution is to move a step forward advancing river flow measurement in open channels using the direct approach in other words continuous measurement of river flow in this study will be considered using three basic terms i river cross sectional area as a function of stream level ii mean average velocity and iii flow direction the following points highlight the key novelties of this research i flow direction is estimated based on travel time principles using a triangular configuration of underwater acoustic transducers and ii two different types of acoustic transducers were used in this work that is to say one pair of broadband transducers that transmit cylindrical beam pattern of sound rays and another broadband transducer transmits hemispherical beam pattern of sound rays which reflect another technical novelty of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation site observations were carried out in the gōno river located in hiroshima prefecture japan fig 1 the stream region is characterized by a tepid weather with a mean annual temperature of 12 c the river mainstream flows through hiroshima and shimane prefectures the river basin area is 3900 km2 and it has a channel length of 194 km the main tributaries of the gōno river i e basen and saijō rivers are unified 2 7 km upstream of the monitoring location fig 1a the river channel at the study site is classified as a shallow gravel bed river with bed slope as 0 11 using the records of the cross sectional average velocity hydraulic radius and water surface slope hydraulic grade line the roughness coefficient for the observation site according to the gauckler manning formula was estimated as 0 03 illustration of the tomographic measurement of river flow using the fat system is shown in fig 1b a set of three fat systems forming a triangle shape were deployed at the river site as can be seen one of the systems was installed at the upstream location of the river in the left bank i e p1 station while the other remaining systems were deployed at the downstream location to the right bank i e p2 and p3 stations in the case of p1 p2 stations we used broadband transducers that transmit a cylindrical beam pattern of sound rays with a resonant frequency of 58 khz fig 2 a alternatively in the case of p3 station the fat system was operated using a transducer that transmit a hemispherical beam pattern of sound rays with a resonant frequency of 54 khz fig 2a fig 2a shows the fat system logger and the two different types of the used transducers in this observation in addition fig 2 b c presents the installation of the fat system in the river site moreover fig 2d reveals our effort in fixing the transducer cable in the river site in such a way to be protected from being washed out due to potential massive floods fig 2e sketches the primary configuration of the fat system to obtain the mean water level records three water pressure loggers hobo level temperature logger were attached to each transducer at p1 p2 and p3 and configured to acquire data at 5 min intervals bed topography survey along p1 p2 and p1 p3 was achieved using a boat armed with a single beam echo sounder coden boat rc s3 hence the cross sectional area along p1 p2 and p1 p3 can be estimated by integrating the elevation of the riverbed with the mean water level records observed by the water pressure loggers at p1 p2 and p1 p3 respectively to ensure high precision of the stations position their locations were defined using high precision gps gnss real time kinematic rtk with a resolution of 5 cm it should be noted that there was no salinity effect in the observation area moreover temperature variation along the water column was minimal hence double or multi layer phenomenon due to salinity or temperature variation was not emerged table 1 summarizes the main features of the experiment configuration and setups further insights regarding streamflow measurement by fat and flow angle determination are presented in the following sections 2 2 river flow measurement based on the travel time principles by means of travel time method sound speed c 1 and the corresponding cross sectional mean velocity u 1 along the transmission section p1 p2 can be estimated by the fat system to illustrate the travel time is the time elapsed by an acoustic signal triggered from a transducer to a defined receiver s thus in the case of a couple of transducers e g p1 and p2 the acquired travel times t p 1 t p 2 the triggered acoustic pulse from the transducer at p1 station to the transducer at p2 station and vice versa are used to compute the sound speed and cross sectional mean velocity along the transmission path p1 p2 as follows 1 c 1 l 1 2 1 t p 1 1 t p 2 2 u 1 l 1 2 1 t p 1 1 t p 2 where l1 is the horizontal distance between p1 and p2 hence river flow using the fat can be evaluated as 3 q fat u 1 a 1 t a n α 1 a 1 is the area along p1 p2 and α 1 is the angle between acoustic path p1 p2 and streamflow direction 2 3 estimation of streamflow direction based on travel time principles using a triangular tomographic scheme one of the novel aspects of this study is offering new guidelines to estimate river flow direction using a triangular tomographic scheme fig 3 presents a flowchart that outlines the estimation process of river flow direction using a triangular tomographic scheme at the beginning it is very important to point out that the estimation process was accomplished based on the assumption that there is no difference in the measured river flow passing through both cross sections i e p1 p2 p1 p3 or it should be very trivial so that it can be neglected and hence flow continuity principle is valid in other words river discharge passing through p1 p2 q p 1 p 2 and p1 p3 q p 1 p 3 are equal and therefore 4 q p 1 p 2 q p 1 p 3 5 u 1 a 1 tan α 1 u 2 a 2 t a n α 2 where u 2 a 2 are the cross sectional mean velocity and area along p1 p3 respectively and α 2 is the angle between the acoustic path p1 p3 and streamflow direction the first step as shown in fig 3 is to determine the planer angle ϕ between the lines from p1 through p2 and p3 as shown in fig 4 in this study the planer angle was estimated using the distances among the gps coordinates obtained at p1 p2 and p3 the second step is to estimate flow direction domain in fact the flow in the gōno river is unidirectional thus the expectation is that the flow direction will be from upstream to the downstream and both velocity vectors u 1 u 2 fig 1 are positive accordingly the flow domain should be in the intersection zone of both transmission line axes more specifically the intersection of the first and second quadrants q1 q2 of x y a b as illustrated in fig 4a because river flow through q3 q4 is negative hence the flow domain in this case equals to 180 2 ϕ and four cases can be distinguished as presented in fig 4 at each time step t i the instantaneous flow angles α 1 α 2 can be computed by examining the status of the velocity vectors u 1 u 2 and cross sectional areas a 1 a 2 first the estimation process must be started by verifying whether the flow domain is in the direction of case i or not because the flow is likely to be in this direction as illustrated in fig 3 and fig 4b in this case flow direction along p1 p2 and p1 p3 can be expressed as α 1 ϕ α 2 by substituting in eq 5 flow angle α 2 can be expressed as shown in eq 6 6 α 2 tan 1 u 1 a 1 u 2 a 2 tan ϕ α 2 an iteration solving approach is needed to estimate α 2 thus eq 6 can be rewritten as follows 7 α 2 c o s 1 1 2 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 u 1 3 a 2 u 2 c o s 2 ϕ a 2 u 2 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 it is essential to emphasize that case i is valid whenever u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 1 alternatively if the aforementioned condition is not valid then the next step is to verify if the condition of case ii is applicable as illustrated in fig 4c in this case flow direction is valid if u 2 u 1 a 2 a 1 1 and therefore the flow direction can be expressed as α 1 ϕ α 2 thus substituting in eq 5 8 α 2 tan 1 u 1 a 1 u 2 a 2 tan ϕ α 2 and the iterative solution of eq 8 is given in eq 9 9 α 2 c o s 1 1 2 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 u 1 3 a 2 u 2 c o s 2 ϕ a 2 u 2 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 on the other hand if the condition of case ii is not valid the next step is to confirm the condition of case 3 as u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 1 the flow direction in this case can be expressed by α 2 ϕ α 1 see case iii fig 4d accordingly 10 α 1 tan 1 u 1 a 1 u 2 a 2 tan ϕ α 1 and the iterative solution of eq 10 is 11 α 1 c o s 1 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 u 1 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ a 2 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 the last case is case iv illustrated in fig 4e this case is valid when u 2 u 1 a 2 a 1 1 and one can write 12 α 1 tan 1 u 2 a 2 u 1 a 1 tan ϕ α 1 13 α 1 c o s 1 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 u 1 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ a 2 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 3 results we observed two flood events the first event started from 2022 03 12 to 2022 03 18 whereas the second event started from 2022 03 26 to 2022 03 31 for the present study river flow using a triangular distribution of fat systems was conducted to continuously monitor and compute the cross sectional average velocity streamflow direction and discharge fig 5 a b presents the records of the cross sectional mean velocity along p1 p2 and p1 p3 sections as well as the records of the water level for both events of importance in the current context the cross sectional velocity along p1 p3 black was greater than the velocity along p1 p2 blue furthermore both velocity records were totally positive apparently a stable behavior of velocity difference purple can be noticed during baseflow and can be estimated as 0 18 0 2 m s moreover it shows a sharp peak at the beginning of the flood event however after the first peak recedes the velocity difference increases gradually and peaks after two days again then dropped down and turned back as it was during the baseflow discontinuities in the velocity records along p1 p2 blue line occurred due to the intermittent loss of the gps time signals in fact the fat system logger at p2 station was mounted to a nearby tree in such a way that the system was protected from wild animals sabotage and hence the gps antenna was not appropriately exposed to an open space for the present configuration the planer angle ϕ was 9 7 the temporal variations in the flow direction records i e α 1 α 2 were estimated using only the mutual of non missed records of u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 accordingly fig 5 c d shows the records of the flow direction α 1 corresponding to the streamline p1 p2 blue and the records of the flow direction α 2 corresponding to the streamline p1 p3 black during each flood event it can be noticed that the flow directions α 1 and α 2 varied by 12 in comparison to the velocity difference fig 5 a b the temporal variation in the flow direction fig 5 c d shows a downward peak at the beginning of the flood event opposite to the velocity difference peak and then reaches its maxima once the water level peaks after that a gradual decreasing behavior can be observed once the streamflow directions were evaluated the time series of the streamwise velocity was computed using eqs 14 15 and plotted in fig 5e and 5f 14 v 1 u 1 c o s α 1 15 v 2 u 2 c o s α 2 where v 1 v 2 are the streamwise cross sectional average velocity corresponding to the streamline p1 p2 and streamline p1 p3 respectively as can be observed the cross sectional average velocity along p1 p2 was different from the recorded velocity along p1 p3 fig 5a and 5b still more impressive the behavior of streamwise cross sectional average velocity graphed in fig 5 e f g h first it can be noticed that the velocity shows distinctive patterns of fluctuations concaved downward within high frequency i e few hours 1 3 h indicated by arrows in fig 5 g h these hourly fluctuations are obvious along p1 p2 and p1 p3 on the contrary the fluctuations were not apparent in the water stage readings in distinction to the velocity recorded along p1 p2 as shown in fig 5 e f the cross sectional average velocity along p1 p3 decreased with a mild slope during the falling limb while the velocity along p1 p2 swiftly decreased within the same period likewise river discharge was computed using eq 3 fig 6 a b presents the plots of the streamflow during the observation period estimated by the fat system 4 discussion this paper sheds light on the applications of the travel time approach as a promising method in water resources and hydrological research and several interesting points can be learned from this study 4 1 underwater acoustic measurement from technical point of view past monitoring campaigns by means of the fat system were carried out using the 30 khz omnidirectional broadband transducers however since 2017 a new generation of the fat system was improved to be operated by the 58 khz omnidirectional broadband transducers and is being under investigation the primary goal of using higher transmission frequency was basically to enable higher resolution measurement in shallower and narrower streams al sawaf et al 2022 2020 the main question related to the technical aspects of this observation is what are the criteria used to select a specific transmission frequency to answer this question fig 7 shows the velocity resolution curves as a function of transmission frequency and sound ray length between a transmitter and receiver as proposed by kawanisi et al 2012 it can be seen that the velocity resolution obtained by a high transmission frequency i e 54 58 khz shown in blue dots is better than the velocity resolution that would be acquired by the older version of the fat system i e 30 khz version if the same distances among p1 p2 and p3 were used moreover in the case of this observation there was no specific reason on how to set the order of the used transducers thus any order is expected to generate the same results in terms of hydrological research mutual transmission between two different types of underwater acoustic transducers may not necessarily imply a specific importance however one of the technical aims of our observation is to verify if mutual transmission using the different types of the mentioned transducers can be attained or not more importantly the key reason to improve the current version of the fat using a hemispherical transmission type was to minimize the transmission loss of acoustic signals and increase the accuracy level of the system within different conditions e g high turbid water unsteady conditions due to floods better transmission quality with existence of river debris in comparison to the cylindrical beam broadband transducers further important fact is that the theoretical design of a technique instrument in some cases may not be identical with the practical actual design therefore continuous improvement is being considered to achieve the best desired performance 4 2 river hydrodynamics in light of fat measurements by means of travel time principles continuous measurements of the cross sectional average velocity streamflow direction and discharge were accomplished unexpectedly the measured velocity u 2 along p1 p3 as can be seen in fig 5 a b exhibited a prolonged continuous peak behavior for about two days however similar behavior was not observed in the case of the measured velocity u 1 along p1 p2 i e about a half day peak this is maybe justified by the fact that the observation site is being located nearby to a meander bend as can be verified in fig 1 apparently fig 1 a b shows the deposited gravel and boulder particles in the inner side of the meander furthermore fig 1 c d tells that the river channel becomes more deeper near to the right bank side therefore it seems that the measured velocity along p1 p3 expresses the behavior of the stream velocity near to the fastest flow line i e near the thalweg which seems to be reasonable since the thalweg represents the line of the fastest flow that swings from the outside of one bend to another on the other side another question related to the accuracy of the measurements obtained by the fat can be raised unfortunately direct comparison using adcp measurements could not be performed during the observation events nonetheless the discharge estimated by the fat was compared to the discharge estimated by the recent rating curve equation developed for this site in late 2020 using direct flow estimates acquired by a moving boat adcp fig 6 a b compares the discharge estimated by the fat with the discharge computed using the rating curve approach encouragingly it can be noticed from the error percentage plots fig 6 c d that an acceptable range of variation between qfat and qrc can be noticed during baseflow conditions i e steady and quasi steady flow conditions alternatively a considerable range of variation between qfat and qrc is apparent during late recession limb remarkably these variations can be associated with the same period when the behavior of velocities along p1 p2 and p1 p3 was different fig 5a 5b in comparison kawanisi et al 2018 and kawanisi and al sawaf 2020 conducted long term flow measurement using the fat for the same observation area using different cross sections and revealed that maximum percentage error between the discharge estimated by fat and moving adcp boat was 19 64 fig 1 and table 1 in the supplementary materials another important issue of discharge computation is to give a sensible image about the error structure related to our observation the error structure in the flow computed by the fat system can be expressed as kawanisi et al 2016 16 δ q fat q fat δ q h q δ q a q δ q u q δ q α q δ h h δ z bm h δ u u δ α sin α cos α it can be realized in eq 16 that the relative error of the discharge estimated by the fat is affected by the water depth cross sectional area mean velocity and flow direction the first term δ q h q is the relative error induced by the mean water level readings while the second term δ q a q is the relative error induced by imperfect bathymetry measurements the third and fourth terms are the errors induced by cross sectional average velocity and flow direction given the uncertainties of the water pressure loggers and the unmanned boat measurements as δ h 0 01 m and δ z bm 0 05 m respectively in addition the uncertainty of the velocity measured by the fat was δ u 0 1 m s and the flow direction angle δ α 1 degree hence the maximum possible error can be estimated as 28 as detailed in the supplementary materials unfortunately it seems that this value is high compared to the estimated values reported by kawanisi et al 2018 2016 i e 15 3 and 14 respectively therefore it seems that proper selection of transmission lines i e cross sections is necessary to ensure accurate estimates in this context it is essential to clarify that the direct distance from p2 to p3 is 40 m approximately in addition during site investigations we tried to select the cross sections of p1 p2 and p1 p3 in such a way that they have almost similar conditions however unavoidable issues governed the selection process of the stations at p1 p2 and p3 for example the first primary consideration was to make the distance between p2 and p3 very close to each other to ensure the continuity principle in open channels the second consideration was to select stations as far as possible from the meander bend since the velocity in the outer bend is high and safe installation cannot be performed easily moreover riverbank locations that seem to be unstable were avoided nonetheless it can be noticed in fig 5 that during these mild flood events about half meter increment in the water level the variation in the flow direction was about 10 which is slightly over our expectation 5 7 and induced by the considerable difference between the velocity vectors that is to say one of the velocity vectors was roughly coinciding with thalweg line accordingly the large variation between qfat and qrc during late recession limb can be understood 4 3 new achievements advantages and limitations of the current observation and future research directions basically to estimate river discharge in open channels information of stream velocity and area would be crucial to do this task in practice river discharge estimation using the rating curves or even data driven methods is deficient because the velocity term is not included directly in the calibration process unlike the stage discharge method the index velocity method is more accurate due the fact that the velocity as well as the area i e stage ratings are embedded in the calibration procedure uniquely river discharge based on the travel time principles is an advanced method since continuous discharge measurements entail information of three ratings namely cross sectional area cross sectional mean velocity and river flow direction in fact the last term is often ignored by other approaches equation 3 shows that the flow determined by the fat system addresses the flow direction term in the estimation process al sawaf et al 2020 reported that the following methods can be used to estimate the flow direction i the regression from another reference discharge data kawanisi et al 2016 ii two cross acoustic lines configuration bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 sloat and gain 1995 and iii moving boat adcp razaz et al 2013 to estimate the temporal variations in the flow direction using the travel time principles bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 and sloat and gain 1995 applied two crossed transmission lines specifically bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 deployed two pairs of the fat system placed in a crossed path shape and derived an equation to estimate the flow direction in a unidirectional stream on the other hand to continuously measure the flow direction variations in a dam lake induced by the intermittent opening and closing of a dam gate al sawaf et al 2022 installed two pairs of the fat system operated by two different frequencies in a cross shape configuration they demonstrated that flow direction may flow in one of the four quadrants formed by the cross shape depend on the time difference between each pair of transducers an additional method to estimate flow direction using the travel time approach was introduced by sloat and gain 1995 which is the multi sectional paths in their method they divided the cross section site at the st johns river into four subsections and installed six transducers distributed at the upstream and downstream locations diagonally over a stream width of 450 m as a result past studies had utilized at least four tomographic systems to estimate river flow direction for the present study continuous river flow direction was estimated based on the travel time approach using three fat systems deployed in a triangular shape for the first time and hence river flow direction based on travel time can be determined using at least three tomographic stations the results presented in fig 5 c d indicated that river flow direction corresponded to case 1 as illustrated in fig 4b which seems to be logic and was rotating clockwise during the falling limb as can be deduced from fig 5 c d more interestingly it can be realized in fig 5 c d that the river flow was closer to the p1 p3 i e very close to the thalweg the fat system can be operated for rivers with nonuniform bathymetries and within complex site conditions hence it can provide several desired advantages and beat many drawbacks that include i avoiding disturbance of riverine biodiversity ii avoiding conflicting of fishing activities iii enabling the functionality of river location for boat navigation activities and iv giving a feasible and practical solution for flow measurements within restricted site conditions nevertheless the operation of the fat system may be associated with some barriers for example adequate protection for transducer cable is necessary to avoid the risk of massive floods in some cases sound transmission can be restrained due to riverbed protrusions hence poor data transmission may be caused by gravel and boulders in the shallow area may occur however two main barriers appeared in this study can be mentioned as follows i improper site selection thus uncertainty value was high compared to the past studies this limitation was due to the fact that the fat systems were deployed near a meander bend as a result like any discharge computation approach e g slope area method rating curves etc it seems that there should be some criteria that must be considered to perform perfect discharge measurement the second limitation was inability to estimate the third velocity component along p1 p2 continuously since gps signal lost which caused intermittent records since we tried to protect the system from animal damage although our results are preliminary we are optimist that applications of travel time would be prospered in future and would deepen our understanding regarding river meander hydrodynamics and how to improve the current numerical models future work should be directed to extend the application of this method to bidirectional streams such as estuaries also optimal selection of transmission lines and planer angle should be investigated although double or multi layer phenomenon due to salinity intrusion or temperature variance along the water column was not emerged in this study it would be interesting to shed light on this issue in future works 5 conclusions with advent of accurate and advanced underwater acoustic transducers applications of travel time principles have received a growing interest in hydrological research and river engineering in this study the dynamics of two flood events were observed using the fluvial acoustic tomography fat system based on the travel time approach the primary purpose of this study is to continuously measure the cross sectional average velocity river flow direction and river discharge using an innovative tomographic system three fat systems were installed in a gravel bed river forming a triangle shape to enhance the performance of the recorded acoustic signals we used two different types of acoustic beams i e cylindrical and hemispherical beam pattern of sound rays some interesting points and issues can be learned from this study first to determine streamflow direction previous works used four acoustic stations or more to evaluate the flow direction based on the travel time principles interestingly in this study we demonstrated that the minimum number of acoustic stations that can be used to determine the river flow in unidirectional streams can be reduced to three stations which can be more practical and easier in addition this study offered new guidelines to continuously estimate

2494,monitoring flood dynamics is important to provide optimal flood mitigation practices and understand their hydrological responses recently applications of travel time principles have gained a growing interest in hydrological research and river engineering in this study flood dynamics were monitored using the fluvial acoustic tomography system fat based on travel time principles the primary objective of this study is to continuously measure the mean cross sectional velocity river flow direction and river discharge using an innovative tomographic system during two flood events in this regard three fat systems were placed in a gravel bed stream forming a triangle shape to measure stream velocity along two cross sections by investigating the magnitude of the cross sectional mean velocity vectors and the cross sectional areas we proposed new equations to evaluate the expected flow direction the performance of flow measurement by the fat system was verified with another reference record importantly we demonstrated that the minimum number of acoustic stations to determine river flow direction in unidirectional streams can be reduced to three stations which can be more practical and easier further one of the novel aspects of this study is offering new guidelines to continuously estimate flow direction using a triangular distribution of tomographic systems in general this study presents a promising method for monitoring flow dynamics in rivers keywords velocity flow direction flow underwater acoustic tomography travel time data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate measurement of streams such as unidirectional and bidirectional has been a great challenge faced by hydrologists and water resources engineers for many years in addition continuous and long term monitoring of reliable status of river dynamics is essential to provide best operation and management plans of water resources systems understand their hydrological processes and minimize the effects of related climate extremes hannah et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2017 worldwide extensive endeavors have been made to compute river flow continuously using various methods despite the latest developments in river monitoring methods and applications determination of stream velocity remains a challenging task particularly in gravel bed rivers due to several reasons including uneven river bed shape complex bathymetries and high flow resistance fujita et al 2007 holmes jr 2016 kawanisi et al 2016 2015 mihailović et al 2014 sawaf et al 2021 in practice at a stream gauging station streamflow is mainly derived using stage discharge relationships rantz 1982 by calibrating river discharge readings obtained from some direct observations with stage records long term investigations and assessments were conducted to correct discharge estimation acquired by the rating curves and decrease the related uncertainties bahreinimotlagh et al 2019 holmes jr 2016 jalbert et al 2011 mansanarez et al 2016 recently the index velocity method has been emerged as another advanced approach that is increasingly used as an alternative to the rating curves to acquire continuous streamflow records specifically at river stations with notable rating complexity holmes jr 2016 kawanisi et al 2018 levesque and oberg 2012 in this method river flow at a specific site can be estimated by finding empirical relationships between two main ratings namely average stream velocity and cross sectional area as a function of stream stage levesque and oberg 2012 river discharge estimation using the index velocity method is still an active research topic cheng et al 2019 in this regard cheng et al 2019 investigated the performance of the rating curves and the index velocity approach to estimate the discharge in the snake river idaho usa within complex flow situations their findings demonstrate that the discharge estimated by the index velocity method performed better during unsteady flows in contrast to the rating curves estimates commonly stream average velocity is measured by means of the acoustic doppler current profilers adcps kästner et al 2018 levesque and oberg 2012 although adcps offer great benefits over other traditional instruments approaches there exist some limitations that constrain the functionality and efficiency of applying adcps in riverine applications effectively for example the major limitations of measurements using moving boats adcp are i imprecise under very turbulent environment as a result of boat instability malcolm et al 2008 ii direct measurement is not safe in case of extreme weather and hydrological conditions hence peak hydrograph cannot be easily captured kawanisi et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 and iii accurate measurement necessitates significant time and experienced hands williams et al 2015 another option to obtain accurate cross sectional average velocity is to use the horizontal acoustic doppler profiler h adcp that measures water currents and flow structures fixed at a single depth horizontally from its mounting structure nonetheless the main limitation is the maximum range that can be covered up to 200 m approximately besides the measurement accuracy of the adcp goes down as the concentration of suspended sediment increases wall et al 2006 similarly multi deployment of one point nodal sensors e g vertical acoustic doppler profiler current meters along a stream cross section may achieve desirable measurements nevertheless the main limitation of this measurement style resides in restricting high number of stream related activities such as fishing and transportation al sawaf et al 2022 in terms of underwater acoustic measurements the most popular utilized method is the doppler shift method i e adcps where sound rays are emitted along or diagonal to a streamline and the frequency shift in the backscattered signal is measured alternatively the only rival approach to the doppler shift is the travel time method where reciprocal sound rays are transmitted and received along a specific cross section in both directions at certain times laenen and smith 1982 initially applications of the travel time approach in underwater acoustics were restricted in oceanography and coastal research using the ocean acoustic tomography oat and the coastal acoustic tomography cat systems the aforementioned systems were used to perform several applications including monitoring subsurface velocity and temperature structures in the open ocean dushaw and colosi 1998 munk and wunsch 1979 and mapping both 2d and 3d structures of sound speeds and sea currents hanifa et al 2020 kaneko et al 2020 park and kaneko 2000 however in recent years applications of travel time approach have received a growing interest in river engineering and hydrological research the fluvial acoustic tomography system fat system was made and developed as an advanced technology to extend the applications of reciprocal sound transmission in shallower water bodies compared to oceans and seas such as rivers and estuaries previous works used the fat system had studied and investigated various hydrological topics including high quality monitoring of river discharge danial et al 2019 kawanisi et al 2018 dam flush characteristics al sawaf and kawanisi 2019 reconstructing 2d currents and salinity profiles in a tidal junction xiao et al 2021 and monitoring dam lake dynamics al sawaf et al 2022 one of the most interesting and important applications of travel time principles using the fat is determination of flow direction estimation of streamflow direction using travel time principles was investigated by sloat and gain 1995 and bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 these works mainly proposed a cross path configuration to estimate flow direction while bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 estimated flow direction in a unidirectional stream al sawaf et al 2022 fully discussed flow direction computation in a dam lake by dividing the cross path formed by two acoustic lines into four quadrants and examining the time difference between each pair of transducers another method to estimate flow direction using the travel time approach was proposed by sloat and gain 1995 is the multi sectional paths that employed more than four acoustic stations in light of the foregoing the primary gap of previous works was lack of studies focusing on effective utilization of travel time principles in flow direction estimation and streamflow monitoring in other words past studies sought to estimate flow direction carried out using a set of four tomographic systems or more bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 xiao et al 2021 which can be impractical in long term applications however there is no work indicated the minimum number of acoustic stations required to estimate flow direction particularly during flood events hence the purpose of this study is to shed light on continuous monitoring of streamflow direction as well as river discharge using an innovative underwater acoustic tomography system the key questions of this research are i how travel time principles can advance the estimation of river flow compared to other current approaches and ii what is the minimum number of acoustic stations needed to estimate flow direction according to travel time principles the major contribution of this research is to provide a first guideline on flow direction estimation in unsteady rivers using a triangular distribution of underwater acoustic tomography systems another important contribution is to move a step forward advancing river flow measurement in open channels using the direct approach in other words continuous measurement of river flow in this study will be considered using three basic terms i river cross sectional area as a function of stream level ii mean average velocity and iii flow direction the following points highlight the key novelties of this research i flow direction is estimated based on travel time principles using a triangular configuration of underwater acoustic transducers and ii two different types of acoustic transducers were used in this work that is to say one pair of broadband transducers that transmit cylindrical beam pattern of sound rays and another broadband transducer transmits hemispherical beam pattern of sound rays which reflect another technical novelty of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 observation site observations were carried out in the gōno river located in hiroshima prefecture japan fig 1 the stream region is characterized by a tepid weather with a mean annual temperature of 12 c the river mainstream flows through hiroshima and shimane prefectures the river basin area is 3900 km2 and it has a channel length of 194 km the main tributaries of the gōno river i e basen and saijō rivers are unified 2 7 km upstream of the monitoring location fig 1a the river channel at the study site is classified as a shallow gravel bed river with bed slope as 0 11 using the records of the cross sectional average velocity hydraulic radius and water surface slope hydraulic grade line the roughness coefficient for the observation site according to the gauckler manning formula was estimated as 0 03 illustration of the tomographic measurement of river flow using the fat system is shown in fig 1b a set of three fat systems forming a triangle shape were deployed at the river site as can be seen one of the systems was installed at the upstream location of the river in the left bank i e p1 station while the other remaining systems were deployed at the downstream location to the right bank i e p2 and p3 stations in the case of p1 p2 stations we used broadband transducers that transmit a cylindrical beam pattern of sound rays with a resonant frequency of 58 khz fig 2 a alternatively in the case of p3 station the fat system was operated using a transducer that transmit a hemispherical beam pattern of sound rays with a resonant frequency of 54 khz fig 2a fig 2a shows the fat system logger and the two different types of the used transducers in this observation in addition fig 2 b c presents the installation of the fat system in the river site moreover fig 2d reveals our effort in fixing the transducer cable in the river site in such a way to be protected from being washed out due to potential massive floods fig 2e sketches the primary configuration of the fat system to obtain the mean water level records three water pressure loggers hobo level temperature logger were attached to each transducer at p1 p2 and p3 and configured to acquire data at 5 min intervals bed topography survey along p1 p2 and p1 p3 was achieved using a boat armed with a single beam echo sounder coden boat rc s3 hence the cross sectional area along p1 p2 and p1 p3 can be estimated by integrating the elevation of the riverbed with the mean water level records observed by the water pressure loggers at p1 p2 and p1 p3 respectively to ensure high precision of the stations position their locations were defined using high precision gps gnss real time kinematic rtk with a resolution of 5 cm it should be noted that there was no salinity effect in the observation area moreover temperature variation along the water column was minimal hence double or multi layer phenomenon due to salinity or temperature variation was not emerged table 1 summarizes the main features of the experiment configuration and setups further insights regarding streamflow measurement by fat and flow angle determination are presented in the following sections 2 2 river flow measurement based on the travel time principles by means of travel time method sound speed c 1 and the corresponding cross sectional mean velocity u 1 along the transmission section p1 p2 can be estimated by the fat system to illustrate the travel time is the time elapsed by an acoustic signal triggered from a transducer to a defined receiver s thus in the case of a couple of transducers e g p1 and p2 the acquired travel times t p 1 t p 2 the triggered acoustic pulse from the transducer at p1 station to the transducer at p2 station and vice versa are used to compute the sound speed and cross sectional mean velocity along the transmission path p1 p2 as follows 1 c 1 l 1 2 1 t p 1 1 t p 2 2 u 1 l 1 2 1 t p 1 1 t p 2 where l1 is the horizontal distance between p1 and p2 hence river flow using the fat can be evaluated as 3 q fat u 1 a 1 t a n α 1 a 1 is the area along p1 p2 and α 1 is the angle between acoustic path p1 p2 and streamflow direction 2 3 estimation of streamflow direction based on travel time principles using a triangular tomographic scheme one of the novel aspects of this study is offering new guidelines to estimate river flow direction using a triangular tomographic scheme fig 3 presents a flowchart that outlines the estimation process of river flow direction using a triangular tomographic scheme at the beginning it is very important to point out that the estimation process was accomplished based on the assumption that there is no difference in the measured river flow passing through both cross sections i e p1 p2 p1 p3 or it should be very trivial so that it can be neglected and hence flow continuity principle is valid in other words river discharge passing through p1 p2 q p 1 p 2 and p1 p3 q p 1 p 3 are equal and therefore 4 q p 1 p 2 q p 1 p 3 5 u 1 a 1 tan α 1 u 2 a 2 t a n α 2 where u 2 a 2 are the cross sectional mean velocity and area along p1 p3 respectively and α 2 is the angle between the acoustic path p1 p3 and streamflow direction the first step as shown in fig 3 is to determine the planer angle ϕ between the lines from p1 through p2 and p3 as shown in fig 4 in this study the planer angle was estimated using the distances among the gps coordinates obtained at p1 p2 and p3 the second step is to estimate flow direction domain in fact the flow in the gōno river is unidirectional thus the expectation is that the flow direction will be from upstream to the downstream and both velocity vectors u 1 u 2 fig 1 are positive accordingly the flow domain should be in the intersection zone of both transmission line axes more specifically the intersection of the first and second quadrants q1 q2 of x y a b as illustrated in fig 4a because river flow through q3 q4 is negative hence the flow domain in this case equals to 180 2 ϕ and four cases can be distinguished as presented in fig 4 at each time step t i the instantaneous flow angles α 1 α 2 can be computed by examining the status of the velocity vectors u 1 u 2 and cross sectional areas a 1 a 2 first the estimation process must be started by verifying whether the flow domain is in the direction of case i or not because the flow is likely to be in this direction as illustrated in fig 3 and fig 4b in this case flow direction along p1 p2 and p1 p3 can be expressed as α 1 ϕ α 2 by substituting in eq 5 flow angle α 2 can be expressed as shown in eq 6 6 α 2 tan 1 u 1 a 1 u 2 a 2 tan ϕ α 2 an iteration solving approach is needed to estimate α 2 thus eq 6 can be rewritten as follows 7 α 2 c o s 1 1 2 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 u 1 3 a 2 u 2 c o s 2 ϕ a 2 u 2 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 it is essential to emphasize that case i is valid whenever u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 1 alternatively if the aforementioned condition is not valid then the next step is to verify if the condition of case ii is applicable as illustrated in fig 4c in this case flow direction is valid if u 2 u 1 a 2 a 1 1 and therefore the flow direction can be expressed as α 1 ϕ α 2 thus substituting in eq 5 8 α 2 tan 1 u 1 a 1 u 2 a 2 tan ϕ α 2 and the iterative solution of eq 8 is given in eq 9 9 α 2 c o s 1 1 2 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 u 1 3 a 2 u 2 c o s 2 ϕ a 2 u 2 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 on the other hand if the condition of case ii is not valid the next step is to confirm the condition of case 3 as u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 1 the flow direction in this case can be expressed by α 2 ϕ α 1 see case iii fig 4d accordingly 10 α 1 tan 1 u 1 a 1 u 2 a 2 tan ϕ α 1 and the iterative solution of eq 10 is 11 α 1 c o s 1 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 u 1 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ a 2 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 the last case is case iv illustrated in fig 4e this case is valid when u 2 u 1 a 2 a 1 1 and one can write 12 α 1 tan 1 u 2 a 2 u 1 a 1 tan ϕ α 1 13 α 1 c o s 1 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 u 1 2 c o s ϕ c o s ϕ a 2 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 1 2 u 1 2 3 c o s 2 ϕ a 1 a 2 u 1 u 2 c o s ϕ 2 a 2 2 u 2 2 a 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 3 results we observed two flood events the first event started from 2022 03 12 to 2022 03 18 whereas the second event started from 2022 03 26 to 2022 03 31 for the present study river flow using a triangular distribution of fat systems was conducted to continuously monitor and compute the cross sectional average velocity streamflow direction and discharge fig 5 a b presents the records of the cross sectional mean velocity along p1 p2 and p1 p3 sections as well as the records of the water level for both events of importance in the current context the cross sectional velocity along p1 p3 black was greater than the velocity along p1 p2 blue furthermore both velocity records were totally positive apparently a stable behavior of velocity difference purple can be noticed during baseflow and can be estimated as 0 18 0 2 m s moreover it shows a sharp peak at the beginning of the flood event however after the first peak recedes the velocity difference increases gradually and peaks after two days again then dropped down and turned back as it was during the baseflow discontinuities in the velocity records along p1 p2 blue line occurred due to the intermittent loss of the gps time signals in fact the fat system logger at p2 station was mounted to a nearby tree in such a way that the system was protected from wild animals sabotage and hence the gps antenna was not appropriately exposed to an open space for the present configuration the planer angle ϕ was 9 7 the temporal variations in the flow direction records i e α 1 α 2 were estimated using only the mutual of non missed records of u 1 u 2 a 1 a 2 accordingly fig 5 c d shows the records of the flow direction α 1 corresponding to the streamline p1 p2 blue and the records of the flow direction α 2 corresponding to the streamline p1 p3 black during each flood event it can be noticed that the flow directions α 1 and α 2 varied by 12 in comparison to the velocity difference fig 5 a b the temporal variation in the flow direction fig 5 c d shows a downward peak at the beginning of the flood event opposite to the velocity difference peak and then reaches its maxima once the water level peaks after that a gradual decreasing behavior can be observed once the streamflow directions were evaluated the time series of the streamwise velocity was computed using eqs 14 15 and plotted in fig 5e and 5f 14 v 1 u 1 c o s α 1 15 v 2 u 2 c o s α 2 where v 1 v 2 are the streamwise cross sectional average velocity corresponding to the streamline p1 p2 and streamline p1 p3 respectively as can be observed the cross sectional average velocity along p1 p2 was different from the recorded velocity along p1 p3 fig 5a and 5b still more impressive the behavior of streamwise cross sectional average velocity graphed in fig 5 e f g h first it can be noticed that the velocity shows distinctive patterns of fluctuations concaved downward within high frequency i e few hours 1 3 h indicated by arrows in fig 5 g h these hourly fluctuations are obvious along p1 p2 and p1 p3 on the contrary the fluctuations were not apparent in the water stage readings in distinction to the velocity recorded along p1 p2 as shown in fig 5 e f the cross sectional average velocity along p1 p3 decreased with a mild slope during the falling limb while the velocity along p1 p2 swiftly decreased within the same period likewise river discharge was computed using eq 3 fig 6 a b presents the plots of the streamflow during the observation period estimated by the fat system 4 discussion this paper sheds light on the applications of the travel time approach as a promising method in water resources and hydrological research and several interesting points can be learned from this study 4 1 underwater acoustic measurement from technical point of view past monitoring campaigns by means of the fat system were carried out using the 30 khz omnidirectional broadband transducers however since 2017 a new generation of the fat system was improved to be operated by the 58 khz omnidirectional broadband transducers and is being under investigation the primary goal of using higher transmission frequency was basically to enable higher resolution measurement in shallower and narrower streams al sawaf et al 2022 2020 the main question related to the technical aspects of this observation is what are the criteria used to select a specific transmission frequency to answer this question fig 7 shows the velocity resolution curves as a function of transmission frequency and sound ray length between a transmitter and receiver as proposed by kawanisi et al 2012 it can be seen that the velocity resolution obtained by a high transmission frequency i e 54 58 khz shown in blue dots is better than the velocity resolution that would be acquired by the older version of the fat system i e 30 khz version if the same distances among p1 p2 and p3 were used moreover in the case of this observation there was no specific reason on how to set the order of the used transducers thus any order is expected to generate the same results in terms of hydrological research mutual transmission between two different types of underwater acoustic transducers may not necessarily imply a specific importance however one of the technical aims of our observation is to verify if mutual transmission using the different types of the mentioned transducers can be attained or not more importantly the key reason to improve the current version of the fat using a hemispherical transmission type was to minimize the transmission loss of acoustic signals and increase the accuracy level of the system within different conditions e g high turbid water unsteady conditions due to floods better transmission quality with existence of river debris in comparison to the cylindrical beam broadband transducers further important fact is that the theoretical design of a technique instrument in some cases may not be identical with the practical actual design therefore continuous improvement is being considered to achieve the best desired performance 4 2 river hydrodynamics in light of fat measurements by means of travel time principles continuous measurements of the cross sectional average velocity streamflow direction and discharge were accomplished unexpectedly the measured velocity u 2 along p1 p3 as can be seen in fig 5 a b exhibited a prolonged continuous peak behavior for about two days however similar behavior was not observed in the case of the measured velocity u 1 along p1 p2 i e about a half day peak this is maybe justified by the fact that the observation site is being located nearby to a meander bend as can be verified in fig 1 apparently fig 1 a b shows the deposited gravel and boulder particles in the inner side of the meander furthermore fig 1 c d tells that the river channel becomes more deeper near to the right bank side therefore it seems that the measured velocity along p1 p3 expresses the behavior of the stream velocity near to the fastest flow line i e near the thalweg which seems to be reasonable since the thalweg represents the line of the fastest flow that swings from the outside of one bend to another on the other side another question related to the accuracy of the measurements obtained by the fat can be raised unfortunately direct comparison using adcp measurements could not be performed during the observation events nonetheless the discharge estimated by the fat was compared to the discharge estimated by the recent rating curve equation developed for this site in late 2020 using direct flow estimates acquired by a moving boat adcp fig 6 a b compares the discharge estimated by the fat with the discharge computed using the rating curve approach encouragingly it can be noticed from the error percentage plots fig 6 c d that an acceptable range of variation between qfat and qrc can be noticed during baseflow conditions i e steady and quasi steady flow conditions alternatively a considerable range of variation between qfat and qrc is apparent during late recession limb remarkably these variations can be associated with the same period when the behavior of velocities along p1 p2 and p1 p3 was different fig 5a 5b in comparison kawanisi et al 2018 and kawanisi and al sawaf 2020 conducted long term flow measurement using the fat for the same observation area using different cross sections and revealed that maximum percentage error between the discharge estimated by fat and moving adcp boat was 19 64 fig 1 and table 1 in the supplementary materials another important issue of discharge computation is to give a sensible image about the error structure related to our observation the error structure in the flow computed by the fat system can be expressed as kawanisi et al 2016 16 δ q fat q fat δ q h q δ q a q δ q u q δ q α q δ h h δ z bm h δ u u δ α sin α cos α it can be realized in eq 16 that the relative error of the discharge estimated by the fat is affected by the water depth cross sectional area mean velocity and flow direction the first term δ q h q is the relative error induced by the mean water level readings while the second term δ q a q is the relative error induced by imperfect bathymetry measurements the third and fourth terms are the errors induced by cross sectional average velocity and flow direction given the uncertainties of the water pressure loggers and the unmanned boat measurements as δ h 0 01 m and δ z bm 0 05 m respectively in addition the uncertainty of the velocity measured by the fat was δ u 0 1 m s and the flow direction angle δ α 1 degree hence the maximum possible error can be estimated as 28 as detailed in the supplementary materials unfortunately it seems that this value is high compared to the estimated values reported by kawanisi et al 2018 2016 i e 15 3 and 14 respectively therefore it seems that proper selection of transmission lines i e cross sections is necessary to ensure accurate estimates in this context it is essential to clarify that the direct distance from p2 to p3 is 40 m approximately in addition during site investigations we tried to select the cross sections of p1 p2 and p1 p3 in such a way that they have almost similar conditions however unavoidable issues governed the selection process of the stations at p1 p2 and p3 for example the first primary consideration was to make the distance between p2 and p3 very close to each other to ensure the continuity principle in open channels the second consideration was to select stations as far as possible from the meander bend since the velocity in the outer bend is high and safe installation cannot be performed easily moreover riverbank locations that seem to be unstable were avoided nonetheless it can be noticed in fig 5 that during these mild flood events about half meter increment in the water level the variation in the flow direction was about 10 which is slightly over our expectation 5 7 and induced by the considerable difference between the velocity vectors that is to say one of the velocity vectors was roughly coinciding with thalweg line accordingly the large variation between qfat and qrc during late recession limb can be understood 4 3 new achievements advantages and limitations of the current observation and future research directions basically to estimate river discharge in open channels information of stream velocity and area would be crucial to do this task in practice river discharge estimation using the rating curves or even data driven methods is deficient because the velocity term is not included directly in the calibration process unlike the stage discharge method the index velocity method is more accurate due the fact that the velocity as well as the area i e stage ratings are embedded in the calibration procedure uniquely river discharge based on the travel time principles is an advanced method since continuous discharge measurements entail information of three ratings namely cross sectional area cross sectional mean velocity and river flow direction in fact the last term is often ignored by other approaches equation 3 shows that the flow determined by the fat system addresses the flow direction term in the estimation process al sawaf et al 2020 reported that the following methods can be used to estimate the flow direction i the regression from another reference discharge data kawanisi et al 2016 ii two cross acoustic lines configuration bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 sloat and gain 1995 and iii moving boat adcp razaz et al 2013 to estimate the temporal variations in the flow direction using the travel time principles bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 and sloat and gain 1995 applied two crossed transmission lines specifically bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 deployed two pairs of the fat system placed in a crossed path shape and derived an equation to estimate the flow direction in a unidirectional stream on the other hand to continuously measure the flow direction variations in a dam lake induced by the intermittent opening and closing of a dam gate al sawaf et al 2022 installed two pairs of the fat system operated by two different frequencies in a cross shape configuration they demonstrated that flow direction may flow in one of the four quadrants formed by the cross shape depend on the time difference between each pair of transducers an additional method to estimate flow direction using the travel time approach was introduced by sloat and gain 1995 which is the multi sectional paths in their method they divided the cross section site at the st johns river into four subsections and installed six transducers distributed at the upstream and downstream locations diagonally over a stream width of 450 m as a result past studies had utilized at least four tomographic systems to estimate river flow direction for the present study continuous river flow direction was estimated based on the travel time approach using three fat systems deployed in a triangular shape for the first time and hence river flow direction based on travel time can be determined using at least three tomographic stations the results presented in fig 5 c d indicated that river flow direction corresponded to case 1 as illustrated in fig 4b which seems to be logic and was rotating clockwise during the falling limb as can be deduced from fig 5 c d more interestingly it can be realized in fig 5 c d that the river flow was closer to the p1 p3 i e very close to the thalweg the fat system can be operated for rivers with nonuniform bathymetries and within complex site conditions hence it can provide several desired advantages and beat many drawbacks that include i avoiding disturbance of riverine biodiversity ii avoiding conflicting of fishing activities iii enabling the functionality of river location for boat navigation activities and iv giving a feasible and practical solution for flow measurements within restricted site conditions nevertheless the operation of the fat system may be associated with some barriers for example adequate protection for transducer cable is necessary to avoid the risk of massive floods in some cases sound transmission can be restrained due to riverbed protrusions hence poor data transmission may be caused by gravel and boulders in the shallow area may occur however two main barriers appeared in this study can be mentioned as follows i improper site selection thus uncertainty value was high compared to the past studies this limitation was due to the fact that the fat systems were deployed near a meander bend as a result like any discharge computation approach e g slope area method rating curves etc it seems that there should be some criteria that must be considered to perform perfect discharge measurement the second limitation was inability to estimate the third velocity component along p1 p2 continuously since gps signal lost which caused intermittent records since we tried to protect the system from animal damage although our results are preliminary we are optimist that applications of travel time would be prospered in future and would deepen our understanding regarding river meander hydrodynamics and how to improve the current numerical models future work should be directed to extend the application of this method to bidirectional streams such as estuaries also optimal selection of transmission lines and planer angle should be investigated although double or multi layer phenomenon due to salinity intrusion or temperature variance along the water column was not emerged in this study it would be interesting to shed light on this issue in future works 5 conclusions with advent of accurate and advanced underwater acoustic transducers applications of travel time principles have received a growing interest in hydrological research and river engineering in this study the dynamics of two flood events were observed using the fluvial acoustic tomography fat system based on the travel time approach the primary purpose of this study is to continuously measure the cross sectional average velocity river flow direction and river discharge using an innovative tomographic system three fat systems were installed in a gravel bed river forming a triangle shape to enhance the performance of the recorded acoustic signals we used two different types of acoustic beams i e cylindrical and hemispherical beam pattern of sound rays some interesting points and issues can be learned from this study first to determine streamflow direction previous works used four acoustic stations or more to evaluate the flow direction based on the travel time principles interestingly in this study we demonstrated that the minimum number of acoustic stations that can be used to determine the river flow in unidirectional streams can be reduced to three stations which can be more practical and easier in addition this study offered new guidelines to continuously estimate river flow direction using a triangular configuration of three tomographic systems credit authorship contribution statement mohamad basel al sawaf conceptualization methodology data curation writing
