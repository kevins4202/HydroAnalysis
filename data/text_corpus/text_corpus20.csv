100,in this paper we report on experimental and computational studies investigating the evolution of pore structure and permeability of a microporous carbonate rock during chemical dissolution using information provided from x ray micro computed tomography µ ct and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip techniques we consider a chemical dissolution in a core sample by a nonacidic solution wherein a quasi uniform modification of pore structure occurred first we conduct a comparative analysis on the capabilities and limitations of the µ ct and mip methods to quantify the evolution of pore size and pore surface area in particular we incorporate micropores into the calculations of the pore size related parameters to highlight the uncertainties that ignoring microporosity causes in the second part of the paper we present predictive results on the fractional changes in the permeability of the rock using the katz thompson kt and kozeny carman kc models the predictions are based on two characteristic parameters of the pore phase i e the critical pore diameter and the specific pore surface area and two characteristic macro scale properties i e porosity and formation factor all calculated from both the mip and µ ct methods the predicted changes in permeability are compared with those calculated directly on the images using the lattice boltzmann lb flow simulation on segmented images the effect of changes in microporosity is also assessed to investigate its role in permeability evolution the results showed that the kt model could reasonably predict the fractional

problem that is central in a wide variety of geochemical processes such as acidizing of petroleum reservoirs ali and nasr el din 2020 contaminant transport in groundwater resources nick et al 2013 and geological storage of co2 liu et al 2019 and hydrogen hassanpouryouzband et al 2021 these processes often induce substantial changes in rock microstructure which in turn may significantly change the petrophysical and transport properties of the rock in the petroleum industry billions of dollars are spent annually on oil and gas exploration and developing complex and risky reservoirs particularly carbonate reservoirs during the life cycle of a reservoir chemical dissolution plays an important role from treating formation damage resulting from drilling operations to using acids and other chemicals for improved and enhanced oil recovery a better understanding of chemical dissolution at the pore scale can for example lead to improvement in the performance of reactive processes during the development of reservoirs and hence dramatically reduce the associated costs changes in petrophysical and transport properties of sedimentary rocks strongly depend on the evolution of pore structure including pore throat shape and size pore surface area and connectivity of the pore system garing et al 2014 qajar and arns 2017 among sedimentary rocks carbonates show particular features and are much more susceptible to alteration than sandstones when exposed to the flow of reactive fluids in subsurface formations the characterization of changes in the microstructure of carbonate rocks is extremely challenging because these rocks often exhibit complex microstructure and disorder over a wide range of length scales knackstedt et al 2007 this complexity causes considerable variability in relations of structure and topology to physical properties most carbonate rocks comprise a variety of pore and grain types with irregular spatial distributions and a wide spectrum of pore sizes from nanometers to centimeters and hence the macro scale properties of carbonate rocks e g permeability and electrical conductivity are highly variable ramakrishnan et al 2001 arns et al 2004 as a result it has been of great importance to accurately characterize the pore structure of carbonate rocks its evolution during geochemical processes and the relation between the evolution in pore scale descriptors and changes in macroscale properties two widely techniques used to characterize the pore structure of porous materials including conventional and unconventional reservoir rocks are mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and x ray computed tomography ct especially microtomography μ ct the mip method has primarily been used for decades to determine the pore size distribution psd and pore volume of various porous media schmitt et al 2015 sidiq et al 2020 this method is based on a bundle of capillary tubes model contrary to a real porous structure wherein a complex network of pores and throats exists hence some authors have referred to the mip based void size distribution as pore access size distribution feia et al 2014 nonetheless the high pressure mip makes it possible to probe the nano scale void space of porous materials particularly tight rocks ma et al 2020 from mip based pore throat size distribution it is possible to calculate a range of pore and core scale properties purcell 1949 liu and winslow 1995 aligizaki 2005 in recent years in particular the use of x ray μ ct and the image based simulations known as digital rock physics drp is a rapidly evolving research field and is increasingly being used to quantitatively characterize the microstructure and properties of materials via tomographically recorded 3d media flannery et al 1987 spanne et al 1994 arns et al 2003 derzhi et al 2010 knackstedt et al 2011 andrä et al 2013 cnudde and boone 2013 berg et al 2017 hassanpouryouzband et al 2020 wang and miller 2020 ni et al 2021 in the μ ct technique high resolution images of the material specimen are acquired at micro and nano meter scales and processed to create accurate 3d digital data the material structure parameters and physical properties are then computed using advanced numerical techniques at the pore scale the main advantage of the μ ct method is the ability to nondestructively probe the inner nonvisible structure pore system and surface morphology of materials allowing one to follow microstructure evolution in real time a major source of uncertainty in μ ct is the image resolution that can be attained for a specimen elkhoury et al 2019 although 2d other imaging techniques such as thin section microscopy yarmohammadi et al 2020 scanning electron microscopy kuzmin and skibitskaya 2017 and atomic force microscopy hassenkam et al 2011 can provide images with higher resolutions and hence combine with μ ct for better assessment of rock pore space and grains several studies have reported a combined use of the mip and µ ct for the characterization of material internal structure ho and hutmacher 2006 compared µ ct with other methods including the mip for the characterization of scaffolds they argued that the possibility of sample compression and even collapse at very high mercury pressure the reactions of mercury with some metals such as aluminum the assumption of the cylindrical pores and the sample contamination with mercury are major limitations of the mip this is while the µ ct has crucial advantages of being non destructive and identifying spatial distributions of internal features they mentioned thresholding and beam hardening as the main concerns of using µ ct the applications of mip and sem for microstructure evaluation in unsaturated soils were reviewed by romero and simms 2008 they pointed out the main limitations of mip such as inaccessible pores including isolated pores and pores which are accessible through smaller ones non intruded pores non detected pores due to the apparatus minimum pressure limits and deformation of the sample container they mentioned that the mip does not achieve true psd due to several constraints including sample treatment and pore accessibility fusi and martinez martinez 2013 suggested using µ ct imaging before and after mercury intrusion to accurately characterize the structural features of low porosity carbonates the pore systems of complex carbonate formations were studied by njiekak et al 2018 using µ ct mercury intrusion and helium porosimetry they argued that it is crucial to use various techniques when evaluating the multiscale porosity of rocks with a considerable amount of both the connected and non connected pores considering that the µ ct can provide information on both the connected and non connected macropores resolved pores and the mip can give connected porosity resolved and non resolved pores combining the data depict an accurate picture of the rock pore system a complete characterization of a tight sandstone was reported by cheng et al 2019 using µ ct sem imaging and mercury intrusion the issue of characterizing the evolution of rock structure due to various processes particularly chemical dissolution using the mip and or computed tomography techniques has been investigated by several researchers the early work by swift and fogler 1977 investigated the evolution of pore size of sandstones due to acidizing using a mercury injection technique they observed that while the pore sizes of the cores ranged from 0 03 to 30 μm the dissolution happened only in those pores larger than about 1 μm based on these results they introduced a threshold reactivity diameter concept as a pore size above which the dissolution has the largest effect bazin et al 1995 studied acidizing of limestone cores using the x ray ct and mercury intrusion they qualitatively investigated the dissolution pattern by the ct images and evaluated the changes in pore size distribution after acidizing by mercury injection curves they found that the acidizing process predominantly affected the larger pores in another study burlion et al 2006 used the μ ct method to analyze the mortar microstructure variations during an accelerated leaching process they quantified the evolution of porosity during the process their findings are of great importance in the modeling study of concrete durability a uniform rock structure modification due to dissolution caused by co2 injection was studied by egermann et al 2010 they conducted mercury porosimetry measurements before and after the alteration and found that the distribution of small pore radii was rather unaffected regardless of the rock types they observed major modifications of the distributions for the larger pores but in a different manner according to the particular rock type interestingly it was found that for the low permeable rock the dissolution increased the intermediate pore radii while the large pores of the high permeable rock mainly increased after the dissolution this explained the variations in permeability evolution of the rocks where the largest permeability increase was obtained for the rock type with the most pronounced increase in larger pores egermann et al 2010 gouze and luquot 2011 used the μ ct facility at esrf grenoble france to investigate the spatial distribution of the effective hydraulic radius and tortuosity to examine the different porosity permeability relationships observed for homogeneous and heterogeneous dissolution patterns they found that for homogeneous dissolution the permeability increase was due to the decrease of the tortuosity whereas the combination of tortuosity and hydraulic radius changes were controlling factors for permeability in heterogeneous dissolution luquot et al 2014 investigated the structural changes in limestone samples induced by co2 rich brine using microtomography they analyzed various dissolution patterns in relation to the partial pressure of co2 and found that the initial rock structure strongly controlled the permeability porosity relationship in another paper by luquot et al 2016 changes in pore size distribution and pore connectivity of a limestone sample induced by an acidic solution were investigated they compared the evolution of the pore scale parameters computed by x ray µ ct images and laboratory experiments and obtained good agreement between them despite the high dependence of image based computed parameters on the resolution particularly for the fluid rock interface the µ ct method yielded similar results for the micro and macro scale rock properties as the laboratory experiments in a much shorter time and in a non destructive way aside from the changes in pore size distribution the μ ct method has also been employed to geometrically estimate the changes in specific surface area after chemical dissolution noiriel et al 2004 noiriel et al 2009 gouze and luquot 2011 these studies emphasized that the grain and or grain roughness smaller than the μ ct resolution could not be measured and the pore grain interface area was a priori underestimated dal ferro et al 2012 conducted a comparative study of the µ ct and mip for evaluation of cambisols structure under fertilization treatments they argued that the mip measurements were necessary to identify small pores that were not resolved by the µ ct imaging they found that compared to the µ ct method the mip detected micropores were underestimated but macropores overestimated due to the ink bottle effect it was also found that only the µ ct could show the impacts of organic amendments on pore morphology the microstructure of the original and tectonic coals was explored by the mip and µ ct by k zhang et al 2019 in addition to psd they used the mip results to assess the connectivity of the pore system and found that tectonic stress created many noneffective pores with pore opening constrictions they also examined the evolution of the morphology of macropores and fractures using µ ct this study clearly highlights the significance of employing various techniques when analyzing the microstructure of complex porous media in a recent interesting paper sidiq et al 2020 reviewed the application of x ray tomography and mip for the characterization of concrete pores cracks content and structure for self healing cementitious materials they briefly discuss some sources of limitations such as the noise level and the thresholding as the major factors contributing to the errors in the μ ct technique and the applied pressure and the non intruded internal pores and cracks as the main types of errors in the mip leading to inaccurate results comprehensive reviews regarding the evolution of pore scale structure and permeability during geochemical processes are provided in noiriel 2015 gan et al 2020 and khan et al 2021 despite previous studies on the study of chemical dissolution in porous materials using various experimental and imaging techniques there is still a need to accurately address the respective challenges when characterizing the evolution of the internal structure of porous rocks using the two powerful tools of µ ct and mip particularly for complex microporous rocks such as carbonates in this study we first aim to explore and compare the scope of application of these two complementary techniques for tracking and characterizing the evolution of the pore structure of a microporous carbonate rock during chemical dissolution we carefully address the respective challenges and limitations of both methods in characterizing the evolution of rock pore structures subject to reactive flow in particular the evolutions of pore size distribution and pore surface area are quantified and the role of micropores is explored the second aim is to predict the resulting changes in permeability due to dissolution using the information provided from 3d µ ct images and mip tests in this regard we consider two well known permeability estimation models i e the katz thompson and the kozeny carman equations in particular we incorporate sub resolution pores into critical pore diameter to evaluate the degree to which the inclusion of microporosity could enhance the prediction of permeability changes 2 experimental methods 2 1 rock sample the core sample was obtained from the savonnières en perthois region in eastern france flugel 2010 fig 1 shows a photograph of the core sample used in this study the rock is an oolitic limestone composed of ellipsoidal particles of calcite known as ooids with diameters ranging from a few tens to thousand microns embedded in sparry calcite cement sparite some ooids are preserved whereas others are completely or partially hollowed out forming oomoldic pores visual observations of the sample revealed the presence of millimeter sized oomoldic pores the xrd test showed that the sample is mainly made of calcite the mineralogical content of the sample is consistent with previous studies by e g zhang et al 2018 and de muynck et al 2011 in which they mentioned the savonniere limestone contains 97 99 calcite and 1 3 biotite 2 2 experimental procedure in this study the experiment involved alternating steps of µ ct imaging and ex situ core sample alteration by chemical dissolution using 0 25 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta solution at ph 12 at ambient conditions under these conditions the dissolution of the sample was mainly performed through ligand promoted dissolution fredd and fogler 1998 here dissolution at high ph is beneficial in reaching a homogeneous alteration of pore structure within the core sample because the kinetics of the chelation reactions dominates the rate of dissolution fig 2 illustrates the schematic diagram of the setup used for the chemical dissolution experiment a small core plug with a diameter and length of 7 0 and 20 6 mm respectively was drilled out from the original rock specimen and dried in an oven it was then sealed on the sides using a fluoropolymer heat shrink and imaged in a dry state using the µ ct facility at the australian national university sakellariou et al 2004 the initial porosity of the sample was measured by the saturation method ϕ 0 30 6 then deionized water was injected at different rates to measure permeability by darcy s law k 0 58 6 md the reactive fluid was injected through the sample at rate of 0 36 cm3 min using a motorized syringe pump and the pressure drop across the sample was monitored by a differential pressure transmitter abb model 2600t pressure range from 0 0000 to 250 0000 kpa the reactive injection was terminated after a significant increase in the permeability of the sample kf 152 4 md the final porosity of the core was measured ϕf 42 6 before it was imaged in a dry state again a 3d registration technique by latham et al 2008 was used to superpose the µ ct image of the disturbed sample to the image of the original unaltered sample tomograms in each state were composed of 20483 voxels fig 3 summarizes the lengths and voxel sizes of pre and post dissolution scans as well as the registered images as schematically shown in fig 3 images of the core sample were taken at about 4 mm from the front of the sample to eliminate the inlet effect with a field of view of at least 8 5 mm the final registered tomograms corresponded to two datasets of 1632 1592 1664 voxels with a common voxel size of 4 49 μm 2 3 scanning electron microscope sem we used sem to display the finer features of the pore systems than those resolved by the µ ct imaging the equipment used for the sem image acquisition of the studied rock was a zeiss ultra plus field emission scanning electron microscope fesem located at the centre for advanced microscopy at the australian national university the fesem microscope was operated at a low accelerating voltage 1 kv and small aperture at a small working distance around 2 mm to maximize the resolution 2 4 mercury intrusion porosimetry mip tests to analyze the internal pore structure and to compare the results obtained from the μ ct imaging we used the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip method as a standard experimental technique to primarily evaluate the pore size distribution psd or more strictly the pore accessibility distribution or pore throat size distribution of the specimen in a mercury intrusion test the non wetting mercury invades in a drainage process the connected pore system according to capillary pressure for each pressure the change in injected volume is recorded in a typical mip test capillary entry pressure mercury air and the volume of intruded mercury into the pore space of the specimen are directly measured in this study mip testing was performed on the rock samples in both the pre and post dissolution conditions using the micromeritics autopore iv 9500 v1 06 mercury porosimeter with a maximum pressure of 30 000 psia to examine the effect of reactive flow on the micro and macro scale properties we performed three mip tests in this work the first test was performed on a sister plug of the intact core sample marked here as the pre dissolution sample the sister plug was chosen very close to the sample imaged after the chemical dissolution experiment was terminated the altered sample marked here as the post dissolution sample was split into two pieces and the mip tests were performed on both the first piece marked as sample piece p1 was located near the injection face inlet of the sample where the acquired μ ct images correspond to this sample piece the other piece was located far from the injection face of the sample marked as sample piece p2 and was also used for the mip study to observe changes in pore size distribution along the length of the core referring to fig 3 the μ ct image of the altered sample contains the rock piece p1 being imaged and does not include the rock piece p2 3 computational methods 3 1 µ ct image analysis and image based simulations 3 1 1 image processing a number of key limitations exist when applying the µ ct technique to study intact and successively altered core samples subject to a variety of processes such as dissolution precipitation and mechanical loading first image resolution is one of the most important barriers to capture features at extremely small scales the resolution can be enhanced by reducing the sample volume scanned this in turn may reduce the size of the image below the representative elementary volume rev of the sample which should be considered for representative macroscale property calculations second the occurrence of image noise is inevitable noise degrades the image quality and hence the further image based characterization accuracy a number of algorithms have been developed to efficiently reduce noise from tomographic images gonzales and wintz 1987 mallat 1989 perona and malik 1990 catté et al 1992 the third difficulty relates to successive imaging of a sample during ex situ sample alteration in practice it is impossible to return the sample to the same position and orientation with micron precision wildenschild and sheppard 2013 recently a procedure has been proposed by qajar and arns 2016 in order to accurately compare the successive images of the same core for image based calculations of micro and macro scale property evolution the proposed approach includes five steps 1 registration of successive images 2 rescaling of grey scale images to a common intensity range 3 image enhancement using appropriate noise filtering techniques 4 further rescaling of the filtered images to common intensity range 5 image segmentation and microporous phases assignment this approach was previously applied to the images used in this study accompanied by the statistical uncertainty analysis qajar and arns 2016 in this paper a brief description of the methods used to pre process and segment the image data is given key to the success of the analysis given here is 1 registration of the successive images of the core sample subject to chemical dissolution in order to directly observe the evolution of microstructure including pore structure in particular and integrate the image data 2 rescaling of different images of the core sample taken at different conditions in order to transform the image data to the same reference frame and 3 segmentation of the registered rescaled successive images of the core sample in order to accurately partition different phases in the images all other image post processing steps are based on the segmented images regarding the acquired images of the sample in this study the pre and post dissolution registered images were first rescaled to a common 8 bit intensity range in a linear fashion then a combination of anisotropic diffusion sheppard et al 2004 and gaussian smoothing wang et al 2014 filters was applied to reduce noise and enhance the quality of the images quantitative measurements of the signal to noise ratios of the pore and grain regions were previously reported in qajar and arns 2016 finally the converging active contours cac method sheppard et al 2004 was utilized to partition the images into three phases of macropore or resolved pore intermediate and grain phases the macropore phase shows pores fully resolved in the µ ct images while the intermediate phase voxel contains some mixture of both void and solid within its volume the pore space in the intermediate phase is commonly referred to as micropores or subresolution pores the image processing and phase partitioning was accomplished using the medial axis and network generation mango software tool developed at anu sheppard et al 2004 the resulting datasets were visualized using an open source volume rendering software drishti limaye 2012 3 1 2 simulated mercury intrusion and critical pore diameter this paper determined the pore size distributions by simulating the mercury injection on the segmented images simulation of mercury intrusion or capillary drainage transform represents the invasion percolation process of the drainage capillary dominated flow experiment liu et al 2017 during this process the diameter of the largest sphere which can percolate across a connected pore system is called the critical pore diameter lc friedman and seaton 1998 lc is a unique transport length scale that controls the permeability of porous materials according to the critical path analysis scholz et al 2015 the euclidean distance transform edt map is needed for the calculation of critical diameters of percolation the simulation of lc is performed by defining locally for every voxel the diameter of the largest sphere which fully lies within the pore phase and covers that voxel at a fixed capillary pressure equivalent to a pore entry radius all spheres with radii greater than or equal to the equivalent pore entry radius are considered we begin with the largest sphere and increment the sphere radius downwards equivalent to incrementing capillary pressure upwards the non wetting phase saturation is measured as the subset of all spheres that have invaded the pore space one can simulate the complete simulated mercury intrusion curves by considering all possible invading sphere radii hilpert and miller 2001 we used the mango software to calculate the simulated mercury curves and the morphy software arns et al 2001 to calculate the critical pore diameter 3 1 3 calculations of specific pore surface area from µ ct data the specific surface between two phases in a two phase medium is defined as the area of the interface between the two phases per unit volume of the medium the inverse of the specific surface is considered as an important characteristic length scale of the medium yeong and torquato 1998 various methods have been used to calculate the specific surface of pore space in porous media in this paper we compute the evolution of pore surface area from the μ ct images and the mip data high resolution μ ct imaging has been used as a reliable tool for quantifying pore surface area and its changes in the course of physical and chemical processes concerning the six sides of each voxel the geometric pore surface area is simply calculated by counting the number of face pixels of pore voxels that are face adjacent to surrounding solid voxels normalized to the volume of the sample image mathematically 1 s μ c t n p x s p x v i m g where npx is the number of pore solid face pixels spx is the pixel surface area vimg represents image volume and sμ ct is the specific pore surface area in regard to the μ ct images of the sample studied in this paper the pixel surface area spx is equal to 4 49 4 49 µm 2 the surface area calculations were performed using the mango and the morphy software package it is worth noting that the most important issue that needs to be addressed is the dependency of the computed surface area on the resolution of the images this is more challenging when rock samples contain a considerable amount of subresolution porosity in fact the μ ct images cannot provide geometric information at scales below image resolution alternatively the pore surface area can be calculated from the simulated mip using the same approach adopted for the calculations of pore surface area from the experimental mip data see subsection 4 4 3 in this method the pore surface area calculations are limited to the resolution of the images used for simulations of the mercury intrusion process 3 1 4 numerical calculations of permeability and formation factor the permeability is calculated based on a lattice boltzmann lb simulation of flow in 3d segmented images using the d3q19 model qian and zhou 1998 the boundary conditions bcs at the solid fluid interfaces are no flow bcs that are realized using the bounce back rule martys and chen 1996 and the pressure gradient acting on the fluid is simulated by the body force ferreol and rothman 1995 the formation factor calculations are based on a solution of the laplace equation with charge conservation boundary conditions arns et al 2001 the 3d image is first converted into a network of resistors by connecting each pair of adjacent voxels with a resistor then a homogeneous electrical field is applied along each of the major tomogram axes and the potential field is solved for using a finite element formulation bohn and garboczi 2003 we assume an idealized case assigning zero conductivity to all mineral phases and a conductivity equal to one to the fluid filled pore phase we used the morphy software for permeability and formation factor calculations 3 2 analysis of mip data 3 2 1 pore size distribution and pore surface area the mip data by itself provides no information about the distribution of pore throat sizes to generate psd from mip data an appropriate model must be employed the usual model used to interpret mip data is the bundle of capillary tubes model diamond 2000 according to this model the well known washburn s equation is applied to estimate the diameter d of cylindrical pores intruded by mercury at each pressurizing step diamond 2000 2 d 4 γ cos θ p where γ is the surface tension θ is the contact angle of mercury on the solid surface and p is the applied mercury pressure the typical mercury limestone surface tension value is 480 dynes cm and the contact angle between air wetting phase and mercury non wetting phase is around 140 howard 1991 ho and hutmacher 2006 the pore size distribution is then calculated by converting the capillary pressure into the pore throat size via the washburn s equation eq 2 and the cumulative mercury intrusion in terms of the percentage of pore volume occupied by mercury into the probability of abundance of each pore in the distribution fig 4 a cumulative curve another typical graph is the log differential intrusion curve vs pore throat size fig 4 a log differential curve which assists in the visual identification of the dominant pore modes romero and simms 2008 it is worth mentioning that while the µ ct method can detect all macropores connected isolated and dead end the mip can only probe the connected pores and throats where mercury intrudes the pore solid specific surface area can be estimated from mip data the pore throat diameter at each incremental pressure step is calculated from the washburn s equation based on a modification made on the assumption of cylindrical pores and the formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder it is possible to estimate pore surface area for each pore throat diameter details of equations used for pore surface area calculations from mip data are presented in appendix a 1 the cumulative total specific pore surface area estimated from mip measurements is here denoted by smip t it is also possible to calculate the specific pore surface area from the largest pore diameter down to a certain or cut off diameter this can help us to define the mip based specific pore surface area denoted by smip mac based on the cut off pore diameter equal to the voxel size of the μ ct image in other words smip mac shows the specific surface area of macropores the pores correspond to the resolved pore space in the μ ct images 3 2 2 pore size statistics several statistical parameters related to mip derived pore throat size distribution can be defined and quantified the average pore diameter dave is defined by 4 over the surface to pore volume ratio of the pore space intruded by mercury see appendix a 2 for the formula the median pore throat diameter by volume dmed v is the diameter where 50 of the total mercury volume has been intruded into the open pores of the sample and is correspondent to the 50 of the cumulative intrusion curve the median pore throat diameter by area dmed a is calculated similar to the median pore throat diameter by volume but based on pore area distribution the threshold pore throat diameter dth is defined as the largest pore throat diameter at which significant intruded pore volume is detected ma 2014 in other words the slope of the cumulative intrusion curve increases abruptly at the threshold diameter above the threshold diameter there is comparatively little mercury intrusion aligizaki 2005 stated that the threshold diameter corresponds to the narrowest path in the interconnected pores as schematically shown in fig 4 b liu and winslow 1995 proposed that the threshold pore throat diameter is a diameter corresponding to the intersection point of the tangent lines drawn on the cumulative distribution curves as schematically shown in fig 4 a the critical pore throat diameter or the characteristic pore diameter denoted by dc or lc is one of the important pore structure parameters that is closely related to permeability and electrical conductivity it is the diameter calculated from the washburn equation for a specific pressure at which mercury first spans the sample and forms an inter connected pathway throughout the sample i e a continuous filament of mercury extends through the pore network of the sample katz and thompson 1987 svendsen et al 2004 aligizaki 2005 argued that the critical pore throat is the most frequently occurring pore size in interconnected pores that allows maximum percolation as schematically shown in fig 4 c swanson 1985 and katz and thompson 1986 adopted the inflection point of the rapidly rising initial portion of the cumulative intrusion curve to mark that specific pressure this inflection point corresponds to the steepest slope of the cumulative intrusion curve i e the highest point in the log differential intrusion curve gao and hu 2013 the determination of dc is schematically shown in fig 4 a it is believed that the critical pore throat diameter is the maximum pore throat diameter that can connect the larger pores and reflect the connectivity of the pore system zhu et al 2019 the pore throats larger than the critical pore throat diameter mainly contribute to flow and hence permeability 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of pore space from sem imaging fig 5 a shows an sem micrograph of the whole core cross section of a 5 mm diameter core sample of the rock with 20 magnification and a resolution of 4 961 µm further investigations were carried out through sem to probe the µm and nm scale pores at higher magnifications fig 5 b f illustrates the sem close up views of the rock corresponding to locations marked by orange rectangles in fig 5 a in fig 5 b f individual ooids ooid center and edge oomoldic pores and sparry cement were visualized at extremely high resolution representing the presence of extremely small pores e g intercrystalline pores within ooid and sparry cement which normally cannot be resolved in the μ ct images but can be detected by the mip technique 4 2 visual inspections of the evolution of pore space from µ ct imaging examples of 2d slices through the 3d registered images are shown in fig 6 preliminary visual inspections of the images clearly show evidence of chemical dissolution of ooids and sparry cement and enlarging of oomoldic pores close observations of the dissolution patterns revealed that the chemical dissolution locally enlarged pores across most sample parts with no visible major flow paths wormholes in this case the chemical dissolution resulted in a homogeneous alteration of the sample pore structure in this paper the resolved porosity macroporosity was separated based on the visual inspections of the images two phase segmentation the three phase segmentation of the images was then carried out using a compromise between the visual inspections of the images and an approximate match between the image based total porosity and lab measured core porosity an example of slices of the partitioning of the macro and micropore phases in the pre and post dissolution core sample is shown in fig 7 where the resolved macropore phase is illustrated in black the grain phase is given in white and the micropore phases are shown in greyscale the intensity of shades of gray is proportional to the void fraction of the microporous phase where the darker gray color represents the microporous phase with a larger void fraction the image based total porosity of the pre dissolution sample gives the value of 27 8 of which 12 5 is macroporosity 50 of the sample image is assigned as an intermediate phase with a microporosity contribution of 15 3 the segmentation results for the post dissolution sample show a total porosity of 41 0 of which 23 5 is macroporosity in this case about 40 of the sample image is assigned as an intermediate phase with a microporosity contribution of 17 6 the segmentation data indicates approximately a double increase in macroporosity but a slight increase in microporosity after the dissolution experiment a comparison between the experimentally and image based measured porosity shows that the total image porosity of the post alteration sample is in a good match with the experimental porosity while the pre alteration image porosity was slightly underestimated mainly due to the presence of the higher amount of image noise overall the difference between the experimental and image porosity can be attributed to the experimental measurement error image quality and noise segmentation error and the fact that we may image only part of the sample it is noted the porosity of the unaltered sample is characterized by 45 of macroporosity this value was increased to 57 5 after the dissolution representing that the initial microporous dominant pore structure converted to the pore system dominated by macropores as a consequence it was expected that the major effect of the chemical dissolution was to largely increase in macroporosity of the sample as evidenced later the image based results were also confirmed by the performed mip tests which showed a significant increase in the number of larger pores after the dissolution experiment luquot et al 2016 found very similar findings in porosity changes while in another study the opposite results were obtained luquot et al 2014 in which the authors argued that the enlargement of micropores could induce the local migration of fines 4 3 characterization of the evolution of pore size and surface area using the mip data before presenting the results of mip measurements and comparing them with the image based results it is essential to address the major limitation of mip derived data the mip method suffers from its assumptions and hence includes several drawbacks diamond 2000 gorce and milestone 2007 zhang et al 2019 first both the advancing and receding contact angles at pore walls are assumed to be uniform second the mip method is not able to detect pores of access diameter larger than a certain size due to limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the mip test in other words the mip data starts at a non zero saturation according to the entry mercury pressure an initial increase in mercury pressure is due to mercury entering surface pores and fractures which may not be detected by the mip method third it is assumed that the pore structure does not change during mip measurements this assumption may not be valid for poorly connected pore structures where the high mercury pressure may break the solid partitions between two adjacent non connected pores cao et al 2016 argued that mip data at pressures 70 mpa and above are unreliable and probably not meaningful due to changes in pore structure including possible particle breakdown and the opening of closed pores fourth the most important limitation is related to the assumptions of the cylindrical pores with uniform radius in other words this method neglects the pore irregularities and the fact that the pore system may be composed of large pore bodies interconnected by narrow pores throats i e ink bottle pores schmitt et al 2015 mercury requires a breakthrough pressure to pass through the throats of non cylindrical pores consequently the distribution curve from the mip measurement should be interpreted as the pore throat diameter distribution despite these limitations the mip method is one of the few techniques that can identify a broad range of pore sizes and quantify porosity surface area and other microstructural parameters 4 3 1 pore space analysis of intact rock sample fig 8 illustrates the mip cumulative incremental and differential intrusion curves of a sister plug of the sample used in the dissolution experiment the chosen sister plug marked as the pre dissolution sample served as a control sample the mip data shows that the rock possessed a wide pore size range and its pore throat sizes are distributed over four orders of magnitude from tens of nanometers to hundred microns it is worth noting that the mip test was not able to detect pores of access diameters larger than 180 µm due to limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the test in other words the experimental mip data starts at a non zero saturation as only pores of diameter 180 µm or less are probed via the mip apparatus 1 psi entry pressure this is while the microscopic and µ ct images of the sample figs 1 and 6 reveal the presence of surface and internal pores of access diameter larger than 180 μm the sem micrographs fig 5 and the µ ct images fig 6 of the rock sample in combination with the mip data fig 8 suggest that the pore space of the rock can be classified as macroporosity occurring within ooids oomoldic porosity and between ooids and within sparry cement interoolitic intergranular macroporosity as well as microporosity within intact ooids and ooid cortices intra oolitic porosity and sparry cement interoolitic microporosity as evident from fig 8 the 4 49 μm from the cumulative intrusion curve one can conclude that more than half of the sample porosity is only accessible via subresolution pores or micropore space even though the incremental intrusion curve in fig 8 shows a large variation from the log differential intrusion curve dv dlogd pore volume versus pore throat diameter the pore size distribution curve of the sample is characterized by a double peak bimodal distribution regarding the method proposed by katz and thompson 1986 for determining the critical pore throat diameter and the pore size of the rock sample as a bimodal distribution we found two critical pore throat diameters in both the macropore and micropore regions the first bump in the log differential intrusion curve covers mainly in the pore size range of 10 20 µm with the pore throat diameter corresponding to the large pore mode the 1st major peak which occurred at 12 µm this pore throat size range belongs to the macropore space the pores with diameters larger than the macro critical pore throat diameter 12 µm are expected to mostly control the permeability of this rock at the initial condition before the chemical dissolution experiment the second bump primarily covers the pore sizes between 30 and 400 nm with the pore throat diameter corresponding to the small classification of the pores into macro and micropores is here based on the resolution of the µ ct images i e pore mode the 2nd peak which occurred at 100 nm this pore throat size range belongs to the micropore space of the rock the two bumps in the differential curve suggest that the pore throat sizes can be divided into three parts 12 μm 12 0 1 μm and 0 1 μm table 1 summarizes statistical results on pore sizes obtained from the mip data for the pre and post dissolution states while the average pore throat diameter of the intact pre dissolution sample is far below the resolution of the μ ct image the median pore throat diameter by volume approximately coincides with the resolution of the pre dissolution μ ct image 4 15 μm in fig 3 highlighting the fact that 50 of the porosity of the pre dissolution sample is accessible via the macropore space region 4 3 2 of chemical dissolution on pore throat diameter from mip data fig 9 compares the mip cumulative incremental and log differential intrusion curves of the pre and post dissolution samples the solid dashed and dotted lines in fig 9 represent the pre dissolution post dissolution sample piece p1 and post dissolution sample piece p2 mip curves respectively since significant changes in pre and post dissolution mip curves are observed we can neglect deviations that could be attributed to the fact that the mercury porosimetry measurements were performed on the sister plug of the sample prior to the dissolution it is apparent from fig 9 that there has been a significant shift in pore throat size distribution to the right the number of macropores significantly increased for the pores larger than 20 μm and decreased for smaller ones a similar observation was obtained for micropores where the number of larger micropores between 400 nm and 2 μm increased while the number of smaller ones decreased as a result a large number of original pores particularly the larger macropores were enlarged or merged to form larger pores during the dissolution experiment since permeability is largely determined by the interconnected macropores with sizes greater than the critical macropore diameter the conducted chemical dissolution has significantly improved the permeability of the sample by first enlarging the macropores and second by increasing the connectivity of the macropore system the changes in the connectivity of the pore system of the rock sample were investigated in detail in our previous paper qajar and arns 2017 fig 9 also gives information about the longitudinal variation of the pore throat size distribution of the post dissolution sample a quick look at fig 9 and table 1 points out a small difference between the mip curves of sample pices p1 and p2 indicating a quasi uniform dissolution within the sample and hence confirming the image based results a comparison between the mip data of the post dissolution sample pieces p1 and p2 indicates a moderately larger increase in the number of larger pores and throats for the near inlet post dissolution piece which confirms the image based porosity profiles obtained in our previous work qajar and arns 2016 table 1 also shows a slightly larger increase in average median and critical pore throat diameters for the near inlet part of the post dissolution sample piece p1 despite the presence of slightly more dissolution induced macropores in the near inlet post dissolution sample the dissolution map as evidenced by the µ ct images is very close to uniform along the core length the changes in the pore throat size statistics calculated from the mip data are reported in table 1 if one estimates the mip incremental intrusion curves in both pre and post dissolution states as unimodal distributions the calculated mean and median pore diameters suggest that the mip curves are negative skew representing the largest occurrence of the pore size is in the macropore region the mean and median pore diameters significantly increased after the chemical dissolution it can be argued from the mip cumulative curves that the threshold pore throat diameter considerably increased after the dissolution experiment despite the inability to detect pores of access diameters larger than 180 µm in the mip tests data from table 1 also indicates that the macro critical pore throat diameter corresponding to the top of the first major peak in fig 9 c increased from 12 µm to 52 µm after the dissolution test this shows that mercury quickly formed a connected filament through the pore space of the post dissolution sample during mercury intrusion at the low pressure stage as a result one can conclude that the enlarged oomoldic pores with diameters greater than 52 µm govern fluid flow and hence permeability in the post dissolution sample the micro critical pore throat diameter corresponding to the top of the second major peak in fig 9 c also increased from 0 1 µm to 1 1 µm in order to obtain a better understanding of the effect of the chemical dissolution on the evolution of pore throat size we consider a relative change in pore throat number denoted by r the corresponding equations used for the calculation of r are given in appendix a 1 fig 10 shows the relative change in the incremental intrusion volume versus pore throat diameter for both the altered sample pieces and can be interpreted as the ratio of changes in the number of pore throats for a given pore throat diameter the zero r in fig 10 means no change in the relative pore throat number during the chemical dissolution process whereas the positive and negative r values indicate an increase and decrease in relative pore throat number respectively fig 10 clearly shows that the chemical dissolution did not uniformly change the number of different pore throat diameters the largest increase is found for pore throat diameters between 20 100 μm based on the data of altered sample pieces p1 and p2 the most observed increase in the number of pore throat diameters occurred for pore throat diameters of 90 and 50 μm based on the mip data of the altered sample pieces p1 and p2 respectively with an average value of 70 μm fig 10 swift and fogler 1977 defined the threshold reactivity diameter as the pore throat diameter above which the dissolution has the largest effect fig 10 shows the largest relative increase in pore throat number occurs at diameters greater than 20 μm both mip tests on pieces p1 and p2 illustrate that the relative change in pore throat number is close to zero for pore throat diameters below 20 μm indicating little or no change in pore throat number consequently we found that the effectiveness of the chemical dissolution was greatest for larger pores and throats in the macro pore region defined by the μ ct images the mip results are consistent with visual observations of the μ ct images indicating considerable enlarging of oomoldic and intergranular macropores fig 6 4 3 3 analysis of the evolution of specific pore surface area using mip data we calculated the specific pore area according to the procedure explained in section 3 2 2 fig 11 shows the cumulative specific pore surface area before and after the chemical dissolution experiment it is evident that pore throats with diameters below 1 μm contributed to about 95 of the total pore area for both the pre and post dissolution samples the pore throat diameter is inversely proportional to the specific pore area which indicates a larger cumulative specific pore area for the post dissolution sample however there was a dramatic decrease when the pore throat diameter was below 0 08 μm it can be argued that there are more micro nanopores and micro nanothroats found after the chemical dissolution and that these micropores and microthroats contribute to an increase in the pore area but not the pore volume table 2 reports the results of the cumulative specific pore surface area from the mip method for the pre and post dissolution samples it was found that the total specific pore surface area smip t was reduced by 21 after the dissolution based on the average values of the cumulative specific pore areas of sample pieces p1 and p2 it is also possible to evaluate the changes in pore surface area based on a specific pore throat diameter in particular based on the cut off pore throat diameter equal to the voxel size of the μ ct image the specific pore surface area smip mac almost remained unchanged after the dissolution based on the information obtained from the sample piece p1 however smip mac decreased by 8 based on the average mip data of the sample pieces p1 and p2 4 4 image based quantification of changes in pore size and pore surface area 4 4 1 analysis of the evolution of pore size from the μ ct images various approaches have been adopted to study pore size distribution psd from μ ct image data in this paper we use the distribution of the maximal covering spheres percolating the sample as pore diameter distribution this can be obtained by simulating mercury intrusion porosimetry simulated mip based on 3d microstructural data provided from the μ ct image the simulations were performed on the resolved pore space macropores of the whole registered images fig 12 shows a comparison between the simulated mip curves and the experimental mip measurements on the core sample it is worth mentioning that the simulated mip curves are limited to the voxel size of the images and do not cover the whole pore size range of the sample detected by experimental mip from the simulated mip data we found that the number of larger macropores pores larger than 40 μm significantly increased and slightly decreased for smaller ones a similar analysis of the relative change in macropore number was performed on the simulated mip data and it was found that the largest increase in macropore number occurred for a pore diameter of 60 μm which is in good agreement with the value of 70 μm obtained from the experimental mip data fig 10 it is noted that the image based simulated mip data has a necessary cut off at porosities associated with pores below the voxel size of the image regarding the complex pore structure of the sample fig 12 indicates an acceptable agreement between the experimental and simulated mip data as expected the pore size distribution based on the simulated mip overestimated the larger pores which consequently shifted the psd in the direction of the bigger pores table 3 reports the estimated average threshold and critical pore diameter from the simulated mip curves of the pre and post dissolution images here the estimations were performed similarly to those obtained from the experimental mip data the results show that despite a slight increase in the average pore diameter the threshold and critical pore diameters increased significantly after the dissolution in particular the critical pore diameter increased from 45 to 72 μm a comparison with the experimental mip results table 1 shows that the image based method overpredicts the pore size statistics primarily due to the disability of the μ ct images to detect whole pore space with detailed pore structure 4 4 2 effects of chemical dissolution on pore surface area from μ ct data the μ ct data can be used to characterize the influence of chemical dissolution on the surface area between pore and solid phases based on the spatially resolved voxel evolution regions in this technique the geometric pore surface area is simply calculated by counting the number of direct solid neighbor voxels to each pore voxel to characterize the evolution of pore surface area first the μ ct method requires a precise 3d registration of the original and altered images in a common coordinate system second the surface area computed from μ ct images is highly dependent on the resolution of the images in other words the existence of a considerable amount of intermediate phase makes the quantification of the pore solid surface area difficult the latter problem is more difficult to experimentally deal with especially when the rock sample contains subresolution porosity we have conducted a stable chemical dissolution test in a small rock sample to increase the image resolution as much as possible the μ ct data is used here to measure the surface area between macropores and the solid phase the measured surface area involves the surface area of both connected and unconnected pores the μ ct data is not able to capture the geometry at scales below the image resolution regarding the images of the core sample studied in this paper the ooid grain roughness grains smaller than the resolution of the images and microporosity are not distinguishable in the images therefore we cannot measure the actual or more strictly the subresolution or submicron pore solid surface area from the images however observations of the pre and post dissolution images as well as the mercury porosimetry measurements show that the conducted chemical dissolution test mainly affects the macropore space in fact the surface area of major flow pathways is more important than the surface area in isolated pores or micropores that do not contribute much to fluid flow noiriel et al 2009 therefore changes in actual pore solid surface area are largely influenced by changes in macropore surface area consequently μ ct can be a useful tool for estimating effective pore surface area changes here the macropore surface area i e the surface area between macropore and non macropore phases denoted by sμ ct mac was estimated by directly counting the number of voxels and faces of the macropore phase on the image as well as by using the simulated mip curve in this case the image based pore surface area is denoted by sμ ct mac fig 13 shows the variation of specific surface area between macropore and non macropore phases along the flow direction for each slice of the images the initial specific surface area of macropores shows local variability while the macropore specific surface area of the post dissolution sample exhibits more uniformity representing the surface area of macropore space changed almost uniformly along the flow direction after the dissolution test alternatively it is possible to evaluate the evolution of macropore surface area using the simulated mip data fig 14 illustrates the cumulative specific macropore surface area before and after the chemical dissolution experiment here the calculations of the total specific macropore surface area from the simulated mip data are similar to the procedure adopted for the experimental mip data analysis for pore surface area the porosity used in calculating the macropore surface area based on the simulated mip was the macroporosity not the total porosity obtained from the segmentation of the images it is evident from fig 14 that the cumulative specific macropore area is larger for the post dissolution sample table 4 summarizes the total macropore specific surface area values from the image data 4 5 discussion a comparison between the mip and μ ct methods in the quantification of the evolution of pore surface area from experimental mip data table 2 we found that the specific total pore surface area decreased by 21 even for macropores the experimental mip data exhibits an 8 reduction in specific pore surface area conversely the image based data based on the segmentation into resolved pore space shows a significant increase in pore surface area table 4 since from the experimental mip data fig 8 more than half the sample pore size is less than the resolution of the images it is concluded that the evaluation of the pore surface area of the sample based on resolvable pore space from images was inaccurate and ignoring micropores as part of the pore system led to a considerable error despite the ability of the mip technique in the quantification of the pore surface area for a wide range of pore sizes down to a few nanometers this method assumes the model of the bundle of capillary tubes which neglects the actual pore structure of the rocks on the other hand the µ ct method provides a relatively accurate representation of the pore structure but the weak point in the µ ct method is that the image based results are dependent on the image resolution and ignoring subresolution pores results in a significant error although the rock investigated in this study are highly microporous the dissolution mainly affects the larger pores of the sample in the macropore region hence the use of both methods can give a complementary insight in analysis of the changes in pore surface area measurements of the pore surface area with µ ct reveal that when we ignored microporosity the specific surface area of macropores increased by an average of 40 first column in table 4 this is primarily due to the enlargement of macropores and is consistent with the fact that the conducted chemical dissolution had the largest effect on the macropores and macrothroats with diameters greater than 20 µm fig 10 observations of the µ ct images fig 6 reveal that the pore size of oomoldic and interoolitic macropores increases whereas the pore size of oolitic grains ooids decreases in the macropore region of the sample the dissolution induced enlargement of oomoldic and interoolitic pores was dominant and increased pore surface area however when we look at the experimental mip data the total specific pore surface area was reduced by 21 after the dissolution test first column in table 2 even when we calculated the changes in pore surface area from the experimental mip data for pore sizes down to the cut off size equal to the resolution of the µ ct images we found a slight decrease of 8 in pore surface area second column in table 2 4 6 predictions of the changes in permeability so far we have focused on the analysis of the evolution of two characteristic parameters of the pore phase i e pore size distribution and pore surface area during the chemical dissolution in this section we evaluate the evolution of permeability based on the pore scale information provided by the mip and μ ct techniques this is of great importance since an improved estimation of the evolution of macroscopic rock properties including porosity and permeability can potentially assist in managing the risks associated with the reactive processes in sub surface formations to evaluate the evolution of permeability during chemical dissolution based on the pore scale descriptors calculated from the mip and μ ct methods we consider two well known permeability estimation models i e the katz thomson kt and the kozeny carman kc equations the predicted changes in permeability are compared with those calculated directly on the images using the lattice boltzmann lb flow simulation in 3d segmented images the kt and kc models are briefly described as follows katz thompson kt equation one of the most common methods for estimating permeability uses the equation given by katz and thompson 1986 3 k c k t l c 2 1 f where k is permeability ckt is a prefactor that depends on the distribution of pore sizes in the rock bauget et al 2005 lc is a characteristic pore size and f is a dimensionless parameter called the formation factor the constant ckt is of the order of 1 226 katz and thompson 1986 the characteristic pore size in eq 3 is usually taken to be the critical pore diameter which was directly measured here from the mip curves see the two last columns in table 1 we calculated the critical pore diameter and formation factors for several subvolumes of the images as previously mentioned in sec 3 1 5 the calculations were based on the resolved pore space alternatively the formation factor can be estimated from the experimental mip data eq 4 was proposed by katz and thompson 1987 to estimate the formation factor from the same mip data used to measure the characteristic pore size lc 4 1 f l max e l c ϕ s l max e where ϕ is the porosity l m a x e is a pore size at which hydraulic conductance is maximum and s l m a x e is the fraction of total porosity filled at l m a x e or in other words the fractional volume of connected pore space involving pores with sizes l m a x e and larger katz and thompson 1987 argued that l m a x e can be estimated from the following relation for very broad size ditributions 5 l max e 0 34 l c according to the kt equation a non wetting fluid can have access from one face of the sample to the other when the driving pressure is sufficient to allow the fluid to penetrate the smallest pore throat of diameter lc in the most efficient conducting pathway cerepi et al 2003 kozeny carman kc equation one of the widely used models for permeability is the kozeny carman equation torquato 2002 6 k c k c ϕ 3 s p 2 where sp is the specific pore surface area per unit bulk volume and ckc called the kozeny s constant is a constant and generally depends on pore geometry and tortuosity the specific pore surface area was calculated using both the mip see table 2 and the μ ct images see table 4 as previously observed the chemical dissolution locally enlarged pores across most parts of the sample with no visible major flow paths wormholes and led to a quasi uniform dissolution pattern within the sample at this condition it is reasonable to assume that the constants of the kt and kc equations i e ckt and ckc remained unchanged during the uniform dissolution pattern hence we propose to use the following relations to assess changes in the permeability of rock samples due to chemical dissolution based on the kt equation using the critical pore size and formation factor data and based on the kc equation using the porosity and specific surface area data 7 k k 0 k t μ c t l c l c 0 2 f 0 f 8 k k 0 k c ϕ ϕ 0 3 s p 0 s p 2 where the subscript 0 refers to the properties before the dissolution test inserting eqs 4 and 5 in eq 7 leads to 9 k k 0 k t m i p l c l c 0 2 ϕ ϕ 0 s 0 34 l c s 0 34 l c 0 regarding the post dissolution mip data we averaged between the results of the sample pieces p1 and p2 for the calculations of changes in permeability in order to provide a more accurate comparison between the mip based results and the lab based measurements it is worth mentioning that if the purpose is to compare the image based and mip based results we should use the mip data of the sample piece p1 because the μ ct image of the post dissolution sample corresponded to the sample piece p1 4 6 1 the evolution of porosity table 5 compares the experimentally measured porosity values in pre and post alteration states and the porosity ratios ϕ ϕ 0 i e the ratio of post to pre dissolution porosity and the corresponding results obtained by the mip and µ ct methods the µct based porosity results were obtained for the image volumes depicted in fig 3 using the cac segmentation method it is worth mentioning that the macroporosity was separated based on the visual inspections of the µ ct images in the first segmentation stage known as two phase segmentation in the second stage of phase partitioning i e three phase segmentation the phase separations were carried out using a compromise between the visual inspections of the images and an approximate match between the image based total porosity and lab measured core porosity the total porosity of the sample derived from the μ ct images is obviously in a reasonable match with the values measured experimentally in the lab by the saturation method the differences particularly for the pre dissolution sample can be attributed to the image noise and the fact that we imaged only part of the sample which indicates that the μ ct calculated parameters are restricted to the part of the sample imaged regarding the mip method the total porosity at the pre dissolution condition is somewhat lower than the lab measured value mainly because the mip measurements were performed on the sister plug of the sample not the sample itself before the dissolution measurements of the total porosity of the post dissolution sample using the mip method exhibit an excellent agreement with respect to the lab measured experimental data for both the mip and μ ct methods it is possible to calculate the macroporosity ratio ϕ ϕ 0 macro the microporosity ratio ϕ ϕ 0 micro and the total porosity ratio ϕ ϕ 0 total while the formers i e the macro and microporosity ratio are not possible to be measured in the lab regarding the resolved pore space macropore region both the mip and μ ct methods revealed that the macroporosity has approximately doubled in contrast the microporosity slightly increased after the dissolution as indicated by both the mip and μ ct data 4 6 2 evaluations of the changes in permeability based on the macropore space the numerical calculations of the critical pore diameter formation factor and the lbm permeability were performed on several subvolumes with the full section area of the image data and 200 or 400 pixel thicknesses in along the flow axis multiple measurements on image data give computational predictions of properties rather than obtaining a single data point we have previously found that the size of subvolumes was sufficiently larger than the pore size correlation length which allows producing representative results fig 15 shows the ratio of altered post dissolution to unaltered pre dissolution permeability k k 0 calculated directly by the lbm method plotted against the estimated k k 0 by the kt and kc models using the image based data based on the resolved pore space or macropores we found that the estimated permeability ratios from the kt model eq 7 were in the same order of magnitude as those obtained with the lbm on the contrary the estimated permeability ratios from the kc model eq 8 differed from the lbm results between one and three orders of magnitude highlighting that ignoring the micropore surface area significantly underestimated the permeability ratio this result demonstrates that the kt model can reasonably predict the permeability evolution of the studied complex carbonate sample from the image based critical pore diameter and formation factor data of the resolved pore space furthermore the result suggests that the critical pore diameter lc of the macroporous phase governs the fluid flow through the microporous carbonate sample and hence it is an appropriate length scale for the prediction of the dissolution induced permeability evolution of the studied rock sample during the uniform dissolution processes it is also of interest here to compare the average values of the permeability ratios k k 0 obtained from the kt model and lbm method for the images subvolumes in our case where the subvolumes are arranged in series and the permeability changes only perpendicular to the flow direction the harmonic average provides the effective permeability assuming constant ckt the average values of the permeability ratios k k 0 are given by 10 k k 0 k t μ c t i 1 n f 0 i l c 0 i 2 i 1 n f i l c i 2 table 6 compares the average post dissolution permeability ratio to that of pre dissolution calculated by the lbm and the corresponding values estimated by the kt model using the mip or µ ct data the reported data in the first row of table 6 i e k k 0 macro were based on the resolved macroporous phase a comparison with the lbm permeability ratio shows that the kt model reasonably predicts the permeability ratio using the data of the critical pore diameter and the formation factor the difference in results between the lbm and the kt models based on the mip data can be attributed to the inability to detect pores of access diameters larger than 180 µm due to the limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the mip test this led to difficulty estimating reliable critical pore throat diameter particularly for the post dissolution mip cumulative curves wee fig 9 the image based method also significantly overpredicted the critical pore size due primarily to resolution limitations note that the sample studied in this paper is highly microporous in both the pre and post dissolution states as evidenced by the mip curves fig 9 so it is anticipated that ignoring micropore space may induce considerable uncertainty in predicting the changes in permeability 4 6 3 incorporation of microporosity into predictions of changes in permeability the presence of subresolution pore space or microporosity and its potential role in flow and transport is of great importance and has been investigated in a few studies knackstedt et al 2006 apourvari and arns 2014 soulaine et al 2016 even though we found that the macropore system mainly controlled the permeability of the rock sample and its changes it is intriguing to explore the effects of micropores on the evolution of permeability during the chemical dissolution experiment this is important here because the rock sample considered in this study contained a high amount of microporosity to assess the effect of microporosity on the performance of the kt method as a prediction model the lbm permeability and the critical pore diameter were calculated for a pore phase that comprised of macropores and the largest quartile of micropores in this regard the macropore voxels were merged with the microporous voxels with a porosity of 100 down to a porosity of 75 5 and the calculations along the flow axis were performed for this combined phase the results are reported in the second row of table 6 i e k k 0 macro micro it is revealed that the inclusion of microporosity into property calculations significantly reduced the permeability ratio values and generally improved the predictions of changes in permeability this suggests that the evolution of micropores during the chemical dissolution experiment affected the changes in permeability to some extent it is concluded that the two phase segmentation of the images with neglecting the spatial distribution of micropores increased the uncertainty in predicting the changes in permeability using the kt method as a predictive model based on the image data 5 summary and conclusions the research presented and discussed in this paper explores the use of mercury intrusion and 3d pore scale imaging via µ ct to characterize the influence of chemical dissolution on the pore structure of a carbonate sample we have addressed several challenges behind implementing both approaches for reactive flow study in microporous porous media limiting the usability of the acquired data in particular chemical dissolution experiments should be conducted on smaller core samples typically at a millimeter scale to acquire higher resolution images this leads to the challenge of characterizing the microstructure of the cores at a higher resolution and then connecting it to the macro scale descriptors and properties we obtained experimental control points in the form of a quasi uniform dissolution pattern within a millimeter scale core sample which allowed us to connect the pore scale structural evolution to changes in macroscopic properties both the μ ct images and mip revealed that the dissolution significantly enlarged the pores of the sample in a quasi uniform manner with no visible detected wormholes regarding the macropore space the mip method cannot detect pores of access diameters larger than a certain size due to limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the test this is while the evolution of macropores can be accurately quantified from the µ ct images the mip results showed that the total pore surface area was reduced after the dissolution while the μ ct method showed an increase in the surface area of resolved macropores while the mip method can probe the tiny pores down to a few tens of nanometers and hence a more realistic estimation of parameters such as surface area of pores the µ ct despite being limited in resolution provides a spatial description of the dissolution pattern and can be used to directly study the percolation properties and simulate mercury intrusion through the pore space furthermore the µ ct enables us to provide multiple measurements and hence can be used for predictive models this is while the mip and other usual laboratory techniques provide single measurements and are not able to determine the spatial distribution of micro and macro scale properties within a core sample we evaluated the fractional changes in permeability using the katz thompson kt and kozeny carman kc relations based on the calculated critical pore diameter pore surface area and formation factor compared to the lbm method we found that the kt could predict the ratio of altered post dissolution to unaltered pre dissolution permeability more accurately this suggests that the evolution of permeability in the core sample is controlled by the changes in the critical pore diameter based on the image data the kc model failed to predict the permeability ratio due mainly to ignoring the micropores in pore surface area calculations it was also found that the inclusion of microporosity in the critical pore diameter calculations improved the predictions of changes in permeability the results of this paper indicated that although large macropores were mainly affected by the chemical dissolution the evolution of micropores exhibited a moderate effect when predicting changes in the

100,in this paper we report on experimental and computational studies investigating the evolution of pore structure and permeability of a microporous carbonate rock during chemical dissolution using information provided from x ray micro computed tomography µ ct and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip techniques we consider a chemical dissolution in a core sample by a nonacidic solution wherein a quasi uniform modification of pore structure occurred first we conduct a comparative analysis on the capabilities and limitations of the µ ct and mip methods to quantify the evolution of pore size and pore surface area in particular we incorporate micropores into the calculations of the pore size related parameters to highlight the uncertainties that ignoring microporosity causes in the second part of the paper we present predictive results on the fractional changes in the permeability of the rock using the katz thompson kt and kozeny carman kc models the predictions are based on two characteristic parameters of the pore phase i e the critical pore diameter and the specific pore surface area and two characteristic macro scale properties i e porosity and formation factor all calculated from both the mip and µ ct methods the predicted changes in permeability are compared with those calculated directly on the images using the lattice boltzmann lb flow simulation on segmented images the effect of changes in microporosity is also assessed to investigate its role in permeability evolution the results showed that the kt model could reasonably predict the fractional

problem that is central in a wide variety of geochemical processes such as acidizing of petroleum reservoirs ali and nasr el din 2020 contaminant transport in groundwater resources nick et al 2013 and geological storage of co2 liu et al 2019 and hydrogen hassanpouryouzband et al 2021 these processes often induce substantial changes in rock microstructure which in turn may significantly change the petrophysical and transport properties of the rock in the petroleum industry billions of dollars are spent annually on oil and gas exploration and developing complex and risky reservoirs particularly carbonate reservoirs during the life cycle of a reservoir chemical dissolution plays an important role from treating formation damage resulting from drilling operations to using acids and other chemicals for improved and enhanced oil recovery a better understanding of chemical dissolution at the pore scale can for example lead to improvement in the performance of reactive processes during the development of reservoirs and hence dramatically reduce the associated costs changes in petrophysical and transport properties of sedimentary rocks strongly depend on the evolution of pore structure including pore throat shape and size pore surface area and connectivity of the pore system garing et al 2014 qajar and arns 2017 among sedimentary rocks carbonates show particular features and are much more susceptible to alteration than sandstones when exposed to the flow of reactive fluids in subsurface formations the characterization of changes in the microstructure of carbonate rocks is extremely challenging because these rocks often exhibit complex microstructure and disorder over a wide range of length scales knackstedt et al 2007 this complexity causes considerable variability in relations of structure and topology to physical properties most carbonate rocks comprise a variety of pore and grain types with irregular spatial distributions and a wide spectrum of pore sizes from nanometers to centimeters and hence the macro scale properties of carbonate rocks e g permeability and electrical conductivity are highly variable ramakrishnan et al 2001 arns et al 2004 as a result it has been of great importance to accurately characterize the pore structure of carbonate rocks its evolution during geochemical processes and the relation between the evolution in pore scale descriptors and changes in macroscale properties two widely techniques used to characterize the pore structure of porous materials including conventional and unconventional reservoir rocks are mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and x ray computed tomography ct especially microtomography μ ct the mip method has primarily been used for decades to determine the pore size distribution psd and pore volume of various porous media schmitt et al 2015 sidiq et al 2020 this method is based on a bundle of capillary tubes model contrary to a real porous structure wherein a complex network of pores and throats exists hence some authors have referred to the mip based void size distribution as pore access size distribution feia et al 2014 nonetheless the high pressure mip makes it possible to probe the nano scale void space of porous materials particularly tight rocks ma et al 2020 from mip based pore throat size distribution it is possible to calculate a range of pore and core scale properties purcell 1949 liu and winslow 1995 aligizaki 2005 in recent years in particular the use of x ray μ ct and the image based simulations known as digital rock physics drp is a rapidly evolving research field and is increasingly being used to quantitatively characterize the microstructure and properties of materials via tomographically recorded 3d media flannery et al 1987 spanne et al 1994 arns et al 2003 derzhi et al 2010 knackstedt et al 2011 andrä et al 2013 cnudde and boone 2013 berg et al 2017 hassanpouryouzband et al 2020 wang and miller 2020 ni et al 2021 in the μ ct technique high resolution images of the material specimen are acquired at micro and nano meter scales and processed to create accurate 3d digital data the material structure parameters and physical properties are then computed using advanced numerical techniques at the pore scale the main advantage of the μ ct method is the ability to nondestructively probe the inner nonvisible structure pore system and surface morphology of materials allowing one to follow microstructure evolution in real time a major source of uncertainty in μ ct is the image resolution that can be attained for a specimen elkhoury et al 2019 although 2d other imaging techniques such as thin section microscopy yarmohammadi et al 2020 scanning electron microscopy kuzmin and skibitskaya 2017 and atomic force microscopy hassenkam et al 2011 can provide images with higher resolutions and hence combine with μ ct for better assessment of rock pore space and grains several studies have reported a combined use of the mip and µ ct for the characterization of material internal structure ho and hutmacher 2006 compared µ ct with other methods including the mip for the characterization of scaffolds they argued that the possibility of sample compression and even collapse at very high mercury pressure the reactions of mercury with some metals such as aluminum the assumption of the cylindrical pores and the sample contamination with mercury are major limitations of the mip this is while the µ ct has crucial advantages of being non destructive and identifying spatial distributions of internal features they mentioned thresholding and beam hardening as the main concerns of using µ ct the applications of mip and sem for microstructure evaluation in unsaturated soils were reviewed by romero and simms 2008 they pointed out the main limitations of mip such as inaccessible pores including isolated pores and pores which are accessible through smaller ones non intruded pores non detected pores due to the apparatus minimum pressure limits and deformation of the sample container they mentioned that the mip does not achieve true psd due to several constraints including sample treatment and pore accessibility fusi and martinez martinez 2013 suggested using µ ct imaging before and after mercury intrusion to accurately characterize the structural features of low porosity carbonates the pore systems of complex carbonate formations were studied by njiekak et al 2018 using µ ct mercury intrusion and helium porosimetry they argued that it is crucial to use various techniques when evaluating the multiscale porosity of rocks with a considerable amount of both the connected and non connected pores considering that the µ ct can provide information on both the connected and non connected macropores resolved pores and the mip can give connected porosity resolved and non resolved pores combining the data depict an accurate picture of the rock pore system a complete characterization of a tight sandstone was reported by cheng et al 2019 using µ ct sem imaging and mercury intrusion the issue of characterizing the evolution of rock structure due to various processes particularly chemical dissolution using the mip and or computed tomography techniques has been investigated by several researchers the early work by swift and fogler 1977 investigated the evolution of pore size of sandstones due to acidizing using a mercury injection technique they observed that while the pore sizes of the cores ranged from 0 03 to 30 μm the dissolution happened only in those pores larger than about 1 μm based on these results they introduced a threshold reactivity diameter concept as a pore size above which the dissolution has the largest effect bazin et al 1995 studied acidizing of limestone cores using the x ray ct and mercury intrusion they qualitatively investigated the dissolution pattern by the ct images and evaluated the changes in pore size distribution after acidizing by mercury injection curves they found that the acidizing process predominantly affected the larger pores in another study burlion et al 2006 used the μ ct method to analyze the mortar microstructure variations during an accelerated leaching process they quantified the evolution of porosity during the process their findings are of great importance in the modeling study of concrete durability a uniform rock structure modification due to dissolution caused by co2 injection was studied by egermann et al 2010 they conducted mercury porosimetry measurements before and after the alteration and found that the distribution of small pore radii was rather unaffected regardless of the rock types they observed major modifications of the distributions for the larger pores but in a different manner according to the particular rock type interestingly it was found that for the low permeable rock the dissolution increased the intermediate pore radii while the large pores of the high permeable rock mainly increased after the dissolution this explained the variations in permeability evolution of the rocks where the largest permeability increase was obtained for the rock type with the most pronounced increase in larger pores egermann et al 2010 gouze and luquot 2011 used the μ ct facility at esrf grenoble france to investigate the spatial distribution of the effective hydraulic radius and tortuosity to examine the different porosity permeability relationships observed for homogeneous and heterogeneous dissolution patterns they found that for homogeneous dissolution the permeability increase was due to the decrease of the tortuosity whereas the combination of tortuosity and hydraulic radius changes were controlling factors for permeability in heterogeneous dissolution luquot et al 2014 investigated the structural changes in limestone samples induced by co2 rich brine using microtomography they analyzed various dissolution patterns in relation to the partial pressure of co2 and found that the initial rock structure strongly controlled the permeability porosity relationship in another paper by luquot et al 2016 changes in pore size distribution and pore connectivity of a limestone sample induced by an acidic solution were investigated they compared the evolution of the pore scale parameters computed by x ray µ ct images and laboratory experiments and obtained good agreement between them despite the high dependence of image based computed parameters on the resolution particularly for the fluid rock interface the µ ct method yielded similar results for the micro and macro scale rock properties as the laboratory experiments in a much shorter time and in a non destructive way aside from the changes in pore size distribution the μ ct method has also been employed to geometrically estimate the changes in specific surface area after chemical dissolution noiriel et al 2004 noiriel et al 2009 gouze and luquot 2011 these studies emphasized that the grain and or grain roughness smaller than the μ ct resolution could not be measured and the pore grain interface area was a priori underestimated dal ferro et al 2012 conducted a comparative study of the µ ct and mip for evaluation of cambisols structure under fertilization treatments they argued that the mip measurements were necessary to identify small pores that were not resolved by the µ ct imaging they found that compared to the µ ct method the mip detected micropores were underestimated but macropores overestimated due to the ink bottle effect it was also found that only the µ ct could show the impacts of organic amendments on pore morphology the microstructure of the original and tectonic coals was explored by the mip and µ ct by k zhang et al 2019 in addition to psd they used the mip results to assess the connectivity of the pore system and found that tectonic stress created many noneffective pores with pore opening constrictions they also examined the evolution of the morphology of macropores and fractures using µ ct this study clearly highlights the significance of employing various techniques when analyzing the microstructure of complex porous media in a recent interesting paper sidiq et al 2020 reviewed the application of x ray tomography and mip for the characterization of concrete pores cracks content and structure for self healing cementitious materials they briefly discuss some sources of limitations such as the noise level and the thresholding as the major factors contributing to the errors in the μ ct technique and the applied pressure and the non intruded internal pores and cracks as the main types of errors in the mip leading to inaccurate results comprehensive reviews regarding the evolution of pore scale structure and permeability during geochemical processes are provided in noiriel 2015 gan et al 2020 and khan et al 2021 despite previous studies on the study of chemical dissolution in porous materials using various experimental and imaging techniques there is still a need to accurately address the respective challenges when characterizing the evolution of the internal structure of porous rocks using the two powerful tools of µ ct and mip particularly for complex microporous rocks such as carbonates in this study we first aim to explore and compare the scope of application of these two complementary techniques for tracking and characterizing the evolution of the pore structure of a microporous carbonate rock during chemical dissolution we carefully address the respective challenges and limitations of both methods in characterizing the evolution of rock pore structures subject to reactive flow in particular the evolutions of pore size distribution and pore surface area are quantified and the role of micropores is explored the second aim is to predict the resulting changes in permeability due to dissolution using the information provided from 3d µ ct images and mip tests in this regard we consider two well known permeability estimation models i e the katz thompson and the kozeny carman equations in particular we incorporate sub resolution pores into critical pore diameter to evaluate the degree to which the inclusion of microporosity could enhance the prediction of permeability changes 2 experimental methods 2 1 rock sample the core sample was obtained from the savonnières en perthois region in eastern france flugel 2010 fig 1 shows a photograph of the core sample used in this study the rock is an oolitic limestone composed of ellipsoidal particles of calcite known as ooids with diameters ranging from a few tens to thousand microns embedded in sparry calcite cement sparite some ooids are preserved whereas others are completely or partially hollowed out forming oomoldic pores visual observations of the sample revealed the presence of millimeter sized oomoldic pores the xrd test showed that the sample is mainly made of calcite the mineralogical content of the sample is consistent with previous studies by e g zhang et al 2018 and de muynck et al 2011 in which they mentioned the savonniere limestone contains 97 99 calcite and 1 3 biotite 2 2 experimental procedure in this study the experiment involved alternating steps of µ ct imaging and ex situ core sample alteration by chemical dissolution using 0 25 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta solution at ph 12 at ambient conditions under these conditions the dissolution of the sample was mainly performed through ligand promoted dissolution fredd and fogler 1998 here dissolution at high ph is beneficial in reaching a homogeneous alteration of pore structure within the core sample because the kinetics of the chelation reactions dominates the rate of dissolution fig 2 illustrates the schematic diagram of the setup used for the chemical dissolution experiment a small core plug with a diameter and length of 7 0 and 20 6 mm respectively was drilled out from the original rock specimen and dried in an oven it was then sealed on the sides using a fluoropolymer heat shrink and imaged in a dry state using the µ ct facility at the australian national university sakellariou et al 2004 the initial porosity of the sample was measured by the saturation method ϕ 0 30 6 then deionized water was injected at different rates to measure permeability by darcy s law k 0 58 6 md the reactive fluid was injected through the sample at rate of 0 36 cm3 min using a motorized syringe pump and the pressure drop across the sample was monitored by a differential pressure transmitter abb model 2600t pressure range from 0 0000 to 250 0000 kpa the reactive injection was terminated after a significant increase in the permeability of the sample kf 152 4 md the final porosity of the core was measured ϕf 42 6 before it was imaged in a dry state again a 3d registration technique by latham et al 2008 was used to superpose the µ ct image of the disturbed sample to the image of the original unaltered sample tomograms in each state were composed of 20483 voxels fig 3 summarizes the lengths and voxel sizes of pre and post dissolution scans as well as the registered images as schematically shown in fig 3 images of the core sample were taken at about 4 mm from the front of the sample to eliminate the inlet effect with a field of view of at least 8 5 mm the final registered tomograms corresponded to two datasets of 1632 1592 1664 voxels with a common voxel size of 4 49 μm 2 3 scanning electron microscope sem we used sem to display the finer features of the pore systems than those resolved by the µ ct imaging the equipment used for the sem image acquisition of the studied rock was a zeiss ultra plus field emission scanning electron microscope fesem located at the centre for advanced microscopy at the australian national university the fesem microscope was operated at a low accelerating voltage 1 kv and small aperture at a small working distance around 2 mm to maximize the resolution 2 4 mercury intrusion porosimetry mip tests to analyze the internal pore structure and to compare the results obtained from the μ ct imaging we used the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip method as a standard experimental technique to primarily evaluate the pore size distribution psd or more strictly the pore accessibility distribution or pore throat size distribution of the specimen in a mercury intrusion test the non wetting mercury invades in a drainage process the connected pore system according to capillary pressure for each pressure the change in injected volume is recorded in a typical mip test capillary entry pressure mercury air and the volume of intruded mercury into the pore space of the specimen are directly measured in this study mip testing was performed on the rock samples in both the pre and post dissolution conditions using the micromeritics autopore iv 9500 v1 06 mercury porosimeter with a maximum pressure of 30 000 psia to examine the effect of reactive flow on the micro and macro scale properties we performed three mip tests in this work the first test was performed on a sister plug of the intact core sample marked here as the pre dissolution sample the sister plug was chosen very close to the sample imaged after the chemical dissolution experiment was terminated the altered sample marked here as the post dissolution sample was split into two pieces and the mip tests were performed on both the first piece marked as sample piece p1 was located near the injection face inlet of the sample where the acquired μ ct images correspond to this sample piece the other piece was located far from the injection face of the sample marked as sample piece p2 and was also used for the mip study to observe changes in pore size distribution along the length of the core referring to fig 3 the μ ct image of the altered sample contains the rock piece p1 being imaged and does not include the rock piece p2 3 computational methods 3 1 µ ct image analysis and image based simulations 3 1 1 image processing a number of key limitations exist when applying the µ ct technique to study intact and successively altered core samples subject to a variety of processes such as dissolution precipitation and mechanical loading first image resolution is one of the most important barriers to capture features at extremely small scales the resolution can be enhanced by reducing the sample volume scanned this in turn may reduce the size of the image below the representative elementary volume rev of the sample which should be considered for representative macroscale property calculations second the occurrence of image noise is inevitable noise degrades the image quality and hence the further image based characterization accuracy a number of algorithms have been developed to efficiently reduce noise from tomographic images gonzales and wintz 1987 mallat 1989 perona and malik 1990 catté et al 1992 the third difficulty relates to successive imaging of a sample during ex situ sample alteration in practice it is impossible to return the sample to the same position and orientation with micron precision wildenschild and sheppard 2013 recently a procedure has been proposed by qajar and arns 2016 in order to accurately compare the successive images of the same core for image based calculations of micro and macro scale property evolution the proposed approach includes five steps 1 registration of successive images 2 rescaling of grey scale images to a common intensity range 3 image enhancement using appropriate noise filtering techniques 4 further rescaling of the filtered images to common intensity range 5 image segmentation and microporous phases assignment this approach was previously applied to the images used in this study accompanied by the statistical uncertainty analysis qajar and arns 2016 in this paper a brief description of the methods used to pre process and segment the image data is given key to the success of the analysis given here is 1 registration of the successive images of the core sample subject to chemical dissolution in order to directly observe the evolution of microstructure including pore structure in particular and integrate the image data 2 rescaling of different images of the core sample taken at different conditions in order to transform the image data to the same reference frame and 3 segmentation of the registered rescaled successive images of the core sample in order to accurately partition different phases in the images all other image post processing steps are based on the segmented images regarding the acquired images of the sample in this study the pre and post dissolution registered images were first rescaled to a common 8 bit intensity range in a linear fashion then a combination of anisotropic diffusion sheppard et al 2004 and gaussian smoothing wang et al 2014 filters was applied to reduce noise and enhance the quality of the images quantitative measurements of the signal to noise ratios of the pore and grain regions were previously reported in qajar and arns 2016 finally the converging active contours cac method sheppard et al 2004 was utilized to partition the images into three phases of macropore or resolved pore intermediate and grain phases the macropore phase shows pores fully resolved in the µ ct images while the intermediate phase voxel contains some mixture of both void and solid within its volume the pore space in the intermediate phase is commonly referred to as micropores or subresolution pores the image processing and phase partitioning was accomplished using the medial axis and network generation mango software tool developed at anu sheppard et al 2004 the resulting datasets were visualized using an open source volume rendering software drishti limaye 2012 3 1 2 simulated mercury intrusion and critical pore diameter this paper determined the pore size distributions by simulating the mercury injection on the segmented images simulation of mercury intrusion or capillary drainage transform represents the invasion percolation process of the drainage capillary dominated flow experiment liu et al 2017 during this process the diameter of the largest sphere which can percolate across a connected pore system is called the critical pore diameter lc friedman and seaton 1998 lc is a unique transport length scale that controls the permeability of porous materials according to the critical path analysis scholz et al 2015 the euclidean distance transform edt map is needed for the calculation of critical diameters of percolation the simulation of lc is performed by defining locally for every voxel the diameter of the largest sphere which fully lies within the pore phase and covers that voxel at a fixed capillary pressure equivalent to a pore entry radius all spheres with radii greater than or equal to the equivalent pore entry radius are considered we begin with the largest sphere and increment the sphere radius downwards equivalent to incrementing capillary pressure upwards the non wetting phase saturation is measured as the subset of all spheres that have invaded the pore space one can simulate the complete simulated mercury intrusion curves by considering all possible invading sphere radii hilpert and miller 2001 we used the mango software to calculate the simulated mercury curves and the morphy software arns et al 2001 to calculate the critical pore diameter 3 1 3 calculations of specific pore surface area from µ ct data the specific surface between two phases in a two phase medium is defined as the area of the interface between the two phases per unit volume of the medium the inverse of the specific surface is considered as an important characteristic length scale of the medium yeong and torquato 1998 various methods have been used to calculate the specific surface of pore space in porous media in this paper we compute the evolution of pore surface area from the μ ct images and the mip data high resolution μ ct imaging has been used as a reliable tool for quantifying pore surface area and its changes in the course of physical and chemical processes concerning the six sides of each voxel the geometric pore surface area is simply calculated by counting the number of face pixels of pore voxels that are face adjacent to surrounding solid voxels normalized to the volume of the sample image mathematically 1 s μ c t n p x s p x v i m g where npx is the number of pore solid face pixels spx is the pixel surface area vimg represents image volume and sμ ct is the specific pore surface area in regard to the μ ct images of the sample studied in this paper the pixel surface area spx is equal to 4 49 4 49 µm 2 the surface area calculations were performed using the mango and the morphy software package it is worth noting that the most important issue that needs to be addressed is the dependency of the computed surface area on the resolution of the images this is more challenging when rock samples contain a considerable amount of subresolution porosity in fact the μ ct images cannot provide geometric information at scales below image resolution alternatively the pore surface area can be calculated from the simulated mip using the same approach adopted for the calculations of pore surface area from the experimental mip data see subsection 4 4 3 in this method the pore surface area calculations are limited to the resolution of the images used for simulations of the mercury intrusion process 3 1 4 numerical calculations of permeability and formation factor the permeability is calculated based on a lattice boltzmann lb simulation of flow in 3d segmented images using the d3q19 model qian and zhou 1998 the boundary conditions bcs at the solid fluid interfaces are no flow bcs that are realized using the bounce back rule martys and chen 1996 and the pressure gradient acting on the fluid is simulated by the body force ferreol and rothman 1995 the formation factor calculations are based on a solution of the laplace equation with charge conservation boundary conditions arns et al 2001 the 3d image is first converted into a network of resistors by connecting each pair of adjacent voxels with a resistor then a homogeneous electrical field is applied along each of the major tomogram axes and the potential field is solved for using a finite element formulation bohn and garboczi 2003 we assume an idealized case assigning zero conductivity to all mineral phases and a conductivity equal to one to the fluid filled pore phase we used the morphy software for permeability and formation factor calculations 3 2 analysis of mip data 3 2 1 pore size distribution and pore surface area the mip data by itself provides no information about the distribution of pore throat sizes to generate psd from mip data an appropriate model must be employed the usual model used to interpret mip data is the bundle of capillary tubes model diamond 2000 according to this model the well known washburn s equation is applied to estimate the diameter d of cylindrical pores intruded by mercury at each pressurizing step diamond 2000 2 d 4 γ cos θ p where γ is the surface tension θ is the contact angle of mercury on the solid surface and p is the applied mercury pressure the typical mercury limestone surface tension value is 480 dynes cm and the contact angle between air wetting phase and mercury non wetting phase is around 140 howard 1991 ho and hutmacher 2006 the pore size distribution is then calculated by converting the capillary pressure into the pore throat size via the washburn s equation eq 2 and the cumulative mercury intrusion in terms of the percentage of pore volume occupied by mercury into the probability of abundance of each pore in the distribution fig 4 a cumulative curve another typical graph is the log differential intrusion curve vs pore throat size fig 4 a log differential curve which assists in the visual identification of the dominant pore modes romero and simms 2008 it is worth mentioning that while the µ ct method can detect all macropores connected isolated and dead end the mip can only probe the connected pores and throats where mercury intrudes the pore solid specific surface area can be estimated from mip data the pore throat diameter at each incremental pressure step is calculated from the washburn s equation based on a modification made on the assumption of cylindrical pores and the formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder it is possible to estimate pore surface area for each pore throat diameter details of equations used for pore surface area calculations from mip data are presented in appendix a 1 the cumulative total specific pore surface area estimated from mip measurements is here denoted by smip t it is also possible to calculate the specific pore surface area from the largest pore diameter down to a certain or cut off diameter this can help us to define the mip based specific pore surface area denoted by smip mac based on the cut off pore diameter equal to the voxel size of the μ ct image in other words smip mac shows the specific surface area of macropores the pores correspond to the resolved pore space in the μ ct images 3 2 2 pore size statistics several statistical parameters related to mip derived pore throat size distribution can be defined and quantified the average pore diameter dave is defined by 4 over the surface to pore volume ratio of the pore space intruded by mercury see appendix a 2 for the formula the median pore throat diameter by volume dmed v is the diameter where 50 of the total mercury volume has been intruded into the open pores of the sample and is correspondent to the 50 of the cumulative intrusion curve the median pore throat diameter by area dmed a is calculated similar to the median pore throat diameter by volume but based on pore area distribution the threshold pore throat diameter dth is defined as the largest pore throat diameter at which significant intruded pore volume is detected ma 2014 in other words the slope of the cumulative intrusion curve increases abruptly at the threshold diameter above the threshold diameter there is comparatively little mercury intrusion aligizaki 2005 stated that the threshold diameter corresponds to the narrowest path in the interconnected pores as schematically shown in fig 4 b liu and winslow 1995 proposed that the threshold pore throat diameter is a diameter corresponding to the intersection point of the tangent lines drawn on the cumulative distribution curves as schematically shown in fig 4 a the critical pore throat diameter or the characteristic pore diameter denoted by dc or lc is one of the important pore structure parameters that is closely related to permeability and electrical conductivity it is the diameter calculated from the washburn equation for a specific pressure at which mercury first spans the sample and forms an inter connected pathway throughout the sample i e a continuous filament of mercury extends through the pore network of the sample katz and thompson 1987 svendsen et al 2004 aligizaki 2005 argued that the critical pore throat is the most frequently occurring pore size in interconnected pores that allows maximum percolation as schematically shown in fig 4 c swanson 1985 and katz and thompson 1986 adopted the inflection point of the rapidly rising initial portion of the cumulative intrusion curve to mark that specific pressure this inflection point corresponds to the steepest slope of the cumulative intrusion curve i e the highest point in the log differential intrusion curve gao and hu 2013 the determination of dc is schematically shown in fig 4 a it is believed that the critical pore throat diameter is the maximum pore throat diameter that can connect the larger pores and reflect the connectivity of the pore system zhu et al 2019 the pore throats larger than the critical pore throat diameter mainly contribute to flow and hence permeability 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of pore space from sem imaging fig 5 a shows an sem micrograph of the whole core cross section of a 5 mm diameter core sample of the rock with 20 magnification and a resolution of 4 961 µm further investigations were carried out through sem to probe the µm and nm scale pores at higher magnifications fig 5 b f illustrates the sem close up views of the rock corresponding to locations marked by orange rectangles in fig 5 a in fig 5 b f individual ooids ooid center and edge oomoldic pores and sparry cement were visualized at extremely high resolution representing the presence of extremely small pores e g intercrystalline pores within ooid and sparry cement which normally cannot be resolved in the μ ct images but can be detected by the mip technique 4 2 visual inspections of the evolution of pore space from µ ct imaging examples of 2d slices through the 3d registered images are shown in fig 6 preliminary visual inspections of the images clearly show evidence of chemical dissolution of ooids and sparry cement and enlarging of oomoldic pores close observations of the dissolution patterns revealed that the chemical dissolution locally enlarged pores across most sample parts with no visible major flow paths wormholes in this case the chemical dissolution resulted in a homogeneous alteration of the sample pore structure in this paper the resolved porosity macroporosity was separated based on the visual inspections of the images two phase segmentation the three phase segmentation of the images was then carried out using a compromise between the visual inspections of the images and an approximate match between the image based total porosity and lab measured core porosity an example of slices of the partitioning of the macro and micropore phases in the pre and post dissolution core sample is shown in fig 7 where the resolved macropore phase is illustrated in black the grain phase is given in white and the micropore phases are shown in greyscale the intensity of shades of gray is proportional to the void fraction of the microporous phase where the darker gray color represents the microporous phase with a larger void fraction the image based total porosity of the pre dissolution sample gives the value of 27 8 of which 12 5 is macroporosity 50 of the sample image is assigned as an intermediate phase with a microporosity contribution of 15 3 the segmentation results for the post dissolution sample show a total porosity of 41 0 of which 23 5 is macroporosity in this case about 40 of the sample image is assigned as an intermediate phase with a microporosity contribution of 17 6 the segmentation data indicates approximately a double increase in macroporosity but a slight increase in microporosity after the dissolution experiment a comparison between the experimentally and image based measured porosity shows that the total image porosity of the post alteration sample is in a good match with the experimental porosity while the pre alteration image porosity was slightly underestimated mainly due to the presence of the higher amount of image noise overall the difference between the experimental and image porosity can be attributed to the experimental measurement error image quality and noise segmentation error and the fact that we may image only part of the sample it is noted the porosity of the unaltered sample is characterized by 45 of macroporosity this value was increased to 57 5 after the dissolution representing that the initial microporous dominant pore structure converted to the pore system dominated by macropores as a consequence it was expected that the major effect of the chemical dissolution was to largely increase in macroporosity of the sample as evidenced later the image based results were also confirmed by the performed mip tests which showed a significant increase in the number of larger pores after the dissolution experiment luquot et al 2016 found very similar findings in porosity changes while in another study the opposite results were obtained luquot et al 2014 in which the authors argued that the enlargement of micropores could induce the local migration of fines 4 3 characterization of the evolution of pore size and surface area using the mip data before presenting the results of mip measurements and comparing them with the image based results it is essential to address the major limitation of mip derived data the mip method suffers from its assumptions and hence includes several drawbacks diamond 2000 gorce and milestone 2007 zhang et al 2019 first both the advancing and receding contact angles at pore walls are assumed to be uniform second the mip method is not able to detect pores of access diameter larger than a certain size due to limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the mip test in other words the mip data starts at a non zero saturation according to the entry mercury pressure an initial increase in mercury pressure is due to mercury entering surface pores and fractures which may not be detected by the mip method third it is assumed that the pore structure does not change during mip measurements this assumption may not be valid for poorly connected pore structures where the high mercury pressure may break the solid partitions between two adjacent non connected pores cao et al 2016 argued that mip data at pressures 70 mpa and above are unreliable and probably not meaningful due to changes in pore structure including possible particle breakdown and the opening of closed pores fourth the most important limitation is related to the assumptions of the cylindrical pores with uniform radius in other words this method neglects the pore irregularities and the fact that the pore system may be composed of large pore bodies interconnected by narrow pores throats i e ink bottle pores schmitt et al 2015 mercury requires a breakthrough pressure to pass through the throats of non cylindrical pores consequently the distribution curve from the mip measurement should be interpreted as the pore throat diameter distribution despite these limitations the mip method is one of the few techniques that can identify a broad range of pore sizes and quantify porosity surface area and other microstructural parameters 4 3 1 pore space analysis of intact rock sample fig 8 illustrates the mip cumulative incremental and differential intrusion curves of a sister plug of the sample used in the dissolution experiment the chosen sister plug marked as the pre dissolution sample served as a control sample the mip data shows that the rock possessed a wide pore size range and its pore throat sizes are distributed over four orders of magnitude from tens of nanometers to hundred microns it is worth noting that the mip test was not able to detect pores of access diameters larger than 180 µm due to limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the test in other words the experimental mip data starts at a non zero saturation as only pores of diameter 180 µm or less are probed via the mip apparatus 1 psi entry pressure this is while the microscopic and µ ct images of the sample figs 1 and 6 reveal the presence of surface and internal pores of access diameter larger than 180 μm the sem micrographs fig 5 and the µ ct images fig 6 of the rock sample in combination with the mip data fig 8 suggest that the pore space of the rock can be classified as macroporosity occurring within ooids oomoldic porosity and between ooids and within sparry cement interoolitic intergranular macroporosity as well as microporosity within intact ooids and ooid cortices intra oolitic porosity and sparry cement interoolitic microporosity as evident from fig 8 the 4 49 μm from the cumulative intrusion curve one can conclude that more than half of the sample porosity is only accessible via subresolution pores or micropore space even though the incremental intrusion curve in fig 8 shows a large variation from the log differential intrusion curve dv dlogd pore volume versus pore throat diameter the pore size distribution curve of the sample is characterized by a double peak bimodal distribution regarding the method proposed by katz and thompson 1986 for determining the critical pore throat diameter and the pore size of the rock sample as a bimodal distribution we found two critical pore throat diameters in both the macropore and micropore regions the first bump in the log differential intrusion curve covers mainly in the pore size range of 10 20 µm with the pore throat diameter corresponding to the large pore mode the 1st major peak which occurred at 12 µm this pore throat size range belongs to the macropore space the pores with diameters larger than the macro critical pore throat diameter 12 µm are expected to mostly control the permeability of this rock at the initial condition before the chemical dissolution experiment the second bump primarily covers the pore sizes between 30 and 400 nm with the pore throat diameter corresponding to the small classification of the pores into macro and micropores is here based on the resolution of the µ ct images i e pore mode the 2nd peak which occurred at 100 nm this pore throat size range belongs to the micropore space of the rock the two bumps in the differential curve suggest that the pore throat sizes can be divided into three parts 12 μm 12 0 1 μm and 0 1 μm table 1 summarizes statistical results on pore sizes obtained from the mip data for the pre and post dissolution states while the average pore throat diameter of the intact pre dissolution sample is far below the resolution of the μ ct image the median pore throat diameter by volume approximately coincides with the resolution of the pre dissolution μ ct image 4 15 μm in fig 3 highlighting the fact that 50 of the porosity of the pre dissolution sample is accessible via the macropore space region 4 3 2 of chemical dissolution on pore throat diameter from mip data fig 9 compares the mip cumulative incremental and log differential intrusion curves of the pre and post dissolution samples the solid dashed and dotted lines in fig 9 represent the pre dissolution post dissolution sample piece p1 and post dissolution sample piece p2 mip curves respectively since significant changes in pre and post dissolution mip curves are observed we can neglect deviations that could be attributed to the fact that the mercury porosimetry measurements were performed on the sister plug of the sample prior to the dissolution it is apparent from fig 9 that there has been a significant shift in pore throat size distribution to the right the number of macropores significantly increased for the pores larger than 20 μm and decreased for smaller ones a similar observation was obtained for micropores where the number of larger micropores between 400 nm and 2 μm increased while the number of smaller ones decreased as a result a large number of original pores particularly the larger macropores were enlarged or merged to form larger pores during the dissolution experiment since permeability is largely determined by the interconnected macropores with sizes greater than the critical macropore diameter the conducted chemical dissolution has significantly improved the permeability of the sample by first enlarging the macropores and second by increasing the connectivity of the macropore system the changes in the connectivity of the pore system of the rock sample were investigated in detail in our previous paper qajar and arns 2017 fig 9 also gives information about the longitudinal variation of the pore throat size distribution of the post dissolution sample a quick look at fig 9 and table 1 points out a small difference between the mip curves of sample pices p1 and p2 indicating a quasi uniform dissolution within the sample and hence confirming the image based results a comparison between the mip data of the post dissolution sample pieces p1 and p2 indicates a moderately larger increase in the number of larger pores and throats for the near inlet post dissolution piece which confirms the image based porosity profiles obtained in our previous work qajar and arns 2016 table 1 also shows a slightly larger increase in average median and critical pore throat diameters for the near inlet part of the post dissolution sample piece p1 despite the presence of slightly more dissolution induced macropores in the near inlet post dissolution sample the dissolution map as evidenced by the µ ct images is very close to uniform along the core length the changes in the pore throat size statistics calculated from the mip data are reported in table 1 if one estimates the mip incremental intrusion curves in both pre and post dissolution states as unimodal distributions the calculated mean and median pore diameters suggest that the mip curves are negative skew representing the largest occurrence of the pore size is in the macropore region the mean and median pore diameters significantly increased after the chemical dissolution it can be argued from the mip cumulative curves that the threshold pore throat diameter considerably increased after the dissolution experiment despite the inability to detect pores of access diameters larger than 180 µm in the mip tests data from table 1 also indicates that the macro critical pore throat diameter corresponding to the top of the first major peak in fig 9 c increased from 12 µm to 52 µm after the dissolution test this shows that mercury quickly formed a connected filament through the pore space of the post dissolution sample during mercury intrusion at the low pressure stage as a result one can conclude that the enlarged oomoldic pores with diameters greater than 52 µm govern fluid flow and hence permeability in the post dissolution sample the micro critical pore throat diameter corresponding to the top of the second major peak in fig 9 c also increased from 0 1 µm to 1 1 µm in order to obtain a better understanding of the effect of the chemical dissolution on the evolution of pore throat size we consider a relative change in pore throat number denoted by r the corresponding equations used for the calculation of r are given in appendix a 1 fig 10 shows the relative change in the incremental intrusion volume versus pore throat diameter for both the altered sample pieces and can be interpreted as the ratio of changes in the number of pore throats for a given pore throat diameter the zero r in fig 10 means no change in the relative pore throat number during the chemical dissolution process whereas the positive and negative r values indicate an increase and decrease in relative pore throat number respectively fig 10 clearly shows that the chemical dissolution did not uniformly change the number of different pore throat diameters the largest increase is found for pore throat diameters between 20 100 μm based on the data of altered sample pieces p1 and p2 the most observed increase in the number of pore throat diameters occurred for pore throat diameters of 90 and 50 μm based on the mip data of the altered sample pieces p1 and p2 respectively with an average value of 70 μm fig 10 swift and fogler 1977 defined the threshold reactivity diameter as the pore throat diameter above which the dissolution has the largest effect fig 10 shows the largest relative increase in pore throat number occurs at diameters greater than 20 μm both mip tests on pieces p1 and p2 illustrate that the relative change in pore throat number is close to zero for pore throat diameters below 20 μm indicating little or no change in pore throat number consequently we found that the effectiveness of the chemical dissolution was greatest for larger pores and throats in the macro pore region defined by the μ ct images the mip results are consistent with visual observations of the μ ct images indicating considerable enlarging of oomoldic and intergranular macropores fig 6 4 3 3 analysis of the evolution of specific pore surface area using mip data we calculated the specific pore area according to the procedure explained in section 3 2 2 fig 11 shows the cumulative specific pore surface area before and after the chemical dissolution experiment it is evident that pore throats with diameters below 1 μm contributed to about 95 of the total pore area for both the pre and post dissolution samples the pore throat diameter is inversely proportional to the specific pore area which indicates a larger cumulative specific pore area for the post dissolution sample however there was a dramatic decrease when the pore throat diameter was below 0 08 μm it can be argued that there are more micro nanopores and micro nanothroats found after the chemical dissolution and that these micropores and microthroats contribute to an increase in the pore area but not the pore volume table 2 reports the results of the cumulative specific pore surface area from the mip method for the pre and post dissolution samples it was found that the total specific pore surface area smip t was reduced by 21 after the dissolution based on the average values of the cumulative specific pore areas of sample pieces p1 and p2 it is also possible to evaluate the changes in pore surface area based on a specific pore throat diameter in particular based on the cut off pore throat diameter equal to the voxel size of the μ ct image the specific pore surface area smip mac almost remained unchanged after the dissolution based on the information obtained from the sample piece p1 however smip mac decreased by 8 based on the average mip data of the sample pieces p1 and p2 4 4 image based quantification of changes in pore size and pore surface area 4 4 1 analysis of the evolution of pore size from the μ ct images various approaches have been adopted to study pore size distribution psd from μ ct image data in this paper we use the distribution of the maximal covering spheres percolating the sample as pore diameter distribution this can be obtained by simulating mercury intrusion porosimetry simulated mip based on 3d microstructural data provided from the μ ct image the simulations were performed on the resolved pore space macropores of the whole registered images fig 12 shows a comparison between the simulated mip curves and the experimental mip measurements on the core sample it is worth mentioning that the simulated mip curves are limited to the voxel size of the images and do not cover the whole pore size range of the sample detected by experimental mip from the simulated mip data we found that the number of larger macropores pores larger than 40 μm significantly increased and slightly decreased for smaller ones a similar analysis of the relative change in macropore number was performed on the simulated mip data and it was found that the largest increase in macropore number occurred for a pore diameter of 60 μm which is in good agreement with the value of 70 μm obtained from the experimental mip data fig 10 it is noted that the image based simulated mip data has a necessary cut off at porosities associated with pores below the voxel size of the image regarding the complex pore structure of the sample fig 12 indicates an acceptable agreement between the experimental and simulated mip data as expected the pore size distribution based on the simulated mip overestimated the larger pores which consequently shifted the psd in the direction of the bigger pores table 3 reports the estimated average threshold and critical pore diameter from the simulated mip curves of the pre and post dissolution images here the estimations were performed similarly to those obtained from the experimental mip data the results show that despite a slight increase in the average pore diameter the threshold and critical pore diameters increased significantly after the dissolution in particular the critical pore diameter increased from 45 to 72 μm a comparison with the experimental mip results table 1 shows that the image based method overpredicts the pore size statistics primarily due to the disability of the μ ct images to detect whole pore space with detailed pore structure 4 4 2 effects of chemical dissolution on pore surface area from μ ct data the μ ct data can be used to characterize the influence of chemical dissolution on the surface area between pore and solid phases based on the spatially resolved voxel evolution regions in this technique the geometric pore surface area is simply calculated by counting the number of direct solid neighbor voxels to each pore voxel to characterize the evolution of pore surface area first the μ ct method requires a precise 3d registration of the original and altered images in a common coordinate system second the surface area computed from μ ct images is highly dependent on the resolution of the images in other words the existence of a considerable amount of intermediate phase makes the quantification of the pore solid surface area difficult the latter problem is more difficult to experimentally deal with especially when the rock sample contains subresolution porosity we have conducted a stable chemical dissolution test in a small rock sample to increase the image resolution as much as possible the μ ct data is used here to measure the surface area between macropores and the solid phase the measured surface area involves the surface area of both connected and unconnected pores the μ ct data is not able to capture the geometry at scales below the image resolution regarding the images of the core sample studied in this paper the ooid grain roughness grains smaller than the resolution of the images and microporosity are not distinguishable in the images therefore we cannot measure the actual or more strictly the subresolution or submicron pore solid surface area from the images however observations of the pre and post dissolution images as well as the mercury porosimetry measurements show that the conducted chemical dissolution test mainly affects the macropore space in fact the surface area of major flow pathways is more important than the surface area in isolated pores or micropores that do not contribute much to fluid flow noiriel et al 2009 therefore changes in actual pore solid surface area are largely influenced by changes in macropore surface area consequently μ ct can be a useful tool for estimating effective pore surface area changes here the macropore surface area i e the surface area between macropore and non macropore phases denoted by sμ ct mac was estimated by directly counting the number of voxels and faces of the macropore phase on the image as well as by using the simulated mip curve in this case the image based pore surface area is denoted by sμ ct mac fig 13 shows the variation of specific surface area between macropore and non macropore phases along the flow direction for each slice of the images the initial specific surface area of macropores shows local variability while the macropore specific surface area of the post dissolution sample exhibits more uniformity representing the surface area of macropore space changed almost uniformly along the flow direction after the dissolution test alternatively it is possible to evaluate the evolution of macropore surface area using the simulated mip data fig 14 illustrates the cumulative specific macropore surface area before and after the chemical dissolution experiment here the calculations of the total specific macropore surface area from the simulated mip data are similar to the procedure adopted for the experimental mip data analysis for pore surface area the porosity used in calculating the macropore surface area based on the simulated mip was the macroporosity not the total porosity obtained from the segmentation of the images it is evident from fig 14 that the cumulative specific macropore area is larger for the post dissolution sample table 4 summarizes the total macropore specific surface area values from the image data 4 5 discussion a comparison between the mip and μ ct methods in the quantification of the evolution of pore surface area from experimental mip data table 2 we found that the specific total pore surface area decreased by 21 even for macropores the experimental mip data exhibits an 8 reduction in specific pore surface area conversely the image based data based on the segmentation into resolved pore space shows a significant increase in pore surface area table 4 since from the experimental mip data fig 8 more than half the sample pore size is less than the resolution of the images it is concluded that the evaluation of the pore surface area of the sample based on resolvable pore space from images was inaccurate and ignoring micropores as part of the pore system led to a considerable error despite the ability of the mip technique in the quantification of the pore surface area for a wide range of pore sizes down to a few nanometers this method assumes the model of the bundle of capillary tubes which neglects the actual pore structure of the rocks on the other hand the µ ct method provides a relatively accurate representation of the pore structure but the weak point in the µ ct method is that the image based results are dependent on the image resolution and ignoring subresolution pores results in a significant error although the rock investigated in this study are highly microporous the dissolution mainly affects the larger pores of the sample in the macropore region hence the use of both methods can give a complementary insight in analysis of the changes in pore surface area measurements of the pore surface area with µ ct reveal that when we ignored microporosity the specific surface area of macropores increased by an average of 40 first column in table 4 this is primarily due to the enlargement of macropores and is consistent with the fact that the conducted chemical dissolution had the largest effect on the macropores and macrothroats with diameters greater than 20 µm fig 10 observations of the µ ct images fig 6 reveal that the pore size of oomoldic and interoolitic macropores increases whereas the pore size of oolitic grains ooids decreases in the macropore region of the sample the dissolution induced enlargement of oomoldic and interoolitic pores was dominant and increased pore surface area however when we look at the experimental mip data the total specific pore surface area was reduced by 21 after the dissolution test first column in table 2 even when we calculated the changes in pore surface area from the experimental mip data for pore sizes down to the cut off size equal to the resolution of the µ ct images we found a slight decrease of 8 in pore surface area second column in table 2 4 6 predictions of the changes in permeability so far we have focused on the analysis of the evolution of two characteristic parameters of the pore phase i e pore size distribution and pore surface area during the chemical dissolution in this section we evaluate the evolution of permeability based on the pore scale information provided by the mip and μ ct techniques this is of great importance since an improved estimation of the evolution of macroscopic rock properties including porosity and permeability can potentially assist in managing the risks associated with the reactive processes in sub surface formations to evaluate the evolution of permeability during chemical dissolution based on the pore scale descriptors calculated from the mip and μ ct methods we consider two well known permeability estimation models i e the katz thomson kt and the kozeny carman kc equations the predicted changes in permeability are compared with those calculated directly on the images using the lattice boltzmann lb flow simulation in 3d segmented images the kt and kc models are briefly described as follows katz thompson kt equation one of the most common methods for estimating permeability uses the equation given by katz and thompson 1986 3 k c k t l c 2 1 f where k is permeability ckt is a prefactor that depends on the distribution of pore sizes in the rock bauget et al 2005 lc is a characteristic pore size and f is a dimensionless parameter called the formation factor the constant ckt is of the order of 1 226 katz and thompson 1986 the characteristic pore size in eq 3 is usually taken to be the critical pore diameter which was directly measured here from the mip curves see the two last columns in table 1 we calculated the critical pore diameter and formation factors for several subvolumes of the images as previously mentioned in sec 3 1 5 the calculations were based on the resolved pore space alternatively the formation factor can be estimated from the experimental mip data eq 4 was proposed by katz and thompson 1987 to estimate the formation factor from the same mip data used to measure the characteristic pore size lc 4 1 f l max e l c ϕ s l max e where ϕ is the porosity l m a x e is a pore size at which hydraulic conductance is maximum and s l m a x e is the fraction of total porosity filled at l m a x e or in other words the fractional volume of connected pore space involving pores with sizes l m a x e and larger katz and thompson 1987 argued that l m a x e can be estimated from the following relation for very broad size ditributions 5 l max e 0 34 l c according to the kt equation a non wetting fluid can have access from one face of the sample to the other when the driving pressure is sufficient to allow the fluid to penetrate the smallest pore throat of diameter lc in the most efficient conducting pathway cerepi et al 2003 kozeny carman kc equation one of the widely used models for permeability is the kozeny carman equation torquato 2002 6 k c k c ϕ 3 s p 2 where sp is the specific pore surface area per unit bulk volume and ckc called the kozeny s constant is a constant and generally depends on pore geometry and tortuosity the specific pore surface area was calculated using both the mip see table 2 and the μ ct images see table 4 as previously observed the chemical dissolution locally enlarged pores across most parts of the sample with no visible major flow paths wormholes and led to a quasi uniform dissolution pattern within the sample at this condition it is reasonable to assume that the constants of the kt and kc equations i e ckt and ckc remained unchanged during the uniform dissolution pattern hence we propose to use the following relations to assess changes in the permeability of rock samples due to chemical dissolution based on the kt equation using the critical pore size and formation factor data and based on the kc equation using the porosity and specific surface area data 7 k k 0 k t μ c t l c l c 0 2 f 0 f 8 k k 0 k c ϕ ϕ 0 3 s p 0 s p 2 where the subscript 0 refers to the properties before the dissolution test inserting eqs 4 and 5 in eq 7 leads to 9 k k 0 k t m i p l c l c 0 2 ϕ ϕ 0 s 0 34 l c s 0 34 l c 0 regarding the post dissolution mip data we averaged between the results of the sample pieces p1 and p2 for the calculations of changes in permeability in order to provide a more accurate comparison between the mip based results and the lab based measurements it is worth mentioning that if the purpose is to compare the image based and mip based results we should use the mip data of the sample piece p1 because the μ ct image of the post dissolution sample corresponded to the sample piece p1 4 6 1 the evolution of porosity table 5 compares the experimentally measured porosity values in pre and post alteration states and the porosity ratios ϕ ϕ 0 i e the ratio of post to pre dissolution porosity and the corresponding results obtained by the mip and µ ct methods the µct based porosity results were obtained for the image volumes depicted in fig 3 using the cac segmentation method it is worth mentioning that the macroporosity was separated based on the visual inspections of the µ ct images in the first segmentation stage known as two phase segmentation in the second stage of phase partitioning i e three phase segmentation the phase separations were carried out using a compromise between the visual inspections of the images and an approximate match between the image based total porosity and lab measured core porosity the total porosity of the sample derived from the μ ct images is obviously in a reasonable match with the values measured experimentally in the lab by the saturation method the differences particularly for the pre dissolution sample can be attributed to the image noise and the fact that we imaged only part of the sample which indicates that the μ ct calculated parameters are restricted to the part of the sample imaged regarding the mip method the total porosity at the pre dissolution condition is somewhat lower than the lab measured value mainly because the mip measurements were performed on the sister plug of the sample not the sample itself before the dissolution measurements of the total porosity of the post dissolution sample using the mip method exhibit an excellent agreement with respect to the lab measured experimental data for both the mip and μ ct methods it is possible to calculate the macroporosity ratio ϕ ϕ 0 macro the microporosity ratio ϕ ϕ 0 micro and the total porosity ratio ϕ ϕ 0 total while the formers i e the macro and microporosity ratio are not possible to be measured in the lab regarding the resolved pore space macropore region both the mip and μ ct methods revealed that the macroporosity has approximately doubled in contrast the microporosity slightly increased after the dissolution as indicated by both the mip and μ ct data 4 6 2 evaluations of the changes in permeability based on the macropore space the numerical calculations of the critical pore diameter formation factor and the lbm permeability were performed on several subvolumes with the full section area of the image data and 200 or 400 pixel thicknesses in along the flow axis multiple measurements on image data give computational predictions of properties rather than obtaining a single data point we have previously found that the size of subvolumes was sufficiently larger than the pore size correlation length which allows producing representative results fig 15 shows the ratio of altered post dissolution to unaltered pre dissolution permeability k k 0 calculated directly by the lbm method plotted against the estimated k k 0 by the kt and kc models using the image based data based on the resolved pore space or macropores we found that the estimated permeability ratios from the kt model eq 7 were in the same order of magnitude as those obtained with the lbm on the contrary the estimated permeability ratios from the kc model eq 8 differed from the lbm results between one and three orders of magnitude highlighting that ignoring the micropore surface area significantly underestimated the permeability ratio this result demonstrates that the kt model can reasonably predict the permeability evolution of the studied complex carbonate sample from the image based critical pore diameter and formation factor data of the resolved pore space furthermore the result suggests that the critical pore diameter lc of the macroporous phase governs the fluid flow through the microporous carbonate sample and hence it is an appropriate length scale for the prediction of the dissolution induced permeability evolution of the studied rock sample during the uniform dissolution processes it is also of interest here to compare the average values of the permeability ratios k k 0 obtained from the kt model and lbm method for the images subvolumes in our case where the subvolumes are arranged in series and the permeability changes only perpendicular to the flow direction the harmonic average provides the effective permeability assuming constant ckt the average values of the permeability ratios k k 0 are given by 10 k k 0 k t μ c t i 1 n f 0 i l c 0 i 2 i 1 n f i l c i 2 table 6 compares the average post dissolution permeability ratio to that of pre dissolution calculated by the lbm and the corresponding values estimated by the kt model using the mip or µ ct data the reported data in the first row of table 6 i e k k 0 macro were based on the resolved macroporous phase a comparison with the lbm permeability ratio shows that the kt model reasonably predicts the permeability ratio using the data of the critical pore diameter and the formation factor the difference in results between the lbm and the kt models based on the mip data can be attributed to the inability to detect pores of access diameters larger than 180 µm due to the limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the mip test this led to difficulty estimating reliable critical pore throat diameter particularly for the post dissolution mip cumulative curves wee fig 9 the image based method also significantly overpredicted the critical pore size due primarily to resolution limitations note that the sample studied in this paper is highly microporous in both the pre and post dissolution states as evidenced by the mip curves fig 9 so it is anticipated that ignoring micropore space may induce considerable uncertainty in predicting the changes in permeability 4 6 3 incorporation of microporosity into predictions of changes in permeability the presence of subresolution pore space or microporosity and its potential role in flow and transport is of great importance and has been investigated in a few studies knackstedt et al 2006 apourvari and arns 2014 soulaine et al 2016 even though we found that the macropore system mainly controlled the permeability of the rock sample and its changes it is intriguing to explore the effects of micropores on the evolution of permeability during the chemical dissolution experiment this is important here because the rock sample considered in this study contained a high amount of microporosity to assess the effect of microporosity on the performance of the kt method as a prediction model the lbm permeability and the critical pore diameter were calculated for a pore phase that comprised of macropores and the largest quartile of micropores in this regard the macropore voxels were merged with the microporous voxels with a porosity of 100 down to a porosity of 75 5 and the calculations along the flow axis were performed for this combined phase the results are reported in the second row of table 6 i e k k 0 macro micro it is revealed that the inclusion of microporosity into property calculations significantly reduced the permeability ratio values and generally improved the predictions of changes in permeability this suggests that the evolution of micropores during the chemical dissolution experiment affected the changes in permeability to some extent it is concluded that the two phase segmentation of the images with neglecting the spatial distribution of micropores increased the uncertainty in predicting the changes in permeability using the kt method as a predictive model based on the image data 5 summary and conclusions the research presented and discussed in this paper explores the use of mercury intrusion and 3d pore scale imaging via µ ct to characterize the influence of chemical dissolution on the pore structure of a carbonate sample we have addressed several challenges behind implementing both approaches for reactive flow study in microporous porous media limiting the usability of the acquired data in particular chemical dissolution experiments should be conducted on smaller core samples typically at a millimeter scale to acquire higher resolution images this leads to the challenge of characterizing the microstructure of the cores at a higher resolution and then connecting it to the macro scale descriptors and properties we obtained experimental control points in the form of a quasi uniform dissolution pattern within a millimeter scale core sample which allowed us to connect the pore scale structural evolution to changes in macroscopic properties both the μ ct images and mip revealed that the dissolution significantly enlarged the pores of the sample in a quasi uniform manner with no visible detected wormholes regarding the macropore space the mip method cannot detect pores of access diameters larger than a certain size due to limited mercury filling pressure at the low pressure stage of the test this is while the evolution of macropores can be accurately quantified from the µ ct images the mip results showed that the total pore surface area was reduced after the dissolution while the μ ct method showed an increase in the surface area of resolved macropores while the mip method can probe the tiny pores down to a few tens of nanometers and hence a more realistic estimation of parameters such as surface area of pores the µ ct despite being limited in resolution provides a spatial description of the dissolution pattern and can be used to directly study the percolation properties and simulate mercury intrusion through the pore space furthermore the µ ct enables us to provide multiple measurements and hence can be used for predictive models this is while the mip and other usual laboratory techniques provide single measurements and are not able to determine the spatial distribution of micro and macro scale properties within a core sample we evaluated the fractional changes in permeability using the katz thompson kt and kozeny carman kc relations based on the calculated critical pore diameter pore surface area and formation factor compared to the lbm method we found that the kt could predict the ratio of altered post dissolution to unaltered pre dissolution permeability more accurately this suggests that the evolution of permeability in the core sample is controlled by the changes in the critical pore diameter based on the image data the kc model failed to predict the permeability ratio due mainly to ignoring the micropores in pore surface area calculations it was also found that the inclusion of microporosity in the critical pore diameter calculations improved the predictions of changes in permeability the results of this paper indicated that although large macropores were mainly affected by the chemical dissolution the evolution of micropores exhibited a moderate effect when predicting changes in the

101,coupling multiphase flow with energy transport due to high temperature heat sources introduces significant new challenges since boiling and condensation processes can lead to dry out conditions with subsequent re wetting the transition between two phase and single phase behavior can require changes to the primary dependent variables adding discontinuities as well as extending constitutive nonlinear relations to extreme physical conditions practical simulations of large scale engineered domains lead to jacobian systems with a very large number of unknowns that must be solved efficiently using iterative methods in parallel on high performance computers performance assessment of potential nuclear repositories carbon sequestration sites and geothermal reservoirs can require numerous monte carlo simulations to explore uncertainty in material properties boundary conditions and failure scenarios due to the numerical challenges standard nr iteration may not converge over the range of required simulations and require more sophisticated optimization method like trust region we use the open source simulator pflotran for the important practical problem of the safety assessment of future nuclear waste repositories in the u s doe geologic disposal safety assessment framework the simulator applies the petsc parallel framework and a backward euler finite volume discretization we demonstrate failure of the conventional nr method and the success of trust region modifications to newton s method for a series of test problems of increasing complexity trust region methods essentially modify the newton step size and direction under some circumstances where the standard nr iteration can cause the solution to diverge or oscillate we show how the newton trust region method can be adapted for primary variable switching pvs when the multiphase state changes due to boiling or condensation the simulations with high temperature heat sources which led to extreme nonlinear processes with many state changes in the domain did not converge with nr but they do complete successfully with the trust region methods modified for pvs this implementation effectively decreased weeks of simulation time needing manual adjustments to complete a simulation down to a day furthermore we show the strong scalability of the methods on a single node and multiple nodes in an hpc cluster keywords nonisothermal high temperature porous media multiphase flow miscible trust region 1 introduction modeling multiphase flow in porous media plays an important role in practical engineering applications such as carbon sequestration contaminant remediation geothermal engineering enhanced oil recovery and nuclear waste management accurate and robust simulators are needed to forecast the transport and fate of fluids and contaminants and to aid in design of engineered systems for applications to nuclear waste management simulators are used to design and evaluate engineered components of geological repositories assess repository safety and risk and conduct formal performance assessment to meet regulatory requirements for licensing because the governing flow equations are highly nonlinear and the simulations must be performed for large spatial domains over very long time horizons computational efficiency is paramount requiring that simulators run efficiently in parallel on high performance supercomputers since regulatory performance assessments require repeated monte carlo simulations to assess uncertainty considering failure scenarios and geologic heterogeneity the simulators must run efficiently and must also be robust for a wide range of hydrogeologic parameters the primary motivation for this research is capability development for safety assessment of generic nuclear waste repositories using the us department of energy doe geologic disposal safety assessment gdsa framework mariner et al 2015 sandia national laboratories 2018 the gdsa framework considers disposal options for heat generating high level nuclear wastes from power plants in different host rocks such as salt argillite and crystalline the goal is to analyze the impact of heat generating nuclear wastes on the surrounding environment for up to 1 million years with 3d non isothermal miscible two phase flow simulations simulations are run with pflotran a massively parallel subsurface flow and transport code andre et al 2021 founded upon the portable extensible toolkit for scientific computations petsc framework balay et al 2021 a the heat generated by radioactive decay can cause rapid water boiling with changes in multiphase states from single phase liquid to two phase liquid gas to single phase gas after the high temperature heat source cools gravity vapor diffusion and capillary forces induce re saturation which again causes changes in the multiphase states a different set of primary dependent variables pdvs is required as the multiphase states change spatially and temporally due to boiling and re saturation referred to as primary variable switching pvs which challenges numerical solutions techniques additional numerical challenges arise from discontinuities in parameters between neighboring engineered barrier materials and low permeability host rocks as will be demonstrated below these complexities can lead to extremely poor nonlinear solver performance we will demonstrate that trust region enhancements to newton s method can effectively address these numerical challenges these methods estimate the size of a trust region where the local taylors series approximation of newton s method is accurate and they can modify the step size and direction during the series of newton iterations dennis and schnabel 1996 heath 2018 although not typically used in the subsurface modeling literature a recent paper by b li et al li et al 2015 has shown that the newton trust region method can be used to resolve nonlinear oscillation and divergence problems for immiscible incompressible oil water porous media flow for advance oil recovery applications in this paper we evaluate newton trust region and the so called newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc methods and investigate strategies for primary variable switching during the newton iterations we also study the parallel performance and strong scalability of the nonlinear and linear solvers although our application is for heat generating waste in an engineered nuclear waste repository our results are also applicable to other applications such as modeling geothermal reservoirs and carbon sequestration with co 2 phase state changes due to high pressures and temperatures in what follows section 2 introduces the governing equations for nonisothermal miscible

and presents conclusions 2 nonisothermal miscible two phase porous media flow model 2 1 governing equations the case study mariner et al 2020 presented below relies on simulation of fully coupled flow of two fluid phases liquid and gas under non isothermal miscible conditions andre et al 2021 pruess et al 1999 the two governing mass conservation equations for the water and air components are respectively 1 t ϕ s l ρ l x l w s g ρ g x g w q l ρ l x l w q g ρ g x g w ϕ s l d l ρ l x l w ϕ s g d g ρ g x g w q w 2 t ϕ s l ρ l x l a s g ρ g x g a q l ρ l x l a q g ρ g x g a ϕ s l d l ρ l x l a ϕ s g d g ρ g x g a q a where ϕ is porosity s is saturation ρ kg m 3 is density and q kg m 3 s 1 is the source sink term each phase is denoted by subscripts g gas and l liquid the mole fraction is x l g a w with a superscript for the component e g air or water and subscript for the phase and d l g is the phase dependent diffusion coefficient m 2 s 1 the darcy velocity is q l g m s 1 for each phase and is defined as 3 q l k k r l μ l p l ρ l g 4 q g k k r g μ g p g ρ g g where p is pressure k m 2 is intrinsic permeability k r is relative permeability and μ pa s is viscosity the density for each phase is calculated through equations of state for liquid water steam and air as 5 ρ l ρ w p l t 6 ρ g ρ steam p v t ρ a p a t where ρ w is liquid water density ρ steam is steam density ρ a is dry air density as a function of partial p a air or p v vapor pressure and t temperature we assume that the temperature in a grid cell is at thermal equilibrium henry s law is applied to calculate the air partial pressure 7 x l a k p sat t p a the henry s constant for air k is a function of temperature and saturation vapor pressure p sat and the code uses the formulation by fernandez prini et al fernández prini et al 2003 x l a is mole fraction of air in the liquid phase and p a is the air partial pressure the energy conservation equation couples saturation and pressure of each phase γ l g to internal energy u γ j enthalpy h γ p γ t j and temperature we assume thermal equilibrium between the rock and the fluid phases which allows the equation to be written as 8 γ l g t ϕ s ρ u γ q ρ h γ t

by the relationship from the energy conservation law 10 u γ h γ p γ ρ γ the enthalpy is given by an equation of state as a function of pressure for each γ and temperature wagner and kretzschmar 2008 all the derivations above are presented in more detail in pruess et al 1999 and lichtner et al 2015 2 2 capillary pressure and residual saturation to apply darcy s law to model flow of two phases muskat and meres muskat and meres 1936 postulated that the velocity of the liquid and gas phases are dependent upon relative permeabilities k r l and k r g and the pressure gradient as presented above in eqs 3 and 4 later leverett expanded upon this model by including capillary effects leverett 1941 we use the van genuchten van genuchten capillary pressure model in this paper the limitation of the van genuchten model is the use of the concept of effective saturation θ defined as the fraction of liquid filled pores greater than the residual liquid saturation because capillary pressure approaches infinity when effective saturation approaches zero and is completely undefined at saturation below the residual value when the liquid phase can be removed by other processes such as by evaporation or boiling an extension to the van genuchten model is necessary sun et al 2010 previously pflotran truncated the capillary pressure at some large but finite value as shown in fig 1 flat curve while this approach defines values below residual saturation ordinary newton raphson nr may fail to converge due to the discontinuous derivative as presented in appendix d this proves to be the case here for the original newton solver in the absence of experimental data capillary pressure below the residual can be extrapolated from conventional capillary pressure data or interpolated to a specified maximum capillary pressure in either case to provide a numerically stable model for nr the capillary pressure model should be both continuous and smooth over the residual region in this work both linear and exponential extensions were implemented and are now able to be defined in pflotran by either extrapolating from a defined junction saturation point or interpolating from a maximum capillary pressure when extrapolation is selected a default junction at 5 of effective saturation was selected to be consistent with the practice in the non isothermal unsaturated flow and transport code nuft nitao 1998 conversely when interpolation is utilized a default maximum capillary pressure of 1 gpa is utilized consistent with the work of webb webb 2000 fig 1 illustrates interpolation of the van genuchten capillary pressure model to 1 gpa using unsaturated extensions that were implemented into pflotran as part of this work the numerical experiments in section 5 apply the van genuchten extensions for all experiments to eliminate the discontinuity in capillary pressure while the ntrdc is able to converge even where the discontinuity is present simulator performance is nevertheless much improved using either linear or exponential extensions as presented in detail in appendix d 2 3 newton raphson iteration for nonlinear system of equations the fully coupled system of equations eq 1 eq 2 and eq 8 in pflotran is discretized using the finite volume method with implicit backward euler differencing in time this results in a coupled system of nonlinear algebraic equations newton s method is employed to solve the nonlinear system of equations the residual f u is calculated for each discrete mass and energy conservation equation and the primary dependant variables pdvs are updated by iteratively solving the linear system 11 j f u i δ u f u i with pdvs u iteration number i and jacobian matrix j f and updating the solution 12 u i 1 u i δ u direct or iterative linear solvers are used to solve the linear system eq 11 common iterative krylov solvers include stabilized biconjugate gradient bicgstab or generalized minimal residual method gmres saad 2003 newton iteration continues until convergence criteria are met for norms calculated for the residual and or solution update park et al 2021 13 f u i 2 tol absolute f u i 2 f u 0 2 tol relative or f u i inf tol inf abs u i u i 1 inf tol update 2 4 primary variable switching the choice of primary dependent variables pdvs depends upon the local gas saturation s g at a grid cell as defined in table 1 when a grid cell transitions from one state to another it must update the pdvs through primary variable switching this is accomplished based on the criteria in table 2 vapor pressure p v dropping below p sat represents the bubbling of air in the liquid state while p v exceeding p sat is the condensation of water in the gas state gas saturation outside the range of 0 1 represent the disappearance of a phase i e gas when s g 0 and liquid when s g 1 and force the transition to a liquid or gas state from the two phase state eq 11 in section 2 3 defines a jacobian matrix j that is calculated during newton iteration jacobian derivatives are calculated in local 3 3 blocks that depend upon the pdvs the following 3 3 linear systems illustrate the jacobian blocks for the three states of a cell f w f a and f e are the residual functions for the water and air mass and energy conservation equation respectively liquid state 14 f w p l f w x l a f w t f a p l f a x l a f a t f e p l f e x l a f e t i δ p l δ x l a δ t

p g f e x g w f e t i δ p g δ x g w δ t f w f a f e i linear iteration is declared converged when the 2 norm of the residual eq 17 is less than the default value of 10 5 times the 2 norm of the initial residual this is the default relative 2 norm convergence criterion in petsc after each newton iteration the code determines the state of each grid cell based upon the criteria specified in table 2 and updates the pdvs at each cell accordingly a potential side effect of primary variable switching is oscillation between states between newton iterations this occurs when successive solution updates dictate a state change at a grid cell and the cell s state switches back and forth repeatedly this phenomenon can significantly hamper nonlinear solver performance an oscillating example would be if a grid cell s air bubbles and the state changes from the liquid state to two phase state but in the next newton iteration gas saturation is zero and all air is dissolved in the aqueous phase then it must switch back to the liquid state and this repeats for subsequent iterations if the simulation domain and properties are highly sensitive to changing states the simulation can be extremely challenged by these discontinuities in the residual equations f w a e and constitutive relations 2 5 time stepping algorithms our simulator s time step size is dynamically adjusted as shown in fig 2 the default values for maximum cut number is 40 the next time step size is determined by three factors a number of nonlinear iterations required to converge b absolute update of the governing equation unknowns and c maximum time step size these parameters all have default values but also can be user defined in the input andre et al 2021 3 newton trust region nonlinear solvers as noted earlier conventional newton raphson iterative solution of the coupled system on nonlinear algebraic equations can fail for challenging cases with heat generation which cause changes in multiphase states similar challenges with newton raphson were found in our prior work on isothermal multiphase flow park et al 2021 due to discontinuous nonlinear constitutive models and extreme contrasts in material properties in the discretized repository as in our previous work we show that trust region variants of newton method will lead to successful solution for especially difficult cases in this section we provide an overview of the two methods we implemented newton trust region ntr and newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc further details about the methods and our implementation are given in park et al park et al 2021 the discretized governing equations in residual form are a system of coupled nonlinear algebraic equations f u 0 the solution of the nonlinear system can also be posed as an optimization problem to minimize the magnitude of the residual as measured by some vector norm the 2 norm of f u is commonly used 17 f u 2 i 1 n f i u 2 1 2 f u t f u 1 2 therefore the unconstrained optimization problem is to minimize the following objective function 18 f u 1 2 f u 2 2 r n r finding the minimum of the function achieves the global unconstrained minimization as noted by heath 2018 and dennis and schnabel 1996 the iterative trust region methods are based on a local quadratic approximation to the objective function the quadratic approximation is assumed valid within a certain region in the current iteration and is expressed as 19 m k p f k g k t p 1 2 p t b k p s t p δ k above k is the iteration number p is the solution update or search direction δ k is the trust region radius at iteration k f 1 2 f t f g k j t f and b k j t j which is an approximation to the hessian matrix of second derivatives newton trust region ntr and newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc use the solution of this quadratic optimization problem to determine the proper size of the trust region tr the algorithms implemented into pflotran were given in our prior paper park et al 2021 and for convenience are shown as algorithms 1 and 3 in appendix b as detailed there the trust region solution requires an inner iteration nested within the standard newton iteration the standard newton update is computed and the improvement in the true objective function the norm of the residual given in eq 18 is compared with the improvement in quadratic approximation of the objective function 20 ρ k f u k f u k p k m k 0 m k p k depending upon the ratio ρ k the trust region size δ k either expands or shrinks in subsequent inner iterations see appendix c in some cases the cauchy point cp method i e direction of steepest descent for the quadratic approximation of the objective function is used to improve the newton solution update 4 accommodating primary variable switching in nonlinear solvers the nonisothermal miscible multiphase flow simulator requires primary variable switching pvs to represent three different states in a fully coupled set of governing equations liquid phase two phase and gas phase section 2 4 the nonlinear solver must resolve the solution and determine each grid cell s state in the domain within the physical constraints while the solution can sometimes converge without changing states in many realistic problems the updated unknowns during an iteration may exceed the physical limits for the state see table 2 thus requiring a change to a different set of states and a repeat of the nonlinear iteration for example if the converged solution for liquid saturation is less than or equal to zero meaning the liquid phase no longer exists then the state of the grid cell must transition into the gas phase from the two phase state this section introduces two algorithms algorithm 1 that integrate with ntrdc and ntr nonlinear solver so the primary variable switching is handled correctly if the inner iteration of the ntrdc and ntr solver does not control the phase state the solver will fail to converge since it computes the optimal solution update in a different phase state from the outer iteration solution these solvers must apply one of the two algorithms introduced in this section nr does not require the same treatment since there is no inner iteration and the phase state can be adjusted at each iteration if needed 4 1 holding primary variable in the inner iterations fig 3 illustrates schematically the optimization approach of the hold inner iteration hii algorithm the two surfaces with contours represent the residual space in each state for a grid cell the nonlinear solver optimizes the whole domain but this schematic depicts only one cell s behavior for simplicity the initial solution starts in the liquid phase marked as x 0 the first number is the outer iteration of the ntrdc algorithm and the second number is the inner iteration the hold inner iteration algorithm tries to optimize the solution in one state in the inner iteration by re evaluating the residuals as shown fig 3 it progresses through 4 inner iterations to get to the optimal solution in the liquid phase state in this cartoon however the converged solution exceeds the physical limits of the liquid state vapor pressure drops below the saturation pressure in this example therefore the simulator changes this grid cell to a two phase state the nonlinear solver acknowledges the primary variable switching and restarts the optimization in the two phase state after three inner iterations the two phase state solution is found the simulator confirms that the solution satisfies all the physical boundaries and declares a successful nonlinear convergence 4 2 forcing primary variable update in the outer iterations unlike the hold inner iteration algorithm the force newton iteration fni algorithm skips additional inner iteration steps of the ntrdc method and proceeds to the next outer iteration newton iteration when the solution update indicates a state change the outer iterations continue until state change does not change any further the force newton iterations algorithm allows the ntrdc method to proceed with the inner iterations to find the optimal solution fig 4 demonstrates the process of the algorithm the first iteration takes one inner iteration and then detects state changes in the second inner iteration the algorithm exits the inner iteration and proceeds to the outer iteration the successive two outer iterations changed states in the grid cell and newton s method tried to optimize in each step given a state finally in the fourth step the ntrdc method proceeded to find the optimal solution with the inner iterations in the two phase state 5 numerical experiments we evaluated nonlinear solver algorithm performance by simulating multiphase flow within a generic nuclear waste repository positioned above the groundwater table within an unsaturated alluvium the domain was discretized using three levels of grid refinement and three heat sources were considered of varying intensity grid resolution in the vicinity of nuclear waste packages and the magnitude of the heat source significantly influence peak temperatures and the state of the system within each grid cell i e single phase liquid vs two phase vs single phase gas which impacts solver performance the conceptual model is further described in section 5 1 these numerical experiments were performed on sandia national laboratories snl s boca high performance computing hpc cluster that hosts compute nodes composed of 36 cores with intel xeon gold 6240 processor 2 60 ghz 24 75 mb cache in two sockets with 6 memory channels sandia national laboratories 2021 intel 2021 results are presented in two types of bar charts computation time and time step cuts the computational wall clock time bar charts have three features computation time in minutes or hours in gray bars triangles pointing to the left indicating the number of linear iterations blue or time steps green on the left axis and red triangles pointing to the right indicating the number of nonlinear iterations on the right axis each time step requires one to 20 nonlinear iterations and each nonlinear iteration is solved using one to 10 000 linear iterations both the nonlinear and linear iteration counts include iterations from failed nonlinear iterations or time steps the time step cut bar chart is a stacked bar chart showing the number of time step cuts and the reasons for non convergence a time step cut due to linear solver failure occurs when the linear solver reaches the maximum 10 000 iterations or the krylov space breaks down time step cuts due to nonlinear solver failure occur when the maximum number of nonlinear iterations is reached or the solution is nonphysical nonphysical solutions occur when the pressure or temperature is outside the bounds for the equation of state or when the solution has a negative gas pressure after meeting the nonlinear convergence criteria the nonlinear solver can also fail when the trust region becomes too small the remainder of this section describes the repository conceptual model section 5 1 solver performance 5 2 5 3 and parallel scalability 5 4 solver behavior for the non boiling and boiling simulation domains is explained in sections 5 2 1 and 5 2 2 section 5 2 3 compares the performance of the hold inner iteration hii and force newton iteration fni algorithms section 5 3 shows performance results for the fully refined simulation domain with 7 2m unknowns 5 1 nonisothermal miscible case study one of the more challenging generic reference cases from gdsa is the unsaturated zone uz reference case which assumes a mined repository in unsaturated alluvium located approximately 255 m below the land surface containing hot commercial spent nuclear fuel sevougian et al 2017 the conceptual model considers a small amount of infiltration at the land surface and a water table at 500 m depth heat from the spent nuclear fuel waste packages can generate peak temperatures ranging from 150 c to 350 c that boil water and produce steam even at elevated pressures fig 5 illustrates the layout of the uz reference case 5 1 1 heat generating waste power levels fig 6 illustrates the spacing of waste packages within the repository waste packages are categorized based on the number of contained pressurized water reactor pwr fuel assemblies twelve 24 and 37 pwr packages are considered in this analysis the higher the number of assemblies in the waste packages the more heat is produced which causes higher peak temperatures for the waste repository simulations heat generation is the highest at the time of emplacement and as the radionuclides in the waste packages decay over time less power is produced the heat source is a simple time varying source term and is a tabulated data fig 7 illustrates the heat produced by each pwr assembly as a function of time 5 1 2 grid refinement levels three different discretizations are tested with 64k 104 3k and 2 4m grid cells these are referred to as the uniform refined and fully refined model respectively the top of fig 8 shows all three discretizations of the waste area in one figure for better comparison a single 5 m waste package is modeled by three grid cells in the fully refined model as shown in fig 6 this model also includes discretization of the surrounding engineered barriers and damaged rock zones in the refined model the heated excavated drifts are the most detailed feature that is represented by the discretization as seen in the top middle figure of fig 8 the uniform model grid represents the waste repository area as heat generating engineered barrier rock initially the simulator was to be run for the fully refined model however the standard newton solver could not complete a one million year simulation which is the goal for commercial spent fuel nuclear waste repositories the simulation reached only 50 years of simulation time using 1 024 cores for 48 h on sandia national laboratories snl s skybridge hpc cluster that hosts intel xeon processor e5 2670 2 60 ghz 20 mb cache the domain was coarsened gradually to the refined and uniform cases until the simulation would run to completion in a reasonable amount of computation time and resources using the standard newton solver the 24 pwr and 37 pwr power sources only finish for the uniform model when the grids are coarsened the physics of the problem changes because the heat generated by a 5 m long cylindrical waste package is averaged over the drift in the refined model and over the disturbed rock zone in the uniform model the uniform model has lower peak temperatures due to lower power density and is much easier to solve the refined and fully refined models ran to completion only after we implemented the ntr and ntrdc nonlinear solvers 5 2 comparing newton and trust region variances this section demonstrates the performance of the newton and newton trust region method i e ntr and ntrdc with hii or fni denoted at ntx for non boiling and boiling simulations in the uniform domain by comparing computation time time steps nonlinear and linear iterations and time step cuts simulation results for select grid cells in the more transient regions of the domain were compared at one million years and demonstrated less than 0 5 difference convergence tolerances and all other parameters in the simulation inputs were identical for all simulations 5 2 1 non boiling simulations the uniform domain with a 24 pwr power source reached a peak temperature of 80 c at atmospheric pressure and did not boil off all water i e no grid cells were purely gas phase state the results shown in fig 9 demonstrate that all three nonlinear solvers nr ntr ntrdc performed similarly regardless of whether the hold inner iteration hii or force newton iteration fni options were employed although nr had the lowest number of nonlinear iterations and time step cuts the nr run time still exceeded the other algorithms due to a larger number of linear solver iterations also note that nr had more linear solver failures and these types of failures are computationally expensive since all 10 000 iterations the linear solver maximum are discarded when the time step is cut the newton trust region methods ntx generated more nonphysical solutions and hii had more restrictive trust regions but such failures are often less expensive as they generally occur early in the nonlinear solve the trust region being too small is evidenced by the inner iteration repeatedly shrinking the trust region until it drops below a minimum threshold nonphysical solutions can occur when the nr update using bicgstab block jacobi ilu bcgs with incomplete lu factorization ilu preconditioner exceeds the bounds of the equation of state for example the nr update produced a 400 c temperature which is outside the equation of state s range of 0 to 374 c 5 2 2 boiling simulations the refined domain with the 37 pwr power source produced peak temperatures near 120 c at atmospheric pressure causing water to boil within many grid cells these cells quickly transitioned to a gas phase state the results shown within fig 10 demonstrate that the ntx nonlinear solvers perform better for the boiling simulations nr took twice as long as the trust regions variants though the ratio of linear to nonlinear iterations was very similar at around 134 thus the larger number of nr iterations accounts for the difference each ntx iteration was more efficient at minimizing the residual resulting in fewer nonlinear iterations and faster run times most of the nr time step cuts were caused by nonphysical solutions this behavior is discussed more in the fully refined model analysis in section 5 3 5 2 3 hold inner iteration vs force newton iteration in fig 10b the hii algorithm cut the time step more due to the trust region size falling below the specified tolerance than due to nonphysical solutions however the cost of solving the trust region sub problem i e the inner iteration appears to be similar to solving an extra newton iteration as hii and fni have similar run times hii typically calculates 12 20 residual evaluations before reaching the trust region tolerance while fni solves 1 2 linear systems before reaching a nonphysical solution the expected similar computation time is seen in fig 11 the hii algorithm can potentially improve computation time by loosening the trust region tolerance and increasing the expansion factor t 2 and decreasing the shrink factor t 1 these methods will be further investigated and optimized in the future research 5 3 fully refined simulations the fully refined 12 pwr model has approximately 7 2m degrees of freedom unknowns or 2 4m grid cells in the domain the newton solver reached a simulation time of 237 4 years out of 100 000 after 96 h of the computation time with 144 cores on the other hand fig 12 shows that ntr and ntrdc with the hii algorithm completed the simulation in just under 23 h with 5 000 nonlinear iterations excluding the sub problem inner iterations and around 6m linear iterations the fni algorithm also demonstrated similar results ntx had no issues resolving the difficult nonlinearities at the beginning of the simulation when the waste packages heated up to peak temperatures and cooled down in the first 1 000 years of the simulation and when the most phase state changes occured the newton solver produced nearly 40 000 time step cuts due to nonphysical solutions in the first 96 h of the simulation with 144 cores whereas ntx had only 1 500 time step cuts throughout the entire simulation this test case clearly demonstrates the superiority of the trust region methods over the standard newton raphson method and the behavior of the solvers was the same for the fully refined 24 pwr and 37 pwr cases where the peak temperatures were even higher fig 13 demonstrates ntr hii performance for the three power levels the 12 24 and 37 pwr cases all performed around the same in terms of computation time however there were some differences in linear iterations nonlinear iterations and time step cuts the 12 24 and 37 pwr cases experienced 2 7m 4 3m and 9 4m phase state changes in the domain throughout the simulation respectively the 37 pwr produced three times as many state changes increasing the number of newton iterations and restricting time step size i e through more time step cuts the 12 pwr and 24 pwr cases had substantially fewer nonlinear iterations and time step cuts yet the computation time was slightly greater than the 37 pwr case the slightly lower number of linear solver iterations for 37 pwr may be explained by the larger number of time steps and conversely the smaller average time step size which produced linear systems that were more diagonally dominant and easier to solve the ntr hii solver was able to resolve the extreme nonlinearities of the 37 pwr case and was able to complete the simulation with a run time similar to the 12 pwr case also the early detection of non convergence behavior in a time step indicated by the trust region becoming too small may have reduced the number of linear iterations for the 37 pwr case thus reducing the overall computation time fig 14 shows the time history of when the time step cuts occurred in the simulation and the number of nonlinear and linear iterations required to resolve the non convergence to complete the time step the 12 pwr case simulation had higher nonlinear iteration counts in between 200 years and 1000 years and small time step sizes which required fewer linear iterations to complete time steps during this period of time the heat generating waste packages are cooling down from peak temperatures see fig 7 and hence the system experiences aggressive re saturation of the waste repository area many cells change state during re saturation gas two phase liquid state the 37 pwr cases had more nonlinear iterations after 1000 years as those waste packages cooled down later in the simulation the 37 pwr case has about 500 more time step cuts between 1000 and 10 000 years compared to the other two cases fig 14f clearly illustrates that the time step size remained small for 37 pwr during this period of time although the nonlinear iteration counts were higher each iteration was fast due to the diagonally dominant linear system being solved evidenced by the lower linear iteration counts between 1 000 10 000 years in fig 14f results for all three cases are similar after 10 000 years into the simulation the 37 pwr case rarely exceeded 5000 linear iterations when there were time step cuts the other two cases had larger time step sizes overall but solving these larger time steps often required more than 5000 linear iterations when the time step was cut it is possible that the computation time for the other two cases could be reduced by specifying a maximum time step size of 40 years and such tuning will be studied in future work these results demonstrate the robustness of the trust region methods and their ability to improve nonlinear solver convergence 5 4 parallel scalability of the trust region solvers this section illustrates the parallel scalability of the trust region solvers ntr and ntrdc with hii and fni options and newton 5 4 1 in node strong scalability of trust region solvers the refined domain with 313 000 degrees of freedom was run on different numbers of cores and cores per node to demonstrate the strong scalability of the newly implemented algorithms newton ntr and ntrdc with the fni and hii algorithm the strong scaling of ntr and ntrdc follows the trend of ideal strong scaling in fig 15 the higher core counts i e 8 16 or 32 lose some efficiency as the node becomes more fully packed but still follow the ideal trend line the three single data points with the larger markers at 32 cores represent results run with one core per node they are much closer to the ideal for strong scalability 5 4 2 cross node strong scalability the fully refined domain 7 2 million degrees of freedom was used to test pflotran strong scaling using fully packed nodes strong scaling was calculated relative to a base case run with a single fully packed node 36 cores fig 16 shows that the trend follows the ideal line extremely closely except for the last point at 1152 cores the number of degrees of freedom per core drops below 10 000 a lower bound for good parallel pflotran performance reported by other research hammond et al 2014 see fig 16 6 conclusion simulation of multiphase flow is computationally challenging due to the highly nonlinear governing equations the large engineered simulation domain with high temperature heat sources introduces even more numerical difficulty these engineered subsurface system models also require fine spatial discretization in the area of the repository and coarsened discretization in the far field in the same domain this leads to a very large number of degrees of freedom in the numerical simulator thus requiring algorithms that can scale efficiently on parallel high performance computing hpc clusters in this paper we focus on how to overcome challenges in simulating a generic commercial spent nuclear fuel waste repository the high temperature heat sources cause nearby water to boil off into steam which dries out the repository but later after the heat sources cool down capillary pressure vapor diffusion and gravity forces lead to re saturation of the near repository zone these phase state changes are handled numerically by a primary variable switching pvs technique that introduces discontinuities in the nonlinear constitutive relations nonisothermal miscible subsurface flow numerical solutions require discretization of the fully coupled system of two flow and one energy governing equations the resulting system of coupled nonlinear algebraic equations is solved with newton raphson nr which requires solving the linear jacobian system at each iteration we want the simulator to have high computational efficiency as the performance assessment pa of the potential nuclear repositories will require numerous monte carlo simulations to explore uncertainty scenarios which may be specified by governmental regulatory agencies there were three main test cases studied nonboiling 190k unknowns boiling 313k unknowns and fully refined 7 2m unknowns simulations for a generic nuclear waste repository that is located 255 m below the land surface in the unsaturated zone with very small infiltration the simulation was 1 million years long which may be the regulatory period for repositories of commercial spent nuclear fuels the fully refined simulations failed to complete or took unacceptably long computation time with nr because of the discontinuities introduced by pvs we applied general newton trust region method to resolve the discontinuities and were able to successfully speed up and complete the simulations this paper presented the advanced nonlinear solvers newton trust region ntr and newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc and explained how to properly handle pvs in the inner iterations of the trust region method applying either hold inner iteration hii or force newton iteration fni algorithms interestingly no single solver algorithm combination outperformed the others in the numerical experiments hence for simplicity we refer to combinations of all trust region solvers as ntx the nonboiling and boiling simulations were created to further investigate the computational issues with the fully refined simulation ntx did not show any improvement relative to conventional nr for nonboiling simulations because the simulation had minimal phase state changes however ntx did result in two times speed up for the boiling simulation where the domain experienced a large number of phase state changes from liquid to two phase to gas phase and vice versa ntx demonstrated superior performance when compared in the fully refined simulation with 7 2m unknowns and 2 2m state changes throughout the simulation the standard nr could not complete the simulation halted at 200 years of simulation time but ntx completed the simulation in about 23 h with 144 cores on snl s boca hpc cluster ntx showed robustness of the nonlinear solver since it could handle different heat source scenarios having 4 3m and 9 4m million state changes while taking about the same computation time of 23 h with the same number of cores the ntr ntrdc nonlinear solvers and hii fni algorithms are implemented in parallel and the scalability is illustrated in the paper the cross node strong scalability nearly follows the ideal trend line the in node strong scalability also follows the trend but slightly off the ideal line the defect is explained by the modern architecture of processors in the paper future work will apply these solvers to reactive transport calculations in porous media that also inherit nonlinearities from biogeochemical reaction e g aqueous speciation surface complexation mineral precipitation dissolution and radioactive decay and ingrowth we also expect these robust nonlinear solvers to be powerful to other highly nonlinear problems that can arise in simulations of multiphase petroleum geothermal reservoirs and co 2 storage credit authorship contribution

doe that solves a nonlinear system of partial differential equations pdes governing multiphase flow and multicomponent reactive transport in porous materials using the finite volume method the code is designed to run in massively parallel computing architectures as well as workstations and laptops the code is developed and used by an international research community of subsurface scientists andre et al 2021 hammond et al 2012 lichtner et al 2015 it can handle many subsurface processes involving flow and transport in porous media including multiphase isothermal non isothermal miscible immiscible flow co2 two phase flow black oil model richards flow and thermal hydrologic flow and multicomponent reactive transport including aqueous complexation sorption and mineral precipitation and dissolution our simulator also has the capability to run miscible two phase co2 two phase black oil richards and thermal hydrologic models the flow and reactive transport equations are solved using the newton raphson method and fully implicit temporal discretization parallelization is achieved through domain decomposition using the petsc library balay et al 2021 2019 our simulator scales well on distributed memory high performance computing architectures hammond et al 2014 it has been run on up to 2 18 processor cores with problem sizes up to 2 billion degrees of freedom hammond et al 2014 it uses the metis parmetis karypis 2011 libraries for unstructured grids also it can read and write hdf5 folk et al 2011 files as well as ascii files for general use appendix b newton and trust region algorithms this appendix presents the conventional newton and the trust region versions that are used for the results in the paper in section 5 at each iteration the jacobian matrix and residual vector are computed the linear system is solved for the solution update s k b 1 newton raphson nonlinear solver this is the conventional nr method applied for multiphase flow model b 2 newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc nonlinear solver here are suggested parameters for ntrdc in section 3 if ρ η 1 then the inner iteration of tr sub problem is solved and moves on to the next outer newton iteration if ρ η 3 then the trust region is expanded for the next newton iteration and the trust region is shrunk if ρ η 2 if ρ is in between η 2 and η 3 then it keeps the trust region size t 1 and t 2 are the factors that are multiplied to the current trust region size δ k to shrink and expand respectively a typical values for these input parameters are 0 η 1 η 2 η 2 0 25 η 3 0 75 shrinking factor t 1 0 25 and expanding factor t 2 2 0 if the newton solution update generates ρ η 1 the cauchy point cp method attempts to improve the solution update in the ntrdc solver cp takes the steepest descent direction and the step size of the solution update which is dependent on the trust region δ the cp solution update is written as b 1 s k f k 2 f k t b k f k f k if neither cp nor newton solution update satisfies the trust region then it combines both solutions in ratio by solving the quadratic equation b 2 δ s k c y τ s k n t s k c y 2 here c y and n t are is the cauchy and newton solution update respectively b 3 newton trust region ntr nonlinear solver ntr algorithm is listed in algorithm 1 as noted before δ is the region within which the 2 norm of the residual can be approximated as quadratic details are provided below in the explanation of ntrdc in appendix b 2 the algorithm first solves the jacobian system to compute the conventional newton update the inner iteration loop is entered where the trust region size and the solution update are modified if this update falls within the trust region then it is used to update the solution if the norm of the conventional nr update is outside the trust region then it is scaled by δ divided by the norm of the update there is no evaluation or application of cauchy direction in ntr appendix c ntrdc algorithm demonstration fig c 17 demonstrates the ntrdc algorithm step by step the contour is the branin optimization test function but imagine the contour as a residual space of a grid cell in the domain x 0 magenta dot is the initial residual of the new time step applying the unknowns from the last converged solution when the solution reaches the minimum of the contour the residual is minimized and the solution is converged to explain the details of the figure the ntrdc algorithm s final optimization step and direction of the iteration is shown as solid arrows the cauchy step and direction are marked by dashed arrows and newton s step and direction are shown as dotted arrows the first iteration is in magenta the second is in yellow the third is in green and the fourth is in white the minimum point of the contour is the gold cross in the first nonlinear iteration the newton solution was sufficient to satisfy the trust region so cauchy was not calculated here the newton step and direction was an overshoot of the trust region heading for the saddle point thus was truncated by the trust region the first iteration also largely reduced the residual and the algorithm expanded the region for the next iteration the second iteration is complex but very important the second iteration calculated the newton solution towards the saddle point again but it did not sufficiently reduce the residual so cauchy was evaluated but it also did not reduce the residual enough the left figure on fig c 17 illustrates how the dogleg algorithm determines the optimization step and direction by combining the two solutions with a ratio τ the solution then is truncated by the trust region which becomes the most optimal and trusted solution the third iteration takes the cauchy solution which is the steepest descent solution that reduces the residual whereas the newton solution pointed to the saddle point again not shown the solution is truncated by the green trust region and moves on to the fourth iteration the fourth iteration has two inner iterations the first iteration finds the newton solution however the solution did not find any improvement in the quadratic model eq 19 hence reduces the trust region by a quarter and re evaluates the solution the second inner iteration finds the local minimum within the shrunk region which is also the global minimum if newton s method is applied to the same initial condition it does not find the minimum but ends up at the saddle point where the first and second iteration newton step reached and if you only use cauchy s method the minimum is found after 18 iterations the ntrdc method found the minimum with 4 outer iterations and 1 inner iteration the ntrdc method is much more complex than newton s method but it is robust and can be more efficient for more difficult nonlinear relationships and larger simulation domains appendix d boiling simulations with extended van genuchten curve sun et al 2010 discusses how typical van genuchten curve parameters are not calibrated for strongly heat driven conditions like those in our numerical experiments for conditions that reach boiling and rock dryout occurs fig d 18 is the ideal example illustrating the impact of the extended vg curve on computational efficiency the flat option is the original van genuchten curve that reaches infinite capillary pressure at the liquid residual saturation but is capped at 1 gpa to avoid nan values fig 1 when the simulation reaches the boiling condition the jacobian becomes inaccurate due to the discontinuity of the capillary pressure curve near the residual saturation with the flat option the ntrdc hii solver completes the simulation in 551 min using 16 cores but the original newton solver did not finish the simulation in 48 h in contrast the two extended options successfully completed the simulation approximately 20 min for the ntrdc hii solver and 33 min for the newton solver note that the exp option is the exponential extension and the lin option is the linear extension introduced in section 2 2 as expected we do not observe any difference in computational performance among the different van genuchten extensions for non boiling cases where the simulation does not reach the corner near the residual saturation shown in fig d 19 they generate very similar solutions including the one without the extension

101,coupling multiphase flow with energy transport due to high temperature heat sources introduces significant new challenges since boiling and condensation processes can lead to dry out conditions with subsequent re wetting the transition between two phase and single phase behavior can require changes to the primary dependent variables adding discontinuities as well as extending constitutive nonlinear relations to extreme physical conditions practical simulations of large scale engineered domains lead to jacobian systems with a very large number of unknowns that must be solved efficiently using iterative methods in parallel on high performance computers performance assessment of potential nuclear repositories carbon sequestration sites and geothermal reservoirs can require numerous monte carlo simulations to explore uncertainty in material properties boundary conditions and failure scenarios due to the numerical challenges standard nr iteration may not converge over the range of required simulations and require more sophisticated optimization method like trust region we use the open source simulator pflotran for the important practical problem of the safety assessment of future nuclear waste repositories in the u s doe geologic disposal safety assessment framework the simulator applies the petsc parallel framework and a backward euler finite volume discretization we demonstrate failure of the conventional nr method and the success of trust region modifications to newton s method for a series of test problems of increasing complexity trust region methods essentially modify the newton step size and direction under some circumstances where the standard nr iteration can cause the solution to diverge or oscillate we show how the newton trust region method can be adapted for primary variable switching pvs when the multiphase state changes due to boiling or condensation the simulations with high temperature heat sources which led to extreme nonlinear processes with many state changes in the domain did not converge with nr but they do complete successfully with the trust region methods modified for pvs this implementation effectively decreased weeks of simulation time needing manual adjustments to complete a simulation down to a day furthermore we show the strong scalability of the methods on a single node and multiple nodes in an hpc cluster keywords nonisothermal high temperature porous media multiphase flow miscible trust region 1 introduction modeling multiphase flow in porous media plays an important role in practical engineering applications such as carbon sequestration contaminant remediation geothermal engineering enhanced oil recovery and nuclear waste management accurate and robust simulators are needed to forecast the transport and fate of fluids and contaminants and to aid in design of engineered systems for applications to nuclear waste management simulators are used to design and evaluate engineered components of geological repositories assess repository safety and risk and conduct formal performance assessment to meet regulatory requirements for licensing because the governing flow equations are highly nonlinear and the simulations must be performed for large spatial domains over very long time horizons computational efficiency is paramount requiring that simulators run efficiently in parallel on high performance supercomputers since regulatory performance assessments require repeated monte carlo simulations to assess uncertainty considering failure scenarios and geologic heterogeneity the simulators must run efficiently and must also be robust for a wide range of hydrogeologic parameters the primary motivation for this research is capability development for safety assessment of generic nuclear waste repositories using the us department of energy doe geologic disposal safety assessment gdsa framework mariner et al 2015 sandia national laboratories 2018 the gdsa framework considers disposal options for heat generating high level nuclear wastes from power plants in different host rocks such as salt argillite and crystalline the goal is to analyze the impact of heat generating nuclear wastes on the surrounding environment for up to 1 million years with 3d non isothermal miscible two phase flow simulations simulations are run with pflotran a massively parallel subsurface flow and transport code andre et al 2021 founded upon the portable extensible toolkit for scientific computations petsc framework balay et al 2021 a the heat generated by radioactive decay can cause rapid water boiling with changes in multiphase states from single phase liquid to two phase liquid gas to single phase gas after the high temperature heat source cools gravity vapor diffusion and capillary forces induce re saturation which again causes changes in the multiphase states a different set of primary dependent variables pdvs is required as the multiphase states change spatially and temporally due to boiling and re saturation referred to as primary variable switching pvs which challenges numerical solutions techniques additional numerical challenges arise from discontinuities in parameters between neighboring engineered barrier materials and low permeability host rocks as will be demonstrated below these complexities can lead to extremely poor nonlinear solver performance we will demonstrate that trust region enhancements to newton s method can effectively address these numerical challenges these methods estimate the size of a trust region where the local taylors series approximation of newton s method is accurate and they can modify the step size and direction during the series of newton iterations dennis and schnabel 1996 heath 2018 although not typically used in the subsurface modeling literature a recent paper by b li et al li et al 2015 has shown that the newton trust region method can be used to resolve nonlinear oscillation and divergence problems for immiscible incompressible oil water porous media flow for advance oil recovery applications in this paper we evaluate newton trust region and the so called newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc methods and investigate strategies for primary variable switching during the newton iterations we also study the parallel performance and strong scalability of the nonlinear and linear solvers although our application is for heat generating waste in an engineered nuclear waste repository our results are also applicable to other applications such as modeling geothermal reservoirs and carbon sequestration with co 2 phase state changes due to high pressures and temperatures in what follows section 2 introduces the governing equations for nonisothermal miscible multiphase flow and shows how we modify the calculation of the nonlinear capillary pressure and relative permeability constitutive relations at the limiting bounds of residual saturation the section also gives a summary of the numerical solution approach including the newton raphson method primary variable switching and pflotran s time stepping algorithm section 3 describes the newton trust region and newton trust region dogleg cauchy methods section 4 illustrates discontinuities in solution caused by state changes and methods to adapt the trust region method for pvs section 5 presents results for simulator performance with conventional newton raphson and newton trust region for a series of test problems parallel scaling results are also presented section 6 summarizes key results and presents conclusions 2 nonisothermal miscible two phase porous media flow model 2 1 governing equations the case study mariner et al 2020 presented below relies on simulation of fully coupled flow of two fluid phases liquid and gas under non isothermal miscible conditions andre et al 2021 pruess et al 1999 the two governing mass conservation equations for the water and air components are respectively 1 t ϕ s l ρ l x l w s g ρ g x g w q l ρ l x l w q g ρ g x g w ϕ s l d l ρ l x l w ϕ s g d g ρ g x g w q w 2 t ϕ s l ρ l x l a s g ρ g x g a q l ρ l x l a q g ρ g x g a ϕ s l d l ρ l x l a ϕ s g d g ρ g x g a q a where ϕ is porosity s is saturation ρ kg m 3 is density and q kg m 3 s 1 is the source sink term each phase is denoted by subscripts g gas and l liquid the mole fraction is x l g a w with a superscript for the component e g air or water and subscript for the phase and d l g is the phase dependent diffusion coefficient m 2 s 1 the darcy velocity is q l g m s 1 for each phase and is defined as 3 q l k k r l μ l p l ρ l g 4 q g k k r g μ g p g ρ g g where p is pressure k m 2 is intrinsic permeability k r is relative permeability and μ pa s is viscosity the density for each phase is calculated through equations of state for liquid water steam and air as 5 ρ l ρ w p l t 6 ρ g ρ steam p v t ρ a p a t where ρ w is liquid water density ρ steam is steam density ρ a is dry air density as a function of partial p a air or p v vapor pressure and t temperature we assume that the temperature in a grid cell is at thermal equilibrium henry s law is applied to calculate the air partial pressure 7 x l a k p sat t p a the henry s constant for air k is a function of temperature and saturation vapor pressure p sat and the code uses the formulation by fernandez prini et al fernández prini et al 2003 x l a is mole fraction of air in the liquid phase and p a is the air partial pressure the energy conservation equation couples saturation and pressure of each phase γ l g to internal energy u γ j enthalpy h γ p γ t j and temperature we assume thermal equilibrium between the rock and the fluid phases which allows the equation to be written as 8 γ l g t ϕ s ρ u γ q ρ h γ t

by the relationship from the energy conservation law 10 u γ h γ p γ ρ γ the enthalpy is given by an equation of state as a function of pressure for each γ and temperature wagner and kretzschmar 2008 all the derivations above are presented in more detail in pruess et al 1999 and lichtner et al 2015 2 2 capillary pressure and residual saturation to apply darcy s law to model flow of two phases muskat and meres muskat and meres 1936 postulated that the velocity of the liquid and gas phases are dependent upon relative permeabilities k r l and k r g and the pressure gradient as presented above in eqs 3 and 4 later leverett expanded upon this model by including capillary effects leverett 1941 we use the van genuchten van genuchten capillary pressure model in this paper the limitation of the van genuchten model is the use of the concept of effective saturation θ defined as the fraction of liquid filled pores greater than the residual liquid saturation because capillary pressure approaches infinity when effective saturation approaches zero and is completely undefined at saturation below the residual value when the liquid phase can be removed by other processes such as by evaporation or boiling an extension to the van genuchten model is necessary sun et al 2010 previously pflotran truncated the capillary pressure at some large but finite value as shown in fig 1 flat curve while this approach defines values below residual saturation ordinary newton raphson nr may fail to converge due to the discontinuous derivative as presented in appendix d this proves to be the case here for the original newton solver in the absence of experimental data capillary pressure below the residual can be extrapolated from conventional capillary pressure data or interpolated to a specified maximum capillary pressure in either case to provide a numerically stable model for nr the capillary pressure model should be both continuous and smooth over the residual region in this work both linear and exponential extensions were implemented and are now able to be defined in pflotran by either extrapolating from a defined junction saturation point or interpolating from a maximum capillary pressure when extrapolation is selected a default junction at 5 of effective saturation was selected to be consistent with the practice in the non isothermal unsaturated flow and transport code nuft nitao 1998 conversely when interpolation is utilized a default maximum capillary pressure of 1 gpa is utilized consistent with the work of webb webb 2000 fig 1 illustrates interpolation of the van genuchten capillary pressure model to 1 gpa using unsaturated extensions that were implemented into pflotran as part of this work the numerical experiments in section 5 apply the van genuchten extensions for all experiments to eliminate the discontinuity in capillary pressure while the ntrdc is able to converge even where the discontinuity is present simulator performance is nevertheless much improved using either linear or exponential extensions as presented in detail in appendix d 2 3 newton raphson iteration for nonlinear system of equations the fully coupled system of equations eq 1 eq 2 and eq 8 in pflotran is discretized using the finite volume method with implicit backward euler differencing in time this results in a coupled system of nonlinear algebraic equations newton s method is employed to solve the nonlinear system of equations the residual f u is calculated for each discrete mass and energy conservation equation and the primary dependant variables pdvs are updated by iteratively solving the linear system 11 j f u i δ u f u i with pdvs u iteration number i and jacobian matrix j f and updating the solution 12 u i 1 u i δ u direct or iterative linear solvers are used to solve the linear system eq 11 common iterative krylov solvers include stabilized biconjugate gradient bicgstab or generalized minimal residual method gmres saad 2003 newton iteration continues until convergence criteria are met for norms calculated for the residual and or solution update park et al 2021 13 f u i 2 tol absolute f u i 2 f u 0 2 tol relative or f u i inf tol inf abs u i u i 1 inf tol update 2 4 primary variable switching the choice of primary dependent variables pdvs depends upon the local gas saturation s g at a grid cell as defined in table 1 when a grid cell transitions from one state to another it must update the pdvs through primary variable switching this is accomplished based on the criteria in table 2 vapor pressure p v dropping below p sat represents the bubbling of air in the liquid state while p v exceeding p sat is the condensation of water in the gas state gas saturation outside the range of 0 1 represent the disappearance of a phase i e gas when s g 0 and liquid when s g 1 and force the transition to a liquid or gas state from the two phase state eq 11 in section 2 3 defines a jacobian matrix j that is calculated during newton iteration jacobian derivatives are calculated in local 3 3 blocks that depend upon the pdvs the following 3 3 linear systems illustrate the jacobian blocks for the three states of a cell f w f a and f e are the residual functions for the water and air mass and energy conservation equation respectively liquid state 14 f w p l f w x l a f w t f a p l f a x l a f a t f e p l f e x l a f e t i δ p l δ x l a δ t

p g f e x g w f e t i δ p g δ x g w δ t f w f a f e i linear iteration is declared converged when the 2 norm of the residual eq 17 is less than the default value of 10 5 times the 2 norm of the initial residual this is the default relative 2 norm convergence criterion in petsc after each newton iteration the code determines the state of each grid cell based upon the criteria specified in table 2 and updates the pdvs at each cell accordingly a potential side effect of primary variable switching is oscillation between states between newton iterations this occurs when successive solution updates dictate a state change at a grid cell and the cell s state switches back and forth repeatedly this phenomenon can significantly hamper nonlinear solver performance an oscillating example would be if a grid cell s air bubbles and the state changes from the liquid state to two phase state but in the next newton iteration gas saturation is zero and all air is dissolved in the aqueous phase then it must switch back to the liquid state and this repeats for subsequent iterations if the simulation domain and properties are highly sensitive to changing states the simulation can be extremely challenged by these discontinuities in the residual equations f w a e and constitutive relations 2 5 time stepping algorithms our simulator s time step size is dynamically adjusted as shown in fig 2 the default values for maximum cut number is 40 the next time step size is determined by three factors a number of nonlinear iterations required to converge b absolute update of the governing equation unknowns and c maximum time step size these parameters all have default values but also can be user defined in the input andre et al 2021 3 newton trust region nonlinear solvers as noted earlier conventional newton raphson iterative solution of the coupled system on nonlinear algebraic equations can fail for challenging cases with heat generation which cause changes in multiphase states similar challenges with newton raphson were found in our prior work on isothermal multiphase flow park et al 2021 due to discontinuous nonlinear constitutive models and extreme contrasts in material properties in the discretized repository as in our previous work we show that trust region variants of newton method will lead to successful solution for especially difficult cases in this section we provide an overview of the two methods we implemented newton trust region ntr and newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc further details about the methods and our implementation are given in park et al park et al 2021 the discretized governing equations in residual form are a system of coupled nonlinear algebraic equations f u 0 the solution of the nonlinear system can also be posed as an optimization problem to minimize the magnitude of the residual as measured by some vector norm the 2 norm of f u is commonly used 17 f u 2 i 1 n f i u 2 1 2 f u t f u 1 2 therefore the unconstrained optimization problem is to minimize the following objective function 18 f u 1 2 f u 2 2 r n r finding the minimum of the function achieves the global unconstrained minimization as noted by heath 2018 and dennis and schnabel 1996 the iterative trust region methods are based on a local quadratic approximation to the objective function the quadratic approximation is assumed valid within a certain region in the current iteration and is expressed as 19 m k p f k g k t p 1 2 p t b k p s t p δ k above k is the iteration number p is the solution update or search direction δ k is the trust region radius at iteration k f 1 2 f t f g k j t f and b k j t j which is an approximation to the hessian matrix of second derivatives newton trust region ntr and newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc use the solution of this quadratic optimization problem to determine the proper size of the trust region tr the algorithms implemented into pflotran were given in our prior paper park et al 2021 and for convenience are shown as algorithms 1 and 3 in appendix b as detailed there the trust region solution requires an inner iteration nested within the standard newton iteration the standard newton update is computed and the improvement in the true objective function the norm of the residual given in eq 18 is compared with the improvement in quadratic approximation of the objective function 20 ρ k f u k f u k p k m k 0 m k p k depending upon the ratio ρ k the trust region size δ k either expands or shrinks in subsequent inner iterations see appendix c in some cases the cauchy point cp method i e direction of steepest descent for the quadratic approximation of the objective function is used to improve the newton solution update 4 accommodating primary variable switching in nonlinear solvers the nonisothermal miscible multiphase flow simulator requires primary variable switching pvs to represent three different states in a fully coupled set of governing equations liquid phase two phase and gas phase section 2 4 the nonlinear solver must resolve the solution and determine each grid cell s state in the domain within the physical constraints while the solution can sometimes converge without changing states in many realistic problems the updated unknowns during an iteration may exceed the physical limits for the state see table 2 thus requiring a change to a different set of states and a repeat of the nonlinear iteration for example if the converged solution for liquid saturation is less than or equal to zero meaning the liquid phase no longer exists then the state of the grid cell must transition into the gas phase from the two phase state this section introduces two algorithms algorithm 1 that integrate with ntrdc and ntr nonlinear solver so the primary variable switching is handled correctly if the inner iteration of the ntrdc and ntr solver does not control the phase state the solver will fail to converge since it computes the optimal solution update in a different phase state from the outer iteration solution these solvers must apply one of the two algorithms introduced in this section nr does not require the same treatment since there is no inner iteration and the phase state can be adjusted at each iteration if needed 4 1 holding primary variable in the inner iterations fig 3 illustrates schematically the optimization approach of the hold inner iteration hii algorithm the two surfaces with contours represent the residual space in each state for a grid cell the nonlinear solver optimizes the whole domain but this schematic depicts only one cell s behavior for simplicity the initial solution starts in the liquid phase marked as x 0 the first number is the outer iteration of the ntrdc algorithm and the second number is the inner iteration the hold inner iteration algorithm tries to optimize the solution in one state in the inner iteration by re evaluating the residuals as shown fig 3 it progresses through 4 inner iterations to get to the optimal solution in the liquid phase state in this cartoon however the converged solution exceeds the physical limits of the liquid state vapor pressure drops below the saturation pressure in this example therefore the simulator changes this grid cell to a two phase state the nonlinear solver acknowledges the primary variable switching and restarts the optimization in the two phase state after three inner iterations the two phase state solution is found the simulator confirms that the solution satisfies all the physical boundaries and declares a successful nonlinear convergence 4 2 forcing primary variable update in the outer iterations unlike the hold inner iteration algorithm the force newton iteration fni algorithm skips additional inner iteration steps of the ntrdc method and proceeds to the next outer iteration newton iteration when the solution update indicates a state change the outer iterations continue until state change does not change any further the force newton iterations algorithm allows the ntrdc method to proceed with the inner iterations to find the optimal solution fig 4 demonstrates the process of the algorithm the first iteration takes one inner iteration and then detects state changes in the second inner iteration the algorithm exits the inner iteration and proceeds to the outer iteration the successive two outer iterations changed states in the grid cell and newton s method tried to optimize in each step given a state finally in the fourth step the ntrdc method proceeded to find the optimal solution with the inner iterations in the two phase state 5 numerical experiments we evaluated nonlinear solver algorithm performance by simulating multiphase flow within a generic nuclear waste repository positioned above the groundwater table within an unsaturated alluvium the domain was discretized using three levels of grid refinement and three heat sources were considered of varying intensity grid resolution in the vicinity of nuclear waste packages and the magnitude of the heat source significantly influence peak temperatures and the state of the system within each grid cell i e single phase liquid vs two phase vs single phase gas which impacts solver performance the conceptual model is further described in section 5 1 these numerical experiments were performed on sandia national laboratories snl s boca high performance computing hpc cluster that hosts compute nodes composed of 36 cores with intel xeon gold 6240 processor 2 60 ghz 24 75 mb cache in two sockets with 6 memory channels sandia national laboratories 2021 intel 2021 results are presented in two types of bar charts computation time and time step cuts the computational wall clock time bar charts have three features computation time in minutes or hours in gray bars triangles pointing to the left indicating the number of linear iterations blue or time steps green on the left axis and red triangles pointing to the right indicating the number of nonlinear iterations on the right axis each time step requires one to 20 nonlinear iterations and each nonlinear iteration is solved using one to 10 000 linear iterations both the nonlinear and linear iteration counts include iterations from failed nonlinear iterations or time steps the time step cut bar chart is a stacked bar chart showing the number of time step cuts and the reasons for non convergence a time step cut due to linear solver failure occurs when the linear solver reaches the maximum 10 000 iterations or the krylov space breaks down time step cuts due to nonlinear solver failure occur when the maximum number of nonlinear iterations is reached or the solution is nonphysical nonphysical solutions occur when the pressure or temperature is outside the bounds for the equation of state or when the solution has a negative gas pressure after meeting the nonlinear convergence criteria the nonlinear solver can also fail when the trust region becomes too small the remainder of this section describes the repository conceptual model section 5 1 solver performance 5 2 5 3 and parallel scalability 5 4 solver behavior for the non boiling and boiling simulation domains is explained in sections 5 2 1 and 5 2 2 section 5 2 3 compares the performance of the hold inner iteration hii and force newton iteration fni algorithms section 5 3 shows performance results for the fully refined simulation domain with 7 2m unknowns 5 1 nonisothermal miscible case study one of the more challenging generic reference cases from gdsa is the unsaturated zone uz reference case which assumes a mined repository in unsaturated alluvium located approximately 255 m below the land surface containing hot commercial spent nuclear fuel sevougian et al 2017 the conceptual model considers a small amount of infiltration at the land surface and a water table at 500 m depth heat from the spent nuclear fuel waste packages can generate peak temperatures ranging from 150 c to 350 c that boil water and produce steam even at elevated pressures fig 5 illustrates the layout of the uz reference case 5 1 1 heat generating waste power levels fig 6 illustrates the spacing of waste packages within the repository waste packages are categorized based on the number of contained pressurized water reactor pwr fuel assemblies twelve 24 and 37 pwr packages are considered in this analysis the higher the number of assemblies in the waste packages the more heat is produced which causes higher peak temperatures for the waste repository simulations heat generation is the highest at the time of emplacement and as the radionuclides in the waste packages decay over time less power is produced the heat source is a simple time varying source term and is a tabulated data fig 7 illustrates the heat produced by each pwr assembly as a function of time 5 1 2 grid refinement levels three different discretizations are tested with 64k 104 3k and 2 4m grid cells these are referred to as the uniform refined and fully refined model respectively the top of fig 8 shows all three discretizations of the waste area in one figure for better comparison a single 5 m waste package is modeled by three grid cells in the fully refined model as shown in fig 6 this model also includes discretization of the surrounding engineered barriers and damaged rock zones in the refined model the heated excavated drifts are the most detailed feature that is represented by the discretization as seen in the top middle figure of fig 8 the uniform model grid represents the waste repository area as heat generating engineered barrier rock initially the simulator was to be run for the fully refined model however the standard newton solver could not complete a one million year simulation which is the goal for commercial spent fuel nuclear waste repositories the simulation reached only 50 years of simulation time using 1 024 cores for 48 h on sandia national laboratories snl s skybridge hpc cluster that hosts intel xeon processor e5 2670 2 60 ghz 20 mb cache the domain was coarsened gradually to the refined and uniform cases until the simulation would run to completion in a reasonable amount of computation time and resources using the standard newton solver the 24 pwr and 37 pwr power sources only finish for the uniform model when the grids are coarsened the physics of the problem changes because the heat generated by a 5 m long cylindrical waste package is averaged over the drift in the refined model and over the disturbed rock zone in the uniform model the uniform model has lower peak temperatures due to lower power density and is much easier to solve the refined and fully refined models ran to completion only after we implemented the ntr and ntrdc nonlinear solvers 5 2 comparing newton and trust region variances this section demonstrates the performance of the newton and newton trust region method i e ntr and ntrdc with hii or fni denoted at ntx for non boiling and boiling simulations in the uniform domain by comparing computation time time steps nonlinear and linear iterations and time step cuts simulation results for select grid cells in the more transient regions of the domain were compared at one million years and demonstrated less than 0 5 difference convergence tolerances and all other parameters in the simulation inputs were identical for all simulations 5 2 1 non boiling simulations the uniform domain with a 24 pwr power source reached a peak temperature of 80 c at atmospheric pressure and did not boil off all water i e no grid cells were purely gas phase state the results shown in fig 9 demonstrate that all three nonlinear solvers nr ntr ntrdc performed similarly regardless of whether the hold inner iteration hii or force newton iteration fni options were employed although nr had the lowest number of nonlinear iterations and time step cuts the nr run time still exceeded the other algorithms due to a larger number of linear solver iterations also note that nr had more linear solver failures and these types of failures are computationally expensive since all 10 000 iterations the linear solver maximum are discarded when the time step is cut the newton trust region methods ntx generated more nonphysical solutions and hii had more restrictive trust regions but such failures are often less expensive as they generally occur early in the nonlinear solve the trust region being too small is evidenced by the inner iteration repeatedly shrinking the trust region until it drops below a minimum threshold nonphysical solutions can occur when the nr update using bicgstab block jacobi ilu bcgs with incomplete lu factorization ilu preconditioner exceeds the bounds of the equation of state for example the nr update produced a 400 c temperature which is outside the equation of state s range of 0 to 374 c 5 2 2 boiling simulations the refined domain with the 37 pwr power source produced peak temperatures near 120 c at atmospheric pressure causing water to boil within many grid cells these cells quickly transitioned to a gas phase state the results shown within fig 10 demonstrate that the ntx nonlinear solvers perform better for the boiling simulations nr took twice as long as the trust regions variants though the ratio of linear to nonlinear iterations was very similar at around 134 thus the larger number of nr iterations accounts for the difference each ntx iteration was more efficient at minimizing the residual resulting in fewer nonlinear iterations and faster run times most of the nr time step cuts were caused by nonphysical solutions this behavior is discussed more in the fully refined model analysis in section 5 3 5 2 3 hold inner iteration vs force newton iteration in fig 10b the hii algorithm cut the time step more due to the trust region size falling below the specified tolerance than due to nonphysical solutions however the cost of solving the trust region sub problem i e the inner iteration appears to be similar to solving an extra newton iteration as hii and fni have similar run times hii typically calculates 12 20 residual evaluations before reaching the trust region tolerance while fni solves 1 2 linear systems before reaching a nonphysical solution the expected similar computation time is seen in fig 11 the hii algorithm can potentially improve computation time by loosening the trust region tolerance and increasing the expansion factor t 2 and decreasing the shrink factor t 1 these methods will be further investigated and optimized in the future research 5 3 fully refined simulations the fully refined 12 pwr model has approximately 7 2m degrees of freedom unknowns or 2 4m grid cells in the domain the newton solver reached a simulation time of 237 4 years out of 100 000 after 96 h of the computation time with 144 cores on the other hand fig 12 shows that ntr and ntrdc with the hii algorithm completed the simulation in just under 23 h with 5 000 nonlinear iterations excluding the sub problem inner iterations and around 6m linear iterations the fni algorithm also demonstrated similar results ntx had no issues resolving the difficult nonlinearities at the beginning of the simulation when the waste packages heated up to peak temperatures and cooled down in the first 1 000 years of the simulation and when the most phase state changes occured the newton solver produced nearly 40 000 time step cuts due to nonphysical solutions in the first 96 h of the simulation with 144 cores whereas ntx had only 1 500 time step cuts throughout the entire simulation this test case clearly demonstrates the superiority of the trust region methods over the standard newton raphson method and the behavior of the solvers was the same for the fully refined 24 pwr and 37 pwr cases where the peak temperatures were even higher fig 13 demonstrates ntr hii performance for the three power levels the 12 24 and 37 pwr cases all performed around the same in terms of computation time however there were some differences in linear iterations nonlinear iterations and time step cuts the 12 24 and 37 pwr cases experienced 2 7m 4 3m and 9 4m phase state changes in the domain throughout the simulation respectively the 37 pwr produced three times as many state changes increasing the number of newton iterations and restricting time step size i e through more time step cuts the 12 pwr and 24 pwr cases had substantially fewer nonlinear iterations and time step cuts yet the computation time was slightly greater than the 37 pwr case the slightly lower number of linear solver iterations for 37 pwr may be explained by the larger number of time steps and conversely the smaller average time step size which produced linear systems that were more diagonally dominant and easier to solve the ntr hii solver was able to resolve the extreme nonlinearities of the 37 pwr case and was able to complete the simulation with a run time similar to the 12 pwr case also the early detection of non convergence behavior in a time step indicated by the trust region becoming too small may have reduced the number of linear iterations for the 37 pwr case thus reducing the overall computation time fig 14 shows the time history of when the time step cuts occurred in the simulation and the number of nonlinear and linear iterations required to resolve the non convergence to complete the time step the 12 pwr case simulation had higher nonlinear iteration counts in between 200 years and 1000 years and small time step sizes which required fewer linear iterations to complete time steps during this period of time the heat generating waste packages are cooling down from peak temperatures see fig 7 and hence the system experiences aggressive re saturation of the waste repository area many cells change state during re saturation gas two phase liquid state the 37 pwr cases had more nonlinear iterations after 1000 years as those waste packages cooled down later in the simulation the 37 pwr case has about 500 more time step cuts between 1000 and 10 000 years compared to the other two cases fig 14f clearly illustrates that the time step size remained small for 37 pwr during this period of time although the nonlinear iteration counts were higher each iteration was fast due to the diagonally dominant linear system being solved evidenced by the lower linear iteration counts between 1 000 10 000 years in fig 14f results for all three cases are similar after 10 000 years into the simulation the 37 pwr case rarely exceeded 5000 linear iterations when there were time step cuts the other two cases had larger time step sizes overall but solving these larger time steps often required more than 5000 linear iterations when the time step was cut it is possible that the computation time for the other two cases could be reduced by specifying a maximum time step size of 40 years and such tuning will be studied in future work these results demonstrate the robustness of the trust region methods and their ability to improve nonlinear solver convergence 5 4 parallel scalability of the trust region solvers this section illustrates the parallel scalability of the trust region solvers ntr and ntrdc with hii and fni options and newton 5 4 1 in node strong scalability of trust region solvers the refined domain with 313 000 degrees of freedom was run on different numbers of cores and cores per node to demonstrate the strong scalability of the newly implemented algorithms newton ntr and ntrdc with the fni and hii algorithm the strong scaling of ntr and ntrdc follows the trend of ideal strong scaling in fig 15 the higher core counts i e 8 16 or 32 lose some efficiency as the node becomes more fully packed but still follow the ideal trend line the three single data points with the larger markers at 32 cores represent results run with one core per node they are much closer to the ideal for strong scalability 5 4 2 cross node strong scalability the fully refined domain 7 2 million degrees of freedom was used to test pflotran strong scaling using fully packed nodes strong scaling was calculated relative to a base case run with a single fully packed node 36 cores fig 16 shows that the trend follows the ideal line extremely closely except for the last point at 1152 cores the number of degrees of freedom per core drops below 10 000 a lower bound for good parallel pflotran performance reported by other research hammond et al 2014 see fig 16 6 conclusion simulation of multiphase flow is computationally challenging due to the highly nonlinear governing equations the large engineered simulation domain with high temperature heat sources introduces even more numerical difficulty these engineered subsurface system models also require fine spatial discretization in the area of the repository and coarsened discretization in the far field in the same domain this leads to a very large number of degrees of freedom in the numerical simulator thus requiring algorithms that can scale efficiently on parallel high performance computing hpc clusters in this paper we focus on how to overcome challenges in simulating a generic commercial spent nuclear fuel waste repository the high temperature heat sources cause nearby water to boil off into steam which dries out the repository but later after the heat sources cool down capillary pressure vapor diffusion and gravity forces lead to re saturation of the near repository zone these phase state changes are handled numerically by a primary variable switching pvs technique that introduces discontinuities in the nonlinear constitutive relations nonisothermal miscible subsurface flow numerical solutions require discretization of the fully coupled system of two flow and one energy governing equations the resulting system of coupled nonlinear algebraic equations is solved with newton raphson nr which requires solving the linear jacobian system at each iteration we want the simulator to have high computational efficiency as the performance assessment pa of the potential nuclear repositories will require numerous monte carlo simulations to explore uncertainty scenarios which may be specified by governmental regulatory agencies there were three main test cases studied nonboiling 190k unknowns boiling 313k unknowns and fully refined 7 2m unknowns simulations for a generic nuclear waste repository that is located 255 m below the land surface in the unsaturated zone with very small infiltration the simulation was 1 million years long which may be the regulatory period for repositories of commercial spent nuclear fuels the fully refined simulations failed to complete or took unacceptably long computation time with nr because of the discontinuities introduced by pvs we applied general newton trust region method to resolve the discontinuities and were able to successfully speed up and complete the simulations this paper presented the advanced nonlinear solvers newton trust region ntr and newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc and explained how to properly handle pvs in the inner iterations of the trust region method applying either hold inner iteration hii or force newton iteration fni algorithms interestingly no single solver algorithm combination outperformed the others in the numerical experiments hence for simplicity we refer to combinations of all trust region solvers as ntx the nonboiling and boiling simulations were created to further investigate the computational issues with the fully refined simulation ntx did not show any improvement relative to conventional nr for nonboiling simulations because the simulation had minimal phase state changes however ntx did result in two times speed up for the boiling simulation where the domain experienced a large number of phase state changes from liquid to two phase to gas phase and vice versa ntx demonstrated superior performance when compared in the fully refined simulation with 7 2m unknowns and 2 2m state changes throughout the simulation the standard nr could not complete the simulation halted at 200 years of simulation time but ntx completed the simulation in about 23 h with 144 cores on snl s boca hpc cluster ntx showed robustness of the nonlinear solver since it could handle different heat source scenarios having 4 3m and 9 4m million state changes while taking about the same computation time of 23 h with the same number of cores the ntr ntrdc nonlinear solvers and hii fni algorithms are implemented in parallel and the scalability is illustrated in the paper the cross node strong scalability nearly follows the ideal trend line the in node strong scalability also follows the trend but slightly off the ideal line the defect is explained by the modern architecture of processors in the paper future work will apply these solvers to reactive transport calculations in porous media that also inherit nonlinearities from biogeochemical reaction e g aqueous speciation surface complexation mineral precipitation dissolution and radioactive decay and ingrowth we also expect these robust nonlinear solvers to be powerful to other highly nonlinear problems that can arise in simulations of multiphase petroleum geothermal reservoirs and co 2 storage credit authorship contribution

algorithms this appendix presents the conventional newton and the trust region versions that are used for the results in the paper in section 5 at each iteration the jacobian matrix and residual vector are computed the linear system is solved for the solution update s k b 1 newton raphson nonlinear solver this is the conventional nr method applied for multiphase flow model b 2 newton trust region dogleg cauchy ntrdc nonlinear solver here are suggested parameters for ntrdc in section 3 if ρ η 1 then the inner iteration of tr sub problem is solved and moves on to the next outer newton iteration if ρ η 3 then the trust region is expanded for the next newton iteration and the trust region is shrunk if ρ η 2 if ρ is in between η 2 and η 3 then it keeps the trust region size t 1 and t 2 are the factors that are multiplied to the current trust region size δ k to shrink and expand respectively a typical values for these input parameters are 0 η 1 η 2 η 2 0 25 η 3 0 75 shrinking factor t 1 0 25 and expanding factor t 2 2 0 if the newton solution update generates ρ η 1 the cauchy point cp method attempts to improve the solution update in the ntrdc solver cp takes the steepest descent direction and the step size of the solution update which is dependent on the trust region δ the cp solution update is written as b 1 s k f k 2 f k t b k f k f k if neither cp nor newton solution update satisfies the trust region then it combines both solutions in ratio by solving the quadratic equation b 2 δ s k c y τ s k n t s k c y 2 here c y and n t are is the cauchy and newton solution update respectively b 3 newton trust region ntr nonlinear solver ntr algorithm is listed in algorithm 1 as noted before δ is the region within which the 2 norm of the residual can be approximated as quadratic details are provided below in the explanation of ntrdc in appendix b 2 the algorithm first solves the jacobian system to compute the conventional newton update the inner iteration loop is entered where the trust region size and the solution update are modified if this update falls within the trust region then it is used to update the solution if the norm of the conventional nr update is outside the trust region then it is scaled by δ divided by the norm of the update there is no evaluation or application of cauchy direction in ntr appendix c ntrdc algorithm demonstration fig c 17 demonstrates the ntrdc algorithm step by step the contour is the branin optimization test function but imagine the contour as a residual space of a grid cell in the domain x 0 magenta dot is the initial residual of the new time step applying the unknowns from the last converged solution when the solution reaches the minimum of the contour the residual is minimized and the solution is converged to explain the details of the figure the ntrdc algorithm s final optimization step and direction of the iteration is shown as solid arrows the cauchy step and direction are marked by dashed arrows and newton s step and direction are shown as dotted arrows the first iteration is in magenta the second is in yellow the third is in green and the fourth is in white the minimum point of the contour is the gold cross in the first nonlinear iteration the newton solution was sufficient to satisfy the trust region so cauchy was not calculated here the newton step and direction was an overshoot of the trust region heading for the saddle point thus was truncated by the trust region the first iteration also largely reduced the residual and the algorithm expanded the region for the next iteration the second iteration is complex but very important the second iteration calculated the newton solution towards the saddle point again but it did not sufficiently reduce the residual so cauchy was evaluated but it also did not reduce the residual enough the left figure on fig c 17 illustrates how the dogleg algorithm determines the optimization step and direction by combining the two solutions with a ratio τ the solution then is truncated by the trust region which becomes the most optimal and trusted solution the third iteration takes the cauchy solution which is the steepest descent solution that reduces the residual whereas the newton solution pointed to the saddle point again not shown the solution is truncated by the green trust region and moves on to the fourth iteration the fourth iteration has two inner iterations the first iteration finds the newton solution however the solution did not find any improvement in the quadratic model eq 19 hence reduces the trust region by a quarter and re evaluates the solution the second inner iteration finds the local minimum within the shrunk region which is also the global minimum if newton s method is applied to the same initial condition it does not find the minimum but ends up at the saddle point where the first and second iteration newton step reached and if you only use cauchy s method the minimum is found after 18 iterations the ntrdc method found the minimum with 4 outer iterations and 1 inner iteration the ntrdc method is much more complex than newton s method but it is robust and can be more efficient for more difficult nonlinear relationships and larger simulation domains appendix d boiling simulations with extended van genuchten curve sun et al 2010 discusses how typical van genuchten curve parameters are not calibrated for strongly heat driven conditions like those in our numerical experiments for conditions that reach boiling and rock dryout occurs fig d 18 is the ideal example illustrating the impact of the extended vg curve on computational efficiency the flat option is the original van genuchten curve that reaches infinite capillary pressure at the liquid residual saturation but is capped at 1 gpa to avoid nan values fig 1 when the simulation reaches the boiling condition the jacobian becomes inaccurate due to the discontinuity of the capillary pressure curve near the residual saturation with the flat option the ntrdc hii solver completes the simulation in 551 min using 16 cores but the original newton solver did not finish the simulation in 48 h in contrast the two extended options successfully completed the simulation approximately 20 min for the ntrdc hii solver and 33 min for the newton solver note that the exp option is the exponential extension and the lin option is the linear extension introduced in section 2 2 as expected we do not observe any difference in computational performance among the different van genuchten extensions for non boiling cases where the simulation does not reach the corner near the residual saturation shown in fig d 19 they generate very similar solutions including the one without the extension

102,the saturation solution to the capillary retention phenomenon is critical to understand how much and what type of phase is retained by a heterogeneous medium hence this paper studies the solution qualitatively using methods from the qualitative theory of differential equations in particular when the capillary function defined as the square root of the ratio of permeability to porosity is differentiable and monotonic is examined the analysis shows that the saturation solution is bell shaped with a local minimum or maximum point depending on the leverett curve and the derivative of the capillary function the case with a discontinuous capillary function is identified here as the limiting case when the regularisation parameter approaches zero analytical solution of the linearised differential equation enables the derivation of a parameter that characterises the local flow regime of the solution the parameter is a function of the capillary number the viscous limit fractional

water 1 introduction at steady state conditions capillary retention occurs whenever two immiscible fluids flow across a heterogeneous porous medium under the influence of capillary force the notion of the word retention should not be interpreted in an absolute or traditional sense in which the medium has an extra possession of oil or water phase relative to how much is there originally what we mean by retention is the extra possession of water or oil phase by capillary force relative to how much it would be if this force is absent or negligible under steady state condition the time dimension and the initial condition resident fluids do not play a role in our definition of capillary retention the description of the solution to this phenomenon for discontinuous media has been reviewed both analytically and numerically bear 1975 kortekaas 1985 yortsos and chang 1990 chang and yortsos 1992 chaouche et al 1993 van duijn et al 1995 van duijn and de neef 1998 helmig et al 2007 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 van duijn et al 2008 fučík et al 2008 debbabi et al 2017 in such type of media bear 1975 showed that the capillary pressure is constant in the capillary regime and the saturation is a mirror image of the heterogeneity permeability and porosity in the capillary viscous regime kortekaas 1985 simulated a one dimensional and two phase model with multiple discontinuities and showed that the medium can retain oil phase if the water wet capillary pressure function is used yortsos and chang 1990 showed that at a steady state the saturation jump discontinuity is governed by the continuity of the capillary pressure at the interface van duijn et al 1995 verified this result for the general unsteady state displacements the first experimental evidence of the existence of capillary retention is attributed to chaouche et al 1993 fučík et al 2008 derived a semianalytical solution of the retention problem in the presence of an advection term in a limited way yet valuable for the verification of complex numerical models concerning continuous media and to our knowledge the earliest and latest theoretical work is attributed to yortsos and chang 1990 in their analysis porosity and residual saturations were constant throughout the domain of the porous medium and the capillary function is only a function of permeability to begin with they employed simple forms of the capillary function described by ramp and piecewise linear periodic functions and used integration by quadrature analysis to derive analytical results such assumptions seem restrictive when it comes to model representation and in particular porosity which as we shall demonstrate has a significant impact on the characteristics of the capillary function and hence the solution to the phenomenon another limitation is the use of the water wet leverett function in this article we complement their work by easing the assumptions above and deriving new and general analytical results the article is organised as follows in section 2 we examine the fractional flow equation at steady state that governs the capillary retention and present the assumptions associated with it the saturation solution is well behaved if the capillary function is monotonic hence in section 3 1 we explore the condition that renders it monotonic then in section 3 2 we study the solution behaviour using techniques from the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations seeking critical points and asymptotic behaviours the analysis is complemented by deriving analytical solutions to some limiting and linearised cases in section 3 3 then we validate the results by solving the differential equation numerically in section 4 finally we discuss the physical interpretation of the analysis followed by a conclusion of the main results in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 statement of the problem consider the flow of two immiscible fluids water and oil in a one dimensional heterogeneous porous medium where ϕ and k are spatially varying functions the fractional flow of water in the dimensionless form can be derived as 2 1 u w x t f w γ f w λ o k p c x where 2 2 f w s w m e λ w m e λ w λ o is by definition the viscous limit of the fractional flow u w x t occurring when γ 0 the derivation of 2 1 from the two phase governing flow equations is presented in appendix upon the expansion of the capillary pressure gradient using eqs a 13 and a 14 the fractional flow equation becomes 2 3 u w x t f w γ ϕ h τ s w x g d τ d x where 2 4 h s w f w λ o j g s w f w λ o j we impose conditions on j s w namely lim s w 0 j and j 1 0 for water wet medium and j 0 0 and lim s w 1 j for oil wet medium for mixed wet medium lim s w 0 j and lim s w 1 j in all wettability types we require that j 0 in the continuity equation for water phase we shall consider steady state conditions which implies that u w 0 1 is constant along the flow domain hence the argument u w along with γ are considered parameters in eq 2 3 and the partial derivative is replaced by the normal derivative since x is the only variable argument of s w before characterising the solution to the differential equation 2 3 it is important to understand the character of τ given the permeability k ϕ and the porosity ϕ x of the porous medium the solution is well behaved if τ is monotonic with x 3 analysis 3 1 the monotonicity of τ x let ϕ be continuous smooth monotonic and changes from ϕ to ϕ over a small transition of width 2 w let us restrict the analysis for the case ϕ ϕ with an inflection point in w w the analysis for the case ϕ ϕ is identical if k ϕ is an increasing monotone then 3 1 d k d x d k d ϕ d ϕ d x 0 which shows that k x is also an increasing monotone also consideration of 3 2 d 2 k d x 2 d 2 k d ϕ 2 d ϕ d x 2 d k d ϕ d 2 ϕ d x 2 implies that the x position of the inflection point of k x occurs between those of the inflection points of k ϕ and ϕ x if k ϕ does not exhibit any inflection then the position of the inflection point of k x is always to the right of that of ϕ x as in fig 1 b the monotonicity of the capillary function is an interesting one taking the first derivative of τ with respect to x gives 3 3 2 τ d τ d x 1 ϕ d k d ϕ τ 2 d ϕ d x which is an increasing monotone if and only if 3 4 d k d ϕ τ 2 0 for all x if the above condition is satisfied only for a subset of x local extrema are expected to be found in general the number of local extrema depends on the number of disjoint intervals for which the condition 3 4 is violated for a monolithologic and clean sandstone under the absence of any diagenetic processes after deposition it is empirically found that the permeability in a logarithmic scale is linear with porosity coates and dumanoir 1973 this can be stated in the exponential form as 3 5 k x k e β ϕ ϕ where k and ϕ are the downstream permeability and porosity and β is the constant of proportionality measured in the logarithmic scale we notify that such correlation does not imply causation to appreciate this argument think of the dependence of k and independence of ϕ on the grain size for example beside the aforementioned relationship various models of k have been proposed kozeny 1927 carman 1937 tixier 1949 wyllie and rose 1950 timur 1968 coates and dumanoir 1973 amaefule et al 1993 we choose to use eq 3 5 and in view of the condition 3 4 τ will only be an increasing monotone if 3 6 β ϕ 1 as in fig 2 solid line or the converse could occur for instance if we allow β to be small this gives an important message that we may start with ϕ x and k x that are increasing monotones yet τ x is decreasing which seems counter intuitive from an engineering point of view it is possible that for clean sandstone that β ϕ 0 for smaller values of ϕ and then shifts to the condition 3 6 as ϕ increases beyond a particular value ϕ c as in fig 2 blue dots to study the solution character qualitatively we assume that the condition 3 4 is satisfied and hence τ x is monotonic this is a reasonable assumption as far as the monolithologic sandstone is concerned the permeability has an order of 10s 1000s md and hence β 1 is considerably smaller than ϕ 3 2 the solution character to the capillary retention at the steady state condition eq 2 3 can be rearranged as 3 7 d s d x f x s 1 h τ 1 γ ϕ f u g d τ d x s s v where we have dropped the subscript w from the saturation variable and the saturation dependent functions since water is the only phase involved in the above equation the parameter s v f w 1 u 0 1 is the viscous limit solution of the above equation as γ 0 this is an initial value problem of a nonlinear first order ordinary differential equation in which the functions f and f s are continuous in the rectangular domain r x s 1 2 1 2 given a known initial condition the continuity of the aforementioned functions are adequate to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of s x following picard iterative and banach fixed point theorems coddington 1961 bramwell and kreyszig 1979 in view of our prescription to τ the above equation is autonomous in x w and it reduces to 3 8 f x w s 1 γ ϕ τ f u h f x w s 1 γ ϕ τ f u h in both equations if the direction field is examined at s v and its neighbourhood then 3 9 f s s v 0 f s s v 0 f s s v 0 this shows that the critical point s v is stable as x w in w the direction field gradually converges to the line s s v as in fig 3 this convergence is presented schematically by a phase line drawn to the right of the figure this implies that the integral curve 3 10 s s v is the only solution to eq 3 7 in w satisfying the prescribed initial condition however s v is asymptotically stable critical point as x in w the direction field converges to the line s x s v and in particular 3 11 lim x s x s v these results concerning the characteristics of s x in x w can be arrived at using a different approach which is as follows first observe from eq a 13 that for any given τ 3 12 d p c d s 1 τ d j d s 0 which shows that p c like j is a decreasing monotone with s also eq 3 7 can be rearranged as 3 13 1 τ d τ d x j j d s d x 1 γ f u ϕ τ g integrating from x to x o x gives 3 14 ln τ o j τ j o 1 γ x x o f u ϕ τ g d x which can be written in a more recognisable form as 3 15 p c x p c x o exp 1 γ x x o f u ϕ τ g d x given x s and x o s w o the above equation gives the relationship between the capillary pressure points p c x and p c x o the aim here is to determine the relationship between s and s w o provided that eqs 3 12 and 3 15 hold if we take x and x o to be in w then ϕ τ ϕ τ note also that if we let x o then s w o x o s v and eq 3 15 reduces to 3 16 p c s p c s v exp 1 γ ϕ τ x f u g d x it implies that if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v the first two implications violate the monotonicity of the capillary pressure dictated by 3 12 this contradiction is illustrated geometrically in fig 4 it follows that s x s v in w as dictated by the third implication and in agreement with the result 3 10 now if we consider x and x o to be in w then ϕ τ ϕ τ note also that if we let x o then s w o x o s v and eq 3 12 reduces to 3 17 p c s p c s v exp 1 γ ϕ τ x f u g d x which implies that if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v these implications are all dictated by the monotonicity of the capillary pressure as in fig 4 with the consideration that we are now on the p c s τ curve these results show that s is approaching s v as x and hence in agreement with the result 3 11 in the transition eq 3 7 is non autonomous and the space dependent functions will warp the direction field observe that 3 18 f x s s v 0 f x s 1 ϵ 0 for a given x in w w and where ϵ 0 is a very small number the above results and the continuity of f dictates the existence of a stationary point x s s s such that 3 19 d s s d x s 0 as implied by the intermediate value theorem to study the relationship between the type of the stationary point τ x and j absorbed in the g function we substitute the above condition into 3 7 to give 3 20 f s u g s γ ϕ s d τ s d x s the fractional flow f is an increasing monotone with s to verify this we examine f s derived from eq 2 2 as 3 21 f f 1 f λ w λ w λ o λ o note that from its definition 2 2 0 f s 1 and since λ w 0 and λ o 0 the expression inside the last bracket on the right hand side is positive and hence f 0 which completes the proof this is also true for f u this implies that s s s v 0 s s s v 0 and s s s v 0 if and only if f s u 0 f s u 0 and f s u 0 respectively eq 3 20 shows that the relationship between s s and s v depends on the signs of j and τ x in particular it implies that if τ x 0 then for j 0 3 22 s s s v for j 0 3 23 s s s v the two implications occur in water wet and oil wet porous media respectively observe the proportionality between δ s s v s s s v and γ which implies that if γ 0 then s s s v consistent with the viscous limit solution also the result 3 22 along with 3 10 and 3 11 implies that the solution is nonmonotonic and bounded i e s v s s s and x s s s is a local extremum point to infer about the relative position of x s in the transition one can examine the second derivative at this stationary point derived from 3 7 as 3 24 d 2 s s d x s 2 j s ϕ s τ s j s d d x s ϕ s d τ s d x s in view of 3 22 and 3 24 the above equation has to be negative i e the spatial derivative on the right hand side is positive the monotonicity of the function ϕ τ is similar to τ as inferred from 3 3 if the condition 3 4 is satisfied then 3 25 h x s x u where x u is the root of 3 26 d d x ϕ d τ d x 0 once the behaviour of s x is established the behaviour of p c x is readily known in eq 3 15 letting x to be variable in and x o then differentiation with respect to x gives 3 27 d p c d x p c s v p c x f u γ ϕ τ g 0 which is unlike s x a decreasing monotone with x also from eqs a 13 3 10 and 3 11 it follows that 3 28 p x j s v τ x w and 3 29 lim x p x j s v τ in eq 3 15 if we let x and x o w and hence s x s x o s v then the capillary function ratio τ r τ τ satisfies the following integral identity 3 30 τ r exp 1 γ w f u ϕ τ g d x it is expected that if w ϕ x ϕ i e the average porosity and the medium is homogenised in this case the local extremum s s s v as w decreases δ s s v increases in the limiting case w 0 and if we take x x s and x o w in 3 15 then 3 31 p c s 0 p c s v p c s s 0 exp 0 p c s v p c s s this shows unlike s x that capillary pressure preserves its continuity with the development of discontinuity at τ 0 in agreement with yortsos and chang 1990 and van duijn et al 1995 the geometric interpretation of 3 31 in the p c s plane is shown in fig 5 this also implies the generation of a saturation discontinuity saturation jump where s 0 s v s 0 s s the size of the saturation jump the length of s v s s in fig 5 is variable with respect to capillary pressure and there exists a maximum jump to verify this claim observe that s v s s is also equal to δ s s v p c s p c τ s p c τ where s p c τ and s p c τ are the inverses of p c s τ and p c s τ respectively since δ s s v 0 in 0 p c 0 and lim p c 0 δ s s v lim p c δ s s v 0 it follows that δ s s v is nonmonotonic which verify the existence of a maximum jump fig 6 we remark that one would arrive at the pressure continuity conclusion by only inspecting the specific form of the transformation 3 15 in this transformation the exponent is the integral of a bounded and continuous or at worst piecewise continuous function of x and s this class of functions is riemann integrable and gives continuous function when evaluated this implies that the transformation gives a continuous capillary pressure hence this transformation can be regarded as a statement for the continuity of the capillary pressure we also observe that u x t does not need to be constant and the statement can be generalised to the unsteady state conditions 3 2 1 mixed wet medium water wet and oil wet porous media are types of homogeneous wettability in which the entire rock surface has a uniform molecular affinity for either water or oil conversely a mixed wet porous medium is a common type of heterogeneous wettability in which distinct rock surface regions have different affinities for water or oil salathiel 1973 morrow 1990 kovscek et al 1993 a common mixed wet j curve occurring during imbibition process is shown in fig 7 it has 3 32 lim s 0 j lim s 1 j and hence there exist s s m such that 3 33 j s m 0 as implied by the intermediate value theorem this saturation value splits the curve into two regions the water wet region which constitutes the smaller pores and the mixed oil wet region which constitutes the larger pores as shown in fig 7 kovscek et al 1993 the surfaces of the larger pores undergo partial wettability alteration during a drainage process prior to imbibition by a particular type of oil the diffusivity function h is still positive as it depends on j similar to the water wet and oil wet case fig 8 however the function g is positive in 0 s m and negative in s m 1 since it depends on j an example of g is shown in fig 8 outside the transition zone f is independent of g and the previous analysis applies here regarding the character of the solution s however inside the transition f depends on g and the solution depends on whether the prescribed initial condition is s v s m s v s m or s v s m for τ x 0 if s v s m then the analytical results of the water wet case applies and the solution is bell like with a local maximum if s v s m then f 0 regardless of the size of τ x hence the solution is 3 34 s x s m if s v s m then the analytical results of the oil wet case applies and the solution is bell like with a local minimum the character of the capillary pressure also follows from the analysis it is a decreasing monotone if s v s m an increasing monotone if s v s m and constant if s v s m 3 3 analytical solutions to limiting and linearised cases discontinuous medium in the limit w 0 and for particular forms of f and h a closed form for s can be obtained for x 0 in particular we assume a linear f and a constant unit h this can be established without loss of generality by defining λ w 1 m e s λ o 1 s and j α λ o f which implies 3 35 j α ln 1 s s c where c is the constant of integration for the limit w 0 the differential eq 3 7 reduces to 3 36 d s d x 1 γ ϕ τ f u h s 0 s s j 1 j s v τ r and with our prescription for f and h the above equation becomes linear 3 37 d s d x 1 γ ϕ τ s u by noting that u s v the solution becomes 3 38 s x s v δ s s v exp 1 γ ϕ τ x this shows for the linear case that saturation decreases exponentially with a rate of decay of 1 γ ϕ τ and approaches s v as x the capillary pressure solution follows from eqs 3 35 3 38 and setting τ τ for x 0 in a two phase flow in porous media typical f and h are nonlinear and hence 4 36 however for a small δ s s s s s we can linearise f and h about 0 s s to study how the solution depends locally on f s and g s small δ s s can be satisfied if we choose either δ s s v in fig 6 to be small since δ s s δ s s v or choose γ to be near the capillary limit to do this eq 3 36 is first rearranged as 3 39 h f u d s 1 γ ϕ τ d x taking the taylor expansion of f and h up to the first derivatives and integrating 3 40 s s s h s δ s s h s f s δ s s f s u d s 0 x 1 γ ϕ τ d x the integration gives s x implicitly as 3 41 m s δ s s h s h s f s u f s ln f s f s u δ s s 1 1 γ ϕ τ f s h s x observe that if the coefficient on the right hand side of the above equation approaches zero then m s δ s s 0 and hence s s s the capillary limit solution also suppose that the coefficient is small then applying taylor s expansion of m s about 0 s s up to the first derivative gives 3 42 s ω x s s h s 0 where 3 43 ω 1 γ ϕ τ f s u h s this equation is a straight line with a positive slope if f s u 0 or negative if f s u 0 in or near the capillary region the experimental results by chaouche et al 1993 is in agreement with eq 3 42 there is an important physical implication of the parameter ω in the context of flow regime numerical observations show that the flow regime does not only depend on γ but also on the saturation if we except the linear change in saturation occurring at a small x to be characteristic of the flow regime then these numerical observations are dictated by the parameter ω very rapid change implies that the solution is in the viscous regime whereas very slow change implies that it is in the capillary regime between these two regimes there is a spectrum of ω that characterises the viscous capillary regime when h s 0 eq 3 41 reduces to 3 44 s f s u f s exp ω f s f s u x 1 s s h s 0 which is an exponential decrease if f s u 0 or increase if f s u 0 as x eq 3 43 is of great importance since it enables one to derive a normalised formula for the capillary retention κ for a small δ s s in our context capillary retention is the area confined by s ˆ and s ˆ v behind the discontinuity and averaged over a certain length to derive κ subtract s v from either side of eq 3 43 and multiply by s ˆ o m ϕ s ˆ o m 3 45 δ s ˆ v s ˆ o m ω x δ s ˆ s v if we take l 0 as our domain with the discontinuity being at x 0 then the capillary retention is 3 46 κ ˆ 1 l l 0 δ s ˆ v d x 1 2 s ˆ o m l ω δ s ˆ s v we choose to normalise the capillary retention by δ s ˆ s v and the above equation becomes 3 47 κ π 1 where 3 48 π 1 2 ω l δ s s v a plot of κ vs π is a decreasing line with a unit slope and unit intercept the accuracy can be extended a little if we take the taylor s expansion of m s up to the second derivative the resulting k is identical in form to eq 3 47 but with complicated definition for π capillary limit in this case γ and eq 3 7 reduces to 3 49 d s d x j j 1 τ d τ d x by separating variables followed by integration this gives 3 50 j s x c τ x where c is the constant of integration the solution is given by 3 51 s x j 1 c τ x since j is a decreasing monotone with s the solution is essentially a mirror image of τ the laboratory demonstration by chaouche et al 1993 is in agreement with 3 39 also 3 52 p c j τ c as expected viscous limit in this case γ 0 and eq 3 7 reduces to 3 53 u f which implies that the solution is 3 54 s x f 1 u s v 4 numerical validation the differential eq 3 7 is solved numerically to verify the analytical results the porosity used is the following regularised heaviside function 4 1 ϕ x h w x ϕ if x w 1 2 2 ϕ δ ϕ sin π x 2 w if w x w ϕ if x w where ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 3 ϕ δ ϕ 0 2 and w 0 5 for the calculation of permeability we use β 2 485 and k 0 4 in eq 3 5 the porosity permeability and capillary functions were plotted previously in figs 1 a 1 b and 2 respectively with solid black lines the resulting capillary function ratio is τ r 2 the end point mobility ratio is m e 160 the phase mobilities given by brooks and corey s form brooks and corey 1966 4 2 λ w s 4 λ o 1 s 2 and the water wet j curve given by van genuchten form van genuchten 1980 4 3 j 1 10 s 2 1 1 4 are used to calculate f h and g the resulting λ w λ o f j h and g functions are shown in fig 9 a fractional flow of u 0 75 is used which gives s v f 1 u 0 31 as shown in fig 9 b these inputs are treated as a base of reference a domain of x 1 is specified and hence the point 1 0 31 is regarded as the initial condition the fourth order runge kutta method is employed to solve eq 3 7 numerically starting from the initial condition and moving backwards howlett and henrici 1966 the scheme is as follow 4 4 s s v δ x i 0 k ψ i x i 1 where 4 5 ψ i 1 6 ψ i 1 2 ψ i 2 ψ i 3 ψ i 4 4 6 ψ i 1 f x i s i ψ i 2 f x i s i δ x 2 ψ i 1 4 7 ψ i 3 f x i s i δ x 2 ψ i 2 ψ i 4 f x i s i δ x ψ i 3 and s v 0 31 figs 10 a and 10 b show the saturation capillary pressure profiles when γ 17 the saturation solution is plotted along with the direction field constructed using eq 3 7 the field is tangent when it coincides with the solution and in particular the zero field in the interval 0 5 x 1 at s s v explains why the solution is constant there as derived previously on the other side of the transition s x approaches s v rapidly in this case note also that the solution is bounded i e s v s x s s fig 10 b shows that the capillary pressure is decreasing monotonically as derived in 3 25 since the input data have j 0 and τ x 0 like s x p c x is constant j s v τ in w 1 and approaches j s v τ as x if the order of ϕ and ϕ is reversed so that δ ϕ is now negative then τ x 0 if the water wet base j curve is used then the characteristics of the resulting saturation and capillary pressure curves are similar to that of the oil wet case with τ x 0 as shown in fig 11 to check the solutions in the oil wet medium we choose to alter the base j w j so that j o 0 0 and lim s 1 j o where the subscripts w and o denotes the wettability of the medium respectively a quick way to establish this is by using the transformation j o j w 1 s the resulting curve is plotted as j o in fig 12 a this will affect the two curves as illustrated in fig 12 b note that g o 0 fig 13 shows the resulting saturation and capillary pressure solutions respectively the concavity of the saturation curve in the transition zone and the monotonicity of the capillary pressure curve are in agreement with the analytical results for the mixed wet medium we use the j curve plotted in fig 7 and the resulting h and g function were plotted in fig 8 we take three fractional flow cases u 0 75 0 976 0 999 which give s v 0 31 0 50 0 77 respectively and are used as initial conditions at x 1 the resulting saturation and capillary pressure curves are shown in figs 14 a and 14 b they show that for s v s m 0 5 the saturation curve has a local maximum and the corresponding capillary pressure curve is monotonically decreasing for s v s m the saturation curve has a local minimum and the corresponding capillary pressure curve is monotonically increasing for s v s m both saturation and capillary pressure curves are constant in the base case the size of the width is varied in eq 4 1 and the resulting capillary function saturation and capillary pressure solutions are shown in figs 15 16 b and 16 a the local maximum of the saturation curve grows gradually as w 0 and the curve becomes gradually skewed on the other hand the capillary pressure curve is sigmoidal and as w 0 the curve is continuous at x 0 but not differentiable since s is discontinuous there the solutions shown in figs 16 a and 16 b are plotted in the p c s plane in fig 17 to see how the path traversed by the point s p c changes as w changes all the paths start at s v p c s v τ and trace continuous τ until they reach s v p c s v τ asymptotically as w is decreased the paths are tapering towards s s p c s s τ the case with w 0 005 is nearly there as w 0 there will be a saturation jump from δ s s v at which p c s s p c s v and then approaches s v p c s v τ asymptotically in this case δ s s v 0 48 figs 18 a and 18 b show the saturation and capillary pressure solutions black lines for various capillary numbers near the limit w 0 the blue lines in the range 0 5 x 0 are the corresponding analytical solutions of the linearised differential equation the approximation becomes accurate with increasing γ at which the saturations curves become linear with a slope given by 3 43 in the base case we change the capillary number to be near the capillary limit the saturation solution is a mirror image of τ and the capillary pressure is constant in agreement with eqs 3 51 and 3 52 we also change the capillary number to be near the viscous limit as expected the saturation curve is constant while the capillary pressure is monotonically decreasing it is worth mentioning that viscous dominated displacement does not imply zero capillary pressure the capillary pressure is very similar to that of the base case fig 10 b similarly the corresponding dimensional capillary pressure will also be very similar provided that the characteristic capillary pressure is the same for both it only means that the dominance of the viscous term resembled in large capillary number renders the effect of the capillary term negligible so that it can be dropped out of the differential equation in 2 3 the analysis describes the solution character of the normalised saturation and the unnormalised saturation can be obtained using eq a 8 as 4 8 s ˆ x s ˆ w r x s ˆ o m x s x this is typically a nonlinear transformation and eq 4 8 suggests that s ˆ v still bounds s ˆ from above or below depending on the sign of j curve and τ x for the purpose of illustration and in the base reference we set 4 9 s ˆ w r s ˆ w r e δ ϕ ϕ where s ˆ w r 0 4 and δ 6 9315 we also set s ˆ o r x 0 2 fig 21 a shows the resulting unnormalised saturations observe how the viscous limit saturation curve upstream and downstream the transition reaches different viscous limit saturation values this can be best explained by considering the viscous limit fractional flow as a function of the unnormalised data defined by f ˆ s ˆ s ˆ w r s ˆ o r f s s ˆ s ˆ w r s ˆ o r upstream and downstream the transition we have s w r and s w r respectively and this results in two different viscous limit fractional flow curves fig 21 b this figure shows that 4 10 s ˆ f ˆ 1 u s ˆ f ˆ 1 u which have the values of s 0 52 and s 0 32 observe also in fig 19 how the viscous limit saturation curve bounds the solution curve from below 5 discussion when two phases flow through a gradually coarser or finer medium the saturation profile is controlled by the capillary pressure and its continuity away from the transition the saturation approaches the viscous limit saturation fig 10 a in the coarser case the capillary pressure upstream the transition is higher than the downstream capillary pressure simply due to the difference in the pore size i e τ as depicted in fig 10 b as the fluids flow through the transition the saturation increases peaks and then decreases towards the same saturation immediately after it leaves the transition so that there exists a gradual change from the upstream to the downstream capillary pressures in the finer case the converse occurs fig 11 the dependency of the saturation profile on the continuity of the capillary pressure is well appreciated if an abrupt change occurs in the pore size in the coarser case the saturation builds up upstream of the heterogeneity interface and then undergoes an abrupt change at the interface fig 16 a this behaviour occurs so that the capillary pressure changes gradually from higher to lower and becomes unlike the saturation continuous at the interface fig 16 b the maximum saturation value upstream of the interface depends on the capillary pressure curves as shown in fig 17 the analysis shows that the critical saturation point depends on the grading of the pore size in the flow direction compared to the coarser case fig 10 the finer medium gives a trough instead of a peak fig 11 also wettability affects the type of critical point compared to the water wet case fig 10 the oil wet case gives results similar to the water wet finer case fig 13 in the mixed wet case the saturation and capillary pressure profiles depend on s m the root of the j curve and the viscous limit saturation s v if s v s m the water wet results apply and if s v s m the oil wet results apply the case s v s m gives rise to the trivial constant saturation and capillary pressure profiles fig 14 in the capillary regime the saturation profile is a mirror image of the capillary function whereas the capillary pressure is constant fig 19 in contrast the saturation profile is constant and equal to the viscous limit saturation whereas the capillary pressure is by definition proportional to the reciprocal of the capillary function fig 20 typically the residual water saturation is related to the pore size in this case the unnormalised saturation profile approaches different saturation values upstream and downstream of the transition fig 21 a this behaviour is because different residual water saturation values on either side of the transition correspond to two distinct viscous limit fractional flow curves as shown in fig 21 b as illustrated in the figure two viscous limit saturation values exist in the x axis for one fractional flow value in the y axis as addressed earlier capillary retention depends primarily on the saturation profile which the current work has explained rigorously recent use of the current result has been the derivation of an upper bound for the steady state capillary retention al ghafri et al 2022 also this work has important implications for unsteady state capillary retention which directly affects oil recovery by unsteady displacements this subject is under current investigation while the origin of the work is the simultaneous flow of water and oil the results are applicable to any immiscible two phase flow in porous media an example of such flow is the c o 2 migration in water aquifers 6 conclusion capillary retention is an important phenomenon that may have a major impact on oil recovery by employing techniques from the qualitative theory of differential equations the solution shape to the phenomenon is bell like when a differentiable and monotonic capillary function is assumed the type of the local extremum of the solution depends on the leverett function and the capillary function derivative the case with a discontinuous capillary function is identified here as the limiting case when the regularisation parameter approaches zero and our analytical results agree with previous ones analytical solution of the linearised differential equation enables the derivation of a parameter that characterises the local flow regime of the solution the parameter is a function of the macroscopic capillary number the viscous limit fractional flow and the diffusivity functions the numerical

102,the saturation solution to the capillary retention phenomenon is critical to understand how much and what type of phase is retained by a heterogeneous medium hence this paper studies the solution qualitatively using methods from the qualitative theory of differential equations in particular when the capillary function defined as the square root of the ratio of permeability to porosity is differentiable and monotonic is examined the analysis shows that the saturation solution is bell shaped with a local minimum or maximum point depending on the leverett curve and the derivative of the capillary function the case with a discontinuous capillary function is identified here as the limiting case when the regularisation parameter approaches zero analytical solution of the linearised differential equation enables the derivation of a parameter that characterises the local flow regime of the solution the parameter is a function of the capillary number the viscous limit fractional

water 1 introduction at steady state conditions capillary retention occurs whenever two immiscible fluids flow across a heterogeneous porous medium under the influence of capillary force the notion of the word retention should not be interpreted in an absolute or traditional sense in which the medium has an extra possession of oil or water phase relative to how much is there originally what we mean by retention is the extra possession of water or oil phase by capillary force relative to how much it would be if this force is absent or negligible under steady state condition the time dimension and the initial condition resident fluids do not play a role in our definition of capillary retention the description of the solution to this phenomenon for discontinuous media has been reviewed both analytically and numerically bear 1975 kortekaas 1985 yortsos and chang 1990 chang and yortsos 1992 chaouche et al 1993 van duijn et al 1995 van duijn and de neef 1998 helmig et al 2007 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 van duijn et al 2008 fučík et al 2008 debbabi et al 2017 in such type of media bear 1975 showed that the capillary pressure is constant in the capillary regime and the saturation is a mirror image of the heterogeneity permeability and porosity in the capillary viscous regime kortekaas 1985 simulated a one dimensional and two phase model with multiple discontinuities and showed that the medium can retain oil phase if the water wet capillary pressure function is used yortsos and chang 1990 showed that at a steady state the saturation jump discontinuity is governed by the continuity of the capillary pressure at the interface van duijn et al 1995 verified this result for the general unsteady state displacements the first experimental evidence of the existence of capillary retention is attributed to chaouche et al 1993 fučík et al 2008 derived a semianalytical solution of the retention problem in the presence of an advection term in a limited way yet valuable for the verification of complex numerical models concerning continuous media and to our knowledge the earliest and latest theoretical work is attributed to yortsos and chang 1990 in their analysis porosity and residual saturations were constant throughout the domain of the porous medium and the capillary function is only a function of permeability to begin with they employed simple forms of the capillary function described by ramp and piecewise linear periodic functions and used integration by quadrature analysis to derive analytical results such assumptions seem restrictive when it comes to model representation and in particular porosity which as we shall demonstrate has a significant impact on the characteristics of the capillary function and hence the solution to the phenomenon another limitation is the use of the water wet leverett function in this article we complement their work by easing the assumptions above and deriving new and general analytical results the article is organised as follows in section 2 we examine the fractional flow equation at steady state that governs the capillary retention and present the assumptions associated with it the saturation solution is well behaved if the capillary function is monotonic hence in section 3 1 we explore the condition that renders it monotonic then in section 3 2 we study the solution behaviour using techniques from the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations seeking critical points and asymptotic behaviours the analysis is complemented by deriving analytical solutions to some limiting and linearised cases in section 3 3 then we validate the results by solving the differential equation numerically in section 4 finally we discuss the physical interpretation of the analysis followed by a conclusion of the main results in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 statement of the problem consider the flow of two immiscible fluids water and oil in a one dimensional heterogeneous porous medium where ϕ and k are spatially varying functions the fractional flow of water in the dimensionless form can be derived as 2 1 u w x t f w γ f w λ o k p c x where 2 2 f w s w m e λ w m e λ w λ o is by definition the viscous limit of the fractional flow u w x t occurring when γ 0 the derivation of 2 1 from the two phase governing flow equations is presented in appendix upon the expansion of the capillary pressure gradient using eqs a 13 and a 14 the fractional flow equation becomes 2 3 u w x t f w γ ϕ h τ s w x g d τ d x where 2 4 h s w f w λ o j g s w f w λ o j we impose conditions on j s w namely lim s w 0 j and j 1 0 for water wet medium and j 0 0 and lim s w 1 j for oil wet medium for mixed wet medium lim s w 0 j and lim s w 1 j in all wettability types we require that j 0 in the continuity equation for water phase we shall consider steady state conditions which implies that u w 0 1 is constant along the flow domain hence the argument u w along with γ are considered parameters in eq 2 3 and the partial derivative is replaced by the normal derivative since x is the only variable argument of s w before characterising the solution to the differential equation 2 3 it is important to understand the character of τ given the permeability k ϕ and the porosity ϕ x of the porous medium the solution is well behaved if τ is monotonic with x 3 analysis 3 1 the monotonicity of τ x let ϕ be continuous smooth monotonic and changes from ϕ to ϕ over a small transition of width 2 w let us restrict the analysis for the case ϕ ϕ with an inflection point in w w the analysis for the case ϕ ϕ is identical if k ϕ is an increasing monotone then 3 1 d k d x d k d ϕ d ϕ d x 0 which shows that k x is also an increasing monotone also consideration of 3 2 d 2 k d x 2 d 2 k d ϕ 2 d ϕ d x 2 d k d ϕ d 2 ϕ d x 2 implies that the x position of the inflection point of k x occurs between those of the inflection points of k ϕ and ϕ x if k ϕ does not exhibit any inflection then the position of the inflection point of k x is always to the right of that of ϕ x as in fig 1 b the monotonicity of the capillary function is an interesting one taking the first derivative of τ with respect to x gives 3 3 2 τ d τ d x 1 ϕ d k d ϕ τ 2 d ϕ d x which is an increasing monotone if and only if 3 4 d k d ϕ τ 2 0 for all x if the above condition is satisfied only for a subset of x local extrema are expected to be found in general the number of local extrema depends on the number of disjoint intervals for which the condition 3 4 is violated for a monolithologic and clean sandstone under the absence of any diagenetic processes after deposition it is empirically found that the permeability in a logarithmic scale is linear with porosity coates and dumanoir 1973 this can be stated in the exponential form as 3 5 k x k e β ϕ ϕ where k and ϕ are the downstream permeability and porosity and β is the constant of proportionality measured in the logarithmic scale we notify that such correlation does not imply causation to appreciate this argument think of the dependence of k and independence of ϕ on the grain size for example beside the aforementioned relationship various models of k have been proposed kozeny 1927 carman 1937 tixier 1949 wyllie and rose 1950 timur 1968 coates and dumanoir 1973 amaefule et al 1993 we choose to use eq 3 5 and in view of the condition 3 4 τ will only be an increasing monotone if 3 6 β ϕ 1 as in fig 2 solid line or the converse could occur for instance if we allow β to be small this gives an important message that we may start with ϕ x and k x that are increasing monotones yet τ x is decreasing which seems counter intuitive from an engineering point of view it is possible that for clean sandstone that β ϕ 0 for smaller values of ϕ and then shifts to the condition 3 6 as ϕ increases beyond a particular value ϕ c as in fig 2 blue dots to study the solution character qualitatively we assume that the condition 3 4 is satisfied and hence τ x is monotonic this is a reasonable assumption as far as the monolithologic sandstone is concerned the permeability has an order of 10s 1000s md and hence β 1 is considerably smaller than ϕ 3 2 the solution character to the capillary retention at the steady state condition eq 2 3 can be rearranged as 3 7 d s d x f x s 1 h τ 1 γ ϕ f u g d τ d x s s v where we have dropped the subscript w from the saturation variable and the saturation dependent functions since water is the only phase involved in the above equation the parameter s v f w 1 u 0 1 is the viscous limit solution of the above equation as γ 0 this is an initial value problem of a nonlinear first order ordinary differential equation in which the functions f and f s are continuous in the rectangular domain r x s 1 2 1 2 given a known initial condition the continuity of the aforementioned functions are adequate to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of s x following picard iterative and banach fixed point theorems coddington 1961 bramwell and kreyszig 1979 in view of our prescription to τ the above equation is autonomous in x w and it reduces to 3 8 f x w s 1 γ ϕ τ f u h f x w s 1 γ ϕ τ f u h in both equations if the direction field is examined at s v and its neighbourhood then 3 9 f s s v 0 f s s v 0 f s s v 0 this shows that the critical point s v is stable as x w in w the direction field gradually converges to the line s s v as in fig 3 this convergence is presented schematically by a phase line drawn to the right of the figure this implies that the integral curve 3 10 s s v is the only solution to eq 3 7 in w satisfying the prescribed initial condition however s v is asymptotically stable critical point as x in w the direction field converges to the line s x s v and in particular 3 11 lim x s x s v these results concerning the characteristics of s x in x w can be arrived at using a different approach which is as follows first observe from eq a 13 that for any given τ 3 12 d p c d s 1 τ d j d s 0 which shows that p c like j is a decreasing monotone with s also eq 3 7 can be rearranged as 3 13 1 τ d τ d x j j d s d x 1 γ f u ϕ τ g integrating from x to x o x gives 3 14 ln τ o j τ j o 1 γ x x o f u ϕ τ g d x which can be written in a more recognisable form as 3 15 p c x p c x o exp 1 γ x x o f u ϕ τ g d x given x s and x o s w o the above equation gives the relationship between the capillary pressure points p c x and p c x o the aim here is to determine the relationship between s and s w o provided that eqs 3 12 and 3 15 hold if we take x and x o to be in w then ϕ τ ϕ τ note also that if we let x o then s w o x o s v and eq 3 15 reduces to 3 16 p c s p c s v exp 1 γ ϕ τ x f u g d x it implies that if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v the first two implications violate the monotonicity of the capillary pressure dictated by 3 12 this contradiction is illustrated geometrically in fig 4 it follows that s x s v in w as dictated by the third implication and in agreement with the result 3 10 now if we consider x and x o to be in w then ϕ τ ϕ τ note also that if we let x o then s w o x o s v and eq 3 12 reduces to 3 17 p c s p c s v exp 1 γ ϕ τ x f u g d x which implies that if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v if s s v then p c s p c s v these implications are all dictated by the monotonicity of the capillary pressure as in fig 4 with the consideration that we are now on the p c s τ curve these results show that s is approaching s v as x and hence in agreement with the result 3 11 in the transition eq 3 7 is non autonomous and the space dependent functions will warp the direction field observe that 3 18 f x s s v 0 f x s 1 ϵ 0 for a given x in w w and where ϵ 0 is a very small number the above results and the continuity of f dictates the existence of a stationary point x s s s such that 3 19 d s s d x s 0 as implied by the intermediate value theorem to study the relationship between the type of the stationary point τ x and j absorbed in the g function we substitute the above condition into 3 7 to give 3 20 f s u g s γ ϕ s d τ s d x s the fractional flow f is an increasing monotone with s to verify this we examine f s derived from eq 2 2 as 3 21 f f 1 f λ w λ w λ o λ o note that from its definition 2 2 0 f s 1 and since λ w 0 and λ o 0 the expression inside the last bracket on the right hand side is positive and hence f 0 which completes the proof this is also true for f u this implies that s s s v 0 s s s v 0 and s s s v 0 if and only if f s u 0 f s u 0 and f s u 0 respectively eq 3 20 shows that the relationship between s s and s v depends on the signs of j and τ x in particular it implies that if τ x 0 then for j 0 3 22 s s s v for j 0 3 23 s s s v the two implications occur in water wet and oil wet porous media respectively observe the proportionality between δ s s v s s s v and γ which implies that if γ 0 then s s s v consistent with the viscous limit solution also the result 3 22 along with 3 10 and 3 11 implies that the solution is nonmonotonic and bounded i e s v s s s and x s s s is a local extremum point to infer about the relative position of x s in the transition one can examine the second derivative at this stationary point derived from 3 7 as 3 24 d 2 s s d x s 2 j s ϕ s τ s j s d d x s ϕ s d τ s d x s in view of 3 22 and 3 24 the above equation has to be negative i e the spatial derivative on the right hand side is positive the monotonicity of the function ϕ τ is similar to τ as inferred from 3 3 if the condition 3 4 is satisfied then 3 25 h x s x u where x u is the root of 3 26 d d x ϕ d τ d x 0 once the behaviour of s x is established the behaviour of p c x is readily known in eq 3 15 letting x to be variable in and x o then differentiation with respect to x gives 3 27 d p c d x p c s v p c x f u γ ϕ τ g 0 which is unlike s x a decreasing monotone with x also from eqs a 13 3 10 and 3 11 it follows that 3 28 p x j s v τ x w and 3 29 lim x p x j s v τ in eq 3 15 if we let x and x o w and hence s x s x o s v then the capillary function ratio τ r τ τ satisfies the following integral identity 3 30 τ r exp 1 γ w f u ϕ τ g d x it is expected that if w ϕ x ϕ i e the average porosity and the medium is homogenised in this case the local extremum s s s v as w decreases δ s s v increases in the limiting case w 0 and if we take x x s and x o w in 3 15 then 3 31 p c s 0 p c s v p c s s 0 exp 0 p c s v p c s s this shows unlike s x that capillary pressure preserves its continuity with the development of discontinuity at τ 0 in agreement with yortsos and chang 1990 and van duijn et al 1995 the geometric interpretation of 3 31 in the p c s plane is shown in fig 5 this also implies the generation of a saturation discontinuity saturation jump where s 0 s v s 0 s s the size of the saturation jump the length of s v s s in fig 5 is variable with respect to capillary pressure and there exists a maximum jump to verify this claim observe that s v s s is also equal to δ s s v p c s p c τ s p c τ where s p c τ and s p c τ are the inverses of p c s τ and p c s τ respectively since δ s s v 0 in 0 p c 0 and lim p c 0 δ s s v lim p c δ s s v 0 it follows that δ s s v is nonmonotonic which verify the existence of a maximum jump fig 6 we remark that one would arrive at the pressure continuity conclusion by only inspecting the specific form of the transformation 3 15 in this transformation the exponent is the integral of a bounded and continuous or at worst piecewise continuous function of x and s this class of functions is riemann integrable and gives continuous function when evaluated this implies that the transformation gives a continuous capillary pressure hence this transformation can be regarded as a statement for the continuity of the capillary pressure we also observe that u x t does not need to be constant and the statement can be generalised to the unsteady state conditions 3 2 1 mixed wet medium water wet and oil wet porous media are types of homogeneous wettability in which the entire rock surface has a uniform molecular affinity for either water or oil conversely a mixed wet porous medium is a common type of heterogeneous wettability in which distinct rock surface regions have different affinities for water or oil salathiel 1973 morrow 1990 kovscek et al 1993 a common mixed wet j curve occurring during imbibition process is shown in fig 7 it has 3 32 lim s 0 j lim s 1 j and hence there exist s s m such that 3 33 j s m 0 as implied by the intermediate value theorem this saturation value splits the curve into two regions the water wet region which constitutes the smaller pores and the mixed oil wet region which constitutes the larger pores as shown in fig 7 kovscek et al 1993 the surfaces of the larger pores undergo partial wettability alteration during a drainage process prior to imbibition by a particular type of oil the diffusivity function h is still positive as it depends on j similar to the water wet and oil wet case fig 8 however the function g is positive in 0 s m and negative in s m 1 since it depends on j an example of g is shown in fig 8 outside the transition zone f is independent of g and the previous analysis applies here regarding the character of the solution s however inside the transition f depends on g and the solution depends on whether the prescribed initial condition is s v s m s v s m or s v s m for τ x 0 if s v s m then the analytical results of the water wet case applies and the solution is bell like with a local maximum if s v s m then f 0 regardless of the size of τ x hence the solution is 3 34 s x s m if s v s m then the analytical results of the oil wet case applies and the solution is bell like with a local minimum the character of the capillary pressure also follows from the analysis it is a decreasing monotone if s v s m an increasing monotone if s v s m and constant if s v s m 3 3 analytical solutions to limiting and linearised cases discontinuous medium in the limit w 0 and for particular forms of f and h a closed form for s can be obtained for x 0 in particular we assume a linear f and a constant unit h this can be established without loss of generality by defining λ w 1 m e s λ o 1 s and j α λ o f which implies 3 35 j α ln 1 s s c where c is the constant of integration for the limit w 0 the differential eq 3 7 reduces to 3 36 d s d x 1 γ ϕ τ f u h s 0 s s j 1 j s v τ r and with our prescription for f and h the above equation becomes linear 3 37 d s d x 1 γ ϕ τ s u by noting that u s v the solution becomes 3 38 s x s v δ s s v exp 1 γ ϕ τ x this shows for the linear case that saturation decreases exponentially with a rate of decay of 1 γ ϕ τ and approaches s v as x the capillary pressure solution follows from eqs 3 35 3 38 and setting τ τ for x 0 in a two phase flow in porous media typical f and h are nonlinear and hence 4 36 however for a small δ s s s s s we can linearise f and h about 0 s s to study how the solution depends locally on f s and g s small δ s s can be satisfied if we choose either δ s s v in fig 6 to be small since δ s s δ s s v or choose γ to be near the capillary limit to do this eq 3 36 is first rearranged as 3 39 h f u d s 1 γ ϕ τ d x taking the taylor expansion of f and h up to the first derivatives and integrating 3 40 s s s h s δ s s h s f s δ s s f s u d s 0 x 1 γ ϕ τ d x the integration gives s x implicitly as 3 41 m s δ s s h s h s f s u f s ln f s f s u δ s s 1 1 γ ϕ τ f s h s x observe that if the coefficient on the right hand side of the above equation approaches zero then m s δ s s 0 and hence s s s the capillary limit solution also suppose that the coefficient is small then applying taylor s expansion of m s about 0 s s up to the first derivative gives 3 42 s ω x s s h s 0 where 3 43 ω 1 γ ϕ τ f s u h s this equation is a straight line with a positive slope if f s u 0 or negative if f s u 0 in or near the capillary region the experimental results by chaouche et al 1993 is in agreement with eq 3 42 there is an important physical implication of the parameter ω in the context of flow regime numerical observations show that the flow regime does not only depend on γ but also on the saturation if we except the linear change in saturation occurring at a small x to be characteristic of the flow regime then these numerical observations are dictated by the parameter ω very rapid change implies that the solution is in the viscous regime whereas very slow change implies that it is in the capillary regime between these two regimes there is a spectrum of ω that characterises the viscous capillary regime when h s 0 eq 3 41 reduces to 3 44 s f s u f s exp ω f s f s u x 1 s s h s 0 which is an exponential decrease if f s u 0 or increase if f s u 0 as x eq 3 43 is of great importance since it enables one to derive a normalised formula for the capillary retention κ for a small δ s s in our context capillary retention is the area confined by s ˆ and s ˆ v behind the discontinuity and averaged over a certain length to derive κ subtract s v from either side of eq 3 43 and multiply by s ˆ o m ϕ s ˆ o m 3 45 δ s ˆ v s ˆ o m ω x δ s ˆ s v if we take l 0 as our domain with the discontinuity being at x 0 then the capillary retention is 3 46 κ ˆ 1 l l 0 δ s ˆ v d x 1 2 s ˆ o m l ω δ s ˆ s v we choose to normalise the capillary retention by δ s ˆ s v and the above equation becomes 3 47 κ π 1 where 3 48 π 1 2 ω l δ s s v a plot of κ vs π is a decreasing line with a unit slope and unit intercept the accuracy can be extended a little if we take the taylor s expansion of m s up to the second derivative the resulting k is identical in form to eq 3 47 but with complicated definition for π capillary limit in this case γ and eq 3 7 reduces to 3 49 d s d x j j 1 τ d τ d x by separating variables followed by integration this gives 3 50 j s x c τ x where c is the constant of integration the solution is given by 3 51 s x j 1 c τ x since j is a decreasing monotone with s the solution is essentially a mirror image of τ the laboratory demonstration by chaouche et al 1993 is in agreement with 3 39 also 3 52 p c j τ c as expected viscous limit in this case γ 0 and eq 3 7 reduces to 3 53 u f which implies that the solution is 3 54 s x f 1 u s v 4 numerical validation the differential eq 3 7 is solved numerically to verify the analytical results the porosity used is the following regularised heaviside function 4 1 ϕ x h w x ϕ if x w 1 2 2 ϕ δ ϕ sin π x 2 w if w x w ϕ if x w where ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 3 ϕ δ ϕ 0 2 and w 0 5 for the calculation of permeability we use β 2 485 and k 0 4 in eq 3 5 the porosity permeability and capillary functions were plotted previously in figs 1 a 1 b and 2 respectively with solid black lines the

is used which gives s v f 1 u 0 31 as shown in fig 9 b these inputs are treated as a base of reference a domain of x 1 is specified and hence the point 1 0 31 is regarded as the initial condition the fourth order runge kutta method is employed to solve eq 3 7 numerically starting from the initial condition and moving backwards howlett and henrici 1966 the scheme is as follow 4 4 s s v δ x i 0 k ψ

saturation capillary pressure profiles when γ 17 the saturation solution is plotted along with the direction field constructed using eq 3 7 the field is tangent when it coincides with the solution and in particular the zero field in the interval 0 5 x 1 at s s v explains why the solution is constant there as derived previously on the other side of the transition s x approaches s v rapidly in this case note also that the solution is bounded i e s v s x s s fig 10 b shows that the capillary pressure is decreasing monotonically as derived in 3 25 since the input data have j 0 and τ x 0 like s x p c x is constant j s v τ in w 1 and approaches j s v τ as x if the order of ϕ and ϕ is reversed so that δ ϕ is now negative then τ x 0 if the water wet base j curve is used then the characteristics of the resulting saturation and capillary pressure curves are similar to that of the oil wet case with τ x 0 as shown in fig 11 to check the solutions in the oil wet medium we choose to alter the base j w j so that j o 0 0 and lim s 1 j o where the subscripts w and o denotes the wettability of the medium respectively a quick way to establish this is by using the transformation j o j w 1 s the resulting curve is plotted as j o in fig 12 a this will affect the two curves as illustrated in fig 12 b note that g o 0 fig 13 shows the resulting saturation and capillary pressure solutions respectively the concavity of the saturation curve in the transition zone and the monotonicity of the capillary pressure curve are in agreement with the analytical results for the mixed wet medium we use the j curve plotted in fig 7 and the resulting h and g function were plotted in fig 8 we take three fractional flow cases u 0 75 0 976 0 999 which give s v 0 31 0 50 0 77 respectively and are used as initial conditions at x 1 the resulting saturation and capillary pressure curves are shown in figs 14 a and 14 b they show that for s v s m 0 5 the saturation curve has a local maximum and the corresponding capillary pressure curve is monotonically decreasing for s v s m the saturation curve has a local minimum and the corresponding capillary pressure curve is monotonically increasing for s v s m both saturation and capillary pressure curves are constant in the base case the size of the width is varied in eq 4 1 and the resulting capillary function saturation and capillary pressure solutions are shown in figs 15 16 b and 16 a the local maximum of the saturation curve grows gradually as w 0 and the curve becomes gradually skewed on the other hand the capillary pressure curve is sigmoidal and as w 0 the curve is continuous at x 0 but not differentiable since s is discontinuous there the solutions shown in figs 16 a and 16 b are plotted in the p c s plane in fig 17 to see how the path traversed by the point s p c changes as w changes all the paths start at s v p c s v τ and trace continuous τ until they reach s v p c s v τ asymptotically as w is decreased the paths are tapering towards s s p c s s τ the case with w 0 005 is nearly there as w 0 there will be a saturation jump from δ s s v at which p c s s p c s v and then approaches s v p c s v τ asymptotically in this case δ s s v 0 48 figs 18 a and 18 b show the saturation and capillary pressure solutions black lines for various capillary numbers near the limit w 0 the blue lines in the range 0 5 x 0 are the corresponding analytical solutions of the linearised differential equation the approximation becomes accurate with increasing γ at which the saturations curves become linear with a slope given by 3 43 in the base case we change the capillary number to be near the capillary limit the saturation solution is a mirror image of τ and the capillary pressure is constant in agreement with eqs 3 51 and 3 52 we also change the capillary number to be near the viscous limit as expected the saturation curve is constant while the capillary pressure is monotonically decreasing it is worth mentioning that viscous dominated displacement does not imply zero capillary pressure the capillary pressure is very similar to that of the base case fig 10 b similarly the corresponding dimensional capillary pressure will also be very similar provided that the characteristic capillary pressure is the same for both it only means that the dominance of the viscous term resembled in large capillary number renders the effect of the capillary term negligible so that it can be dropped out of the differential equation in 2 3 the analysis describes the solution character of the normalised saturation and the unnormalised saturation can be obtained using eq a 8 as 4 8 s ˆ x s ˆ w r x s ˆ o m x s x this is typically a nonlinear transformation and eq 4 8 suggests that s ˆ v still bounds s ˆ from above or below depending on the sign of j curve and τ x for the purpose of illustration and in the base reference we set 4 9 s ˆ w r s ˆ w r e δ ϕ ϕ where s ˆ w r 0 4 and δ 6 9315 we also set s ˆ o r x 0 2 fig 21 a shows the resulting unnormalised saturations observe how the viscous limit saturation curve upstream and downstream the transition reaches different viscous limit saturation values this can be best explained by considering the viscous limit fractional flow as a function of the unnormalised data defined by f ˆ s ˆ s ˆ w r s ˆ o r f s s ˆ s ˆ w r s ˆ o r upstream and downstream the transition we have s w r and s w r respectively and this results in two different viscous limit fractional flow curves fig 21 b this figure shows that 4 10 s ˆ f ˆ 1 u s ˆ f ˆ 1 u which have the values of s 0 52 and s 0 32 observe also in fig 19 how the viscous limit saturation curve bounds the solution curve from below 5 discussion when two phases flow through a gradually coarser or finer medium the saturation profile is controlled by the capillary pressure and its continuity away from the transition the saturation approaches the viscous limit saturation fig 10 a in the coarser case the capillary pressure upstream the transition is higher than the downstream capillary pressure simply due to the difference in the pore size i e τ as depicted in fig 10 b as the fluids flow through the transition the saturation increases peaks and then decreases towards the same saturation immediately after it leaves the transition so that there exists a gradual change from the upstream to the downstream capillary pressures in the finer case the converse occurs fig 11 the dependency of the saturation profile on the continuity of the capillary pressure is well appreciated if an abrupt change occurs in the pore size in the coarser case the saturation builds up upstream of the heterogeneity interface and then undergoes an abrupt change at the interface fig 16 a this behaviour occurs so that the capillary pressure changes gradually from higher to lower and becomes unlike the saturation continuous at the interface fig 16 b the maximum saturation value upstream of the interface depends on the capillary pressure curves as shown in fig 17 the analysis shows that the critical saturation point depends on the grading of the pore size in the flow direction compared to the coarser case fig 10 the finer medium gives a trough instead of a peak fig 11 also wettability affects the type of critical point compared to the water wet case fig 10 the oil wet case gives results similar to the water wet finer case fig 13 in the mixed wet case the saturation and capillary pressure profiles depend on s m the root of the j curve and the viscous limit saturation s v if s v s m the water wet results apply and if s v s m the oil wet results apply the case s v s m gives rise to the trivial constant saturation and capillary pressure profiles fig 14 in the capillary regime the saturation profile is a mirror image of the capillary function whereas the capillary pressure is constant fig 19 in contrast the saturation profile is constant and equal to the viscous limit saturation whereas the capillary pressure is by definition proportional to the reciprocal of the capillary function fig 20 typically the residual water saturation is related to the pore size in this case the unnormalised saturation profile approaches different saturation values upstream and downstream of the transition fig 21 a this behaviour is because different residual water saturation values on either side of the transition correspond to two distinct viscous limit fractional flow curves as shown in fig 21 b as illustrated in the figure two viscous limit saturation values exist in the x axis for one fractional flow value in the y axis as addressed earlier capillary retention depends primarily on the saturation profile which the current work has explained rigorously recent use of the current result has been the derivation of an upper bound for the steady state capillary retention al ghafri et al 2022 also this work has important implications for unsteady state capillary retention which directly affects oil recovery by unsteady displacements this subject is under current investigation while the origin of the work is the simultaneous flow of water and oil the results are applicable to any immiscible two phase flow in porous media an example of such flow is the c o 2 migration in water aquifers 6 conclusion capillary retention is an important phenomenon that may have a major impact on oil recovery by employing techniques from the qualitative theory of differential equations the solution shape to the phenomenon is bell like when a differentiable and monotonic capillary function is assumed the type of the local extremum of the solution depends on the leverett function and the capillary function derivative the case with a discontinuous capillary function is identified here as the limiting case when the regularisation parameter approaches zero and our analytical results agree with previous ones analytical solution of the linearised differential equation enables the derivation of a parameter that characterises the local flow regime of the solution the parameter is a function of the macroscopic capillary number the viscous limit fractional flow and the diffusivity functions the numerical

103,riparian evapotranspiration is an important process that constrains water exchanges within a well connected river aquifer vegetation hydrological system in this study we developed an extended analytical dupuit forchheimer df model to consider the additional water flow resistances due to both the vertical deformation of flow lines caused by evapotranspiration and discharge into the river screened by bottom sediments in which a river does not fully penetrate the aquifer this analytical model can describe the groundwater discharge process in the presence of riparian evapotranspiration we validated our analytical results with numerical simulations of a 2 d flow model that explicitly considers vertical hydraulic resistances demonstrating that the surface water groundwater exchanges in such hydrological systems are strongly dependent on the hydrogeological parameters river width riparian zone width and parameters related to the hydraulic connection between evapotranspiration and groundwater a sensitivity analysis of our extended df model reveals that the water balance in hyperarid regions is determined by riparian evapotranspiration and evapotranspiration most likely causes river flow losses however in humid regions most groundwater 80 or more is discharged into rivers rather than via riparian evapotranspiration our results confirm that riparian evapotranspiration in arid regions is an important process that affects surface water groundwater exchanges and that evapotranspiration from riparian zones not only reduces groundwater discharge into rivers but also potentially causes disconnections within river aquifer systems the obtained analytical dependencies allow the grid dependent parameters of the riv and evt packages to be calculated in the modflow simulations of regional groundwater flow discharge in a river valley using coarse grids keywords surface water groundwater interaction groundwater discharge evapotranspiration dupuit forchheimer assumption sensitivity analysis 1 introduction surface water and groundwater interact in almost every landscape ranging from alpine to coastal environments across the globe winter 1995 such interactions mainly include exchanges of water energy and solutes among surface water soil water and groundwater xie et al 2021 sophocleous 2002 groundwater is particularly important for sustaining streamflow and vegetation singha and navarre sitchler 2021 in the riparian zone groundwater responds instantaneously to changes in the stream stage which is evidenced by the strong correlation between the diurnal fluctuations in the groundwater table and the diurnal cycle of streamflow gribovszki et al 2010 for a well connected river aquifer vegetation hydrological system the evapotranspiration of riparian vegetation causes additional diurnal fluctuations in groundwater and streamflow gribovszki et al 2008 either by inducing river infiltration or by intercepting baseflow chen 2007 in arid regions with particularly warm climates enhanced evapotranspiration likely decreases shallow groundwater storage thereby reducing the baseflow and groundwater discharge to rivers condon et al 2020 various field methods have been developed to quantify water fluxes in the stream aquifer vegetation zone kalbus et al 2006 the streambed hydraulic conductivity has been estimated in situ landon et al 2001 river water and groundwater levels have been jointly measured and the responses of the groundwater level to groundwater evapotranspiration have been recorded via high frequency monitoring chen 2007 wang et al 2014 recently heat flux measurements i e time series measurements of sediment and water temperatures have been widely applied to quantify river filtration through streambeds anderson 2005 wang et al 2017 as an alternative to field investigations numerical simulations have been shown to be effective at quantifying surface water groundwater exchanges fleckenstein et al 2010 golden et al 2014 pozdniakov et al 2015 additionally considerable attention has been given to surface water groundwater vegetation interactions ellenburg et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 from the perspective of the evolution of ecohydrological systems troch et al 2015 at the basin scale lateral groundwater flow is a predominant source of baseflow leach et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 and contributes a substantial proportion of the total terrestrial water fluxes to plant transpiration maxwell and condon 2016 in fact streamflow and riparian evapotranspiration both being highly dependent on subsurface flow dynamics brooks et al 2015 have proven to be sensitive to ongoing large scale groundwater depletion condon and maxwell 2019 moreover surface water groundwater vegetation interactions are particularly complex in water limited regions and are controlled by various degrees of ephemerality moisture dependent root water uptake and variably saturated groundwater flow forrester and maxwell 2020 schilling et al 2021 from a practical hydrogeological perspective it is important to estimate evapotranspiration losses and streamflow recharge by groundwater in river valleys fig 1 particularly when their water balance structure is disturbed by groundwater withdrawals via riverbank filtration wang et al 2015 and by associated landscape changes grinevskii and sporyshev 2019 for instance the capture of groundwater evapotranspiration discharge and the associated increase in groundwater recharge can contribute approximately 17 of groundwater withdrawal even in humid boreal regions grinevskiy et al 2018 however quantifying the influence of evapotranspiration induced groundwater discharge on the riparian water balance under both natural and disturbed conditions remains difficult this is because such influences cannot be measured directly and thus are generally estimated through inverse calculations given the nonlinear dependence of groundwater evapotranspiration on the depth of the water table shah et al 2007 this relationship has long been simplified as linear in numerical modelling programs such as modflow harbaugh 2005 due to the coarseness of the grids employed in land surface water and energy balance models the interaction between lateral groundwater flow and vertical plant evapotranspiration in a relatively narrow riparian corridor demonstrates even worse performance in simulations maxwell and condon 2016 alternatively a traditional approach for indirectly quantifying evapotranspiration induced groundwater discharge in a river valley is to use analytical solutions such methods for solving various flow problems were widely used to quantify groundwater flows until the 1980s e g aravin and numerov 1965 polubarinova kochina 1962 strack 1989 nevertheless despite the development of numerical methods analytical methods are still widely used to analyse water exchanges in the hyporheic zone nawalany et al 2020 groundwater flow patterns hunt 2006 strack 2017 zlotnik et al 2015 and the transport of pollutants in river aquifer systems rumynin et al 2021 in a recent paper min et al 2020 we provided an analytical solution for a stationary problem of filtration losses from river and riparian groundwater evapotranspiration and the linear dependence of evapotranspiration induced losses on groundwater depth in this study a more general solution is considered for the steady state problem of riparian groundwater discharged by both riparian evapotranspiration and baseflow to the river due to the simple spatial structure of the considered 1 d model a dimensionless set of parameters on which the proportions of groundwater discharged by both evapotranspiration and leakage into the river channel depend is revealed overall this study has the three following objectives 1 to derive approximate analytical solutions of the flux exchange between rivers and aquifers considering riparian evapotranspiration processes 2 to validate these analytical solutions with numerical simulations and 3 to analyse the sensitivity of these solutions to model parameters 2 method of the equivalent flow resistance length and its application to surface water groundwater interactions 2 1 generalized dupuit forchheimer assumption and vertical hydraulic resistances at present the main approach for simulating regional groundwater flow involves using a 2 d flow model based on the dupuit forchheimer df model assumption the essence of this model is that the 3 d groundwater head distribution h x y z described by the general hydromechanical flow hm model is replaced by the 2 d head change model h x y this substitution is strictly feasible for only two cases a water saturated aquifer thickness m 0 or b vertical hydraulic conductivitykz in these cases the resistance to vertical groundwater flow is negligibly small in all other cases however the df model approximates the hm model with errors and these errors increase in areas where flow lines deform in the vertical section fig 1 such as where groundwater is discharged into streams anderson 2005 aravin and numerov 1965 compared the analytical solutions for the hm and df models for cases involving geometrically simple objects that cause local vertical deformation of flow lines as a result of their comparison they formulated a method of local flow resistances in this method for a 1 d planned flow the difference between the df model head in the area of the far flow zone h far and that in the area of an object perturbing the df flow hclose fig 2 can be expressed as follows 1 h f a r l h c l o s e 0 i x l δ h δ h q x φ k where l is the distance from the object to the far zone where the df model operates ix is the lateral gradient of the df flow k is the hydraulic conductivity qx is the total flow rate per unit width of the aquifer i e specific discharge haitjema and anderson 2016 ф is the dimensionless hydraulic resistance and δh is the additional head loss due to the effect of the local hydraulic resistance of hm flow expressions for dimensionless hydraulic resistances are obtained from the solutions of the corresponding flow problems for the hm model and from a comparison of the asymptotic behaviour of the head in the far field via the df model a similar approach using the dimensionless resistivity was developed by morel seytoux to correctly simulate near river flows in regional numerical modflow based df models morel seytoux 2009 nevertheless shestakov 1970 and streltsova 1974 suggested that a dimensional value the equivalent length δl of a 1 d planned flow with constant transmissivity t should be used instead of dimensionless resistances the physical meaning of introducing this parameter is to account for additional hydraulic resistances by virtually lengthening the df flow by the value of δl fig 2 with this approach taking the case involving the symmetric flow of groundwater into a river from both banks shown in fig 2 the expression for the total groundwater discharge into the river per unit width of the aquifer q r in the case of stationary flow is defined as follows 2 q r q x h f a r l h r φ 0 φ r t h f a r l h r l δ l where hr is the river head stage φ0 lt 1is the hydraulic resistance to flow in a 1 d planned df flow of length l φ r δlt 1 is the additional hydraulic resistance and δl is the equivalent additional length of the 1 d df flow due to additional flow resistances namely the equivalent flow resistance length comparing eqs 1 and 2 and considering that hclose 0 hr and qx qr for an aquifer with constant hydraulic conductivity we can obtain the additional equivalent flow resistance for a river without bottom sediments δl m φ in our opinion the advantage of using the parameter δl is twofold a both the hydraulic vertical resistance of the aquifer and as shown below the resistances of bottom sediments can be incorporated into this length and b this parameter can be determined by monitoring groundwater levels see for example wang et al 2015 to account for parameters in the vertical direction in the df model shestakov 1992 proposed a generalization for a horizontally layered aquifer with horizontal and vertical conductivity depth dependent functions k x z and k z z respectively based on the assumption of a linear distribution of vertical flow velocities in the vertical aquifer section and a constant horizontal gradient with depth using these assumptions the df model for groundwater flow in an aquifer overlying an impermeable aquitard can be expressed in terms of the depth averaged head h this head refers to the hydraulic centre of the aquifer and is related to the head at the aquifer top free surface shestakov 1992 3 h x y t 1 0 m k x h x y z d z h t o p x y v z t o p φ t 0 m k x z d z φ 0 m k z 1 1 t 1 0 z k x z d z d z where htop is the head at the top of the aquifer on the free surface of unconfined flow v z t o p is the vertical flux through the aquifer top under confined conditions or through the free surface under unconfined conditions φ is the dimensional t specific vertical flow resistance per unit area and m is the water saturated thickness of the aquifer for the case of an aquifer that has constant vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities the expression for resistance takes the following form 4 φ α m k z where α 1 3 expressions 3 and 4 show that the head corresponding to the df model refers to a point located at a depth equal to 1 3 of the water saturated aquifer thickness in the case where groundwater flow is discharged into a stream with bottom sediments that does not penetrate the aquifer top according to eq 3 the intensity of water exchange between the surface water and underlying groundwater when written in terms of the df model is defined as follows 5 v z t o p v z x h x h r φ m 0 k 0 where m 0 k 0 is the specific flow resistance of bottom sediments for bottom sediments with thickness m 0 and hydraulic conductivity k 0 vz x is the vertical flux through the bottom sediments and x is the coordinate under the bottom of the water body directed perpendicular to its edge 2 2 equivalent flow resistance length of symmetric groundwater discharge into a water body with bottom sediments consider the case of symmetric groundwater discharge into a river without evapotranspiration in the river valley for the flow region from one bank to the middle of the river fig 2 the stationary df model can be written in the following form 6 d 2 h 1 d x 2 0 l r 2 x l d 2 h 2 d x 2 b r 2 h i h r 0 0 x l r 2 b r t m 0 k 0 φ 1 where a subscript index of 1 represents the flow zone of length l into which the total flow per unit width of the aquifer qx is entering and a subscript index of 2 signifies the flow zone under the river of length l r 2 via which the flow qr q x is discharged into the river through the riverbed note that the leakage term b r in eq 6 involves a sequence of two specific hydraulic resistances that complicate the interaction between the surface water body and groundwater the first resistance φ arises due to vertical deformations of flow lines in the aquifer and the second resistance m 0 k 0 is the vertical hydraulic resistance of low permeability bottom sediments the boundary conditions for this model include the total flow from the watershed side qr and the symmetric groundwater discharge into the river from both banks resulting in a no flow boundary under the centre of the river from the analytical solution of eq 6 under the given boundary conditions the expression of the parameter δl in eq 2 is defined as follows shestakov 1970 7 δ l b r 1 coth b r l r 2 where lr is the width of the river for the case of a hydrodynamically wide river l r b r 3 δ l b r 1 if the aquifer is vertically homogeneous and isotropic i e t km and bottom sediments are absent it follows from 7 and 4 that the δl of a hydrodynamically wide river is equal to 8 δ l t α k 1 m α 0 577 m however if the hm solution for the special case where lr is adopted bottom sediments are absent and the head at the top of the aquifer under the river is equal to the river stage aravin and numerov 1965 anderson 2005 and is replaced with the df model the theoretical value of the dimensional hydraulic resistance in eq 1 is φ 2π 1ln 2 thus the parameter δl is defined as follows 9 δ l m φ m 2 π ln 2 0 441 m a comparison between expressions 9 and 7 reveals that to account for the vertical flow resistances in the aquifer under a hydrodynamically wide river using eq 4 α should be used as follows 10 α 4 π 2 ln 2 2 0 195 it follows from this expression that below the stream the hydraulic centre of the aquifer to which the df model head refers is located higher than a depth equal to 1 3 of the aquifer thickness 2 3 numerical validation of the equivalent flow resistance length to verify how well the generalized df model with the parameter α calculated from dependence 8 or 10 describes the symmetric discharge of groundwater into a narrow stream with bottom sediments a numerical simulation was conducted the analytical results of anderson 2005 for the case of a river without bottom sediments overlying an isotropic permeable aquifer were adopted to construct the model geometry anderson 2005 showed that when the ratio of the river width to the aquifer thickness varies from infinity to approximately 0 4 the df model 6 with the coefficient br under the river defined as b r α m 1 0 441 m 1 accurately approximates the hm model at smaller ratios however the df model errors begin to grow exponentially modflow 2005 was used with the river riv package harbaugh 2005 to simulate groundwater discharge into the river according to the situation shown in fig 2 the constant and varying simulation parameters for each variant are given in table 1 a constant vertical head h l was set at the far boundary of the model to characterize the far flow field that strictly corresponds to the df model a detailed numerical grid with a constant step equal to 1 150 m was used to minimize the errors associated with discretization the simulation process is described as follows the analytical value of δl was calculated for each combination of parameters using dependence 7 for both α values then from dependence 2 the numerical value of δl was estimated using the groundwater discharged into the river qr known from the simulation results fig 3 shows a comparison between the analytical and numerical values of δl for the case of an isotropic aquifer kx kz k for two different α values it follows that the use of α 0 195 yields good agreement between the numerical and analytical estimates for a wide range of vertical resistances of the bottom sediments and for aquifer thickness to river width ratios up to 2 5 that is the df model with the leakage coefficient br from dependence 6 and a specific aquifer vertical flow resistance φ 0 195mk 1is applicable for calculating the interaction between groundwater and streams in the case of isotropic hydraulic conductivity of the drained aquifer to assess the possibility of using analytical expression 7 for the case of an anisotropic aquifer the influence of hydraulic anisotropy on the groundwater discharge rate was studied the results of this analysis are shown in fig 4 at the specific vertical resistance φ 0 195 m k z 1 the df model gives acceptable results only for weakly anisotropic media in which the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities have the same order at commensurate aquifer thicknesses and river widths in contrast when the vertical hydraulic conductivity is an order of magnitude or two smaller than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity the df model systematically underestimates the calculated discharge flow rate into the river such an increase in the df model error is related to the nature of the vertical head distribution shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that for the isotropic case the vertical deformation zone of the head field hm flow zone is localized under and near the river this zone can be approximated by the df model in a leaky aquifer df flow develops at a distance equal to an order of magnitude of the aquifer thickness from the river thus in this case a df model described by eq 6 featuring zone boundaries coinciding with the river edge can be used both with and without leakage in contrast for an anisotropic aquifer as the anisotropy coefficient increases the size of the hm flow zone increases capturing an increasingly greater area and thus reducing the ability of the df model to correctly describe the groundwater flow towards the river note that strictly speaking it is more correct to use numerical results for the anisotropic case by holding the ratio of sizes of the fictive region transformed with regard to anisotropy constant in all numerical experiments l l r 2 m k x k z c o n s t to ensure that the numerical results do not depend on the fact that the ratio of the simulated domain length to its thickness remained equal to 4 in all experiments additional model runs were performed for the extended flow domain this domain was selected to satisfy criteria l l r 2 m k x k z 4 for the case when kx kz 10 that is with a fixed thickness of 150 m the total length of the area was increased by 10 times and equalled 1897 m a comparison of the δl estimates with eq 2 for the initial and enlarged lengths of the domain for the case without bottom sediments shows that the difference in the results is close to 5 only for kz kx 1 for the rest of the anisotropy parameters used this difference is less than 0 6 next we conducted a series of numerical experiments increasing the ratio of the length of the domain to its thickness up to 25 fig 6 shows the δl estimates with eq 2 as a function of the ratio of the simulated domain length to its thickness for different anisotropies of hydraulic conductivity one can see from this that the parameter l value estimated from the simulation for the given anisotropy does not depend on this ratio within its interval of 4 25 therefore we can assume that the δl estimates with eq 2 using numerical simulation obtained with the ratio of simulated domain length to its thickness equal to 4 can be used for analytical results validation thus this numerical validation of the generalized df model verifies that it exhibits sufficient accuracy in describing groundwater discharge into streams with bottom sediments that are imperfectly open to isotropic and weakly anisotropic aquifers in the 0 2 5 range of aquifer thickness to river width ratios 2 4 equivalent flow resistance length of a hydrodynamically narrow stream if the river width is an order of magnitude smaller than the aquifer thickness the solution of the df model equation system 6 which gives dependence 7 for the parameter δl cannot be used because the length of the flow zone under the river tends toward zero aravin and numerov 1965 presented an expression for the dimensionless flow resistance in equation 1 for groundwater interacting with a hydrodynamically narrow stream without bottom sediments for the case where lr m for symmetric flow this expression takes the following form 11 φ π 1 ln sinh π l r 4 m π 1 ln 4 m π l r for a vertically homogeneous isotropic aquifer connected via bottom sediments with a stream the total head loss is due to the

follows 13 δ l 2 m φ t l r m 0 k 0 in expressions 11 and 13 the depth of the river is assumed to be significantly less than its width if the river depth is commensurate with its width the wetted perimeter should be taken in expression 11 for the resistance 3 surface water groundwater interaction in a river valley with evapotranspiration 3 1 dupuit forchheimer flow model with groundwater depth dependent evapotranspiration consider groundwater flow in a river valley with evapotranspiration at the groundwater table close to the ground surface we assume that groundwater discharge in the river valley occurs symmetrically from both banks thus for simplification we consider flow from only one bank fig 7 let the total discharge q of groundwater flow per unit width of the aquifer be achieved in the watershed area of the river basin zone 3 then in river zone 2 floodplain of width l0 the groundwater flow is partially discharged via evapotranspiration for generalization we assume that the aquifer beneath the valley is overlain by relatively low permeability sediments with thickness m a and hydraulic conductivity ka the rest of the flow enters zone 1 under the channel of the stream that does not penetrate the aquifer top where it is discharged into the stream through low permeability bottom sediments with specific hydraulic resistance m0 k0 assume that the intensity rate of groundwater discharge by evapotranspiration in zone 2 floodplain can be described as a linear function of the depth of the water table if this depth is less than the critical depth zcrit zsurf d max

elevation in the evapotranspiration zone zone 2 x is the direction perpendicular to the river channel originating in the middle of the river channel and htop is the groundwater table elevation on the other hand the relationship between the groundwater level and df model head in the evapotranspiration zone can be written as follows 15 h 2 x h t o p x e g w x m a k a φ then the df model expressions

solution of problem 16 under the condition of a given total flow per unit width q at the boundary between zones 2 and 3 is given in the appendix in particular see the appendix for details the

the gradient of natural groundwater flow at the river valley boundary equal to i wlw t w is the recharge rate in the recharge zone of length lw designated by zone 3 in fig 7 and iet is the gradient of evapotranspiration discharge in the absence of natural groundwater flow where i e t h r z c r i t l e t 1 β the proportion of discharge flow due to evapotranspiration is 1 ε and the ratio of evapotranspiration to discharge into the river is obtained as follows 18 q e t q r ε 1 1 3 2 numerical validation of the evapotranspiration discharge model to validate the applicability of the df model for estimating groundwater discharge via evapotranspiration we consider the most complicated case in terms of df flow formation fig 8 this case describes the formation of flow losses from a hydrodynamically narrow river in the absence of natural groundwater flow consider the situation shown in fig 8 let the wetted perimeter p of the stream be substantially less than the aquifer thickness m p m and let the width of the evapotranspiration zone in the river valley be comparable to or greater than the aquifer thickness l 0 m under such conditions in the evapotranspiration zone of a narrow stream the vertical head distribution fig 8 does not initially correspond to the df model for the df model the following expression for the flow losses from the river in the absence of natural flow from the watershed is derived from 17 as follows 19 q a 2 q r 2 t h r z c r i t l e t δ l where qa is the analytically calculated total seepage loss per unit width from the river to both banks previously a similar dependence was obtained by min et al 2020 the numerical 2d modflow simulation of flow losses from a narrow stream consumed by evapotranspiration in a river valley using the evapotranspiration evt package harbaugh 2005 was used to assess the applicability of the df model the constant and varying parameters for each variant used for the simulation are presented in table 2 for each simulation run the total discharge originating from the river and evaporating in the river valley was calculated using the numerical model q sim and then the discharge q a was calculated analytically using dependence 19 l et was calculated using dependence a5 it is incorrect to use dependence 7 to calculate the value of δl because the river width is too narrow table 2 specifically the river width is less than 0 4 of the aquifer thickness in all variants therefore the value of δl when calculating q a is determined using dependence 13 for l r equal to the wetted perimeter p fig 9 shows a comparison between the analytically and numerically calculated stream losses for different combinations of parameters for the case of a narrow river the analytical expression for flow losses obtained using the df model achieves sufficient accuracy in a wide range of calculation parameters even for the most complicated case i e the case of a hydrodynamically narrow river under which no df flow zone is formed at the same time fig 9 shows that considering the vertical flow resistance φ in the calculated value of l et does not improve but rather worsens the convergence of both the numerical and the analytical results especially if the ratio d max et max φ is smaller than 10 apparently this is due to the geometry of the problem selected for testing in which the most intense flows are concentrated in the uppermost part of the aquifer 3 3 sensitivity of evapotranspiration discharge to the flow parameters in the arid zone under arid and hyperarid conditions and in the absence of natural groundwater flow in summer evaporation is responsible for the seepage losses from a river using dependence 19 let us consider how groundwater flow parameters influence the formation of losses 3 3 1 case of a hydrodynamically wide river and wide evaporation zone in this case 0 5brlr 3 and the magnitude of δ l b r 1 in addition b et l 0 3 and the magnitude of l e t b e t 1 this is the case for maximum surface runoff losses forming evapotranspiration in the coastal zone the transformation of 19 for the considered case yields the following expression 20 q e t max 2 t d max e t max h r z c r i t d max 1 β if the hydraulic resistance of bottom sediments can be neglected then in an isotropic homogeneous aquifer with hydraulic conductivity k and thickness m the following expression is obtained 21 β 0 441 m k d max e t max considering that typical values of etmax reach 10 3 to 10 4 m day at real aquifer thicknesses and permeabilities and given β 1 the second factor in dependence 20 also has the following order of unity 22 h r z c r i t d max 1 β 1 q e t max 2 t d max e t max as discerned from 22 in this case the flow losses from the river are determined by the aquifer conductivity maximum evaporation rate and depth at which evapotranspiration ceases 3 3 2 case of a hydrodynamically narrow river and wide evaporation zone if the river width is commensurate with the aquifer thickness and the vertical hydraulic resistance of bottom sediments is sufficiently high to guarantee 0 5 l r b r 1 then it is possible to consider a hydrodynamically narrow river in this case the value of β can be estimated as follows 23 β 2 t m 0 k 0 l r d max e t max accordingly 24 q e t max 2 t d max e t max 1 2 m 0 k 0 l r t e t max d max comparing eqs 22 and 24 reveals that the specific resistance of bottom sediments and a small river width reduce the maximum possible loss 3 3 3 case of a hydrodynamically wide river and narrow evapotranspiration zone in this case assuming that b et l 0 1 we obtain the maximum loss as follows 25 q e t max 2 e t max l 0 e t max 2 l 0 3 3 d max t e t max l 0 2 in this case it follows from 25 that the maximum loss is mainly determined by the width of the evapotranspiration zone and etmax 3 4 sensitivity of evapotranspiration discharge to the flow parameters in the humid zone in a humid zone the critical depth of the groundwater table d max usually does not exceed the first 2 3 m likewise most terraces on which evapotranspiration takes place above the river level are usually at elevations within the first couple of metres accordingly under humid conditions in 17 it is possible to achieve hr zcrit in this case the proportion of groundwater discharge into the river is 26 ε q r q coth 2 b e t l 0 1 coth b e t l 0 1 β β δ l l e t dependence 26 is plotted in fig 10 from which it follows that the role of evapotranspiration in the river valley under humid conditions grows with increasing width of the evapotranspiration zone l 0 in the case of b e t l 0 l 0 e t max t d max 1 expression 26 can be approximated by the following dependence 27 ε q r q 1 l 0 2 e t max 2 t d max 1 β 1 the ratio of discharge in the form of evapotranspiration to discharge into the river channel is calculated as follows 28 q e t q r ε 1 1 l 0 2 e t max 2 t d max β 1 β it follows from 27 and 28 that part of the flow being discharged in the evapotranspiration zone increases in proportion to the square of the width of this zone l 0 and the value of the potential evaporation rate et max but increases in inverse proportion to the transmissivity of the aquifer 4 discussion the analysis provided in the previous section shows that under both arid and humid conditions the amount of evapotranspiration that occurs in a river valley depends on a variety of parameters including aquifer properties such as transmissivity and the hydraulic resistance of river bottom sediments and the parameters involved in the linear relationship between evapotranspiration and the groundwater table depth in addition the relationship between evapotranspiration and discharge into the river is affected by both the width of the river and the width of the riparian zone where groundwater evapotranspiration occurs the use of the df flow model to analyse the evapotranspiration that occurs in a river valley shows that the dependence describing both arid and humid conditions includes the parameter β δl let which physically signifies the ratio of the specific flow resistance of the discharge zone into the river to that into the evapotranspiration zone a numerical analysis of the characteristic values of this parameter even for a hydrodynamically narrow river see eq 23 shows that the value of this parameter is fundamentally much less than unity its typical values appear to lie in the range of 0 0 2 consequently under hyperarid conditions surface water losses depend only weakly on the river bottom parameters and are mainly determined by the width of the riverside riparian zone and the parameters governing the connection between groundwater evapotranspiration and the groundwater table depth under humid conditions in most cases this ratio of resistances causes most groundwater flow discharge 80 or more formed in a watershed to flow into a river moreover only in cases of sufficiently wide betl 0 0 5 wetland valleys can the proportion of evapotranspiration discharge be comparable to or even exceed the discharge into the river the problem of correctly accounting for groundwater and stream interconnections in numerical modflow like df flow models with a rather coarse grid has been discussed in several studies mehl et al 2010 investigated the effect of the grid block size on the errors arising from calculating the flow of the river water groundwater interconnection morel seytoux et al 2013 and miracapillo and morel seytoux 2014 developed an approach based on the dependencies for riverbed conductivity obtained using an analytical solution for the hm flow in a narrow river area partially open to an aquifer diaz et al 2020 and nawalany et al 2020 proposed a numerical analytical approach to correctly describe the near river hm flow given a rectangular channel profile in particular using a specific typical example of groundwater discharge into a hydrodynamically narrow river the modflow like approach to describing groundwater interconnection in models was shown to be capable of producing flow errors in excess of 40 nawalany et al 2020 nevertheless modflow like codes are the most common tools used to solve groundwater resource assessment problems and their interaction with streams accordingly when developing regional groundwater models with a rather coarse numerical grid the characteristic grid step size may exceed the width of the river valley fig 11 let us consider a typical situation when a regional modflow based numerical model includes both river and riparian zones with similar groundwater levels in one block a fragment of a 2 d finite difference modflow grid is shown in fig 11 in which the two modflow packages riv and evt harbaugh 2005 are activated in a block with the coordinates i j moreover we assume that the i direction is oriented along the river valley thus the flow in this direction is substantially less than that in the j direction in this case the balance equation for this block under a steady state regime of flow into the river can be written as follows 29 q i j 1 2 q i j 1 2 h i j h r c i j h i j z c r i t c e t i j in eq 29 the grid parameters c and c et are written in the notation of this paper as follows harbaugh 2005 30 с k 0 m 0 l r b c e t e t max d max d x i d y j in the case of the absence of evaporation from 2 7 and 29 the general expression for c considering flow under the river and the vertical resistances of the aquifer can be written as follows 31 c 2 t b b r tanh l r b r 2 in expression 31 the parameter b r is defined by general dependence 6 for the case of a narrow river lrbr 0 5 tanh 0 5lrbr 0 5lrbr if the vertical flow resistance of the aquifer is neglected φ 0 expression 31 becomes dependence 30 for c assuming from 30 that hr zcrit for a humid zone it follows that 32 c e t c d y b ε 1 1 thus the sequential use of dependencies 31 and 32 with an analytical estimation of ε makes it possible to calculate the effective mesh dependent parameters of the riv and evt packages when these packages are activated in the same blocks of the computational grid 5 conclusions the df assumption is widely adopted when modelling the exchanges between surface water and groundwater in regional groundwater flows in such cases difficulties naturally arise in describing the flow near and under streams because the df flow in the zone adjacent to and under the stream is disturbed and additional flow resistances appear due to the vertical deformation of flow lines and because the permeabilities of the river bottom sediments are different from that of the main part of the aquifer we show that in this case it is possible to use an extended df model that considers both abovementioned factors and we present expressions for the generalized hydraulic resistance expressed in units of the 1 d flow length with constant conductivity for the case where groundwater evapotranspiration develops in the river valley and linearly decreases with the depth of the groundwater table from the surface we obtain a new analytical solution within the df model for the symmetric scheme of discharge from both banks of a river this solution describes both the discharge of natural groundwater flow in the valley as evapotranspiration and the discharge into the river the flow losses from the river in the absence of natural flow and the presence of evapotranspiration in the river valley furthermore a sensitivity analysis was conducted for this solution under hyperarid conditions that is when the riverine groundwater balance is determined by evapotranspiration in the riparian zone causing river flow losses in this case the intensity of the water exchange in the riverside riparian zone depends on the sum of two hydraulic resistances the river resistance and the resistance of the evapotranspiration zone in addition analytical assessments are performed on the total river flow losses per unit width of the aquifer due to evapotranspiration while condisering the flow parameters river width width of the riparian zone along the river banks as well as parameters governing the connection between the evapotranspiration of groundwater and the groundwater table depth a sensitivity analysis of the solution under humid conditions reveals that in most cases most of the natural groundwater 80 or more formed in watersheds flows into rivers moreover only in cases of sufficiently wide wetland valleys can the share of evapotranspiration discharge be comparable to or even exceed the discharge into the river finally the obtained analytical dependencies allow the effective grid dependent parameters of the riv and evt packages to be calculated in the modflow based

103,riparian evapotranspiration is an important process that constrains water exchanges within a well connected river aquifer vegetation hydrological system in this study we developed an extended analytical dupuit forchheimer df model to consider the additional water flow resistances due to both the vertical deformation of flow lines caused by evapotranspiration and discharge into the river screened by bottom sediments in which a river does not fully penetrate the aquifer this analytical model can describe the groundwater discharge process in the presence of riparian evapotranspiration we validated our analytical results with numerical simulations of a 2 d flow model that explicitly considers vertical hydraulic resistances demonstrating that the surface water groundwater exchanges in such hydrological systems are strongly dependent on the hydrogeological parameters river width riparian zone width and parameters related to the hydraulic connection between evapotranspiration and groundwater a sensitivity analysis of our extended df model reveals that the water balance in hyperarid regions is determined by riparian evapotranspiration and evapotranspiration most likely causes river flow losses however in humid regions most groundwater 80 or more is discharged into rivers rather than via riparian evapotranspiration our results confirm that riparian evapotranspiration in arid regions is an important process that affects surface water groundwater exchanges and that evapotranspiration from riparian zones not only reduces groundwater discharge into rivers but also potentially causes disconnections within river aquifer systems the obtained analytical dependencies allow the grid dependent parameters of the riv and evt packages to be calculated in the modflow simulations of regional groundwater flow discharge in a river valley using coarse grids keywords surface water groundwater interaction groundwater discharge evapotranspiration dupuit forchheimer assumption sensitivity analysis 1 introduction surface water and groundwater interact in almost every landscape ranging from alpine to coastal environments across the globe winter 1995 such interactions mainly include exchanges of water energy and solutes among surface water soil water and groundwater xie et al 2021 sophocleous 2002 groundwater is particularly important for sustaining streamflow and vegetation singha and navarre sitchler 2021 in the riparian zone groundwater responds instantaneously to changes in the stream stage which is evidenced by the strong correlation between the diurnal fluctuations in the groundwater table and the diurnal cycle of streamflow gribovszki et al 2010 for a well connected river aquifer vegetation hydrological system the evapotranspiration of riparian vegetation causes additional diurnal fluctuations in groundwater and streamflow gribovszki et al 2008 either by inducing river infiltration or by intercepting baseflow chen 2007 in arid regions with particularly warm climates enhanced evapotranspiration likely decreases shallow groundwater storage thereby reducing the baseflow and groundwater discharge to rivers condon et al 2020 various field methods have been developed to quantify water fluxes in the stream aquifer vegetation zone kalbus et al 2006 the streambed hydraulic conductivity has been estimated in situ landon et al 2001 river water and groundwater levels have been jointly measured and the responses of the groundwater level to groundwater evapotranspiration have been recorded via high frequency monitoring chen 2007 wang et al 2014 recently heat flux measurements i e time series measurements of sediment and water temperatures have been widely applied to quantify river filtration through streambeds anderson 2005 wang et al 2017 as an alternative to field investigations numerical simulations have been shown to be effective at quantifying surface water groundwater exchanges fleckenstein et al 2010 golden et al 2014 pozdniakov et al 2015 additionally considerable attention has been given to surface water groundwater vegetation interactions ellenburg et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 from the perspective of the evolution of ecohydrological systems troch et al 2015 at the basin scale lateral groundwater flow is a predominant source of baseflow leach et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 and contributes a substantial proportion of the total terrestrial water fluxes to plant transpiration maxwell and condon 2016 in fact streamflow and riparian evapotranspiration both being highly dependent on subsurface flow dynamics brooks et al 2015 have proven to be sensitive to ongoing large scale groundwater depletion condon and maxwell 2019 moreover surface water groundwater vegetation interactions are particularly complex in water limited regions and are controlled by various degrees of ephemerality moisture dependent root water uptake and variably saturated groundwater flow forrester and maxwell 2020 schilling et al 2021 from a practical hydrogeological perspective it is important to estimate evapotranspiration losses and streamflow recharge by groundwater in river valleys fig 1 particularly when their water balance structure is disturbed by groundwater withdrawals via riverbank filtration wang et al 2015 and by associated landscape changes grinevskii and sporyshev 2019 for instance the capture of groundwater evapotranspiration discharge and the associated increase in groundwater recharge can contribute approximately 17 of groundwater withdrawal even in humid boreal regions grinevskiy et al 2018 however quantifying the influence of evapotranspiration induced groundwater discharge on the riparian water balance under both natural and disturbed conditions remains difficult this is because such influences cannot be measured directly and thus are generally estimated through inverse calculations given the nonlinear dependence of groundwater evapotranspiration on the depth of the water table shah et al 2007 this relationship has long been simplified as linear in numerical modelling programs such as modflow harbaugh 2005 due to the coarseness of the grids employed in land surface water and energy balance models the interaction between lateral groundwater flow and vertical plant evapotranspiration in a relatively narrow riparian corridor demonstrates even worse performance in simulations maxwell and condon 2016 alternatively a traditional approach for indirectly quantifying evapotranspiration induced groundwater discharge in a river valley is to use analytical solutions such methods for solving various flow problems were widely used to quantify groundwater flows until the 1980s e g aravin and numerov 1965 polubarinova kochina 1962 strack 1989 nevertheless despite the development of numerical methods analytical methods are still widely used to analyse water exchanges in the hyporheic zone nawalany et al 2020 groundwater flow patterns hunt 2006 strack 2017 zlotnik et al 2015 and the transport of pollutants in river aquifer systems rumynin et al 2021 in a recent paper min et al 2020 we provided an analytical solution for a stationary problem of filtration losses from river and riparian groundwater evapotranspiration and the linear dependence of evapotranspiration induced losses on groundwater depth in this study a more general solution is considered for the steady state problem of riparian groundwater discharged by both riparian evapotranspiration and baseflow to the river due to the simple spatial structure of the considered 1 d model a dimensionless set of parameters on which the proportions of groundwater discharged by both evapotranspiration and leakage into the river channel depend is revealed overall this study has the three following objectives 1 to derive approximate analytical solutions of the flux exchange between rivers and aquifers considering riparian evapotranspiration processes 2 to validate these analytical solutions with numerical simulations and 3 to analyse the sensitivity of these solutions to model parameters 2 method of the equivalent flow resistance length and its application to surface water groundwater interactions 2 1 generalized dupuit forchheimer assumption and vertical hydraulic resistances at present the main approach for simulating regional groundwater flow involves using a 2 d flow model based on the dupuit forchheimer df model assumption the essence of this model is that the 3 d groundwater head distribution h x y z described by the general hydromechanical flow hm model is replaced by the 2 d head change model h x y this substitution is strictly feasible for only two cases a water saturated aquifer thickness m 0 or b vertical hydraulic conductivitykz in these cases the resistance to vertical groundwater flow is negligibly small in all other cases however the df model approximates the hm model with errors and these errors increase in areas where flow lines deform in the vertical section fig 1 such as where groundwater is discharged into streams anderson 2005 aravin and numerov 1965 compared the analytical solutions for the hm and df models for cases involving geometrically simple objects that cause local vertical deformation of flow lines as a result of their comparison they formulated a method of local flow resistances in this method for a 1 d planned flow the difference between the df model head in the area of the far flow zone h far and that in the area of an object perturbing the df flow hclose fig 2 can be expressed as follows 1 h f a r l h c l o s e 0 i x l δ h δ h q x φ k where l is the distance from the object to the far zone where the df model operates ix is the lateral gradient of the df flow k is the hydraulic conductivity qx is the total flow rate per unit width of the aquifer i e specific discharge haitjema and anderson 2016 ф is the dimensionless hydraulic resistance and δh is the additional head loss due to the effect of the local hydraulic resistance of hm flow expressions for dimensionless hydraulic resistances are obtained from the solutions of the corresponding flow problems for the hm model and from a comparison of the asymptotic behaviour of the head in the far field via the df model a similar approach using the dimensionless resistivity was developed by morel seytoux to correctly simulate near river flows in regional numerical modflow based df models morel seytoux 2009 nevertheless shestakov 1970 and streltsova 1974 suggested that a dimensional value the equivalent length δl of a 1 d planned flow with constant transmissivity t should be used instead of dimensionless resistances the physical meaning of introducing this parameter is to account for additional hydraulic resistances by virtually lengthening the df flow by the value of δl fig 2 with this approach taking the case involving the symmetric flow of groundwater into a river from both banks shown in fig 2 the expression for the total groundwater discharge into the river per unit width of the aquifer q r in the case of stationary flow is defined as follows 2 q r q x h f a r l h r φ 0 φ r t h f a r l h r l δ l where hr is the river head stage φ0 lt 1is the hydraulic resistance to flow in a 1 d planned df flow of length l φ r δlt 1 is the additional hydraulic resistance and δl is the equivalent additional length of the 1 d df flow due to additional flow resistances namely the equivalent flow resistance length comparing eqs 1 and 2 and considering that hclose 0 hr and qx qr for an aquifer with constant hydraulic conductivity we can obtain the additional equivalent flow resistance for a river without bottom sediments δl m φ in our opinion the advantage of using the parameter δl is twofold a both the hydraulic vertical resistance of the aquifer and as shown below the resistances of bottom sediments can be incorporated into this length and b this parameter can be determined by monitoring groundwater levels see for example wang et al 2015 to account for parameters in the vertical direction in the df model shestakov 1992 proposed a generalization for a horizontally layered aquifer with horizontal and vertical conductivity depth dependent functions k x z and k z z respectively based on the assumption of a linear distribution of vertical flow velocities in the vertical aquifer section and a constant horizontal gradient with depth using these assumptions the df model for groundwater flow in an aquifer overlying an impermeable aquitard can be expressed in terms of the depth averaged head h this head refers to the hydraulic centre of the aquifer and is related to the head at the aquifer top free surface shestakov 1992 3 h x y t 1 0 m k x h x y z d z h t o p x y v z t o p φ t 0 m k x z d z φ 0 m k z 1 1 t 1 0 z k x z d z d z where htop is the head at the top of the aquifer on the free surface of unconfined flow v z t o p is the vertical flux through the aquifer top under confined conditions or through the free surface under unconfined conditions φ is the dimensional t specific vertical flow resistance per unit area and m is the water saturated thickness of the aquifer for the case of an aquifer that has constant vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities the expression for resistance takes the following form 4 φ α m k z where α 1 3 expressions 3 and 4 show that the head corresponding to the df model refers to a point located at a depth equal to 1 3 of the water saturated aquifer thickness in the case where groundwater flow is discharged into a stream with bottom sediments that does not penetrate the aquifer top according to eq 3 the intensity of water exchange between the surface water and underlying groundwater when written in terms of the df model is defined as follows 5 v z t o p v z x h x h r φ m 0 k 0 where m 0 k 0 is the specific flow resistance of bottom sediments for bottom sediments with thickness m 0 and hydraulic conductivity k 0 vz x is the vertical flux through the bottom sediments and x is the coordinate under the bottom of the water body directed perpendicular to its edge 2 2 equivalent flow resistance length of symmetric groundwater discharge into a water body with bottom sediments consider the case of symmetric groundwater discharge into a river without evapotranspiration in the river valley for the flow region from one bank to the middle of the river fig 2 the stationary df model can be written in the following form 6 d 2 h 1 d x 2 0 l r 2 x l d 2 h 2 d x 2 b r 2 h i h r 0 0 x l r 2 b r t m 0 k 0 φ 1 where a subscript index of 1 represents the flow zone of length l into which the total flow per unit width of the aquifer qx is entering and a subscript index of 2 signifies the flow zone under the river of length l r 2 via which the flow qr q x is discharged into the river through the riverbed note that the leakage term b r in eq 6 involves a sequence of two specific hydraulic resistances that complicate the interaction between the surface water body and groundwater the first resistance φ arises due to vertical deformations of flow lines in the aquifer and the second resistance m 0 k 0 is the vertical hydraulic resistance of low permeability bottom sediments the boundary conditions for this model include the total flow from the watershed side qr and the symmetric groundwater discharge into the river from both banks resulting in a no flow boundary under the centre of the river from the analytical solution of eq 6 under the given boundary conditions the expression of the parameter δl in eq 2 is defined as follows shestakov 1970 7 δ l b r 1 coth b r l r 2 where lr is the width of the river for the case of a hydrodynamically wide river l r b r 3 δ l b r 1 if the aquifer is vertically homogeneous and isotropic i e t km and bottom sediments are absent it follows from 7 and 4 that the δl of a hydrodynamically wide river is equal to 8 δ l t α k 1 m α 0 577 m however if the hm solution for the special case where lr is adopted bottom sediments are absent and the head at the top of the aquifer under the river is equal to the river stage aravin and numerov 1965 anderson 2005 and is replaced with the df model the theoretical value of the dimensional hydraulic resistance in eq 1 is φ 2π 1ln 2 thus the parameter δl is defined as follows 9 δ l m φ m 2 π ln 2 0 441 m a comparison between expressions 9 and 7 reveals that to account for the vertical flow resistances in the aquifer under a hydrodynamically wide river using eq 4 α should be used as follows 10 α 4 π 2 ln 2 2 0 195 it follows from this expression that below the stream the hydraulic centre of the aquifer to which the df model head refers is located higher than a depth equal to 1 3 of the aquifer thickness 2 3 numerical validation of the equivalent flow resistance length to verify how well the generalized df model with the parameter α calculated from dependence 8 or 10 describes the symmetric discharge of groundwater into a narrow stream with bottom sediments a numerical simulation was conducted the analytical results of anderson 2005 for the case of a river without bottom sediments overlying an isotropic permeable aquifer were adopted to construct the model geometry anderson 2005 showed that when the ratio of the river width to the aquifer thickness varies from infinity to approximately 0 4 the df model 6 with the coefficient br under the river defined as b r α m 1 0 441 m 1 accurately approximates the hm model at smaller ratios however the df model errors begin to grow exponentially modflow 2005 was used with the river riv package harbaugh 2005 to simulate groundwater discharge into the river according to the situation shown in fig 2 the constant and varying simulation parameters for each variant are given in table 1 a constant vertical head h l was set at the far boundary of the model to characterize the far flow field that strictly corresponds to the df model a detailed numerical grid with a constant step equal to 1 150 m was used to minimize the errors associated with discretization the simulation process is described as follows the analytical value of δl was calculated for each combination of parameters using dependence 7 for both α values then from dependence 2 the numerical value of δl was estimated using the groundwater discharged into the river qr known from the simulation results fig 3 shows a comparison between the analytical and numerical values of δl for the case of an isotropic aquifer kx kz k for two different α values it follows that the use of α 0 195 yields good agreement between the numerical and analytical estimates for a wide range of vertical resistances of the bottom sediments and for aquifer thickness to river width ratios up to 2 5 that is the df model with the leakage coefficient br from dependence 6 and a specific aquifer vertical flow resistance φ 0 195mk 1is applicable for calculating the interaction between groundwater and streams in the case of isotropic hydraulic conductivity of the drained aquifer to assess the possibility of using analytical expression 7 for the case of an anisotropic aquifer the influence of hydraulic anisotropy on the groundwater discharge rate was studied the results of this analysis are shown in fig 4 at the specific vertical resistance φ 0 195 m k z 1 the df model gives acceptable results only for weakly anisotropic media in which the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivities have the same order at commensurate aquifer thicknesses and river widths in contrast when the vertical hydraulic conductivity is an order of magnitude or two smaller than the horizontal hydraulic conductivity the df model systematically underestimates the calculated discharge flow rate into the river such an increase in the df model error is related to the nature of the vertical head distribution shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that for the isotropic case the vertical deformation zone of the head field hm flow zone is localized under and near the river this zone can be approximated by the df model in a leaky aquifer df flow develops at a distance equal to an order of magnitude of the aquifer thickness from the river thus in this case a df model described by eq 6 featuring zone boundaries coinciding with the river edge can be used both with and without leakage in contrast for an anisotropic aquifer as the anisotropy coefficient increases the size of the hm flow zone increases capturing an increasingly greater area and thus reducing the ability of the df model to correctly describe the groundwater flow towards the river note that strictly speaking it is more correct to use numerical results for the anisotropic case by holding the ratio of sizes of the fictive region transformed with regard to anisotropy constant in all numerical experiments l l r 2 m k x k z c o n s t to ensure that the numerical results do not depend on the fact that the ratio of the simulated domain length to its thickness remained equal to 4 in all experiments additional model runs were performed for the extended flow domain this domain was selected to satisfy criteria l l r 2 m k x k z 4 for the case when kx kz 10 that is with a fixed thickness of 150 m the total length of the area was increased by 10 times and equalled 1897 m a comparison of the δl estimates with eq 2 for the initial and enlarged lengths of the domain for the case without bottom sediments shows that the difference in the results is close to 5 only for kz kx 1 for the rest of the anisotropy parameters used this difference is less than 0 6 next we conducted a series of numerical experiments increasing the ratio of the length of the domain to its thickness up to 25 fig 6 shows the δl estimates with eq 2 as a function of the ratio of the simulated domain length to its thickness for different anisotropies of hydraulic conductivity one can see from this that the parameter l value estimated from the simulation for the given anisotropy does not depend on this ratio within its interval of 4 25 therefore we can assume that the δl estimates with eq 2 using numerical simulation obtained with the ratio of simulated domain length to its thickness equal to 4 can be used for analytical results validation thus this numerical validation of the generalized df model verifies that it exhibits sufficient accuracy in describing groundwater discharge into streams with bottom sediments that are imperfectly open to isotropic and weakly anisotropic aquifers in the 0 2 5 range of aquifer thickness to river width ratios 2 4 equivalent flow resistance length of a hydrodynamically narrow stream if the river width is an order of magnitude smaller than the aquifer thickness the solution of the df model equation system 6 which gives dependence 7 for the parameter δl cannot be used because the length of the flow zone under the river tends toward zero aravin and numerov 1965 presented an expression for the dimensionless flow resistance in equation 1 for groundwater interacting with a hydrodynamically narrow stream without bottom sediments for the case where lr m for symmetric flow this expression takes the following form 11 φ π 1 ln sinh π l r 4 m π 1 ln 4 m π l r for a vertically homogeneous isotropic aquifer connected via bottom sediments with a stream the total head loss is due to the vertical resistance of the aquifer δh φ and bottom sediment resistances δh m 0 k 0 for the case of symmetric flow the following can be stated 12 q r 2 t h 0 h r δ l h 0 h r δ h φ δ h m 0 k 0 δ h φ q r φ k δ h m 0 k 0 q r l r m 0 k 0 where h 0 is the head of the df model under the river then the expression for parameter δl for a hydrodynamically narrow stream with bottom sediments can be written as follows 13 δ l 2 m φ t l r m 0 k 0 in expressions 11 and 13 the depth of the river is assumed to be significantly less than its width if the river depth is commensurate with its width the wetted perimeter should be taken in expression 11 for the resistance 3 surface water groundwater interaction in a river valley with evapotranspiration 3 1 dupuit forchheimer flow model with groundwater depth dependent evapotranspiration consider groundwater flow in a river valley with evapotranspiration at the groundwater table close to the ground surface we assume that groundwater discharge in the river valley occurs symmetrically from both banks thus for simplification we consider flow from only one bank fig 7 let the total discharge q of groundwater flow per unit width of the aquifer be achieved in the watershed area of the river basin zone 3 then in river zone 2 floodplain of width l0 the groundwater flow is partially discharged via evapotranspiration for generalization we assume that the aquifer beneath the valley is overlain by relatively low permeability sediments with thickness m a and hydraulic conductivity ka the rest of the flow enters zone 1 under the channel of the stream that does not penetrate the aquifer top where it is discharged into the stream through low permeability bottom sediments with specific hydraulic resistance m0 k0 assume that the intensity rate of groundwater discharge by evapotranspiration in zone 2 floodplain can be described as a linear function of the depth of the water table if this depth is less than the critical depth zcrit zsurf d max harbaugh 2005 14 e t g w x e t max d max h t o p x z c r i t h t o p x z c r i t where dmax is the critical depth at which groundwater evapotranspiration ceases zsurf is the constant ground surface elevation in the evapotranspiration zone zone 2 x is the direction perpendicular to the river channel originating in the middle of the river channel and htop is the groundwater table elevation on the other hand the relationship between the groundwater level and df model head in the evapotranspiration zone can be written as follows 15 h 2 x h t o p x e g w x m a k a φ then the df model expressions for zones 1 and 2 can be written in the following forms 16 d 2 h 1 d x 2 b r 2 h 1 h r 0 0 x l 2 2 d 2 h 2 d x 2 b e t 2 h 2 z c r i t 0 l 2 2 x l 0 b e t t d max e t max m a k a φ 1 the analytical solution of problem 16 under the condition of a given total flow per unit width q at the boundary between zones 2 and 3 is given in the appendix in particular see the appendix for details the expression for the fraction of groundwater flow ε being discharged into the river is obtained as follows 17 ε q r q b e t l e t 1 b e t l e t 1 1 b e t 1 l e t 1 1 β i e t i 1 β δ l l e t where i is the gradient of natural groundwater flow at the river valley boundary equal to i wlw t w is the recharge rate in the recharge zone of length lw designated by zone 3 in fig 7 and iet is the gradient of evapotranspiration discharge in the absence of natural groundwater flow where i e t h r z c r i t l e t 1 β the proportion of discharge flow due to evapotranspiration is 1 ε and the ratio of evapotranspiration to discharge into the river is obtained as follows 18 q e t q r ε 1 1 3 2 numerical validation of the evapotranspiration discharge model to validate the applicability of the df model for estimating groundwater discharge via evapotranspiration we consider the most complicated case in terms of df flow formation fig 8 this case describes the formation of flow losses from a hydrodynamically narrow river in the absence of natural groundwater flow consider the situation shown in fig 8 let the wetted perimeter p of the stream be substantially less than the aquifer thickness m p m and let the width of the evapotranspiration zone in the river valley be comparable to or greater than the aquifer thickness l 0 m under such conditions in the evapotranspiration zone of a narrow stream the vertical head distribution fig 8 does not initially correspond to the df model for the df model the following expression for the flow losses from the river in the absence of natural flow from the watershed is derived from 17 as follows 19 q a 2 q r 2 t h r z c r i t l e t δ l where qa is the analytically calculated total seepage loss per unit width from the river to both banks previously a similar dependence was obtained by min et al 2020 the numerical 2d modflow simulation of flow losses from a narrow stream consumed by evapotranspiration in a river valley using the evapotranspiration evt package harbaugh 2005 was used to assess the applicability of the df model the constant and varying parameters for each variant used for the simulation are presented in table 2 for each simulation run the total discharge originating from the river and evaporating in the river valley was calculated using the numerical model q sim and then the discharge q a was calculated analytically using dependence 19 l et was calculated using dependence a5 it is incorrect to use dependence 7 to calculate the value of δl because the river width is too narrow table 2 specifically the river width is less than 0 4 of the aquifer thickness in all variants therefore the value of δl when calculating q a is determined using dependence 13 for l r equal to the wetted perimeter p fig 9 shows a comparison between the analytically and numerically calculated stream losses for different combinations of parameters for the case of a narrow river the analytical expression for flow losses obtained using the df model achieves sufficient accuracy in a wide range of calculation parameters even for the most complicated case i e the case of a hydrodynamically narrow river under which no df flow zone is formed at the same time fig 9 shows that considering the vertical flow resistance φ in the calculated value of l et does not improve but rather worsens the convergence of both the numerical and the analytical results especially if the ratio d max et max φ is smaller than 10 apparently this is due to the geometry of the problem selected for testing in which the most intense flows are concentrated in the uppermost part of the aquifer 3 3 sensitivity of evapotranspiration discharge to the flow parameters in the arid zone under arid and hyperarid conditions and in the absence of natural groundwater flow in summer evaporation is responsible for the seepage losses from a river using dependence 19 let us consider how groundwater flow parameters influence the formation of losses 3 3 1 case of a hydrodynamically wide river and wide evaporation zone in this case 0 5brlr 3 and the magnitude of δ l b r 1 in addition b et l 0 3 and the magnitude of l e t b e t 1 this is the case for maximum surface runoff losses forming evapotranspiration in the coastal zone the transformation of 19 for the considered case yields the following expression 20 q e t max 2 t d max e t max h r z c r i t d max 1 β if the hydraulic resistance of bottom sediments can be neglected then in an isotropic homogeneous aquifer with hydraulic conductivity k and thickness m the following expression is obtained 21 β 0 441 m k d max e t max considering that typical values of etmax reach 10 3 to 10 4 m day at real aquifer thicknesses and permeabilities and given β 1 the second factor in dependence 20 also has the following order of unity 22 h r z c r i t d max 1 β 1 q e t max 2 t d max e t max as discerned from 22 in this case the flow losses from the river are determined by the aquifer conductivity maximum evaporation rate and depth at which evapotranspiration ceases 3 3 2 case of a hydrodynamically narrow river and wide evaporation zone if the river width is commensurate with the aquifer thickness and the vertical hydraulic resistance of bottom sediments is sufficiently high to guarantee 0 5 l r b r 1 then it is possible to consider a hydrodynamically narrow river in this case the value of β can be estimated as follows 23 β 2 t m 0 k 0 l r d max e t max accordingly 24 q e t max 2 t d max e t max 1 2 m 0 k 0 l r t e t max d max comparing eqs 22 and 24 reveals that the specific resistance of bottom sediments and a small river width reduce the maximum possible loss 3 3 3 case of a hydrodynamically wide river and narrow evapotranspiration zone in this case assuming that b et l 0 1 we obtain the maximum loss as follows 25 q e t max 2 e t max l 0 e t max 2 l 0 3 3 d max t e t max l 0 2 in this case it follows from 25 that the maximum loss is mainly determined by the width of the evapotranspiration zone and etmax 3 4 sensitivity of evapotranspiration discharge to the flow parameters in the humid zone in a humid zone the critical depth of the groundwater table d max usually does not exceed the first 2 3 m likewise most terraces on which evapotranspiration takes place above the river level are usually at elevations within the first couple of metres accordingly under humid conditions in 17 it is possible to achieve hr zcrit in this case the proportion of groundwater discharge into the river is 26 ε q r q coth 2 b e t l 0 1 coth b e t l 0 1 β β δ l l e t dependence 26 is plotted in fig 10 from which it follows that the role of evapotranspiration in the river valley under humid conditions grows with increasing width of the evapotranspiration zone l 0 in the case of b e t l 0 l 0 e t max t d max 1 expression 26 can be approximated by the following dependence 27 ε q r q 1 l 0 2 e t max 2 t d max 1 β 1 the ratio of discharge in the form of evapotranspiration to discharge into the river channel is calculated as follows 28 q e t q r ε 1 1 l 0 2 e t max 2 t d max β 1 β it follows from 27 and 28 that part of the flow being discharged in the evapotranspiration zone increases in proportion to the square of the width of this zone l 0 and the value of the potential evaporation rate et max but increases in inverse proportion to the transmissivity of the aquifer 4 discussion the analysis provided in the previous section shows that under both arid and humid conditions the amount of evapotranspiration that occurs in a river valley depends on a variety of parameters including aquifer properties such as transmissivity and the hydraulic resistance of river bottom sediments and the parameters involved in the linear relationship between evapotranspiration and the groundwater table depth in addition the relationship between evapotranspiration and discharge into the river is affected by both the width of the river and the width of the riparian zone where groundwater evapotranspiration occurs the use of the df flow model to analyse the evapotranspiration that occurs in a river valley shows that the dependence describing both arid and humid conditions includes the parameter β δl let which physically signifies the ratio of the specific flow resistance of the discharge zone into the river to that into the evapotranspiration zone a numerical analysis of the characteristic values of this parameter even for a hydrodynamically narrow river see eq 23 shows that the value of this parameter is fundamentally much less than unity its typical values appear to lie in the range of 0 0 2 consequently under hyperarid conditions surface water losses depend only weakly on the river bottom parameters and are mainly determined by the width of the riverside riparian zone and the parameters governing the connection between groundwater evapotranspiration and the groundwater table depth under humid conditions in most cases this ratio of resistances causes most groundwater flow discharge 80 or more formed in a watershed to flow into a river moreover only in cases of sufficiently wide betl 0 0 5 wetland valleys can the proportion of evapotranspiration discharge be comparable to or even exceed the discharge into the river the problem of correctly accounting for groundwater and stream interconnections in numerical modflow like df flow models with a rather coarse grid has been discussed in several studies mehl et al 2010 investigated the effect of the grid block size on the errors arising from calculating the flow of the river water groundwater interconnection morel seytoux et al 2013 and miracapillo and morel seytoux 2014 developed an approach based on the dependencies for riverbed conductivity obtained using an analytical solution for the hm flow in a narrow river area partially open to an aquifer diaz et al 2020 and nawalany et al 2020 proposed a numerical analytical approach to correctly describe the near river hm flow given a rectangular channel profile in particular using a specific typical example of groundwater discharge into a hydrodynamically narrow river the modflow like approach to describing groundwater interconnection in models was shown to be capable of producing flow errors in excess of 40 nawalany et al 2020 nevertheless modflow like codes are the most common tools used to solve groundwater resource assessment problems and their interaction with streams accordingly when developing regional groundwater models with a rather coarse numerical grid the characteristic grid step size may exceed the width of the river valley fig 11 let us consider a typical situation when a regional modflow based numerical model includes both river and riparian zones with similar groundwater levels in one block a fragment of a 2 d finite difference modflow grid is shown in fig 11 in which the two modflow packages riv and evt harbaugh 2005 are activated in a block with the coordinates i j moreover we assume that the i direction is oriented along the river valley thus the flow in this direction is substantially less than that in the j direction in this case the balance equation for this block under a steady state regime of flow into the river can be written as follows 29 q i j 1 2 q i j 1 2 h i j h r c i j h i j z c r i t c e t i j in eq 29 the grid parameters c and c et are written in the notation of this paper as follows harbaugh 2005 30 с k 0 m 0 l r b c e t e t max d max d x i d y j in the case of the absence of evaporation from 2 7 and 29 the general expression for c considering flow under the river and the vertical resistances of the aquifer can be written as follows 31 c 2 t b b r tanh l r b r 2 in expression 31 the parameter b r is defined by general dependence 6 for the case of a narrow river lrbr 0 5 tanh 0 5lrbr 0 5lrbr if the vertical flow resistance of the aquifer is neglected φ 0 expression 31 becomes dependence 30 for c assuming from 30 that hr zcrit for a humid zone it follows that 32 c e t c d y b ε 1 1 thus the sequential use of dependencies 31 and 32 with an analytical estimation of ε makes it possible to calculate the effective mesh dependent parameters of the riv and evt packages when these packages are activated in the same blocks of the computational grid 5 conclusions the df assumption is widely adopted when modelling the exchanges between surface water and groundwater in regional groundwater flows in such cases difficulties naturally arise in describing the flow near and under streams because the df flow in the zone adjacent to and under the stream is disturbed and additional flow resistances appear due to the vertical deformation of flow lines and because the permeabilities of the river bottom sediments are different from that of the main part of the aquifer we show that in this case it is possible to use an extended df model that considers both abovementioned factors and we present expressions for the generalized hydraulic resistance expressed in units of the 1 d flow length with constant conductivity for the case where groundwater evapotranspiration develops in the river valley and linearly decreases with the depth of the groundwater table from the surface we obtain a new analytical solution within the df model for the symmetric scheme of discharge from both banks of a river this solution describes both the discharge of natural groundwater flow in the valley as evapotranspiration and the discharge into the river the flow losses from the river in the absence of natural flow and the presence of evapotranspiration in the river valley furthermore a sensitivity analysis was conducted for this solution under hyperarid conditions that is when the riverine groundwater balance is determined by evapotranspiration in the riparian zone causing river flow losses in this case the intensity of the water exchange in the riverside riparian zone depends on the sum of two hydraulic resistances the river resistance and the resistance of the evapotranspiration zone in addition analytical assessments are performed on the total river flow losses per unit width of the aquifer due to evapotranspiration while condisering the flow parameters river width width of the riparian zone along the river banks as well as parameters governing the connection between the evapotranspiration of groundwater and the groundwater table depth a sensitivity analysis of the solution under humid conditions reveals that in most cases most of the natural groundwater 80 or more formed in watersheds flows into rivers moreover only in cases of sufficiently wide wetland valleys can the share of evapotranspiration discharge be comparable to or even exceed the discharge into the river finally the obtained analytical dependencies allow the effective grid dependent parameters of the riv and evt packages to be calculated in the modflow based

104,though freshwater mussels in rivers tend to be aligned with the flow the angle of attack can increase significantly during periods when the stage and discharge vary rapidly e g floods as the near bed flow changes mussels can experience larger drag forces before they reorient themselves parallel to the flow and or increase their level of burial into the substrate to avoid dislocation the present paper used a previously validated eddy resolving numerical model to study the changes in the structure of the near wake flow horseshoe vortex system drag forces acting on the exposed part of the mussel shell sediment entrainment mechanisms and dilution of the jet of filtered water originating in the excurrent siphon with the increase in the magnitude of the angle of attack θ for an isolated mussel placed in an open channel with incoming fully developed turbulent flow given that the mussel may modify its mean volumetric discharge through the two siphons and level of mussel burial as θ changes simulations are performed with and without active filtering and with two heights of the exposed part of the mussel h the raise in θ increases the total drag force acting on the exposed part of the shell the entrainment into the excurrent siphon jet containing filtered water the circulation of the horseshoe vortices the strength of the anti symmetric wake shedding mode and the circulation of the main streamwise oriented base vortex forming behind the mussel results show that for all angles of attack the downflow induced by the primary base vortex generates a large region where the bed shear stresses are strongly amplified so particulate deposition is expected to be low and significant local scour may occur in the near wake of a partially burrowed mussel keywords freshwater mussels active filtering numerical simulations horseshoe vortex 1 introduction freshwater mussels play an important role in sand bed and gravel bed rivers they provide spawning and hiding habitat for fish and insects increase the dissolved oxygen concentration in the soil substrate enhance the stability of the river bed consume plankton increase water clarity and purify water through their filtering activity guttierez et al 2003 lohrer et al 2004 van duren et al 2006 vaugh et al 2008 allen and vaughn 2009 polvi and sarneel 2018 nutrients are acquired by the mussel from the water taken in through the incurrent siphon that is then filtered the filtered clean water leaving the mussel through its excurrent siphon is characterized by very low levels of nutrients and phytoplankton fine suspended matter and waste compared to the average levels in the incoming flow nakato et al 2007 understanding the role of large scale turbulence on transport processes affected by the mussels presence is of great importance to protect aquatic ecosystems mossa et al 2018 in rivers with dense mussel beds the total filter feeding rate is comparable to the stream s flow rate strayer et al 1994 as such mussels play an important role in the nitrogen cycle through their consumption of phytoplankton and zooplankton and are important contributors to river biotic resilience and to efforts to increase the sustainability of river ecosystems gardner et al 1995 marion et al 2014 unfortunately freshwater mussels are one of the most imperiled aquatic species in rivers around the world williams et al 1993 strayer et al 2004 enhanced knowledge on the ecological adaptations and hydrodynamic responses of freshwater mussels in river environments at mussel scale river reach habitat scale and basin scale are needed to better guide restoration and conservation efforts of native freshwater mussel populations in natural streams nakato et al 2007 englehardt et al 2004 bletter et al 2010 the availability of favorable habitat depends on the hydrodynamic conditions zigler et al 2008 for example several studies concluded that the lifespan of mussel beds increases significantly in regions where lower shear stresses are induced at high flow conditions e g see layzer and madison 1995 strayer 1999 morales et al 2006 newton et al 2008 such conditions allow more mussels to resist dislocation by the overflow even at flooding conditions favorable hydrodynamic conditions limit the disturbance of the substrate which in turn enhances juvenile mussel recruitment layzer and madison 1995 howard and cuffey 2003 turbulence also affects mussel habitat and the capability of mussels to survive rehmann et al 2003 in particular the study of the physical mechanisms at mussel scale can provide valuable information to characterize 1 the stability of the partially burrowed mussels as a function of their degree of exposure to the flow orientation mussel active siphoning filter feeding rate and the flow conditions in the channel 2 erosion deposition processes near the mussel 3 mixing between the filtered water and the overflow which is relevant to understand nutrient depletion and distribution of plankton around the mussel the study of these processes for an isolated mussel provides a baseline no mussel to mussel interactions case with respect to which the hydrodynamics of flow and transport processes over clusters of mussels and mussel beds can be characterized such data may also serve toward developing simple analytical models for mussel habitat quality at larger scales finally mussel beds in natural streams are generally characterized by large variations in mussel density and isolated mussels can be often observed in some regions of the river bed each mussel has a shell that contains two close to symmetric valves part of the shell is burrowed into the sediment at the bed in between these valves mussels have an incurrent siphon and an excurrent siphon on their posterior side through which they exchange flow with the overflow though the cross sections of the two siphons are not equal the discharge through the incurrent and excurrent siphons are always equal mussels have a muscular foot and can modify their degree of burial into the substrate and orientation with respect to the direction of the overflow allen and vaughn 2009 however these adaptations occur very slowly in general mussels try to align with their major axis parallel to the overflow such that they minimize drag forces nakato et al 2007 bletter et al 2010 however because of the rapid variations of the stage and discharge in the river e g during floods due to operation of dams situated upstream of the region containing mussels the direction of the mean flow velocity can change significantly bletter et al 2010 constantinescu et al 2013 this means that the flow approaching the mussel is not oriented anymore parallel to the main axis of the mussel and this situation can persist for some time together with the increase in the approach flow velocity the increase in the angle of attack leads to an increase of the drag force acting on the exposed part of the shell and is one of the main mechanisms for mussel dislocation from the bed at high flow conditions nakato et al 2007 at the organism scale the flow past the mussel resembles that past a surface mounted body whose degree of bluntness increases with the magnitude of the angle of attack θ large values of the bed shear stress near the mussel can induce local scour and reduce the capability of the mussel to avoid dislocation by the flow on the other hand very low bed shear stress levels favor deposition of fine sediment particles silts clay which destroys mussel habitat strayer 1999 as opposed to the case of infinitively long cylinders of noncircular cross section or cylinders extending over the whole depth of the open channel e g see chang et al 2007a 2011 the effect of the angle of attack was seldom investigated for submerged bottom mounted obstacles of noncircular shape most fundamental studies of such flows focused on the case of submerged circular cylinders cones of circular cross section or semi spheres e g acarlar and smith 1987 savory and toy 1986 1988 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 shamloo et al 2001 park and lee 2004 sumner et al 2004 pattenden et al 2005 studies conducted for pyramids and submerged rectangular cylinders generally considered only one value of the angle of attack okajima 1982 okamoto and uemura 1991 castro et al 2001 martinuzzi and abuomar 2003 martinuzzi 2008 wang and zhou 2009 more recently the flow past a semi ellipsoid that is an idealization of a partially burrowed mussel with no active filtering was investigated by hajimirzaie et al 2012 2013 in their investigations the incoming flow was either aligned with the major axis θ 0 or with the minor axis θ 90 of the base ellipse these studies showed that the coherence e g as measured by the circulation of the various vortices and the dominant shedding frequency in the wake are a function of the orientation of the obstacle relative to the incoming flow direction unfortunately these two studies did not consider intermediate angles of attack in the range that is expected for mussels in natural streams detailed data on flow and turbulence structure and drag forces acting on isolated or small clusters of partially burrowed mussels are available only from few experimental studies such lab investigations were conducted with live mussels dead mussels or a model of the mussel s shell with or without active filtering e g see constantinescu et al 2013 sansom et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 and provided quantitative information e g on mean velocity turbulent kinetic energy reynolds stresses in a limited number of sections another approach to investigate this type of complex and highly three dimensional 3 d turbulent flows is based on simulations that resolve the dynamically important eddies and allow direct estimation of the drag forces and bed shear stresses in the instantaneous and mean flow fields keylock et al 2012 chang et al 2007a such investigations were carried out by constantinescu et al 2013 for a small cluster of semi burrowed non filtering freshwater mussels for an angle of attack θ 90 and by wu et al 2020a for a single mussel oriented parallel to the incoming flow direction θ 0 and 180 with and without active filtering the main focus of the present paper is on understanding how the near bed flow and dynamics of coherent structures around a partially burrowed freshwater mussel lampsilis siliquoidea placed in a channel with a smooth bed are affected by increasing the magnitude of the angle of attack the paper discusses how the wake structure turbulence statistics drag forces acting on the emerged part of the shell sediment entrainment mechanisms and the dilution of the excurrent siphon jet vary with the angle of attack and with the degree of shell exposure for mussels with and without active filtering to facilitate comparison with cases when the mussel is aligned with the incoming flow the result sections are structured in a similar way to those in the companion paper by wu et al 2020a that discusses θ 0 simulations of flow past the same mussel considered in the present study the discussion also highlights similarities and differences with more canonical flows past submerged surface mounted obstacles of idealized shapes 2 numerical model boundary conditions and matrix of simulations the simulations are performed using the detached eddy simulations des module in star ccm the base turbulence model in the present des simulations is the spalart allmaras reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model constantinescu et al 2003 the model switches to large eddy simulation mode away from the solid surfaces the viscous sublayer was resolved in the present simulations which allowed avoiding the use of wall functions the iddes version of des rodi et al 2013 was used the full model equations and coefficients can be found in spalart 2000 and rodi et al 2013 more details on des the basic numerical algorithm and grid generation methodology are given in wu et al 2020a only the main features of the numerical method are reviewed below the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm is used in the finite volume method to solve the discretized navier stokes equations on unstructured cartesian like grids the convection terms in the momentum equations are discretized using the 3rd order muscl scheme while those in the transport equations for the eddy viscosity and the passive scalar are discretized using the second order accurate upwind scheme the second order central scheme is used to discretize the diffusive and the pressure gradient terms the discretized equations are advanced in time using a second order implicit scheme preliminary validation of the numerical methodology using laboratory and field data measurements and applications for complex turbulent open channel flows are discussed by horna munoz and constantinescu 2018 2020 cheng et al 2018 and wu et al 2020b directly relevant for the present study wu et al 2020a showed that numerical predictions of mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of a semi buried mussel aligned with the flow were close to experimental measurements of the same flow sansom 2019 the present set of simulations uses the same gridding methodology and mesh quality controls domain size and mesh density as the simulations discussed by wu et al 2020a to ensure the solutions are grid and domain size independent as discussed in more details by wu et al 2020a the mussel geometry fig 1 in the numerical model is obtained by converting a stereo lithography stl file containing the mussel s shell using autocad the stl file was generated at the suny univ at buffalo using 3 d tomography of a dead mussel sansom 2019 then the two siphons are added and the submerged part of the shell is removed this new file containing the posterior end of the shell is then read into the grid generator of starccm at this stage a short vertical pipe connecting into the excurrent siphon is added and each boundary is tagged fig 1a shows the computational domain for one of the simulations performed with θ 30 the domain is meshed such that the attached boundary layers on the mussel s shell and the channel bottom surfaces are resolved fig 1b shows a sample mesh generated over the no slip surfaces and the two siphons as evident from this figure a finer mesh is used around the mussel s shell in all three directions the average cell size increases at larger distances from the emerged part of the shell the number of the mesh cells in the θ 30 simulations is between 2 and 3 million slightly larger than the meshes used in the θ 0 simulations reported by wu et al 2020a the average cell size in the directions parallel to the surface of the mussel s shell is about 20 wall units close to the mussel at most locations the first grid point in the wall normal direction is situated at less than two wall units from the bed and the mussel s shell at all locations the first grid point off the wall is situated at less than five wall units from the solid surface in the simulations discussed in this paper see table 1 the incoming channel flow velocity was u 0 0 3 m s and the mussel was oriented with its siphons pointing upstream which corresponds to the dominant orientation of the mussels in the field kumar et al 2019 the total height of the mussel was d 0 06 m fig 1d the flow depth was d 0 15 m the length and width of the computational domain were l 0 4 m and b 0 4 m respectively the two θ 0 h d 0 5 simulations h is the height of the exposed part of the mussel see fig 1b in table 1 were already discussed by wu et al 2020a these flow conditions correspond to those in the experiments used to validate the present model wu et al 2020a and are representative of cases where the interactions between the mussel and the free surface are negligible d h 4 see also shamloo et al 2001 hajimirzaie et al 2012 2013 the internal flow inside the mussel shell was not simulated simulations were performed without filtering and with a relatively large value of the volumetric flow rate through the incurrent and excurrent siphons q i q e 8 94 10 6 m3 s corresponding to a filtration velocity ratio vr u e u 0 0 7 where u e is the mean exit velocity in the excurrent siphon to understand the effect of active filtering this value of qe is close to the maximum volumetric flow discharge in unionids reported by price and schiebe 1978 the effect of the angle of attack was investigated for two levels of mussel burial h d 0 5 and h d 0 25 additional θ 0 simulations were performed with the same h d and vr values as in the corresponding θ 30 simulations because the two valves are not exactly identical an additional simulation was performed with θ 30 for the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case table 1 also gives the values of the reynolds numbers reb b w u 0 ν and reh hu0 ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity and bw is the maximum projected width of the exposed part of the mussel in a plane perpendicular to the incoming flow fig 1b and 1c the aspect ratio h b is equal to 0 75 in the h d 0 5 cases and 0 5 in the h d 0 25 cases where b is the maximum width of the exposed part of the mussel fig 1b for cases with a non zero angle of attack the more relevant variable is the modified aspect ratio ar h bw see table 1 and fig 1c the velocity and eddy viscosity on the bottom boundary and on the mussel s shell were set equal to zero both surfaces were treated as smooth walls as the ratio d h was larger than 5 and the channel froude number was smaller than 0 3 in all simulations the free surface deformations are expected to be small shamloo et al 2001 this justifies the use of a symmetry slip boundary condition at free surface the mean velocity was specified at the excurrent siphon pipe inlet this allows the excurrent siphon flow to interact in a natural way with the channel flow the flow discharge q i was specified on the surface corresponding to the incurrent siphon in the vr 0 simulations the pipe was taken out and the velocity was set equal to zero on the surfaces of the two siphons symmetry boundary conditions were used at the lateral boundaries of the computational domain to mimic a case when the mussel is situated far away from the channel s banks the instantaneous velocity flow fields specified at the inlet section were obtained from a precursor eddy resolving simulation of fully developed flow in a straight channel of depth d and width b with mean flow velocity u 0 these flow fields were fed in a time accurate way through the inlet section in the simulations containing the partially burrowed mussel see wu et al 2020a for more details the use of eddy resolving techniques and the presence of realistic turbulent fluctuations in the incoming flow should also enhance the accuracy of mixing predictions chang et al 2007b a convective boundary condition was used at the exit section which is standard treatment for eddy resolving simulations rodi et al 2013 a passive scalar of constant concentration c 0 was introduced into the computational domain through the excurrent siphon the concentration c was set equal to zero at the inlet boundary the values of c at the exit boundary were obtained via extrapolation from the interior of the domain at the other boundaries the gradient of c in the direction perpendicular to each boundary surface was set equal to zero 3 coherent structures and their effect on the mean flow and turbulence 3 1 large scale turbulence generated near the mussel the q criterion is used in fig 2 to visualize the large scale coherent structures forming around the mussel this criterion locates regions where rotation dominates strain in the flow and is one of the most used criteria to identify and visualize coherent structures in laminar and turbulent flows rodi et al 2013 the large scale turbulent structures generated by the interaction between the incoming flow and the emerged part of the mussel are qualitatively similar in the θ 0 and the θ 30 simulations in all cases a system of horseshoe vortices is generated around the upstream edge of the mussel s shell near the junction line with the channel bed fig 2 while in the θ 0 cases the necklace vortices were characterized by similar levels of coherence e g in terms of circulation of their core and length of their legs on both sides of the shell defined with respect to the major axis of the mussel in the θ 30 cases the horseshoe vortices are more coherent on the side of the mussel that is directly exposed to the incoming flow left side with respect to the incoming flow direction in fig 2 in fact these vortices do not extend over the right side of the mussel if the level of mussel burial is sufficiently high e g see the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case in fig 2 this is because the region where the interaction of the incoming flow with the frontal part of the mussel generates large adverse pressure gradients moves toward the left side of the mussel with increasing θ moreover for sufficiently high θ the projected mussel area in a plane perpendicular to the incoming flow also increases with respect to cases with θ 0 the increase in the projected area generates larger pressures over the frontal part of the mussel and larger adverse pressure gradients around the exposed part of the mussel s shell and explains the overall increase in the coherence of the horseshoe vortices with the angle of attack for constant vr and h d e g compare mean pressure distribution close to the frontal part of the mussel in fig 3 and vorticity distribution inside the horseshoe vortex system in fig 4 for the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases for example for h d 0 5 the total mean flow circulation of the horseshoe vortices in the y d 0 plane is by about 25 larger in the two θ 30 simulations compared to the θ 0 simulation on the other hand the pressure distribution around the frontal part of the mussel varies little with vr for constant h d and angle of attack fig 3 which explains why the position size and circulation of the horseshoe vortices are very close in the θ 30 h d 0 5 simulations with vr 0 and vr 0 7 similar to what was observed in the θ 0 cases with a relatively low level of mussel burrowing e g for cases with h d 0 5 the horseshoe vortex system in the θ 30 cases contains two main vortices that follow a quasi regular cycle during which a newly shed horseshoe vortex merges with the primary vortex situated closer to the mussel the two vortices can also be observed in the vorticity fields shown in fig 4 for the h d 0 5 θ 30 simulations the dynamics of the horseshoe vortices during the oscillatory cycle is similar to the one characterizing the amalgamation regime of a laminar horseshoe vortex system kirkil and constantinescu 2012 a direct result of these quasi regular oscillations is the presence of two regions of high pressure root mean square rms fluctuations inside the horseshoe vortex system in the h d 0 5 cases see fig 5 the same figure shows that increasing the angle of attack from 0 to 30 results in an amplification of the pressure rms fluctuations inside the horseshoe vortex region of the order of 50 for constant vr the strouhal number sth fhbw u0 fh is the frequency of the oscillatory cycle increases with θ for example in the h d 0 5 simulations st h 0 19 in the θ 0 cases st h 0 21 in the θ 30 cases and st h 0 26 in the θ 30 case the unequal st h values in the θ 30 and the θ 30 simulations are explained by the asymmetry of the mussel s shell with respect to its major axis for relatively high levels of mussel burrowing e g for cases with h d 0 25 the horseshoe vortices are quasi steady therefore no sth value is reported in table 1 for cases with h d 0 25 still the legs of some of these vortices can undergo large scale motions as they interact with the vortex tubes shed in the separated shear layer ssl originating around the edge of the mussel s shell in all the θ 30 cases with h d 0 5 an instability develops along the legs of the main horseshoe vortex as it interacts with the vortex tubes shed in the ssl this instability results in the formation of a train of hairpin like vortices fig 2 though such hairpin vortices were also observed in some of the θ 0 h d 0 5 simulations the coherence and size of these vortical structures is increasing sharply with θ e g compare the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases in fig 2 the other main type of coherent structures generated close to the mussel are hairpin like wake vortices that scale with the height of the emerged part of the mussel most of these hairpins start as u shaped vortex tubes inside the ssl for all values of θ the heads of most of these vortex tubes tilt toward the downstream direction while interacting with the neighboring vortex tubes as the head of each vortex tube is situated in a region of relatively high mean streamwise velocity the legs of the vortex tubes are severely stretched and reduce their inclination with respect to the channel bottom as the head moves faster downstream this is the main mechanism that results in the generation of hairpin like vortices in the near wake additional hairpin vortices form when the excurrent siphon jet is strong enough e g in the vr 0 7 simulations such that hairpins are generated on its upstream side near the excurrent siphon as the jet direction changes from vertical to streamwise these vortices have a similar mechanism of formation to the hairpins present in the canonical case of a jet in crossflow with vr close to unity e g see sau and mahesh 2008 the energetic eddies inside the core of the jet and the hairpin vortices generated near the excurrent siphon interact and further disturb the vortex tubes shed in the ssl and the hairpin like wake vortices these interactions may result in a vortex tube being cut into two halves e g such an example is visible in fig 2 for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case which as will be discussed later further weakens the symmetric wake shedding mode especially for cases with a high angle of attack moreover the smaller hairpin vortices generated near the excurrent siphon sometimes merge with the heads of the hairpins generated by the stretching of the vortex tubes in other cases the main effect of the interaction between the two types of hairpins is the severe tilt of one of these vortices toward one side of the near wake such interactions further complicate the eddy structure of the near wake and may strongly disturb of one of the legs of the main horseshoe vortex e g see h d 0 5 cases in fig 2 interestingly the increase of the angle of attack does not result in a significant tilt of the plane defined by the legs of each vortex tube with respect to x constant planes meaning the streamwise location of both legs is comparable in the formation region e g see left frames in fig 6 this is possible because the ssl is longer on the side of the mussel that deflect less of the incoming flow approaching the mussel e g right side for the θ 30 cases this feature of the ssl is particularly evident in the vr 0 cases where the excurrent siphon jet is not present and the vortex tubes are less disturbed by the surrounding turbulent eddies wu et al 2020a observed an increase of the angle between the vertical ssl and the horizontal with increasing vr for mussels aligned with the incoming flow such an effect is also observed for cases with a high angle of attack for example comparison of the vorticity distributions in fig 4 for the θ 30 h d 0 5 cases with vr 0 and vr 0 7 shows not only an increase of the elevation at which the heads of the vortex tubes are advected inside the ssl but also a strong decrease of the distance from the separation line on the mussel shell needed for the kelvin helmholtz instabilities to generate a well defined vortex tube in the y d 0 plane shown in fig 4 the separation line is situated close to x d 0 in the two θ 30 h d 0 5 cases the first vortex tube inside the vertical ssl is present close to x d 0 5 in the simulation with vr 0 7 and close to x d 0 9 in the simulation with vr 0 this effect is consistent with the distributions of the pressure rms fluctuations in fig 5 that show that the region of high turbulence amplification associated with the vertical ssl penetrates closer to the mussel in the vr 0 7 simulation 0 4 x d 1 2 compared to the corresponding vr 0 simulation 0 7 x d 1 4 increasing the magnitude of the angle of attack while keeping vr and h d unchanged increases the coherence of the vortex tubes fig 4 which explains the higher values of the pressure rms fluctuations inside the vertical ssl as θ increases from 0 to 30 in the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 simulations fig 5 the streamwise distance over which most of the hairpins heads maintain their coherence also increases with increasing angle of attack which has a direct effect on the turbulence kinetic energy tke and pressure rms fluctuations levels in the near wake this is the case for both low h d 0 5 and high h d 0 25 levels of mussel burrowing an increase of vr for constant θ and h d results in the generation of more energetic eddies inside the recirculation region forming at the back of the mussel fig 4 and explains the large increase of the pressure rms fluctuations behind the mussel 0 7 x d 1 2 z d 0 3 observed in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 vr 0 case fig 5 3 2 wake vortex shedding as for the case of a submerged surface mounted cylindrical obstacles of regular shape e g submerged cylinder the interaction between the horizontal ssls may lead to the formation of counter rotating billow vortices that generate a wake containing vortices in a staggered out of phase arrangement similar to the von karman vortex street observed past long cylinders this wake structure corresponds to cases where the anti symmetric shedding mode dominates in the wake of bluff bodies cases when the counter rotating wake vortices are arranged in a non staggered in phase pattern correspond to wakes where the symmetric shedding mode dominates typically this occurs for cases where the interactions between the ssls on the two sides of the bluff body are impeded for both solid and porous submerged cylinders the anti symmetric wake shedding mode is much weaker compared to the case when the same cylinder is emerged due to the flow that moves over the top face of the submerged cylinders and then penetrates in between the two horizontal ssls chang et al 2020 in the case of partially burrowed mussels aligned with the incoming flow wu et al 2020a observed that the antisymmetric wake shedding mode coexists with the symmetric shedding mode regardless of the presence or not of active filtering fig 6a besides the afore mentioned mechanism for weakening of the antisymmetric wake shedding mode wu et al 2020a found that the quasi symmetrical oscillations of the legs of the horseshoe vortices with respect to the mussel impede the natural movement of one ssl toward the other ssl which weakens the antisymmetric wake shedding mode the formation of counter rotating vortices at the back of mussels oriented parallel to the incoming flow was also found to weaken the anti symmetric wake shedding mode moreover the symmetric shedding mode was always present and co existed with the antisymmetric shedding mode e g see fig 6a for the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case still analysis of the velocity power spectra showed that the antisymmetric wake shedding mode was the dominant one in all the θ 0 simulations conducted with different vr and h d the instantaneous vertical vorticity distributions in a horizontal plane situated at mid distance between the bed and the top of the mussel shown in fig 6b d illustrate the two wake shedding modes for cases where the angle of attack is θ 30 present simulations show that for high angles of attack the two wake shedding modes co exist but the percentage of time when each mode is present is generally different for the two modes the percentage of time each mode is present was calculated based on the instantaneous flow fields collected over about 10 s after the flow becomes statistically steady the frames are equally spaced in time the sum of the two numbers is less than 100 because in some frames the wake flow transitions between the two modes and it is not clear if the first two three wake billows on each side of the mussel are in phase or out of phase e g by a streamwise distance larger than the mean diameter of the corresponding billows analysis of successive instantaneous flow fields where one vortex shedding modes is present also allows identifying the average time interval between successive billows formation on one side of the mussel and thus the corresponding shedding frequency in the velocity power spectra that is associated with that mode the velocity power spectra in fig 7 allow to quantitatively evaluate the effect of increasing the angle of attack from 0 to 30 and then varying the active filtering rate and the level of mussel burrowing on the relative strengths of the symmetric and antisymmetric wake shedding modes and the associated nondimensional shedding frequencies st s and st a st fb w u 0 where f is the dimensional shedding frequency of wake billows when the wake near the mussel contains in phase billows or out of phase billows both frequencies are indicated using arrows in the velocity spectra shown in fig 7 in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case the most energetic frequency in the wake st w sta 0 39 corresponds to the antisymmetric mode fig 7a the symmetric mode frequency st s 0 2 is about half the one associated with the antisymmetric mode meanwhile the antisymmetric mode is present in about 60 of the analyzed series of successive flow fields while the symmetric mode is present in about 35 of the same series of flow fields the other energetic frequencies in fig 7a st 0 59 0 78 and 1 55 correspond to the advection of vortex tubes in the upstream part of the ssls some of these vortex tubes increase their size and circulation via vortex pairing the main effect of increasing the angle of attack to 30 is the amplification of the energy associated with the anti symmetric and symmetric vortex shedding modes fig 7a b meanwhile the percentage of time the antisymmetric mode is observed increases to about 75 while that one associated with the symmetric mode decreases to slightly over 20 the increase in the energy of the antisymmetric shedding mode is accompanied by a slight reduction of st a from 0 39 to 0 36 the increase of the projected area of the mussel of the streamwise velocity acceleration on the sides of the mussel and of the spanwise distance between the two horizontal ssls with increasing angle of attack favors the formation of higher circulation wake vortices e g see billow forming on the left side of the mussel in the right panel of fig 6b though at times symmetric shedding of vortex tubes is observed inside the downstream part of the two ssls see left panel of fig 6b the symmetric wake shedding mode is relatively weak sts 0 12 fig 7b the most energetic frequency associated with the passage of the vortex tubes also increases with the angle of attack e g st 1 07 for θ 30 compared to st 0 59 for θ 0 comparison of the θ 30 h d 0 5 cases with vr 0 7 fig 7b and vr 0 fig 7c allows understanding the effect of active filtering on wake shedding for cases with a high angle of attack the main difference is that the symmetric wake shedding mode e g see left frame in fig 6c becomes the most energetic shedding mode as the filtering rate becomes equal to zero also the percentage of time the two modes are observed is approximatively equal in the vr 0 case as this happens the primary ssl interactions are between the two legs of the same vortex tube the two associated counter rotating vortices travel for a relatively large distance before they start being stretched by the surrounding eddies e g see left frame in fig 6c where three pairs of such vortices are observed for vr 0 the dominant frequencies associated with the symmetric and antisymmetric wake shedding modes are st w st s 0 31 and st a 0 64 respectively fig 7c qualitatively this effect is similar to what was observed in the θ 0 cases where the energy of the anti symmetric shedding mode was also found to decrease with decreasing vr wu et al 2020a still in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 simulation the antisymmetric wake shedding mode remained slightly more energetic than the symmetric wake shedding mode for cases with significant active filtering and large angles of attack the antisymmetric wake shedding mode remains the dominant shedding mode as h d decreases beneath 0 5 but the difference in the energy associated with the two modes decays with decreasing h d in the θ 30 vr 0 7 simulations fig 7b and 7d the decrease of h d from 0 5 to 0 25 resulted in a decrease of the energy of the dominant frequency associated with the antisymmetric wake shedding mode but did not affect the value of the shedding frequency st w st a 0 36 as for the other cases with significant active filtering st s 0 2 st a in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 simulation the effect of decreasing h d from 0 5 to 0 25 was to increase the percentage of time when the symmetric shedding mode is observed from 20 to about 40 3 3 effect of wake shedding on the recirculation region and turbulence amplification in the near wake as the flow moves past the mussel and it separates a region containing fluid moving slowly toward the back of the mussel forms e g see 2 d streamline patterns in fig 5 and region with u u 0 0 in fig 8 in some cases e g see the θ 30 h d 0 5 cases in fig 5 a recirculation eddy forms in vertical planes inside the region bounded by the ssl and the bed see also fig 1d its maximum length may occur away from the channel bed this region is the equivalent of the mean flow reattachment bubble forming in flows past surface mounted cylindrical obstacles e g submerged circular cylinders its size scales with the height of the obstacle e g compare the θ 30 h d 0 5 simulation results for h d 0 5 and h d 0 25 in fig 8 for constant θ and h d the size of the region where fluid is moving toward the back of the mussel increases with increasing vr fig 8 as shown in figs 8 and 9 increasing the angle of attack results in a growth of the streamwise length of the region of upstream moving fluid xr this length is measured with respect to the center of the mussel fig 1d when nondimensionalized by the height of the exposed part of the mussel the relative increase of x r h is the largest 50 for the h d 0 25 cases fig 9 and table 1 for constant vr and h d varying the angle of attack from 30 to 30 has a negligible effect on x r the 2 d streamline patterns in a horizontal plane cutting through the middle of the exposed part of the mussel fig 10 b confirm the increase of x r with θ in horizontal planes situated far from the top of the mussel two recirculating eddies are generally present they correspond to the two legs of the u shaped arch vortex generally observed at the back of submerged obstacles with a sufficiently large height to width ratio pattenden et al 2002 chang et al 2020 the u shaped vortex does not form in the h d 0 25 cases see case with h d 0 25 in fig 10b where it is replaced by a recirculation bubble for the θ 30 cases with h d 0 5 the legs of the u shaped vortex are getting closer to the back of the mussel with increasing vr fig 10b this effect is qualitatively similar to what is observed for the θ 0 cases the primary mechanisms for the tke increase in the near wake region are the vortex tubes and the interactions of the horizontal ssls that generate counter rotating wake billows for constant vr and h d the average circulation of the wake billows increases with θ e g see fig 6a and 6b this explains the larger size and larger tke levels inside the region of high turbulence in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 10 similarly the decrease in the average circulation and size of the wake billows generated by antisymmetric wake shedding with decreasing vr e g see fig 6b and 6c for θ 30 is the main reason for the smaller size and lower tke levels inside the region of high turbulence in the θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 10 a similar effect was observed for the θ 0 simulations wu et al 2020a the effect of decreasing h d for constant vr in the θ 30 simulations is to reduce the size of the main region of high tke e g compare the tke distributions for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 cases in fig 10 this happens because the size of this region scales with h and the projected width of the mussel the effect of varying θ vr and h d on the shear stresses u w and u v is investigated in figs 11 and 12 respectively these components of the reynolds stress tensor are the primary shear stresses in vertical and horizontal planes respectively in the vertical y d 0 plane the main region of positive u w in fig 11 is bordered by the vertical ssl fig 4 its formation is associated with the generation of kelvin helmholtz vortices inside the downstream part of the ssl the variations in the position of the vertical ssl over time and the entrainment of some of these vortices inside the near wake region see also instantaneous vorticity distributions in fig 4 it is only in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case that this region is split into two parts due to the formation of a smaller region of high negative u w near the excurrent jet siphon its formation can be explained by the presence of a recirculation bubble attached to the back of the mussel see 2 d streamlines in fig 4 such a bubble is not present in the θ 30 simulations as vr decreases the vertical ssl becomes more horizontal fig 4 this decreases the width of the main region of high positive u w but at the same time increase its length fig 11 in all simulations a smaller size region of high negative u w forms in between the bed and the main region of high positive u w finally the small region of positive u w observed near the front of the mussel in the θ 30 simulations is induced by the oscillations of the cores of the horseshoe vortices this region is characterized by a large amplification of the turbulence as also observed in the distributions of the pressure rms fluctuations in fig 5 the distributions of u v in the z h 0 5 plane fig 12 are qualitatively similar to those observed in the near wake of 2 d bluff bodies where vortex shedding occurs the two regions of high positive and negative u v correspond to those where wake billows form via merging of kelvin helmholtz vortex tubes shed in each of the two horizontal ssls the largest contribution to these stresses comes when the legs of the vortex tubes advected inside the ssls interact this happens primarily during the time periods when the antisymmetric wake shedding mode is observed for constant vr and h d the increase of the angle of attack from 0 to 30 increases the width of the near wake and thus the total width of the two regions of high u v the coherence of the wake billows also increases with increasing θ which explains the increased length of the same regions in the θ 30 simulations see fig 12 variations in h d and vr do not induce noticeable qualitative changes in the distributions of u v in horizontal planes cutting through the mussel 3 4 streamwise oriented vortices and associated upwelling and downwelling motions besides the u shaped vortex pairs of counter rotating streamwise oriented vortices may form at the back of the mussel in the mean flow fig 13 these eddies advect fluid upwards base vortices or downwards tip vortices in between their cores for example both types of vortices are observed very close to the back of the mussel in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 14 such vortices were also observed to form in flow past idealized shape obstacles that are close to the shape of a partially burrowed mussel e g for half ellipsoids placed on the channel bottom where a pair of symmetric counter rotating vortices form in the mean flow see hajimirzaie et al 2012 for mussels aligned with the incoming flow wu et al 2020a have shown that the dominant streamwise oriented vortices are base vortices and that the slight asymmetry of the right and left valves of the shell resulted in one of these vortices being much weaker than the other one such that only one base vortex is generally present for x d 1 in the θ 0 cases e g see results for the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in figs 13 and 14 where the base vortex situated in the y d 0 region maintains its coherence until the end of the computational domain while the other base vortex loses its coherence by x d 1 the first thing to notice in fig 14 for the θ 30 cases is the presence of a high circulation streamwise oriented vortex in the x d 3 5 and 5 cross sections its direction of rotation is opposite to that of the main base vortex observed in the θ 0 case as for most of the θ 0 cases e g see θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 14 two base vortices are present near the back of the mussel in the θ 30 cases e g see the x d 0 55 cross section in fig 14 the increase of the angle of attack from 0 to 30 acts toward strengthening the coherence of the base vortex on the right side of the mussel which is the only base vortex observed in the x d 2 cross sections for example this vortex is visualized in fig 13 using the q criterion for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case one should also mention that for θ 30 the direction of rotation of the main base vortex is the same as that of the main base vortex in the θ 0 cases in the θ 0 cases with a relatively low h d the shape of the emerged part of the mussel s shell becomes close to symmetrical and the coherence of the base vortices remains comparable at large distances from the back of the mussel wu et al 2020a as the angle of attack increases the wake flow loses its symmetry even for small h d this is why similar to the corresponding cases with a higher h d only one streamwise oriented vortex is observed at large distances from the back of the mussel in the θ 30 h d 0 25 cases figs 13 and 14 fig 15 allows to quantitatively estimate the effect of modifying θ vr and h d on the total circulation magnitude of the streamwise oriented base vortices γt the constant u0d is used to nondimensionalize the circulation the circulation is obtained by integrating the out of plane vorticity inside the patches associated with the base vortices in fig 14 a treshold value of 0 1u0d was used to define the boundary of the core of each base vortex based on the mean streamwise vorticity distributions for the θ 30 cases with same h d the total circulation magnitude increases with vr which shows that active filtering affects the coherence of the base vortices for constant vr the total circulation decreases with decreasing h d similar to what was observed for the θ 0 cases interestingly increasing the magnitude of the angle of attack while keeping h d and vr constant does not result in a significant increase of γt away from the mussel e g compare results for cases θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 in fig 15 this effect is atrributed to the fairly large asymmetry generated in the wake of mussels alligned with the flow for relatively high h d the main effect of the presence of strongly coherent streamwise oriented vortices behind the mussel is the generation of flow upwelling and downwelling regions inside the near wake of particular importance are the downwelling regions forming on the side of the vortex core where higher streamwise velocity fluid is advected toward the bed surface which increases the bed shear stress and may generate scour such upwelling and downwelling motions are a general characteristic of flow past submerged and emerged obstacles these motions are generally stronger for submerged obstacles compared to emerged ones this effect is due to the part of the incoming flow moving over the submerged obstacle e g see discussion in chang et al 2020 of the near wake structure past emerged and submerged circular cylinders however for obstacles whose shape is symmetric with respect to the direction of the incoming flow e g ellipsoids circular cylinders the two base or tip vortices are weaker and their circulation magnitude decays faster with the distance from the obstacle compared to the cases analyzed here if one assumes the height and maximum width of the obstacle are the same as those of the partially burrowed mussel as already discussed only one streamwise oriented vortex is generally present at large distances from the mussel as the difference in the circulation of the two vortices growth the stronger vortex gets closer to the bed and the weaker vortex moves away from the bed e g see the x d 0 55 and x d 1 cross sections for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 cases in fig 14 when base vortices are the only streamwise oriented vortices in the wake of a perfectly symmetric surface mounted obstacle one expects a region of upwelling to form between the cores of the two base vortices and two symmetric regions of flow downwelling to form on the outer sides of their cores close to the obstacle the horizontal ssls are part of the downwelling regions in the case of a mussel aligned with the flow wu et al 2020a found that the two downwelling flow regions are of comparable size and fairly symmetric with respect to the y 0 plane only in the h d 0 25 cases where the shape of the emerged part of the mussel considered in the present study is close to symmetric for h d 0 5 all the θ 0 cases are characterized by the presence of a very large region of downflow on the left side of the mussel e g see the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 16 induced by the primary base vortex as in the θ 30 cases the primary base vortex is the one forming on the opposite side of the mussel the main downwelling region also switches sides and is situated on the right side of the mussel the upwelling region is generally larger and extends further downstream from the back of the mussel in the θ 30 cases compared to the corresponding θ 0 cases for h d 0 5 the size of the downwelling region on the side of the weaker base vortex also increases with increasing angle of attack e g compare the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases in fig 16 varying θ from 0 to 30 in the h d 0 25 simulations increases the size of the main downwelling region and of the upwelling region at the back of the mussel this is somewhat expected given that the two base vortices are of comparable coherence and the sizes of the two downwelling flow regions are close in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case while this is not the case in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case fig 14 for both θ 0 and θ 30 the main effect of reducing vr while keeping h d constant is to decrease the sizes of the downwelling and upwelling flow regions e g compare the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 cases in fig 16 4 drag forces quantifying the effect of varying the angle of attack active filtering and level of mussel burial on the total horizontal drag force is important to understand how the capacity of the mussel to withstand dislocation by the overflow varies with changing conditions in the incoming flow that can trigger a response of the mussel e g increase decrease of its filtering activity increase of its level of burial additionally one of the main issues in flow over a mussel bed is to understand the effect of the mussels on the open channel flow in terms of the additional streamwise drag induced by the mussels this requires quantification of the streamwise drag force and the associated drag coefficient for the mussels in the array of particular interest is to understand how these values are different from the drag coefficient of an isolated mussel assuming the same values of θ vr and h d the present study provides estimates of the streamwise drag coefficient c d x m e a n and its root mean square rms fluctuations c d x r m s for isolated partially burrowed mussels see table 1 the streamwise drag coefficient is estimated as c d x m e a n fdx ρu0 2ax where fdx is the streamwise drag force ρ is the density and a x is the streamwise projected area of the emerged part of the mussel s shell same nondimensionalization is used to estimate c d x r m s using the time series of the streamwise drag coefficient in the instantaneous flow fields on the other hand the capacity of the mussel to avoid dislocation is proportional to the magnitude of the mean horizontal drag force acting on the mussel fdxy the total drag force vector is obtained by integrating the mean pressure fig 17 and mean shear stresses over the exposed part of the shell the variable fdxy in table 1 is the magnitude of the projection of this vector on a horizontal plane fdx and fdy are the projections of the total drag force vector along the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively to allow a direct comparison among the different cases considered in the present study the mean drag force variables are nondimensionalized using a length scale d and a velocity scale u0 that is the same for all cases given the relatively high value of the reynolds number the main contribution to both drag forces is form drag due to the mean pressure forces acting on the emerged part of the shell the pressure distributions in fig 17 allow understanding how changes in θ and vr affect the nondimensioanl drag forces for all cases the largest pressures are induced over the most upstream part of the mussel relative to the incoming flow it is near this region that the decelleration of the incoming flow is the largest fig 3 consistent with bernouli s equation the pressure increases as the flow decelerates and adverse pressure gradients are generated away from the mussel given the slight asymmetry of the two valves of the shell the region of high pressure forming around the lower part of the frontal side of the shell in the θ 0 simulations is pushed slighly toward the right side of the mussel e g see θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 17 in the θ 30 simulations this region is mostly situated on the left side of the mussel consistent with the new orientation of the mussel for the same reasons the spanwise component of the drag force fdy is not negligible in both the θ 0 and the θ 30 simulations table 1 though the formation of a region of low pressure at the back of the mussel is expected one interesting result is that for both the θ 0 and the θ 30 simulations the smallest pressures occur just downstream of the separation line fig 17 for constant vr and h d the main effect of increasing θ from 0 to 30 is to decrease the pressure at the back of the mussel e g compare the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases in figs 3 and 17 meanwhile the increase of the pressure inside the frontal region of high pressure values is fairly small this explains the increase of the nondimensional horizontal drag force with the angle of attack in table 1 and fig 18 a the relative increase can be as high as 50 for the h d 0 25 cases for same h d the increase of f d x y with θ is slightly larger for the cases with large active filtering vr 0 7 compared to the corresponding vr 0 cases the main reason for the decay of f d x y with decreasing vr for fixed θ and h d is the pressure increase at the back of the mussel e g see the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 cases in figs 3 and 17 given that the total pressure force acting on the frontal region is very little affected by the variation of vr the effect of lowering vr is to decrease the horizontal drag force acting on the mussel the asymmetry of the two valves of the shell is the main reason why the predicted values of f d x y in the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 simulations with θ 30 are not the same the value predicted for θ 30 is about 25 larger than the one predicted for θ 30 table 1 interestingly the spanwise component of the drag force is significant not only in the simulations with θ 30 but even in the θ 0 simulations conducted with a relatively large height of the exposed part of the mussel h d 0 5 only for h d 0 25 where the degree of asymmetry of the two valves is negligible the spanwise component f d y accounts for only a small percentage of the total drag force in the θ 0 simulations table 1 in the h d 0 5 θ 30 simulations f d y accounts for up to 40 of the total mean drag force results in table 1 for θ 30 also show that the streamwise and the spanwise components of the total drag force increase at about the same rate with increasing vr the effect of increasing the angle of attack from 0 to 30 on c d x m e a n is relatively low fig 18b and table 1 the main reason is that the resultant pressure force acting on the high pressure region at the frontal side of the mussel is not anymore oriented close to parallel to the streamwise direction in the θ 30 cases fig 17 for constant vr and h d c d x m e a n increases slightly with increasing angle of attack the largest increase is observed in the θ 30 and θ 30 cases with vr 0 7 and h d 0 5 fig 18b this shows that for relatively low levels of mussel burrowing active filtering can act toward increasing the streamwise drag for mussels not aligned with the incoming flow vortex shedding in the wake of the mussel is the main reason for the large scale fluctuations observed in the temporal variation of the streamwise drag coefficient the c d x r m s variable characterizes in a quantitative way the intensity of these oscillations results in table 1 show that an increase of θ from 0 to 30 does not necessarily result in an increase of c d x r m s another interesting result is that c d x r m s is less than 6 of c d x m e a n in all the simulations conducted with θ 30 this also means that the capacity of the mussels to avoid dislocation is primarily a function of the mean drag force magnitude 5 bed shear stress distributions local scour developing around the mussel is the second main mechanism that can lead to mussel dislocation from the substrate as large scale coherent structures are present in the bed vicinity e g horseshoe vortices the legs of the vortex tubes in the ssl and large scale hairpins in the near wake the capacity of the flow to erode the bed is a function of both the mean bed shear stress magnitude τ and the temporal variations of the instantaneous bed shear stress with respect to its local mean value the standard deviation of the bed shear stress τ rms is used to characterize in an approximate way the capacity of the coherent structures to induce bed shear stresses that are larger than the mean value and thus the contribution of these structures to enhance sediment entrainment at a certain location sumer et al 2003 kraft et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 given that the near wall flow is resolved the bed shear stress magnitude is estimated as τ ρ u 0 2 1 r e u m u 0 n 1 d where um is the velocity magnitude in a plane parallel to the channel bed situated at a distance n1 from it kirkil and constantinescu 2009 formally the formulas used to estimate τ and τ rms are the same but the square root of the turbulent kinetic energy at the first grid point off the wall replaces um in the definition of τ rms both variables are plotted in nondimensional form in fig 19 the mean bed shear stress in the approach flow τ 0 was used to nondimensionalize τ and τ rms in all the θ 0 and θ 30 cases the peak values of τ τ 0 occur on the two sides of the mussel s shell due to the part of the incoming flow that is diverted laterally as it approaches the mussel these regions of high τ τ 0 generally extend past the end of the mussel where they are bordered by the horizontal ssls as the flow accelerates the bed shear stress increases for same level of mussel burrowing the level of amplification of τ τ 0 inside these regions is proportional to the projected area of the mussel in a plane perpendicular to the incoming flow for same h d the projected area is larger in the θ 30 simulations compared to the corresponding θ 0 simulations consistent with these observations the peak values of τ τ 0 and the size of the regions of high τ τ 0 on the two sides of the mussel are larger in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case fig 19a for θ 30 the decrease of the filtering rate results in an increase of the streamwise length of the two regions of high τ τ 0 on the two sides of the mussel for a constant angle of attack the decrease in h d reduces the projected area and the degree of bluntness of the front side of the mussel that is directly exposed to the incoming flow these are the main reasons why the sizes of the two regions of high mean bed shear stress and the peak values of τ τ 0 inside these regions decrease in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case fig 19a for both values of the angle of attack the region at the back of the mussel situated in between the two horizontal ssls is characterized by low mean bed shear stresses particulate deposition is expected to occur inside this region for same angle of attack and level of mussel burrowing e g compare the two cases with θ 30 and h d 0 5 in fig 19a the reduction of the filtering rate increases the size of this region of low τ τ 0 the main differences between the mean bed shear stress distributions in the θ 0 and θ 30 cases occur in the near wake region for x d 1 for both angles of attack the regions of high values of τ τ 0 are due to downwelling induced by the primary base vortex figs 14 and 16 as already discussed the primary base vortex moves from the left side of the mussel to its right side as θ increases from 0 to 30 this is also why the main region where τ τ 0 1 inside the near wake is situated on the right side of the mussel in all θ 30 cases fig 19a by contrast the same region is situated on the left side of the mussel in the θ 0 cases e g see the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 19a so even for relatively large angles of attack a large part of the near wake is a region where scour may occur and deposition of particulates is going to be impeded which is different of what is generally observed in the near wake of emerged and submerged cylindrical obstacles e g see kirkil and constantinescu 2015 chang et al 2017 2020 this effect is related to the reduction of the cross sectional area of the mussel with the distance from the bed and to the asymmetry of the mussel s shell with respect to its main axis for constant vr and h d the effect of increasing θ from 0 to 30 is to delay the start of the region of high τ τ 0 downstream of x d 1 e g compare cases with vr 0 7 and h d 0 5 in fig 19a as for the θ 0 cases see wu et al 2020a despite the increase of the coherence circulation of the main base vortex with increasing mussel filtering fig 15 the size of the region of high τ τ 0 1 and the bed shear stress values inside this region are similar in the θ 30 h d 0 5 simulations conducted with different values of vr fig 19a high values of τ r m s τ 0 are observed over the part of the channel bed situated immediately behind the mussel that contains a wide array of turbulent eddies and beneath the region where wake billow vortices form figs 4 6 and 19b for constant h d the effects of varying θ and vr are relatively mild in terms of the size of this region fig 19b a second region of high values of τ r m s τ 0 is present in the simulations where an unsteady horseshoe vortex system forms as for the θ 0 cases this second region is not present in the θ 30 cases with h d 0 25 where the horseshoe vortex system is quasi steady in the θ 0 and θ 30 cases with h d 0 5 this region extends around the front and lateral sides of the mussel situated beneath the horseshoe vortex system fig 19b consistent with the increase in the coherence of the horseshoe vortices with the magnitude of the angle of attack for constant h d and vr see discussion in section 3 1 and compare the region of high pressure rms fluctuations induced by the horseshoe vortices in fig 5 the levels of τ r m s τ 0 beneath the horseshoe vortex system are about 50 larger in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case for both θ 0 and θ 30 cases the effects of varying the mussel filtering discharge on the levels of τ r m s τ 0 inside the bed region situated beneath the horseshoe vortex system are fairly negligible 6 scalar transport while the incurrent siphon draws water rich in phytoplankton and nutrients from the overflow the jet through the excurrent siphon contains negligible amounts of phytoplankton and nutrients monismith et al 1990 haag 2012 in the case of mussel beds the siphoning filtering activity of the mussels results in the formation of a bottom layer of water that has lower concentrations of phytoplankton and nutrients this motivates the need to understand how the main geometrical and flow variables affect mixing between the jet of clearer water and the surrounding flow as opposed to the widely studied case of a jet in cross flow where the jet enters the channel through an opening in the bottom surface e g see mahesh 2013 in the present setup the jet enters the channel at an elevation z h and the approaching flow is a function of the shape of the frontal side of the mussel o riordan et al 1995 moreover as pointed out by wu et al 2020a the jet develops in a region where one or two strongly coherent streamwise oriented vortices are present fig 20 a c these vortices are not induced by the excurrent jet as they are also present in simulations conducted with no active filtering in the present study an inverse concentration method monismith et al 1990 o riordan et al 1993 1995 crimaldi et al 2007 is used to quantify the dynamics of the excurrent siphon jet entrainment and mixing in this approach the concentration of phytoplankton in the incoming flow is represented by a scalar with a concentration c 0 while the clear water is represented by a scalar with concentration c c0 as the initial direction of the jet is vertical the jet centerline raises as the jet flow changes direction and aligns itself with the incoming flow then the jet starts to move slowly toward the channel bottom while mixing with the surrounding faster moving fluid fig 20d illustrates the distribution of the nondimensional concentration c c0 along a streamwise vertical plane cutting through the excurrent jet siphon given that the axis of the jet makes only a small angle with the streamwise direction for x d 1 one can get information on the jet structure and entrainment by analyzing the distributions of c c0 in relevant x d constant cross sections fig 20a c compare several cases with vr 0 7 as the volumetric discharge of the excurrent jet qj0 is the same the concentration distributions are directly comparable among the three cases in all these cases the near wake contains a strongly coherent base vortex as one moves away from the mussel the core of the jet becomes more ellipsoidal and tilts with respect to the vertical in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case fig 20a the base vortex rotates clockwise while in the other two θ 30 cases fig 20b c the base vortex rotates counter clockwise which explains why the core tilts in opposite directions in the θ 0 and θ 30 cases the streamwise variations of the maximum concentration in the cross section cmax c0 fig 21 a and of the nondimensional volume flux of the jet qj qj0 fig 21b allow characterizing entrainment and ultimately how fast the jet containing clearer filtered water mixes with the surrounding water advected in the channel based on the analysis performed by wu et al 2020a and using the methodology proposed by yuan and street 1998 the jet fluid is defined as the fluid with c cmin where cmin 0 0001c0 results in fig 21 show that for constant vr and h d cmax c0 decreases faster and qj qj0 increases faster with x dj dj is the diameter of the excurent siphon and is a physically more relevant length scale to analyze the spatial development and mixing for jet flows in the θ 30 case compared to the corresponding θ 0 case these results indicate that the increase of θ results in higher entrainment and faster mixing the difference is significant as the volume flux of the excurrent siphon jet at x 36dj 4 5d 9 h is close to 40 larger in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case fig 21b the main reason is the increase of the coherence of the eddies advected in the vertical ssl downstream of the excurrent siphon and of their interactions with eddies generated inside the jet fig 4 the increase of the circulation of the primary base vortex with increasing angle of attack near the back of the mussel fig 15 also contributes to enhancing mixing for the θ 30 cases an increase in the level of mussel burrowing decreases entrainment by the excurrent siphon jet for example the relative decay of qj for x dj 10 in the θ 30 vr 0 7 simulations is of the order of 40 as h d decreases from 0 5 to 0 25 fig 21b such a trend was also observed in the θ 0 cases discussed by wu et al 2020a and is partially due to the increase of the mean shear between the faster moving channel flow and the slower jet flow with increasing h d the mean streamwise velocity in the channel increases with the distance from the bed moreover as h d decreases it takes a smaller distance for the core of the jet to start interacting with the channel bottom which reduces entrainment and mixing on the lower side of the jet 7 predictive capability of unsteady rans to simulate flow and turbulence around isolated mussels given that most practical applications in eco hydraulics are numerically investigated using the rans based simulations it is relevant to discuss the capabilities of this approach to predict flow past isolated mussels especially for practical applications related to mussel bed studies the use of rans is of interest mainly because it is much less expensive compared to large eddy simulation based methods in terms of the required computational resources to assess the predictive capabilities of rans two unsteady time accurate rans simulations were performed for the h d 0 5 vr 0 7 cases with θ 0 and θ 30 the computational domain mesh and physical time step were the same as in the corresponding des simulations the k ω sst model that is one of the most accurate rans models for predicting massively separated flows was employed the time averaged inflow profile calculated based on the instantaneous velocity fields used in the des simulations was specified at the inflow section in the rans simulations a mass outflow boundary condition was implemented at the channel exit the rest of the boundary conditions were identical to those used in des the rans predictions of the horizontal drag force magnitude fdxy ρu0 2d2 0 046 for θ 0 and 0 062 for θ 30 and streamwise drag coefficient cdx mean 0 325 for θ 0 and 0 358 for θ 30 are within 8 of the corresponding des predictions table 1 on the other hand rans severely underpredicts the unsteady oscillations of the drag coefficient cdx rms 0 001 for θ 0 and 0 005 for θ 30 which is expected given that the rans flow fields are depleted of energetic turbulent eddies e g compare instantaneous vorticity distributions for the h d 0 5 vr 0 7 simulations in figs 4 and 22 a the main unsteadiness captured by rans is the one associated with the large scale oscillations of the near wake rans predictions of the dominant shedding frequency in the wake stw 0 37 for θ 0 and 0 36 for θ 30 are fairly accurate however rans incorrectly predicts the anti symmetric wake shedding mode is present at all times which should affect its capability to predict transport and mixing in mussel beds the fact that rans does not resolve the vortex tubes inside the ssl also affects its capability to accurately predict mixing between the excurrent jet containing filtered water and the surrounding flow this will be a major problem when studying flow and transport in channels containing mussel beds where for example accurate prediction of the vertical distribution of the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrients is essential for understanding and quantifying the ecological role of mussels the tke fields in vertical y d 0 fig 22b and horizontal z h 0 5 fig 23 a planes predicted by rans show the turbulent kinetic energy is underpredicted inside the near wake up to x d 2 and then slightly overpredicted for x d 3 compared to des see corresponding simulations in fig 10 also note that the tke legend is different the tke underprediction near the back of the mussel is due to the failure of unsteady rans to capture the formation of the vortex tubes and to predict the formation of energetic eddies in the recirculation region on the other hand unsteady rans predicts a fairly regular antisymmetric vortex shedding in the wake with no symmetric vortex shedding mode present the wake billows are more coherent and they travel for longer distances before losing their coherence compared to des the wake billows generated during the symmetric vortex shedding mode in the des simulations contribute substantially to increasing the tke near the back of the mussel but these vortices rapidly lose their coherence away from the mussel these differences in the wake structure predicted by the two modeling approaches explain the main differences between the tke patterns in fig 10 des and in figs 22b and 23a rans the rans simulations capture the formation of horseshoe vortices and their coherence e g as measured by the circulation of the vortex is close to that observed in the corresponding des simulations however rans underpredicts the amplitude of the oscillatory motions of the horseshoe vortices toward and away from the mussel as a result there is very little amplification of the tke next to the frontal side of the mussel in the rans simulations e g compare tke distributions in figs 10a and 22b the failure of rans to accurately capture the dynamics of the horseshoe vortices also means that it underpredicts the sediment entrainment capacity of the flow around the frontal face of the mussel an important success of rans is its ability to qualitatively capture the main regions of flow upwelling and downwelling on the sides and in the wake of the mussel e g compare the vertical velocity distributions in figs 16 and 23b as already discussed these regions are related to the formation of a large streamwise oriented base vortex behind the mussel still rans significantly overpredicts the lengths of the main two regions of flow upwelling and downwelling the differences are very high in the θ 0 case where both regions extend past x d 5 in the rans simulation the overprediction of the lengths of these two regions is of the order of 30 50 in the θ 30 case rans predictions of the mean bed shear stress fig 23c are in reasonable agreement with des predictions fig 19a though quantitatively the rans and des predictions are fairly close differences are generally less than 20 on the two sides of the mussel and beneath the ssls larger differences are observed in the near wake these differences are mostly driven by the inability of rans to accurately capture the strength of the upwelling and downwelling motions and the size of the corresponding regions of flow upwelling and downwelling as predicted by des for example in the θ 0 case the size of the region of high mean bed shear stress on the right side of the wake is overpredicted while that on the left side is underpredicted see τ τ 0 distributions in figs 19a and 23c for the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case a similar level of disagreement is observed in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case where rans underpredicts the size of the region of high mean bed shear stress forming on the right side of the wake starting at x d 2 not surprising given the inability of unsteady rans to predict the formation of energetic eddies around the mussel e g vortex tubes near wake eddies and the dynamics of the main horseshoe and wake billow vortices the rms fluctuations of the bed shear stress are significantly under predicted by rans compared to des see figs 19b and 23d in particular rans underpredicts τ r m s τ 0 beneath the horseshoe vortices and at the back of the mussel 0 5 x d 2 close to the y d 0 plane where the unsteadiness is driven by the legs of the vortex tubes similar to observations made for other types of flow past surface mounted bluff bodies the underprediction of τ rms is expected to result in a severe underprediction of the flux of sediment entrained from the bed in unsteady rans simulations see cheng et al 2018 8 summary and conclusions highly unsteady flow hydrographs generally induce fairy rapid changes in the mean flow pattern near the bed of natural channels if such channels contain mussels that are partially burrowed into the substrate some of the mussels may be subject to much larger drag forces and severe local scour during the time periods the mussels need to react e g change their orientation to reduce the angle of attack and increase their level of burrowing to changes in the surrounding flow di maio and corkum 1997 over this critical period mussels are much more likely to be dislocated by the overflow as such the present study focused on the canonical case of an isolated mussel placed on a flat bed channel with fully developed incoming flow the study provided detailed information on how the flow turbulence structure and sediment entrainment mechanisms around an isolated mussel change with increasing angle of attack and how the level of mussel burrowing and active filtering affect flow structure for mussels that are not oriented parallel with the incoming flow present simulations showed that for same level of mussel burrowing and same filtering rate the increase in the angle of attack θ increases the total drag force acting on the exposed part of the mussel s shell and the coherence of the horseshoe vortices and of the vortex tubes shed in the ssl while these effects are somewhat expected given the increase in the degree of bluntness of the mussel and of the amount of incoming flow deflected by the mussel toward its sides and over its top with the angle of attack other effects are less obvious to anticipate as for the case of a mussel aligned with the incoming flow streamwise oriented base vortices of unequal coherence form at the back of a mussel not aligned with the incoming flow the primary base vortex induces strong downwelling on one of its sides and pushes higher streamwise velocity fluid near the bed as a result a large part of the near wake region is characterized by bed shear stresses that are larger than those in the incoming flow this is different from the widely studied case of flow past emerged and submerged cylindrical surface mounted bodies where the bed shear stresses in the near wake are lower than those recorded in regions not affected by the presence of the obstacle this effect is most likely related to the reduction of the cross sectional area toward the top of the partially burrowed mussel and is observed for both low and high angles of attack so fine particulates are unlikely to be able to deposit in the near wake of isolated mussels and some scour may occur even at distances of up to 10 times the length of the partially burrowed mussel measured along its major axis at the bed level results also show that increasing the angle of attack for constant h d and vr increases the strength of the anti symmetric shedding mode in the wake the circulation of the primary base vortex and its capacity to induce downwelling inside the near wake the primary base vortex has a direct effect on the streamwise development of the jet its core becomes more elliptical away from the mussel and the tilting of its main axis is consistent with the direction of rotation of the primary base vortex the mean shear acting on the excurrent siphon jet also increases with increasing angle of attack these effects explain the observed growth of entrainment into the excurrent siphon jet with the angle of attack the fact that mixing between the jet of clearer plankton depleted water and the incoming water rich in phytoplankton is enhanced with increasing angle of attack is potentially relevant for understanding the distribution of phytoplankton concentration in channels containing mussel beds the study of wu et al 2020a has shown that for isolated mussels oriented parallel to the incoming flow the total streamwise drag force acting on the mussel s shell increases as the filtering discharge becomes higher a similar conclusion was reached in the present study for isolated mussels with a relatively large angle of attack so to increase their stability at high flow conditions isolated mussels need to shut off their active filtering moreover for mussels with a large angle of attack shutting down the active filtering decreases the circulation of the primary base vortex and entrainment into the excurrent siphon jet and strengthens the symmetric wake shedding mode at a more general level one of the main research challenges related to conservation of mussel beds in natural streams is to understand how mussel to mussel interactions affect the ability of mussels to withstand dislocation by the overflow particulate transport and their capacity to filter water the present study provides information on the limiting case of flow past an isolated partially burrowed mussel the study also discusses the predictive abilities and limitations of the unsteady rans approach for simulating flow past isolated mussels more complex cases corresponding to flow around clusters of mussels and flow over mussel beds of various mussel densities can be investigated using the present approach based on eddy resolving simulations the effect of mussel to mussel interactions can then be quantified with respect to the limiting cases considered in the present study and some ideas for parametrizing mussel beds in des or rans simulations that do not resolve the

104,though freshwater mussels in rivers tend to be aligned with the flow the angle of attack can increase significantly during periods when the stage and discharge vary rapidly e g floods as the near bed flow changes mussels can experience larger drag forces before they reorient themselves parallel to the flow and or increase their level of burial into the substrate to avoid dislocation the present paper used a previously validated eddy resolving numerical model to study the changes in the structure of the near wake flow horseshoe vortex system drag forces acting on the exposed part of the mussel shell sediment entrainment mechanisms and dilution of the jet of filtered water originating in the excurrent siphon with the increase in the magnitude of the angle of attack θ for an isolated mussel placed in an open channel with incoming fully developed turbulent flow given that the mussel may modify its mean volumetric discharge through the two siphons and level of mussel burial as θ changes simulations are performed with and without active filtering and with two heights of the exposed part of the mussel h the raise in θ increases the total drag force acting on the exposed part of the shell the entrainment into the excurrent siphon jet containing filtered water the circulation of the horseshoe vortices the strength of the anti symmetric wake shedding mode and the circulation of the main streamwise oriented base vortex forming behind the mussel results show that for all angles of attack the downflow induced by the primary base vortex generates a large region where the bed shear stresses are strongly amplified so particulate deposition is expected to be low and significant local scour may occur in the near wake of a partially burrowed mussel keywords freshwater mussels active filtering numerical simulations horseshoe vortex 1 introduction freshwater mussels play an important role in sand bed and gravel bed rivers they provide spawning and hiding habitat for fish and insects increase the dissolved oxygen concentration in the soil substrate enhance the stability of the river bed consume plankton increase water clarity and purify water through their filtering activity guttierez et al 2003 lohrer et al 2004 van duren et al 2006 vaugh et al 2008 allen and vaughn 2009 polvi and sarneel 2018 nutrients are acquired by the mussel from the water taken in through the incurrent siphon that is then filtered the filtered clean water leaving the mussel through its excurrent siphon is characterized by very low levels of nutrients and phytoplankton fine suspended matter and waste compared to the average levels in the incoming flow nakato et al 2007 understanding the role of large scale turbulence on transport processes affected by the mussels presence is of great importance to protect aquatic ecosystems mossa et al 2018 in rivers with dense mussel beds the total filter feeding rate is comparable to the stream s flow rate strayer et al 1994 as such mussels play an important role in the nitrogen cycle through their consumption of phytoplankton and zooplankton and are important contributors to river biotic resilience and to efforts to increase the sustainability of river ecosystems gardner et al 1995 marion et al 2014 unfortunately freshwater mussels are one of the most imperiled aquatic species in rivers around the world williams et al 1993 strayer et al 2004 enhanced knowledge on the ecological adaptations and hydrodynamic responses of freshwater mussels in river environments at mussel scale river reach habitat scale and basin scale are needed to better guide restoration and conservation efforts of native freshwater mussel populations in natural streams nakato et al 2007 englehardt et al 2004 bletter et al 2010 the availability of favorable habitat depends on the hydrodynamic conditions zigler et al 2008 for example several studies concluded that the lifespan of mussel beds increases significantly in regions where lower shear stresses are induced at high flow conditions e g see layzer and madison 1995 strayer 1999 morales et al 2006 newton et al 2008 such conditions allow more mussels to resist dislocation by the overflow even at flooding conditions favorable hydrodynamic conditions limit the disturbance of the substrate which in turn enhances juvenile mussel recruitment layzer and madison 1995 howard and cuffey 2003 turbulence also affects mussel habitat and the capability of mussels to survive rehmann et al 2003 in particular the study of the physical mechanisms at mussel scale can provide valuable information to characterize 1 the stability of the partially burrowed mussels as a function of their degree of exposure to the flow orientation mussel active siphoning filter feeding rate and the flow conditions in the channel 2 erosion deposition processes near the mussel 3 mixing between the filtered water and the overflow which is relevant to understand nutrient depletion and distribution of plankton around the mussel the study of these processes for an isolated mussel provides a baseline no mussel to mussel interactions case with respect to which the hydrodynamics of flow and transport processes over clusters of mussels and mussel beds can be characterized such data may also serve toward developing simple analytical models for mussel habitat quality at larger scales finally mussel beds in natural streams are generally characterized by large variations in mussel density and isolated mussels can be often observed in some regions of the river bed each mussel has a shell that contains two close to symmetric valves part of the shell is burrowed into the sediment at the bed in between these valves mussels have an incurrent siphon and an excurrent siphon on their posterior side through which they exchange flow with the overflow though the cross sections of the two siphons are not equal the discharge through the incurrent and excurrent siphons are always equal mussels have a muscular foot and can modify their degree of burial into the substrate and orientation with respect to the direction of the overflow allen and vaughn 2009 however these adaptations occur very slowly in general mussels try to align with their major axis parallel to the overflow such that they minimize drag forces nakato et al 2007 bletter et al 2010 however because of the rapid variations of the stage and discharge in the river e g during floods due to operation of dams situated upstream of the region containing mussels the direction of the mean flow velocity can change significantly bletter et al 2010 constantinescu et al 2013 this means that the flow approaching the mussel is not oriented anymore parallel to the main axis of the mussel and this situation can persist for some time together with the increase in the approach flow velocity the increase in the angle of attack leads to an increase of the drag force acting on the exposed part of the shell and is one of the main mechanisms for mussel dislocation from the bed at high flow conditions nakato et al 2007 at the organism scale the flow past the mussel resembles that past a surface mounted body whose degree of bluntness increases with the magnitude of the angle of attack θ large values of the bed shear stress near the mussel can induce local scour and reduce the capability of the mussel to avoid dislocation by the flow on the other hand very low bed shear stress levels favor deposition of fine sediment particles silts clay which destroys mussel habitat strayer 1999 as opposed to the case of infinitively long cylinders of noncircular cross section or cylinders extending over the whole depth of the open channel e g see chang et al 2007a 2011 the effect of the angle of attack was seldom investigated for submerged bottom mounted obstacles of noncircular shape most fundamental studies of such flows focused on the case of submerged circular cylinders cones of circular cross section or semi spheres e g acarlar and smith 1987 savory and toy 1986 1988 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 shamloo et al 2001 park and lee 2004 sumner et al 2004 pattenden et al 2005 studies conducted for pyramids and submerged rectangular cylinders generally considered only one value of the angle of attack okajima 1982 okamoto and uemura 1991 castro et al 2001 martinuzzi and abuomar 2003 martinuzzi 2008 wang and zhou 2009 more recently the flow past a semi ellipsoid that is an idealization of a partially burrowed mussel with no active filtering was investigated by hajimirzaie et al 2012 2013 in their investigations the incoming flow was either aligned with the major axis θ 0 or with the minor axis θ 90 of the base ellipse these studies showed that the coherence e g as measured by the circulation of the various vortices and the dominant shedding frequency in the wake are a function of the orientation of the obstacle relative to the incoming flow direction unfortunately these two studies did not consider intermediate angles of attack in the range that is expected for mussels in natural streams detailed data on flow and turbulence structure and drag forces acting on isolated or small clusters of partially burrowed mussels are available only from few experimental studies such lab investigations were conducted with live mussels dead mussels or a model of the mussel s shell with or without active filtering e g see constantinescu et al 2013 sansom et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 and provided quantitative information e g on mean velocity turbulent kinetic energy reynolds stresses in a limited number of sections another approach to investigate this type of complex and highly three dimensional 3 d turbulent flows is based on simulations that resolve the dynamically important eddies and allow direct estimation of the drag forces and bed shear stresses in the instantaneous and mean flow fields keylock et al 2012 chang et al 2007a such investigations were carried out by constantinescu et al 2013 for a small cluster of semi burrowed non filtering freshwater mussels for an angle of attack θ 90 and by wu et al 2020a for a single mussel oriented parallel to the incoming flow direction θ 0 and 180 with and without active filtering the main focus of the present paper is on understanding how the near bed flow and dynamics of coherent structures around a partially burrowed freshwater mussel lampsilis siliquoidea placed in a channel with a smooth bed are affected by increasing the magnitude of the angle of attack the paper discusses how the wake structure turbulence statistics drag forces acting on the emerged part of the shell sediment entrainment mechanisms and the dilution of the excurrent siphon jet vary with the angle of attack and with the degree of shell exposure for mussels with and without active filtering to facilitate comparison with cases when the mussel is aligned with the incoming flow the result sections are structured in a similar way to those in the companion paper by wu et al 2020a that discusses θ 0 simulations of flow past the same mussel considered in the present study the discussion also highlights similarities and differences with more canonical flows past submerged surface mounted obstacles of idealized shapes 2 numerical model boundary conditions and matrix of simulations the simulations are performed using the detached eddy simulations des module in star ccm the base turbulence model in the present des simulations is the spalart allmaras reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model constantinescu et al 2003 the model switches to large eddy simulation mode away from the solid surfaces the viscous sublayer was resolved in the present simulations which allowed avoiding the use of wall functions the iddes version of des rodi et al 2013 was used the full model equations and coefficients can be found in spalart 2000 and rodi et al 2013 more details on des the basic numerical algorithm and grid generation methodology are given in wu et al 2020a only the main features of the numerical method are reviewed below the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm is used in the finite volume method to solve the discretized navier stokes equations on unstructured cartesian like grids the convection terms in the momentum equations are discretized using the 3rd order muscl scheme while those in the transport equations for the eddy viscosity and the passive scalar are discretized using the second order accurate upwind scheme the second order central scheme is used to discretize the diffusive and the pressure gradient terms the discretized equations are advanced in time using a second order implicit scheme preliminary validation of the numerical methodology using laboratory and field data measurements and applications for complex turbulent open channel flows are discussed by horna munoz and constantinescu 2018 2020 cheng et al 2018 and wu et al 2020b directly relevant for the present study wu et al 2020a showed that numerical predictions of mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of a semi buried mussel aligned with the flow were close to experimental measurements of the same flow sansom 2019 the present set of simulations uses the same gridding methodology and mesh quality controls domain size and mesh density as the simulations discussed by wu et al 2020a to ensure the solutions are grid and domain size independent as discussed in more details by wu et al 2020a the mussel geometry fig 1 in the numerical model is obtained by converting a stereo lithography stl file containing the mussel s shell using autocad the stl file was generated at the suny univ at buffalo using 3 d tomography of a dead mussel sansom 2019 then the two siphons are added and the submerged part of the shell is removed this new file containing the posterior end of the shell is then read into the grid generator of starccm at this stage a short vertical pipe connecting into the excurrent siphon is added and each boundary is tagged fig 1a shows the computational domain for one of the simulations performed with θ 30 the domain is meshed such that the attached boundary layers on the mussel s shell and the channel bottom surfaces are resolved fig 1b shows a sample mesh generated over the no slip surfaces and the two siphons as evident from this figure a finer mesh is used around the mussel s shell in all three directions the average cell size increases at larger distances from the emerged part of the shell the number of the mesh cells in the θ 30 simulations is between 2 and 3 million slightly larger than the meshes used in the θ 0 simulations reported by wu et al 2020a the average cell size in the directions parallel to the surface of the mussel s shell is about 20 wall units close to the mussel at most locations the first grid point in the wall normal direction is situated at less than two wall units from the bed and the mussel s shell at all locations the first grid point off the wall is situated at less than five wall units from the solid surface in the simulations discussed in this paper see table 1 the incoming channel flow velocity was u 0 0 3 m s and the mussel was oriented with its siphons pointing upstream which corresponds to the dominant orientation of the mussels in the field kumar et al 2019 the total height of the mussel was d 0 06 m fig 1d the flow depth was d 0 15 m the length and width of the computational domain were l 0 4 m and b 0 4 m respectively the two θ 0 h d 0 5 simulations h is the height of the exposed part of the mussel see fig 1b in table 1 were already discussed by wu et al 2020a these flow conditions correspond to those in the experiments used to validate the present model wu et al 2020a and are representative of cases where the interactions between the mussel and the free surface are negligible d h 4 see also shamloo et al 2001 hajimirzaie et al 2012 2013 the internal flow inside the mussel shell was not simulated simulations were performed without filtering and with a relatively large value of the volumetric flow rate through the incurrent and excurrent siphons q i q e 8 94 10 6 m3 s corresponding to a filtration velocity ratio vr u e u 0 0 7 where u e is the mean exit velocity in the excurrent siphon to understand the effect of active filtering this value of qe is close to the maximum volumetric flow discharge in unionids reported by price and schiebe 1978 the effect of the angle of attack was investigated for two levels of mussel burial h d 0 5 and h d 0 25 additional θ 0 simulations were performed with the same h d and vr values as in the corresponding θ 30 simulations because the two valves are not exactly identical an additional simulation was performed with θ 30 for the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case table 1 also gives the values of the reynolds numbers reb b w u 0 ν and reh hu0 ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity and bw is the maximum projected width of the exposed part of the mussel in a plane perpendicular to the incoming flow fig 1b and 1c the aspect ratio h b is equal to 0 75 in the h d 0 5 cases and 0 5 in the h d 0 25 cases where b is the maximum width of the exposed part of the mussel fig 1b for cases with a non zero angle of attack the more relevant variable is the modified aspect ratio ar h bw see table 1 and fig 1c the velocity and eddy viscosity on the bottom boundary and on the mussel s shell were set equal to zero both surfaces were treated as smooth walls as the ratio d h was larger than 5 and the channel froude number was smaller than 0 3 in all simulations the free surface deformations are expected to be small shamloo et al 2001 this justifies the use of a symmetry slip boundary condition at free surface the mean velocity was specified at the excurrent siphon pipe inlet this allows the excurrent siphon flow to interact in a natural way with the channel flow the flow discharge q i was specified on the surface corresponding to the incurrent siphon in the vr 0 simulations the pipe was taken out and the velocity was set equal to zero on the surfaces of the two siphons symmetry boundary conditions were used at the lateral boundaries of the computational domain to mimic a case when the mussel is situated far away from the channel s banks the instantaneous velocity flow fields specified at the inlet section were obtained from a precursor eddy resolving simulation of fully developed flow in a straight channel of depth d and width b with mean flow velocity u 0 these flow fields were fed in a time accurate way through the inlet section in the simulations containing the partially burrowed mussel see wu et al 2020a for more details the use of eddy resolving techniques and the presence of realistic turbulent fluctuations in the incoming flow should also enhance the accuracy of mixing predictions chang et al 2007b a convective boundary condition was used at the exit section which is standard treatment for eddy resolving simulations rodi et al 2013 a passive scalar of constant concentration c 0 was introduced into the computational domain through the excurrent siphon the concentration c was set equal to zero at the inlet boundary the values of c at the exit boundary were obtained via extrapolation from the interior of the domain at the other boundaries the gradient of c in the direction perpendicular to each boundary surface was set equal to zero 3 coherent structures and their effect on the mean flow and turbulence 3 1 large scale turbulence generated near the mussel the q criterion is used in fig 2 to visualize the large scale coherent structures forming around the mussel this criterion locates regions where rotation dominates strain in the flow and is one of the most used criteria to identify and visualize coherent structures in laminar and turbulent flows rodi et al 2013 the large scale turbulent structures generated by the interaction between the incoming flow and the emerged part of the mussel are qualitatively similar in the θ 0 and the θ 30 simulations in all cases a system of horseshoe vortices is generated around the upstream edge of the mussel s shell near the junction line with the channel bed fig 2 while in the θ 0 cases the necklace vortices were characterized by similar levels of coherence e g in terms of circulation of their core and length of their legs on both sides of the shell defined with respect to the major axis of the mussel in the θ 30 cases the horseshoe vortices are more coherent on the side of the mussel that is directly exposed to the incoming flow left side with respect to the incoming flow direction in fig 2 in fact these vortices do not extend over the right side of the mussel if the level of mussel burial is sufficiently high e g see the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case in fig 2 this is because the region where the interaction of the incoming flow with the frontal part of the mussel generates large adverse pressure gradients moves toward the left side of the mussel with increasing θ moreover for sufficiently high θ the projected mussel area in a plane perpendicular to the incoming flow also increases with respect to cases with θ 0 the increase in the projected area generates larger pressures over the frontal part of the mussel and larger adverse pressure gradients around the exposed part of the mussel s shell and explains the overall increase in the coherence of the horseshoe vortices with the angle of attack for constant vr and h d e g compare mean pressure distribution close to the frontal part of the mussel in fig 3 and vorticity distribution inside the horseshoe vortex system in fig 4 for the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases for example for h d 0 5 the total mean flow circulation of the horseshoe vortices in the y d 0 plane is by about 25 larger in the two θ 30 simulations compared to the θ 0 simulation on the other hand the pressure distribution around the frontal part of the mussel varies little with vr for constant h d and angle of attack fig 3 which explains why the position size and circulation of the horseshoe vortices are very close in the θ 30 h d 0 5 simulations with vr 0 and vr 0 7 similar to what was observed in the θ 0 cases with a relatively low level of mussel burrowing e g for cases with h d 0 5 the horseshoe vortex system in the θ 30 cases contains two main vortices that follow a quasi regular cycle during which a newly shed horseshoe vortex merges with the primary vortex situated closer to the mussel the two vortices can also be observed in the vorticity fields shown in fig 4 for the h d 0 5 θ 30 simulations the dynamics of the horseshoe vortices during the oscillatory cycle is similar to the one characterizing the amalgamation regime of a laminar horseshoe vortex system kirkil and constantinescu 2012 a direct result of these quasi regular oscillations is the presence of two regions of high pressure root mean square rms fluctuations inside the horseshoe vortex system in the h d 0 5 cases see fig 5 the same figure shows that increasing the angle of attack from 0 to 30 results in an amplification of the pressure rms fluctuations inside the horseshoe vortex region of the order of 50 for constant vr the strouhal number sth fhbw u0 fh is the frequency of the oscillatory cycle increases with θ for example in the h d 0 5 simulations st h 0 19 in the θ 0 cases st h 0 21 in the θ 30 cases and st h 0 26 in the θ 30 case the unequal st h values in the θ 30 and the θ 30 simulations are explained by the asymmetry of the mussel s shell with respect to its major axis for relatively high levels of mussel burrowing e g for cases with h d 0 25 the horseshoe vortices are quasi steady therefore no sth value is reported in table 1 for cases with h d 0 25 still the legs of some of these vortices can undergo large scale motions as they interact with the vortex tubes shed in the separated shear layer ssl originating around the edge of the mussel s shell in all the θ 30 cases with h d 0 5 an instability develops along the legs of the main horseshoe vortex as it interacts with the vortex tubes shed in the ssl this instability results in the formation of a train of hairpin like vortices fig 2 though such hairpin vortices were also observed in some of the θ 0 h d 0 5 simulations the coherence and size of these vortical structures is increasing sharply with θ e g compare the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases in fig 2 the other main type of coherent structures generated close to the mussel are hairpin like wake vortices that scale with the height of the emerged part of the mussel most of these hairpins start as u shaped vortex tubes inside the ssl for all values of θ the heads of most of these vortex tubes tilt toward the downstream direction while interacting with the neighboring vortex tubes as the head of each vortex tube is situated in a region of relatively high mean streamwise velocity the legs of the vortex tubes are severely stretched and reduce their inclination with respect to the channel bottom as the head moves faster downstream this is the main mechanism that results in the generation of hairpin like vortices in the near wake additional hairpin vortices form when the excurrent siphon jet is strong enough e g in the vr 0 7 simulations such that hairpins are generated on its upstream side near the excurrent siphon as the jet direction changes from vertical to streamwise these vortices have a similar mechanism of formation to the hairpins present in the canonical case of a jet in crossflow with vr close to unity e g see sau and mahesh 2008 the energetic eddies inside the core of the jet and the hairpin vortices generated near the excurrent siphon interact and further disturb the vortex tubes shed in the ssl and the hairpin like wake vortices these interactions may result in a vortex tube being cut into two halves e g such an example is visible in fig 2 for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case which as will be discussed later further weakens the symmetric wake shedding mode especially for cases with a high angle of attack moreover the smaller hairpin vortices generated near the excurrent siphon sometimes merge with the heads of the hairpins generated by the stretching of the vortex tubes in other cases the main effect of the interaction between the two types of hairpins is the severe tilt of one of these vortices toward one side of the near wake such interactions further complicate the eddy structure of the near wake and may strongly disturb of one of the legs of the main horseshoe vortex e g see h d 0 5 cases in fig 2 interestingly the increase of the angle of attack does not result in a significant tilt of the plane defined by the legs of each vortex tube with respect to x constant planes meaning the streamwise location of both legs is comparable in the formation region e g see left frames in fig 6 this is possible because the ssl is longer on the side of the mussel that deflect less of the incoming flow approaching the mussel e g right side for the θ 30 cases this feature of the ssl is particularly evident in the vr 0 cases where the excurrent siphon jet is not present and the vortex tubes are less disturbed by the surrounding turbulent eddies wu et al 2020a observed an increase of the angle between the vertical ssl and the horizontal with increasing vr for mussels aligned with the incoming flow such an effect is also observed for cases with a high angle of attack for example comparison of the vorticity distributions in fig 4 for the θ 30 h d 0 5 cases with vr 0 and vr 0 7 shows not only an increase of the elevation at which the heads of the vortex tubes are advected inside the ssl but also a strong decrease of the distance from the separation line on the mussel shell needed for the kelvin helmholtz instabilities to generate a well defined vortex tube in the y d 0 plane shown in fig 4 the separation line is situated close to x d 0 in the two θ 30 h d 0 5 cases the first vortex tube inside the vertical ssl is present close to x d 0 5 in the simulation with vr 0 7 and close to x d 0 9 in the simulation with vr 0 this effect is consistent with the distributions of the pressure rms fluctuations in fig 5 that show that the region of high turbulence amplification associated with the vertical ssl penetrates closer to the mussel in the vr 0 7 simulation 0 4 x d 1 2 compared to the corresponding vr 0 simulation 0 7 x d 1 4 increasing the magnitude of the angle of attack while keeping vr and h d unchanged increases the coherence of the vortex tubes fig 4 which explains the higher values of the pressure rms fluctuations inside the vertical ssl as θ increases from 0 to 30 in the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 simulations fig 5 the streamwise distance over which most of the hairpins heads maintain their coherence also increases with increasing angle of attack which has a direct effect on the turbulence kinetic energy tke and pressure rms fluctuations levels in the near wake this is the case for both low h d 0 5 and high h d 0 25 levels of mussel burrowing an increase of vr for constant θ and h d results in the generation of more energetic eddies inside the recirculation region forming at the back of the mussel fig 4 and explains the large increase of the pressure rms fluctuations behind the mussel 0 7 x d 1 2 z d 0 3 observed in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 vr 0 case fig 5 3 2 wake vortex shedding as for the case of a submerged surface mounted cylindrical obstacles of regular shape e g submerged cylinder the interaction between the horizontal ssls may lead to the formation of counter rotating billow vortices that generate a wake containing vortices in a staggered out of phase arrangement similar to the von karman vortex street observed past long cylinders this wake structure corresponds to cases where the anti symmetric shedding mode dominates in the wake of bluff bodies cases when the counter rotating wake vortices are arranged in a non staggered in phase pattern correspond to wakes where the symmetric shedding mode dominates typically this occurs for cases where the interactions between the ssls on the two sides of the bluff body are impeded for both solid and porous submerged cylinders the anti symmetric wake shedding mode is much weaker compared to the case when the same cylinder is emerged due to the flow that moves over the top face of the submerged cylinders and then penetrates in between the two horizontal ssls chang et al 2020 in the case of partially burrowed mussels aligned with the incoming flow wu et al 2020a observed that the antisymmetric wake shedding mode coexists with the symmetric shedding mode regardless of the presence or not of active filtering fig 6a besides the afore mentioned mechanism for weakening of the antisymmetric wake shedding mode wu et al 2020a found that the quasi symmetrical oscillations of the legs of the horseshoe vortices with respect to the mussel impede the natural movement of one ssl toward the other ssl which weakens the antisymmetric wake shedding mode the formation of counter rotating vortices at the back of mussels oriented parallel to the incoming flow was also found to weaken the anti symmetric wake shedding mode moreover the symmetric shedding mode was always present and co existed with the antisymmetric shedding mode e g see fig 6a for the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case still analysis of the velocity power spectra showed that the antisymmetric wake shedding mode was the dominant one in all the θ 0 simulations conducted with different vr and h d the instantaneous vertical vorticity distributions in a horizontal plane situated at mid distance between the bed and the top of the mussel shown in fig 6b d illustrate the two wake shedding modes for cases where the angle of attack is θ 30 present simulations show that for high angles of attack the two wake shedding modes co exist but the percentage of time when each mode is present is generally different for the two modes the percentage of time each mode is present was calculated based on the instantaneous flow fields collected over about 10 s after the flow becomes statistically steady the frames are equally spaced in time the sum of the two numbers is less than 100 because in some frames the wake flow transitions between the two modes and it is not clear if the first two three wake billows on each side of the mussel are in phase or out of phase e g by a streamwise distance larger than the mean diameter of the corresponding billows analysis of successive instantaneous flow fields where one vortex shedding modes is present also allows identifying the average time interval between successive billows formation on one side of the mussel and thus the corresponding shedding frequency in the velocity power spectra that is associated with that mode the velocity power spectra in fig 7 allow to quantitatively evaluate the effect of increasing the angle of attack from 0 to 30 and then varying the active filtering rate and the level of mussel burrowing on the relative strengths of the symmetric and antisymmetric wake shedding modes and the associated nondimensional shedding frequencies st s and st a st fb w u 0 where f is the dimensional shedding frequency of wake billows when the wake near the mussel contains in phase billows or out of phase billows both frequencies are indicated using arrows in the velocity spectra shown in fig 7 in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case the most energetic frequency in the wake st w sta 0 39 corresponds to the antisymmetric mode fig 7a the symmetric mode frequency st s 0 2 is about half the one associated with the antisymmetric mode meanwhile the antisymmetric mode is present in about 60 of the analyzed series of successive flow fields while the symmetric mode is present in about 35 of the same series of flow fields the other energetic frequencies in fig 7a st 0 59 0 78 and 1 55 correspond to the advection of vortex tubes in the upstream part of the ssls some of these vortex tubes increase their size and circulation via vortex pairing the main effect of increasing the angle of attack to 30 is the amplification of the energy associated with the anti symmetric and symmetric vortex shedding modes fig 7a b meanwhile the percentage of time the antisymmetric mode is observed increases to about 75 while that one associated with the symmetric mode decreases to slightly over 20 the increase in the energy of the antisymmetric shedding mode is accompanied by a slight reduction of st a from 0 39 to 0 36 the increase of the projected area of the mussel of the streamwise velocity acceleration on the sides of the mussel and of the spanwise distance between the two horizontal ssls with increasing angle of attack favors the formation of higher circulation wake vortices e g see billow forming on the left side of the mussel in the right panel of fig 6b though at times symmetric shedding of vortex tubes is observed inside the downstream part of the two ssls see left panel of fig 6b the symmetric wake shedding mode is relatively weak sts 0 12 fig 7b the most energetic frequency associated with the passage of the vortex tubes also increases with the angle of attack e g st 1 07 for θ 30 compared to st 0 59 for θ 0 comparison of the θ 30 h d 0 5 cases with vr 0 7 fig 7b and vr 0 fig 7c allows understanding the effect of active filtering on wake shedding for cases with a high angle of attack the main difference is that the symmetric wake shedding mode e g see left frame in fig 6c becomes the most energetic shedding mode as the filtering rate becomes equal to zero also the percentage of time the two modes are observed is approximatively equal in the vr 0 case as this happens the primary ssl interactions are between the two legs of the same vortex tube the two associated counter rotating vortices travel for a relatively large distance before they start being stretched by the surrounding eddies e g see left frame in fig 6c where three pairs of such vortices are observed for vr 0 the dominant frequencies associated with the symmetric and antisymmetric wake shedding modes are st w st s 0 31 and st a 0 64 respectively fig 7c qualitatively this effect is similar to what was observed in the θ 0 cases where the energy of the anti symmetric shedding mode was also found to decrease with decreasing vr wu et al 2020a still in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 simulation the antisymmetric wake shedding mode remained slightly more energetic than the symmetric wake shedding mode for cases with significant active filtering and large angles of attack the antisymmetric wake shedding mode remains the dominant shedding mode as h d decreases beneath 0 5 but the difference in the energy associated with the two modes decays with decreasing h d in the θ 30 vr 0 7 simulations fig 7b and 7d the decrease of h d from 0 5 to 0 25 resulted in a decrease of the energy of the dominant frequency associated with the antisymmetric wake shedding mode but did not affect the value of the shedding frequency st w st a 0 36 as for the other cases with significant active filtering st s 0 2 st a in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 simulation the effect of decreasing h d from 0 5 to 0 25 was to increase the percentage of time when the symmetric shedding mode is observed from 20 to about 40 3 3 effect of wake shedding on the recirculation region and turbulence amplification in the near wake as the flow moves past the mussel and it separates a region containing fluid moving slowly toward the back of the mussel forms e g see 2 d streamline patterns in fig 5 and region with u u 0 0 in fig 8 in some cases e g see the θ 30 h d 0 5 cases in fig 5 a recirculation eddy forms in vertical planes inside the region bounded by the ssl and the bed see also fig 1d its maximum length may occur away from the channel bed this region is the equivalent of the mean flow reattachment bubble forming in flows past surface mounted cylindrical obstacles e g submerged circular cylinders its size scales with the height of the obstacle e g compare the θ 30 h d 0 5 simulation results for h d 0 5 and h d 0 25 in fig 8 for constant θ and h d the size of the region where fluid is moving toward the back of the mussel increases with increasing vr fig 8 as shown in figs 8 and 9 increasing the angle of attack results in a growth of the streamwise length of the region of upstream moving fluid xr this length is measured with respect to the center of the mussel fig 1d when nondimensionalized by the height of the exposed part of the mussel the relative increase of x r h is the largest 50 for the h d 0 25 cases fig 9 and table 1 for constant vr and h d varying the angle of attack from 30 to 30 has a negligible effect on x r the 2 d streamline patterns in a horizontal plane cutting through the middle of the exposed part of the mussel fig 10 b confirm the increase of x r with θ in horizontal planes situated far from the top of the mussel two recirculating eddies are generally present they correspond to the two legs of the u shaped arch vortex generally observed at the back of submerged obstacles with a sufficiently large height to width ratio pattenden et al 2002 chang et al 2020 the u shaped vortex does not form in the h d 0 25 cases see case with h d 0 25 in fig 10b where it is replaced by a recirculation bubble for the θ 30 cases with h d 0 5 the legs of the u shaped vortex are getting closer to the back of the mussel with increasing vr fig 10b this effect is qualitatively similar to what is observed for the θ 0 cases the primary mechanisms for the tke increase in the near wake region are the vortex tubes and the interactions of the horizontal ssls that generate counter rotating wake billows for constant vr and h d the average circulation of the wake billows increases with θ e g see fig 6a and 6b this explains the larger size and larger tke levels inside the region of high turbulence in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 10 similarly the decrease in the average circulation and size of the wake billows generated by antisymmetric wake shedding with decreasing vr e g see fig 6b and 6c for θ 30 is the main reason for the smaller size and lower tke levels inside the region of high turbulence in the θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 10 a similar effect was observed for the θ 0 simulations wu et al 2020a the effect of decreasing h d for constant vr in the θ 30 simulations is to reduce the size of the main region of high tke e g compare the tke distributions for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 cases in fig 10 this happens because the size of this region scales with h and the projected width of the mussel the effect of varying θ vr and h d on the shear stresses u w and u v is investigated in figs 11 and 12 respectively these components of the reynolds stress tensor are the primary shear stresses in vertical and horizontal planes respectively in the vertical y d 0 plane the main region of positive u w in fig 11 is bordered by the vertical ssl fig 4 its formation is associated with the generation of kelvin helmholtz vortices inside the downstream part of the ssl the variations in the position of the vertical ssl over time and the entrainment of some of these vortices inside the near wake region see also instantaneous vorticity distributions in fig 4 it is only in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case that this region is split into two parts due to the formation of a smaller region of high negative u w near the excurrent jet siphon its formation can be explained by the presence of a recirculation bubble attached to the back of the mussel see 2 d streamlines in fig 4 such a bubble is not present in the θ 30 simulations as vr decreases the vertical ssl becomes more horizontal fig 4 this decreases the width of the main region of high positive u w but at the same time increase its length fig 11 in all simulations a smaller size region of high negative u w forms in between the bed and the main region of high positive u w finally the small region of positive u w observed near the front of the mussel in the θ 30 simulations is induced by the oscillations of the cores of the horseshoe vortices this region is characterized by a large amplification of the turbulence as also observed in the distributions of the pressure rms fluctuations in fig 5 the distributions of u v in the z h 0 5 plane fig 12 are qualitatively similar to those observed in the near wake of 2 d bluff bodies where vortex shedding occurs the two regions of high positive and negative u v correspond to those where wake billows form via merging of kelvin helmholtz vortex tubes shed in each of the two horizontal ssls the largest contribution to these stresses comes when the legs of the vortex tubes advected inside the ssls interact this happens primarily during the time periods when the antisymmetric wake shedding mode is observed for constant vr and h d the increase of the angle of attack from 0 to 30 increases the width of the near wake and thus the total width of the two regions of high u v the coherence of the wake billows also increases with increasing θ which explains the increased length of the same regions in the θ 30 simulations see fig 12 variations in h d and vr do not induce noticeable qualitative changes in the distributions of u v in horizontal planes cutting through the mussel 3 4 streamwise oriented vortices and associated upwelling and downwelling motions besides the u shaped vortex pairs of counter rotating streamwise oriented vortices may form at the back of the mussel in the mean flow fig 13 these eddies advect fluid upwards base vortices or downwards tip vortices in between their cores for example both types of vortices are observed very close to the back of the mussel in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 14 such vortices were also observed to form in flow past idealized shape obstacles that are close to the shape of a partially burrowed mussel e g for half ellipsoids placed on the channel bottom where a pair of symmetric counter rotating vortices form in the mean flow see hajimirzaie et al 2012 for mussels aligned with the incoming flow wu et al 2020a have shown that the dominant streamwise oriented vortices are base vortices and that the slight asymmetry of the right and left valves of the shell resulted in one of these vortices being much weaker than the other one such that only one base vortex is generally present for x d 1 in the θ 0 cases e g see results for the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in figs 13 and 14 where the base vortex situated in the y d 0 region maintains its coherence until the end of the computational domain while the other base vortex loses its coherence by x d 1 the first thing to notice in fig 14 for the θ 30 cases is the presence of a high circulation streamwise oriented vortex in the x d 3 5 and 5 cross sections its direction of rotation is opposite to that of the main base vortex observed in the θ 0 case as for most of the θ 0 cases e g see θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 14 two base vortices are present near the back of the mussel in the θ 30 cases e g see the x d 0 55 cross section in fig 14 the increase of the angle of attack from 0 to 30 acts toward strengthening the coherence of the base vortex on the right side of the mussel which is the only base vortex observed in the x d 2 cross sections for example this vortex is visualized in fig 13 using the q criterion for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case one should also mention that for θ 30 the direction of rotation of the main base vortex is the same as that of the main base vortex in the θ 0 cases in the θ 0 cases with a relatively low h d the shape of the emerged part of the mussel s shell becomes close to symmetrical and the coherence of the base vortices remains comparable at large distances from the back of the mussel wu et al 2020a as the angle of attack increases the wake flow loses its symmetry even for small h d this is why similar to the corresponding cases with a higher h d only one streamwise oriented vortex is observed at large distances from the back of the mussel in the θ 30 h d 0 25 cases figs 13 and 14 fig 15 allows to quantitatively estimate the effect of modifying θ vr and h d on the total circulation magnitude of the streamwise oriented base vortices γt the constant u0d is used to nondimensionalize the circulation the circulation is obtained by integrating the out of plane vorticity inside the patches associated with the base vortices in fig 14 a treshold value of 0 1u0d was used to define the boundary of the core of each base vortex based on the mean streamwise vorticity distributions for the θ 30 cases with same h d the total circulation magnitude increases with vr which shows that active filtering affects the coherence of the base vortices for constant vr the total circulation decreases with decreasing h d similar to what was observed for the θ 0 cases interestingly increasing the magnitude of the angle of attack while keeping h d and vr constant does not result in a significant increase of γt away from the mussel e g compare results for cases θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 in fig 15 this effect is atrributed to the fairly large asymmetry generated in the wake of mussels alligned with the flow for relatively high h d the main effect of the presence of strongly coherent streamwise oriented vortices behind the mussel is the generation of flow upwelling and downwelling regions inside the near wake of particular importance are the downwelling regions forming on the side of the vortex core where higher streamwise velocity fluid is advected toward the bed surface which increases the bed shear stress and may generate scour such upwelling and downwelling motions are a general characteristic of flow past submerged and emerged obstacles these motions are generally stronger for submerged obstacles compared to emerged ones this effect is due to the part of the incoming flow moving over the submerged obstacle e g see discussion in chang et al 2020 of the near wake structure past emerged and submerged circular cylinders however for obstacles whose shape is symmetric with respect to the direction of the incoming flow e g ellipsoids circular cylinders the two base or tip vortices are weaker and their circulation magnitude decays faster with the distance from the obstacle compared to the cases analyzed here if one assumes the height and maximum width of the obstacle are the same as those of the partially burrowed mussel as already discussed only one streamwise oriented vortex is generally present at large distances from the mussel as the difference in the circulation of the two vortices growth the stronger vortex gets closer to the bed and the weaker vortex moves away from the bed e g see the x d 0 55 and x d 1 cross sections for the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 cases in fig 14 when base vortices are the only streamwise oriented vortices in the wake of a perfectly symmetric surface mounted obstacle one expects a region of upwelling to form between the cores of the two base vortices and two symmetric regions of flow downwelling to form on the outer sides of their cores close to the obstacle the horizontal ssls are part of the downwelling regions in the case of a mussel aligned with the flow wu et al 2020a found that the two downwelling flow regions are of comparable size and fairly symmetric with respect to the y 0 plane only in the h d 0 25 cases where the shape of the emerged part of the mussel considered in the present study is close to symmetric for h d 0 5 all the θ 0 cases are characterized by the presence of a very large region of downflow on the left side of the mussel e g see the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 16 induced by the primary base vortex as in the θ 30 cases the primary base vortex is the one forming on the opposite side of the mussel the main downwelling region also switches sides and is situated on the right side of the mussel the upwelling region is generally larger and extends further downstream from the back of the mussel in the θ 30 cases compared to the corresponding θ 0 cases for h d 0 5 the size of the downwelling region on the side of the weaker base vortex also increases with increasing angle of attack e g compare the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases in fig 16 varying θ from 0 to 30 in the h d 0 25 simulations increases the size of the main downwelling region and of the upwelling region at the back of the mussel this is somewhat expected given that the two base vortices are of comparable coherence and the sizes of the two downwelling flow regions are close in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case while this is not the case in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case fig 14 for both θ 0 and θ 30 the main effect of reducing vr while keeping h d constant is to decrease the sizes of the downwelling and upwelling flow regions e g compare the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 cases in fig 16 4 drag forces quantifying the effect of varying the angle of attack active filtering and level of mussel burial on the total horizontal drag force is important to understand how the capacity of the mussel to withstand dislocation by the overflow varies with changing conditions in the incoming flow that can trigger a response of the mussel e g increase decrease of its filtering activity increase of its level of burial additionally one of the main issues in flow over a mussel bed is to understand the effect of the mussels on the open channel flow in terms of the additional streamwise drag induced by the mussels this requires quantification of the streamwise drag force and the associated drag coefficient for the mussels in the array of particular interest is to understand how these values are different from the drag coefficient of an isolated mussel assuming the same values of θ vr and h d the present study provides estimates of the streamwise drag coefficient c d x m e a n and its root mean square rms fluctuations c d x r m s for isolated partially burrowed mussels see table 1 the streamwise drag coefficient is estimated as c d x m e a n fdx ρu0 2ax where fdx is the streamwise drag force ρ is the density and a x is the streamwise projected area of the emerged part of the mussel s shell same nondimensionalization is used to estimate c d x r m s using the time series of the streamwise drag coefficient in the instantaneous flow fields on the other hand the capacity of the mussel to avoid dislocation is proportional to the magnitude of the mean horizontal drag force acting on the mussel fdxy the total drag force vector is obtained by integrating the mean pressure fig 17 and mean shear stresses over the exposed part of the shell the variable fdxy in table 1 is the magnitude of the projection of this vector on a horizontal plane fdx and fdy are the projections of the total drag force vector along the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively to allow a direct comparison among the different cases considered in the present study the mean drag force variables are nondimensionalized using a length scale d and a velocity scale u0 that is the same for all cases given the relatively high value of the reynolds number the main contribution to both drag forces is form drag due to the mean pressure forces acting on the emerged part of the shell the pressure distributions in fig 17 allow understanding how changes in θ and vr affect the nondimensioanl drag forces for all cases the largest pressures are induced over the most upstream part of the mussel relative to the incoming flow it is near this region that the decelleration of the incoming flow is the largest fig 3 consistent with bernouli s equation the pressure increases as the flow decelerates and adverse pressure gradients are generated away from the mussel given the slight asymmetry of the two valves of the shell the region of high pressure forming around the lower part of the frontal side of the shell in the θ 0 simulations is pushed slighly toward the right side of the mussel e g see θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 17 in the θ 30 simulations this region is mostly situated on the left side of the mussel consistent with the new orientation of the mussel for the same reasons the spanwise component of the drag force fdy is not negligible in both the θ 0 and the θ 30 simulations table 1 though the formation of a region of low pressure at the back of the mussel is expected one interesting result is that for both the θ 0 and the θ 30 simulations the smallest pressures occur just downstream of the separation line fig 17 for constant vr and h d the main effect of increasing θ from 0 to 30 is to decrease the pressure at the back of the mussel e g compare the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 cases in figs 3 and 17 meanwhile the increase of the pressure inside the frontal region of high pressure values is fairly small this explains the increase of the nondimensional horizontal drag force with the angle of attack in table 1 and fig 18 a the relative increase can be as high as 50 for the h d 0 25 cases for same h d the increase of f d x y with θ is slightly larger for the cases with large active filtering vr 0 7 compared to the corresponding vr 0 cases the main reason for the decay of f d x y with decreasing vr for fixed θ and h d is the pressure increase at the back of the mussel e g see the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 and θ 30 vr 0 h d 0 5 cases in figs 3 and 17 given that the total pressure force acting on the frontal region is very little affected by the variation of vr the effect of lowering vr is to decrease the horizontal drag force acting on the mussel the asymmetry of the two valves of the shell is the main reason why the predicted values of f d x y in the vr 0 7 h d 0 5 simulations with θ 30 are not the same the value predicted for θ 30 is about 25 larger than the one predicted for θ 30 table 1 interestingly the spanwise component of the drag force is significant not only in the simulations with θ 30 but even in the θ 0 simulations conducted with a relatively large height of the exposed part of the mussel h d 0 5 only for h d 0 25 where the degree of asymmetry of the two valves is negligible the spanwise component f d y accounts for only a small percentage of the total drag force in the θ 0 simulations table 1 in the h d 0 5 θ 30 simulations f d y accounts for up to 40 of the total mean drag force results in table 1 for θ 30 also show that the streamwise and the spanwise components of the total drag force increase at about the same rate with increasing vr the effect of increasing the angle of attack from 0 to 30 on c d x m e a n is relatively low fig 18b and table 1 the main reason is that the resultant pressure force acting on the high pressure region at the frontal side of the mussel is not anymore oriented close to parallel to the streamwise direction in the θ 30 cases fig 17 for constant vr and h d c d x m e a n increases slightly with increasing angle of attack the largest increase is observed in the θ 30 and θ 30 cases with vr 0 7 and h d 0 5 fig 18b this shows that for relatively low levels of mussel burrowing active filtering can act toward increasing the streamwise drag for mussels not aligned with the incoming flow vortex shedding in the wake of the mussel is the main reason for the large scale fluctuations observed in the temporal variation of the streamwise drag coefficient the c d x r m s variable characterizes in a quantitative way the intensity of these oscillations results in table 1 show that an increase of θ from 0 to 30 does not necessarily result in an increase of c d x r m s another interesting result is that c d x r m s is less than 6 of c d x m e a n in all the simulations conducted with θ 30 this also means that the capacity of the mussels to avoid dislocation is primarily a function of the mean drag force magnitude 5 bed shear stress distributions local scour developing around the mussel is the second main mechanism that can lead to mussel dislocation from the substrate as large scale coherent structures are present in the bed vicinity e g horseshoe vortices the legs of the vortex tubes in the ssl and large scale hairpins in the near wake the capacity of the flow to erode the bed is a function of both the mean bed shear stress magnitude τ and the temporal variations of the instantaneous bed shear stress with respect to its local mean value the standard deviation of the bed shear stress τ rms is used to characterize in an approximate way the capacity of the coherent structures to induce bed shear stresses that are larger than the mean value and thus the contribution of these structures to enhance sediment entrainment at a certain location sumer et al 2003 kraft et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 given that the near wall flow is resolved the bed shear stress magnitude is estimated as τ ρ u 0 2 1 r e u m u 0 n 1 d where um is the velocity magnitude in a plane parallel to the channel bed situated at a distance n1 from it kirkil and constantinescu 2009 formally the formulas used to estimate τ and τ rms are the same but the square root of the turbulent kinetic energy at the first grid point off the wall replaces um in the definition of τ rms both variables are plotted in nondimensional form in fig 19 the mean bed shear stress in the approach flow τ 0 was used to nondimensionalize τ and τ rms in all the θ 0 and θ 30 cases the peak values of τ τ 0 occur on the two sides of the mussel s shell due to the part of the incoming flow that is diverted laterally as it approaches the mussel these regions of high τ τ 0 generally extend past the end of the mussel where they are bordered by the horizontal ssls as the flow accelerates the bed shear stress increases for same level of mussel burrowing the level of amplification of τ τ 0 inside these regions is proportional to the projected area of the mussel in a plane perpendicular to the incoming flow for same h d the projected area is larger in the θ 30 simulations compared to the corresponding θ 0 simulations consistent with these observations the peak values of τ τ 0 and the size of the regions of high τ τ 0 on the two sides of the mussel are larger in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case fig 19a for θ 30 the decrease of the filtering rate results in an increase of the streamwise length of the two regions of high τ τ 0 on the two sides of the mussel for a constant angle of attack the decrease in h d reduces the projected area and the degree of bluntness of the front side of the mussel that is directly exposed to the incoming flow these are the main reasons why the sizes of the two regions of high mean bed shear stress and the peak values of τ τ 0 inside these regions decrease in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 25 case fig 19a for both values of the angle of attack the region at the back of the mussel situated in between the two horizontal ssls is characterized by low mean bed shear stresses particulate deposition is expected to occur inside this region for same angle of attack and level of mussel burrowing e g compare the two cases with θ 30 and h d 0 5 in fig 19a the reduction of the filtering rate increases the size of this region of low τ τ 0 the main differences between the mean bed shear stress distributions in the θ 0 and θ 30 cases occur in the near wake region for x d 1 for both angles of attack the regions of high values of τ τ 0 are due to downwelling induced by the primary base vortex figs 14 and 16 as already discussed the primary base vortex moves from the left side of the mussel to its right side as θ increases from 0 to 30 this is also why the main region where τ τ 0 1 inside the near wake is situated on the right side of the mussel in all θ 30 cases fig 19a by contrast the same region is situated on the left side of the mussel in the θ 0 cases e g see the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case in fig 19a so even for relatively large angles of attack a large part of the near wake is a region where scour may occur and deposition of particulates is going to be impeded which is different of what is generally observed in the near wake of emerged and submerged cylindrical obstacles e g see kirkil and constantinescu 2015 chang et al 2017 2020 this effect is related to the reduction of the cross sectional area of the mussel with the distance from the bed and to the asymmetry of the mussel s shell with respect to its main axis for constant vr and h d the effect of increasing θ from 0 to 30 is to delay the start of the region of high τ τ 0 downstream of x d 1 e g compare cases with vr 0 7 and h d 0 5 in fig 19a as for the θ 0 cases see wu et al 2020a despite the increase of the coherence circulation of the main base vortex with increasing mussel filtering fig 15 the size of the region of high τ τ 0 1 and the bed shear stress values inside this region are similar in the θ 30 h d 0 5 simulations conducted with different values of vr fig 19a high values of τ r m s τ 0 are observed over the part of the channel bed situated immediately behind the mussel that contains a wide array of turbulent eddies and beneath the region where wake billow vortices form figs 4 6 and 19b for constant h d the effects of varying θ and vr are relatively mild in terms of the size of this region fig 19b a second region of high values of τ r m s τ 0 is present in the simulations where an unsteady horseshoe vortex system forms as for the θ 0 cases this second region is not present in the θ 30 cases with h d 0 25 where the horseshoe vortex system is quasi steady in the θ 0 and θ 30 cases with h d 0 5 this region extends around the front and lateral sides of the mussel situated beneath the horseshoe vortex system fig 19b consistent with the increase in the coherence of the horseshoe vortices with the magnitude of the angle of attack for constant h d and vr see discussion in section 3 1 and compare the region of high pressure rms fluctuations induced by the horseshoe vortices in fig 5 the levels of τ r m s τ 0 beneath the horseshoe vortex system are about 50 larger in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case for both θ 0 and θ 30 cases the effects of varying the mussel filtering discharge on the levels of τ r m s τ 0 inside the bed region situated beneath the horseshoe vortex system are fairly negligible 6 scalar transport while the incurrent siphon draws water rich in phytoplankton and nutrients from the overflow the jet through the excurrent siphon contains negligible amounts of phytoplankton and nutrients monismith et al 1990 haag 2012 in the case of mussel beds the siphoning filtering activity of the mussels results in the formation of a bottom layer of water that has lower concentrations of phytoplankton and nutrients this motivates the need to understand how the main geometrical and flow variables affect mixing between the jet of clearer water and the surrounding flow as opposed to the widely studied case of a jet in cross flow where the jet enters the channel through an opening in the bottom surface e g see mahesh 2013 in the present setup the jet enters the channel at an elevation z h and the approaching flow is a function of the shape of the frontal side of the mussel o riordan et al 1995 moreover as pointed out by wu et al 2020a the jet develops in a region where one or two strongly coherent streamwise oriented vortices are present fig 20 a c these vortices are not induced by the excurrent jet as they are also present in simulations conducted with no active filtering in the present study an inverse concentration method monismith et al 1990 o riordan et al 1993 1995 crimaldi et al 2007 is used to quantify the dynamics of the excurrent siphon jet entrainment and mixing in this approach the concentration of phytoplankton in the incoming flow is represented by a scalar with a concentration c 0 while the clear water is represented by a scalar with concentration c c0 as the initial direction of the jet is vertical the jet centerline raises as the jet flow changes direction and aligns itself with the incoming flow then the jet starts to move slowly toward the channel bottom while mixing with the surrounding faster moving fluid fig 20d illustrates the distribution of the nondimensional concentration c c0 along a streamwise vertical plane cutting through the excurrent jet siphon given that the axis of the jet makes only a small angle with the streamwise direction for x d 1 one can get information on the jet structure and entrainment by analyzing the distributions of c c0 in relevant x d constant cross sections fig 20a c compare several cases with vr 0 7 as the volumetric discharge of the excurrent jet qj0 is the same the concentration distributions are directly comparable among the three cases in all these cases the near wake contains a strongly coherent base vortex as one moves away from the mussel the core of the jet becomes more ellipsoidal and tilts with respect to the vertical in the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case fig 20a the base vortex rotates clockwise while in the other two θ 30 cases fig 20b c the base vortex rotates counter clockwise which explains why the core tilts in opposite directions in the θ 0 and θ 30 cases the streamwise variations of the maximum concentration in the cross section cmax c0 fig 21 a and of the nondimensional volume flux of the jet qj qj0 fig 21b allow characterizing entrainment and ultimately how fast the jet containing clearer filtered water mixes with the surrounding water advected in the channel based on the analysis performed by wu et al 2020a and using the methodology proposed by yuan and street 1998 the jet fluid is defined as the fluid with c cmin where cmin 0 0001c0 results in fig 21 show that for constant vr and h d cmax c0 decreases faster and qj qj0 increases faster with x dj dj is the diameter of the excurent siphon and is a physically more relevant length scale to analyze the spatial development and mixing for jet flows in the θ 30 case compared to the corresponding θ 0 case these results indicate that the increase of θ results in higher entrainment and faster mixing the difference is significant as the volume flux of the excurrent siphon jet at x 36dj 4 5d 9 h is close to 40 larger in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case compared to the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case fig 21b the main reason is the increase of the coherence of the eddies advected in the vertical ssl downstream of the excurrent siphon and of their interactions with eddies generated inside the jet fig 4 the increase of the circulation of the primary base vortex with increasing angle of attack near the back of the mussel fig 15 also contributes to enhancing mixing for the θ 30 cases an increase in the level of mussel burrowing decreases entrainment by the excurrent siphon jet for example the relative decay of qj for x dj 10 in the θ 30 vr 0 7 simulations is of the order of 40 as h d decreases from 0 5 to 0 25 fig 21b such a trend was also observed in the θ 0 cases discussed by wu et al 2020a and is partially due to the increase of the mean shear between the faster moving channel flow and the slower jet flow with increasing h d the mean streamwise velocity in the channel increases with the distance from the bed moreover as h d decreases it takes a smaller distance for the core of the jet to start interacting with the channel bottom which reduces entrainment and mixing on the lower side of the jet 7 predictive capability of unsteady rans to simulate flow and turbulence around isolated mussels given that most practical applications in eco hydraulics are numerically investigated using the rans based simulations it is relevant to discuss the capabilities of this approach to predict flow past isolated mussels especially for practical applications related to mussel bed studies the use of rans is of interest mainly because it is much less expensive compared to large eddy simulation based methods in terms of the required computational resources to assess the predictive capabilities of rans two unsteady time accurate rans simulations were performed for the h d 0 5 vr 0 7 cases with θ 0 and θ 30 the computational domain mesh and physical time step were the same as in the corresponding des simulations the k ω sst model that is one of the most accurate rans models for predicting massively separated flows was employed the time averaged inflow profile calculated based on the instantaneous velocity fields used in the des simulations was specified at the inflow section in the rans simulations a mass outflow boundary condition was implemented at the channel exit the rest of the boundary conditions were identical to those used in des the rans predictions of the horizontal drag force magnitude fdxy ρu0 2d2 0 046 for θ 0 and 0 062 for θ 30 and streamwise drag coefficient cdx mean 0 325 for θ 0 and 0 358 for θ 30 are within 8 of the corresponding des predictions table 1 on the other hand rans severely underpredicts the unsteady oscillations of the drag coefficient cdx rms 0 001 for θ 0 and 0 005 for θ 30 which is expected given that the rans flow fields are depleted of energetic turbulent eddies e g compare instantaneous vorticity distributions for the h d 0 5 vr 0 7 simulations in figs 4 and 22 a the main unsteadiness captured by rans is the one associated with the large scale oscillations of the near wake rans predictions of the dominant shedding frequency in the wake stw 0 37 for θ 0 and 0 36 for θ 30 are fairly accurate however rans incorrectly predicts the anti symmetric wake shedding mode is present at all times which should affect its capability to predict transport and mixing in mussel beds the fact that rans does not resolve the vortex tubes inside the ssl also affects its capability to accurately predict mixing between the excurrent jet containing filtered water and the surrounding flow this will be a major problem when studying flow and transport in channels containing mussel beds where for example accurate prediction of the vertical distribution of the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrients is essential for understanding and quantifying the ecological role of mussels the tke fields in vertical y d 0 fig 22b and horizontal z h 0 5 fig 23 a planes predicted by rans show the turbulent kinetic energy is underpredicted inside the near wake up to x d 2 and then slightly overpredicted for x d 3 compared to des see corresponding simulations in fig 10 also note that the tke legend is different the tke underprediction near the back of the mussel is due to the failure of unsteady rans to capture the formation of the vortex tubes and to predict the formation of energetic eddies in the recirculation region on the other hand unsteady rans predicts a fairly regular antisymmetric vortex shedding in the wake with no symmetric vortex shedding mode present the wake billows are more coherent and they travel for longer distances before losing their coherence compared to des the wake billows generated during the symmetric vortex shedding mode in the des simulations contribute substantially to increasing the tke near the back of the mussel but these vortices rapidly lose their coherence away from the mussel these differences in the wake structure predicted by the two modeling approaches explain the main differences between the tke patterns in fig 10 des and in figs 22b and 23a rans the rans simulations capture the formation of horseshoe vortices and their coherence e g as measured by the circulation of the vortex is close to that observed in the corresponding des simulations however rans underpredicts the amplitude of the oscillatory motions of the horseshoe vortices toward and away from the mussel as a result there is very little amplification of the tke next to the frontal side of the mussel in the rans simulations e g compare tke distributions in figs 10a and 22b the failure of rans to accurately capture the dynamics of the horseshoe vortices also means that it underpredicts the sediment entrainment capacity of the flow around the frontal face of the mussel an important success of rans is its ability to qualitatively capture the main regions of flow upwelling and downwelling on the sides and in the wake of the mussel e g compare the vertical velocity distributions in figs 16 and 23b as already discussed these regions are related to the formation of a large streamwise oriented base vortex behind the mussel still rans significantly overpredicts the lengths of the main two regions of flow upwelling and downwelling the differences are very high in the θ 0 case where both regions extend past x d 5 in the rans simulation the overprediction of the lengths of these two regions is of the order of 30 50 in the θ 30 case rans predictions of the mean bed shear stress fig 23c are in reasonable agreement with des predictions fig 19a though quantitatively the rans and des predictions are fairly close differences are generally less than 20 on the two sides of the mussel and beneath the ssls larger differences are observed in the near wake these differences are mostly driven by the inability of rans to accurately capture the strength of the upwelling and downwelling motions and the size of the corresponding regions of flow upwelling and downwelling as predicted by des for example in the θ 0 case the size of the region of high mean bed shear stress on the right side of the wake is overpredicted while that on the left side is underpredicted see τ τ 0 distributions in figs 19a and 23c for the θ 0 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case a similar level of disagreement is observed in the θ 30 vr 0 7 h d 0 5 case where rans underpredicts the size of the region of high mean bed shear stress forming on the right side of the wake starting at x d 2 not surprising given the inability of unsteady rans to predict the formation of energetic eddies around the mussel e g vortex tubes near wake eddies and the dynamics of the main horseshoe and wake billow vortices the rms fluctuations of the bed shear stress are significantly under predicted by rans compared to des see figs 19b and 23d in particular rans underpredicts τ r m s τ 0 beneath the horseshoe vortices and at the back of the mussel 0 5 x d 2 close to the y d 0 plane where the unsteadiness is driven by the legs of the vortex tubes similar to observations made for other types of flow past surface mounted bluff bodies the underprediction of τ rms is expected to result in a severe underprediction of the flux of sediment entrained from the bed in unsteady rans simulations see cheng et al 2018 8 summary and conclusions highly unsteady flow hydrographs generally induce fairy rapid changes in the mean flow pattern near the bed of natural channels if such channels contain mussels that are partially burrowed into the substrate some of the mussels may be subject to much larger drag forces and severe local scour during the time periods the mussels need to react e g change their orientation to reduce the angle of attack and increase their level of burrowing to changes in the surrounding flow di maio and corkum 1997 over this critical period mussels are much more likely to be dislocated by the overflow as such the present study focused on the canonical case of an isolated mussel placed on a flat bed channel with fully developed incoming flow the study provided detailed information on how the flow turbulence structure and sediment entrainment mechanisms around an isolated mussel change with increasing angle of attack and how the level of mussel burrowing and active filtering affect flow structure for mussels that are not oriented parallel with the incoming flow present simulations showed that for same level of mussel burrowing and same filtering rate the increase in the angle of attack θ increases the total drag force acting on the exposed part of the mussel s shell and the coherence of the horseshoe vortices and of the vortex tubes shed in the ssl while these effects are somewhat expected given the increase in the degree of bluntness of the mussel and of the amount of incoming flow deflected by the mussel toward its sides and over its top with the angle of attack other effects are less obvious to anticipate as for the case of a mussel aligned with the incoming flow streamwise oriented base vortices of unequal coherence form at the back of a mussel not aligned with the incoming flow the primary base vortex induces strong downwelling on one of its sides and pushes higher streamwise velocity fluid near the bed as a result a large part of the near wake region is characterized by bed shear stresses that are larger than those in the incoming flow this is different from the widely studied case of flow past emerged and submerged cylindrical surface mounted bodies where the bed shear stresses in the near wake are lower than those recorded in regions not affected by the presence of the obstacle this effect is most likely related to the reduction of the cross sectional area toward the top of the partially burrowed mussel and is observed for both low and high angles of attack so fine particulates are unlikely to be able to deposit in the near wake of isolated mussels and some scour may occur even at distances of up to 10 times the length of the partially burrowed mussel measured along its major axis at the bed level results also show that increasing the angle of attack for constant h d and vr increases the strength of the anti symmetric shedding mode in the wake the circulation of the primary base vortex and its capacity to induce downwelling inside the near wake the primary base vortex has a direct effect on the streamwise development of the jet its core becomes more elliptical away from the mussel and the tilting of its main axis is consistent with the direction of rotation of the primary base vortex the mean shear acting on the excurrent siphon jet also increases with increasing angle of attack these effects explain the observed growth of entrainment into the excurrent siphon jet with the angle of attack the fact that mixing between the jet of clearer plankton depleted water and the incoming water rich in phytoplankton is enhanced with increasing angle of attack is potentially relevant for understanding the distribution of phytoplankton concentration in channels containing mussel beds the study of wu et al 2020a has shown that for isolated mussels oriented parallel to the incoming flow the total streamwise drag force acting on the mussel s shell increases as the filtering discharge becomes higher a similar conclusion was reached in the present study for isolated mussels with a relatively large angle of attack so to increase their stability at high flow conditions isolated mussels need to shut off their active filtering moreover for mussels with a large angle of attack shutting down the active filtering decreases the circulation of the primary base vortex and entrainment into the excurrent siphon jet and strengthens the symmetric wake shedding mode at a more general level one of the main research challenges related to conservation of mussel beds in natural streams is to understand how mussel to mussel interactions affect the ability of mussels to withstand dislocation by the overflow particulate transport and their capacity to filter water the present study provides information on the limiting case of flow past an isolated partially burrowed mussel the study also discusses the predictive abilities and limitations of the unsteady rans approach for simulating flow past isolated mussels more complex cases corresponding to flow around clusters of mussels and flow over mussel beds of various mussel densities can be investigated using the present approach based on eddy resolving simulations the effect of mussel to mussel interactions can then be quantified with respect to the limiting cases considered in the present study and some ideas for parametrizing mussel beds in des or rans simulations that do not resolve the
