min results showed that the concentration of oil olo and water had remarkable impact on globular size and viscosity of nanoemulsions moreover percent removal efficiency of cla from a bulk aqueous solution was influenced with the content of water oa globular size and viscosity of nanoemulsions the formulation cnf5 comprised of 15 w w of water 48 w w of smix and 37 w w of olo was selected as an efficient green nanoemulsion to eliminate cla from a bulk aqueous solution the cnf5 had the lowest globular size 26 0 nm minimum polydispersity index 0 119 optimum viscosity 94 2 cp and the highest re

with obvious benefits such as simple economic rapid and scalable for large scale plant keywords clarithromycin green nanoemulsion thermodynamic stability liquid liquid adsorptive efficiency bulk aqueous solution 1 introduction wastewater effluents disposed from pharma industry textile industry and hospitals contain various toxic and harmful pharmaceutical products synthetic and semi synthetics dyes and drugs known to pollute environmental ecological system aquatic particularly pharmaceutical drugs as hospital effluent are main environmental risk such as clarithromycin ciprofloxacin and azithromycin 1 even trace concentration from ng l to μg l in waste water effluents and surface drinking water has been well documented in the literature in last decade for causing short term and long term toxicity to aquatic lives 2 7 these contaminants as alone or combined may persist unaltered for long time in the environment to cause chronic toxicity eco toxicity drug resistance and health issues 8 11 annually a few thousand tons of antimicrobial pharmaceutical products and their transformed forms have been estimated to be introduced to the aquatic system specially surface water ground eater and even drinking water through various pathways point and non point sources 12 14 notably wastewater treatment plants wwtps are often identified as the main source of point pollution of antimicrobial agents due to inefficiency unable to eliminate completely and conventional methods detected in treated wastewater adopted 15 16 moreover these pollutants may predominantly undergo transformation biological degradation sorption onto the activated sludge and precipitation depending on the types of technology used and nature physical chemical and biological properties of the antimicrobials 17 conventional methods conventional activated sludge cas and membrane bioreactor mbr failed to remove complete residual antibiotics from the wastewater effluent sewage and drinking water 5 6 10 18 european commission eu has established a watch list of antimicrobials possessing serious threat in water pollution as per water policy watch list is verified and reviewed every two years three main macrolides azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin aces were included in the first watch list in 2015 which remained included in the second watch list of 2018 with addition of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin 19 20 it means cla may pose a serious risk at union level through aquatic system and monitoring data are insufficient to conclude a tangible risk moreover occurrence of cla in the aquatic environment 58 8 from 2792 samples of surface water in european counties generated a potential risk to human and aquatic lives 21 cla fig 1 a is extremely poor soluble in water 0 33 mg l and possessing high log p value 3 suitable for sorption based wastewater treatment 22 cla concentration in surface water was reported as 75 91 ng l whereas this value was 8 460 ng l in treated wastewater 23 25 considering these context it is important to remove cla from aqueous or industrial wastewater solid liquid adsorption method is frequently used for wastewater treatment amongst conventional methods physical chemical and biological despite several limitations low adsorption efficiency 26 28 so it was required to develop a simple economic efficient and scalable to remove cla from wastewater or industrial effluents or aqueous bulk several authors reported to remove organic pollutants using liquid liquid adsorption approach due to various benefits 29 30 no report has been published to remove cla using green nanoemulsion environmentally benign so far green nanoemulsion or microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable isotropic mixture comprised of green lipid surfactant co surfactant and water such isotropic stable systems are simple to prepare economic scalable at industrial level and excellent solubilizing and extraction capacity 29 in this present study water ethanol triton x 100 olive oil nanoemulsions were prepared to remove cla from its bulk aqueous solution for the first time through liquid liquid adsorption green and pharmaceutically acceptable

and cremophor el solubility study was carried out using water bath shaker remi equipment pvt ltd mumbai india set at 25 c for 24 h the drug was added till saturation after completion of 24 h the samples were ultracentrifuged beckman counlter life scinces optim max xp indiana usa and the supernatant was used to estimate the drug content dissolved using validated uplc method experiments were performed in triplicate for mean values 2 4 preparation of nanoemulsion and ternary phase diagram construction various w o nanoemulsions were prepared using water ethanol tx and olo as aqueous component surfactant co surfactant and organic phase respectively following slow and spontaneous emulsification method 29 tx surfactant and ethanol cosurfactant were completely blended to get homogeneous mixture as smix ratio in the mass ratios of 2 1 1 2 1 1 and 1 3 in order to construct the pseudo ternary phase diagrams ptds the aqueous phase and a particular smix ratio were properly blended at the mass ratio from 1 9 to 9 1 then these mixed blends were titrated slowly with the addition of oil phase olo stable transparent and isotropic nanoemulsions were identified in the phase diagrams and considered for further evaluations the composition of the nanoemulsions were selected the phase diagrams and presented in the table 1 nanoemulsions exhibiting any signs of physical instability phase separation creaming gelling and viscous were removed from the study 2 5 characterizations of developed nanoemulsions several water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsions were fabricated cnf1 cnf5 as dictated by ptds these nanoemulsions were evaluated for thermodynamic stability at different temperature followed by centrifugation centrifugation heating cooling cycles and freeze thaw cycles 29 30 particle size and size distribution polydispersity index and zeta potential were estimated using zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments worcestershire uk in case of globular size analysis the samples were diluted with distilled water however zeta potential values were measured without dilution viscosity and refractive index ri were determined using a bohlin viscometer equipped with coaxial cone and plate bohlin visco 88 malvern uk and an abbe type refractometer bausch and lomb optical company rochester ny without dilution respectively experiments were repeated to get mean values 2 6 preparation of stock solution for calibration cla is a sparingly water soluble molecule 0 33 mg l at room temperature 32 moreover the drug is reported to be soluble in olive oil 5 mg ml which was similar to our finding 32 maximum solubility was observed in dmso 32 mg ml therefore dmso was added 5 in aqueous medium to prepare a stock solution 100 ppm a serial dilution was made from the stock solution of cla to achieve concentration range of 2 40 ppm the content was estimated using validated uplc method at 210 nm 33 the analytical method was observed to be linear at explored concentration range as evidenced with correlation coefficient value r 2 of 0 999 2 7 cla elimination from aqueous solution an adsorption experiment in order to eliminate cla from an aqueous solution an adsorption experiment was conducted by dispersing a precisely weighed content of nanoemulsion 1 g in large volume 10 ml of stock solution 100 ppm each nanoemulsion cla solution mixture was properly mixed vortexed for 10 min and then kept aside at 25 1 c each mixture nanoemulsion and stock solution mixture was exposed for varied time points 10 min 30 min and 60 min then the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min to separate out the supernatant the supernatant was used to estimate the content of cla using uplc thus the concentration qt in ppm g at time t of cla adsorbed on to the surface nanoemulsion at time t 10 30 and 60 min was calculated from the eq 1 1 qt co ct m v moreover the percent cla removal efficiency re was calculated from eq 2 as below 2 re removal efficiency co ct co 100 where co and ct represent the initial concentration of cla and the concentration of cla at time t in ppm respectively v and m are the volume of the stock solution taken ml and the mass of the nanoemulsion in g respectively 31 2 8 morphological assessment of nanoemulsions using electron microscopy morphological investigation of the untreated green nanoemulsion and exposed nanoemulsion with the aqueous solution stock solution containing cla was performed this was carried out using a transmission electron microscopy tem tecnail 2 120 kv fei company eindhoven netherlands a drop of the sample was placed on a carbon film coated copper grid and the excess sample was removed using a filter paper the sample was stained with a negative staining agent 2 w v of phosphotungstic acid the samples were air dried before scanning at ambient temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 solubility of cla in various excipients the result of the drug solubility is presented in fig 1b the solubility values were found as 1 5 0 074 8 5 0 425 0 8 0 03 0 9 0 05 1 3 0 06 6 9 0 34 3 6 0 18 and 42 3 1 2 mg ml in ethanol tx triton x 100 pg propylene glycol span 80 cremophor el cel olive oil olo triacetin and dmso respectively based on these results olo as oil ethanol as co surfactant and tx as surfactant were selected for nanoemulsion preparation cla solubility in water is known 0 33 mg ml therefore the drug is classified in the biopharmaceutical classification system bcs ii category 3 2 preparation of ne by pseudo tpds various nanoemulsions were tailored using water tx ethanol and olo as aqueous phase surfactant co surfactant and oil phase respectively before this we constructed several pseudo ternary phase diagrams ptds as shown in fig 2 a d these ptds were constructed by slow titration of oil phase to obtain nanoemulsion region delineated water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsion fig 2 in fig 2a d delineated zones of nanoemulsion were exhibited at different tx surfactant to ethanol co surfactant ratios low zone of nanoemulsion was achieved at tx ethanol ratio of 1 1 fig 2c maximum content of aqueous dissolved at this ratio 1 1 was 19 w w by adding 60 w w of the smix furthermore on increasing the content of ethanol cosurfactant with respect to tx surfactant at smix of 1 2 the maximum concentration of aqueous dissolved was increased up to 35 w w by adding 35 w w of smix the zone of nanoemulsion was also increased at this ratio 2 1 as compared to 1 1 similarly further increment of cosurfactant ethanol with respect to tx there was significant delineated covered zone of nanoemulsion at smix ratio of 1 3 fig 2d at this ratio maximum dissolved aqueous concentration was 48 w w by incorporating 15 w w of smix on increasing the surfactant tx concentration with respect to cosurfactant ethanol maximum concentration of aqueous dissolved was 30 w w by adding 13 w w of smix hence the various nanoemulsion compositions cnf1 to cnf5 were prepared from the smix ratio of 1 3 at constant concentration of smix 48 w w and varied concentration of aqueous phase from 3 to 15 w w as shown in table 1 3 3 evaluations of water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsions nanoemulsion is a thermodynamically stable system comprising of lipid surfactant co surfactant and water therefore it was prerequisite to investigate the stability of nanoemulsion at different cycles of temperature and centrifugation physical stress this was performed to identify unstable and metastable nanoemulsion tailored from the explored composition interestingly all of the developed nanoemulsions cnf1 to cnf5 were thermodynamically stable at all of the investigated stress conditions passes the test results have been illustrated in table 2 globular size of nanoemulsions are the most important parameter for deciding stability and efficiency of removal of cla from the bulk aqueous solution the smaller the globular size of naoemulsions the higher will be surface area which subsequently result in improved removal efficiency moreover the adsorption of cla on to the nanoemulsion surface is proposed higher with increased in surface area the result of globular size and pdi polydispersity index has been revealed in table 3 the globular size was found to be in the range of 26 0 73 0 nm it is clear from the result that the globular size was found to be reduced with increase in the water content aqueous phase and decreasing the oil content olo w w in water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsion table 3 the finding was in accordance with previous published report where water dimethyl sulfoxide isopropyl alcohol capryol based green nanoemulsion was formulated to remove indomethacin from bulk aqueous solution 29 30 the smallest globular size and the lower value of pdi were observed as 26 0 3 0 nm and 0 119 in cnf5 whereas these values were maximum in nf1 73 0 7 0 nm and pdi of 0 309 as shown in table 3 the values of pdi illustrate the uniformity of nanoglobules of nanoemulsions formulated with water tx ethanol and olo the pdi values were found to be in the range of 0 119 0 309 the observed globular size in cnf5 and cnf1 might be prudent to correlate with the content of olo in the formulations the highest value of size in cnf1 might be due to the maximum concentration of olo whereas cnf5 exhibited the lowest value due to minimum content of olo moreover tem result exhibited that the globular shape of cnf5 nanoemulsion was found to be spherical with average globular size of around 26 0 nm which is approximately close to the value obtained from zetasizer fig 5a notably the globular size of nanoemulsion after exposure with the aqueous solution containing cla has been found significantly higher as compared to non exposed green nanoemulsion as shown in fig 3 b this may be attributed to loading of the drug in the lipid phase of nanoemulsion through lipophilic lipophilic interaction like dissolves like fig 4 a indicates the impact of aqueous phase water and organic lipid phase olo on globular size of nanoemulsions furthermore the viscosity of nanoemulsions were measured in the range of 94 2 158 1 cp table 3 thus the values of viscosity were found to be increased with the increase in concentration of oil phase olo whereas this was found to be decreased by reducing the globular size of nanoemulsions similarly the viscosity was decreased with increased concentration of water in the nanoemulsions the nanoemulsion cnf1 and cnf5 exhibited maximum 158 1 cp and minimum 94 2 cp values of viscosity respectively the impact of aqueous water and oil olo contents on the viscosity was portrayed in fig 4b these findings of globular size and viscosity were in good agreement with the values reported before for w o nanoemulsion ferrying caffeine 5 fluorouracil and indomethacin 29 32 33 the ri values were found to be in the range of 1 441 1 430 for the developed nanoemulsions table 3 these values were very close to the refractive index of pure olive oil 1 445 suggesting w o nature of nanoemulsions 3 4 adsorption studies to remove cla from the bulk aqueous solution as we discussed in early section cla is a poor water soluble drug and removal elimination of such drug candidate from a bulk aqueous solution or wastewater or sewage or surface water is a critical and challenging task in general there are several factors that influence the removal efficiency re such as physicochemical and biological properties of pharmaceutical drug products conventional water treatment method such as sewage treatment plant is ineffective to eliminate pharmaceutical and cosmetic products from wastewater 34 removal efficiency of pharmaceutical drug products or cosmetic products depends upon chemical and biological properties such as hydrophobicity solubility biodegradability volatility and adsorption capability 35 37 therefore poor solubility and weak adsorption on to the surface are prime factors for ineffective separation or removal of pharmaceutical or cosmetic drug or drug products in present study the efficiency of water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsions cnf1 cnf5 was estimated to remove cla from the bulk aqueous solution the removal efficiency re values were calculated at varied time of exposure 10 15 and 30 min for all nanoemulsions cnf1 to cnf5 the values of re are presented in table 4 it is obvious from the result that there was an insignificant effect of exposure time on the re the re was achieved maximum in water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsion cnf5 92 9 at the end of 30 min amongst them moreover globular size and pdi values of cnf5 after coming in contact 30 min with the aqueous solution containing cla illustrated a significant increment as compared to non exposed green nanoemulsion table 4 this may be due to drug solubilisation and loading into the oil phase of nanoemulsion fig 3b fig 4c illustrated the impact of water and olo concentration on re of cla from the bulk aqueous solution by nanoemulsions notably the re was found to be rapidly increased on increasing the concentration water from 3 to 15 w w and decreasing the content of olo from 49 to 37 w w fig 4c the influence of the square of globular size in term of radius of nanoemulsion cnf1 to cnf5 was displayed in fig 5 where the values of re of cla were found to be decreased with increase in globular size this finding may be correlated with the available surface area for cla adsorption in general surface area increases with decrease in globular size and subsequently re therefore the maximum 92 9 and minimum 70 7 re of cla from cnf5 26 19 nm and cnf1 73 18 nm were achieved at 30 min probably due to the difference in globular sizes respectively in order to explain the mechanistic perspective of the separation of cla from cla aqueous solution by nanoemulsion it is relative diffusion of cla from aqueous solution to nanoemulsion phase fig 6 a cla water precipitates is proposed to form when cla aqueous solution come in contact with nanoemulsion water tx ethanol olo eventually this results in separation of cla aqueous solution and nanoemulsion 30 thus overall results showed that the content of water olo and globular size had profound impact on re of cla from the bulk aqueous solution by nanoemulsions cnf1 cnf5 4 conclusions considering results obtained in the present study green nanoemulsion based removal of cla from contaminated or polluted water would be economic safe and simple approach compared to conventional methods the purpose of the study was to remove cla from bulk aqueous solution using water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsions these nanoemulsions were thermodynamically stable throughout the experiments as evidenced with successful passing all steps of thermodynamic stability tests centrifugation heating and cooling cycles moreover re of nanoemulsions from its bulk aqueous solution was influenced greatly with the content of water olo and globular size of nanoemulsion this suggested that these factors should be considered as critical parameters while optimization and scaling up for large scale wastewater plant system working on this principle conclusively the current approach may be a promising approach and alternative to conventional methods and bioreactive membrane for the removal of cla from bulk aqueous solution credit authorship contribution statement wael a mahdi

ratio of 1 3 at constant concentration of smix 48 w w and varied concentration of aqueous phase from 3 to 15 w w as shown in table 1 3 3 evaluations of water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsions nanoemulsion is a thermodynamically stable system comprising of lipid surfactant co surfactant and water therefore it was prerequisite to investigate the stability of nanoemulsion at different cycles of temperature and centrifugation physical stress this was performed to identify unstable and metastable nanoemulsion tailored from the explored composition interestingly all of the developed nanoemulsions cnf1 to cnf5 were thermodynamically stable at all of the investigated stress conditions passes the test results have been illustrated in table 2 globular size of nanoemulsions are the most important parameter for deciding stability and efficiency of removal of cla from the bulk aqueous solution the smaller the globular size of naoemulsions the higher will be surface area which subsequently result in improved removal efficiency moreover the adsorption of cla on to the nanoemulsion surface is proposed higher with increased in surface area the result of globular size and pdi polydispersity index has been revealed in table 3 the globular size was found to be in the range of 26 0 73 0 nm it is clear from the result that the globular size was found to be reduced with increase in the water content aqueous phase and decreasing the oil content olo w w in water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsion table 3 the finding was in accordance with previous published report where water dimethyl sulfoxide isopropyl alcohol capryol based green nanoemulsion was formulated to remove indomethacin from bulk aqueous solution 29 30 the smallest globular size and the lower value of pdi were observed as 26 0 3 0 nm and 0 119 in cnf5 whereas these values were maximum in nf1 73 0 7 0 nm and pdi of 0 309 as shown in table 3 the values of pdi illustrate the uniformity of nanoglobules of nanoemulsions formulated with water tx ethanol and olo the pdi values were found to be in the range of 0 119 0 309 the observed globular size in cnf5 and cnf1 might be prudent to correlate with the content of olo in the formulations the highest value of size in cnf1 might be due to the maximum concentration of olo whereas cnf5 exhibited the lowest value due to minimum content of olo moreover tem result exhibited that the globular shape of cnf5 nanoemulsion was found to be spherical with average globular size of around 26 0 nm which is approximately close to the value obtained from zetasizer fig 5a notably the globular size of nanoemulsion after exposure with the aqueous solution containing cla has been found significantly higher as compared to non exposed green nanoemulsion as shown in fig 3 b this may be attributed to loading of the drug in the lipid phase of nanoemulsion through lipophilic lipophilic interaction like dissolves like fig 4 a indicates the impact of aqueous phase water and organic lipid phase olo on globular size of nanoemulsions furthermore the viscosity of nanoemulsions were measured in the range of 94 2 158 1 cp table 3 thus the values of viscosity were found to be increased with the increase in concentration of oil phase olo whereas this was found to be decreased by reducing the globular size of nanoemulsions similarly the viscosity was decreased with increased concentration of water in the nanoemulsions the nanoemulsion cnf1 and cnf5 exhibited maximum 158 1 cp and minimum 94 2 cp values of viscosity respectively the impact of aqueous water and oil olo contents on the viscosity was portrayed in fig 4b these findings of globular size and viscosity were in good agreement with the values reported before for w o nanoemulsion ferrying caffeine 5 fluorouracil and indomethacin 29 32 33 the ri values were found to be in the range of 1 441 1 430 for the developed nanoemulsions table 3 these values were very close to the refractive index of pure olive oil 1 445 suggesting w o nature of nanoemulsions 3 4 adsorption studies to remove cla from the bulk aqueous solution as we discussed in early section cla is a poor water soluble drug and removal elimination of such drug candidate from a bulk aqueous solution or wastewater or sewage or surface water is a critical and challenging task in general there are several factors that influence the removal efficiency re such as physicochemical and biological properties of pharmaceutical drug products conventional water treatment method such as sewage treatment plant is ineffective to eliminate pharmaceutical and cosmetic products from wastewater 34 removal efficiency of pharmaceutical drug products or cosmetic products depends upon chemical and biological properties such as hydrophobicity solubility biodegradability volatility and adsorption capability 35 37 therefore poor solubility and weak adsorption on to the surface are prime factors for ineffective separation or removal of pharmaceutical or cosmetic drug or drug products in present study the efficiency of water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsions cnf1 cnf5 was estimated to remove cla from the bulk aqueous solution the removal efficiency re values were calculated at varied time of exposure 10 15 and 30 min for all nanoemulsions cnf1 to cnf5 the values of re are presented in table 4 it is obvious from the result that there was an insignificant effect of exposure time on the re the re was achieved maximum in water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsion cnf5 92 9 at the end of 30 min amongst them moreover globular size and pdi values of cnf5 after coming in contact 30 min with the aqueous solution containing cla illustrated a significant increment as compared to non exposed green nanoemulsion table 4 this may be due to drug solubilisation and loading into the oil phase of nanoemulsion fig 3b fig 4c illustrated the impact of water and olo concentration on re of cla from the bulk aqueous solution by nanoemulsions notably the re was found to be rapidly increased on increasing the concentration water from 3 to 15 w w and decreasing the content of olo from 49 to 37 w w fig 4c the influence of the square of globular size in term of radius of nanoemulsion cnf1 to cnf5 was displayed in fig 5 where the values of re of cla were found to be decreased with increase in globular size this finding may be correlated with the available surface area for cla adsorption in general surface area increases with decrease in globular size and subsequently re therefore the maximum 92 9 and minimum 70 7 re of cla from cnf5 26 19 nm and cnf1 73 18 nm were achieved at 30 min probably due to the difference in globular sizes respectively in order to explain the mechanistic perspective of the separation of cla from cla aqueous solution by nanoemulsion it is relative diffusion of cla from aqueous solution to nanoemulsion phase fig 6 a cla water precipitates is proposed to form when cla aqueous solution come in contact with nanoemulsion water tx ethanol olo eventually this results in separation of cla aqueous solution and nanoemulsion 30 thus overall results showed that the content of water olo and globular size had profound impact on re of cla from the bulk aqueous solution by nanoemulsions cnf1 cnf5 4 conclusions considering results obtained in the present study green nanoemulsion based removal of cla from contaminated or polluted water would be economic safe and simple approach compared to conventional methods the purpose of the study was to remove cla from bulk aqueous solution using water tx ethanol olo nanoemulsions these nanoemulsions were thermodynamically stable throughout the experiments as evidenced with successful passing all steps of thermodynamic stability tests centrifugation heating and cooling cycles moreover re of nanoemulsions from its bulk aqueous solution was influenced greatly with the content of water olo and globular size of nanoemulsion this suggested that these factors should be considered as critical parameters while optimization and scaling up for large scale wastewater plant system working on this principle conclusively the current approach may be a promising approach and alternative to conventional methods and bioreactive membrane for the removal of cla from bulk aqueous solution credit authorship contribution statement wael a mahdi

13666,in this work a combination zero liquid discharge of reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed for salt recovery and acid base production is proposed for the treatment of cold rolling wastewater in ed concentrating process parameters such as the most suitable voltage drop membrane type and volume ratio were investigated according to concentration factor energy consumption and water transport the results indicated that the cmx amx stack showed good concentration factor of 2 19 in first stage ed and that the average flux of na2so4 approached a high value 4 94 mol m2h at voltage drop of 12 v furthermore an optimal volume ratio of 4 1 was selected for two stage ed process the concentration factor could approach 5 14 through two stage ed vd vc 4 1 while the energy consumption was 61 88 kw h m3 with second stage ed as result of bmed application the na2so4 containing ed concentrate solution was sucessfully desalinated for acid base production and pure water generation the generated naoh concentration can increased up to 2 03 mol l with bp 1e amx cmx stack vf vb va 5 3 3 the results demonstrated that the hybrid ro ed bmed process has potential applicability for the sustainable treatment of cold rolling wastewater keywords cold rolling wastewater reverse osmosis electrodialysis bipolar membrane electrodialysis zero liquid discharge 1 introduction currently water scarcity has become one of the main problems in our society as the global demand for fresh water for agricultural industrial and the rapid development of the economy seriously surface and groundwater contamination produced by the discharge of industrial wastewater further aggravates the problem of water scarcity 1 2 in many industrial sectors steel industry produces a large amount of cold rolling wastewater 3 the steel industry is one of the largest energy intensive and water intensive process industries fresh water is mainly used in facilities cooling process and environmental applications like the sanitary applications and wet gas cleaning especially in integrated routes that produce steel from fossils and iron ore 4 therefore the wastewater generated by different processes always has specific characteristics and water treatment variability is mainly ascribed to the differences of process conditions cold rolling wastewater discharged in steel industry is usually treated with aerobic mbr after floatation coagulation and sedimentation however the aerobic mbr effluent typically presents high inorganic salt contents 5 6 as a consequence the effective treatment of aerobic mbr effluent not only can restore important water pollution resource but also reduce the amount of fresh water used by the industry as a remedy due to its importance for environmental protection zero discharge of industrial wastewater has been emerged as a hot topic to achieve zero liquid discharge industrial wastewater desalination three steps are necessary desalination concentration and recovery of salts in the previous works vacuum evaporation was selected to treat the high salinity solutions in order to produce separate streams of salts and freshwater but the process consumed 20 25 kw h m3 of power 7 8 pisarska et al proposed the use of electro electrodialysis for the treatment of wastewater from cyclohexanone production but the energy consumption for electro electrodialysis limiting its range of applications 9 furthermore na2so4 is a cheap chemical at the market the concentrate solution formed by salt recovery is energy consuming and the impurities in na2so4 always make it unsaleable therefore the improvement of salt value is also a considerable problem in the following studies due to the application of more energy efficient pumps and advanced membranes membrane technologies processes are coming closer to the minimum energy consumption electrodialysis processes ed such as conventional electrodialysis ced selective electrodialysis sed and bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed are separation process for the concentrating and desalination of high saline solution under the applied electrical potential difference which has been widely used in seawater desalination and treatment of concentrated brine 10 13 it is suitable for recycling salts and regenerating freshwater to avoid the discharge of concentrate solution to the environment zhou et al presented a new technique for lithium recovery from primary resource by ed process 14 nazila et al studied the lithium recovery from na contaminated libr solution by ed 15 yan et al carried out investigations on an ed membrane stack treating high salinity solutions through multistage batch ed 16 as a consequence the results indicated that ed has been emerged as a potential technique to process the polluted salts solution 17 furthermore bmed has been investigated to convert various salts such as nacl licl and na2so4 into their corresponding acid and base without other addition of chemicals li et al demonstrated the feasibility of hcl and nh3 h2o generation for the recovery of ammonium chloride wastewater by bmed 18 qiu et al carried out experiments on ed and bmed stack processing salt lake brine for the recovery of lioh 19 meanwhile reverse osmosis ro has been demonstrated to be the lowest cost energy and efficient technique to concentrate salts and simultaneously produce freshwater such as iron and steel wastewater treatment 20 especially integrating ro with ed has been investigated previously for brine water desalination coproduction of salt and water from seawater and for industrial water treatment qiu et al presented a high level process integrating ro and multi stage ed for producing li2co3 from lithium containing wastewater 21 zhang et al evaluated the economics of hybridizing ed and bmed process for producing fresh water and sodium hydroxide from ro effluent 22 therefore it is meaningful to treat cold rolling wastewater discharged from mbr effluent and recovery of acid base in a full scale reclamation scheme with advanced integration technologies herein in this study a combination zero liquid discharge of ro ed and bmed for salt concentration and acid base production with optimal operating parameters is proposed to process the cold rolling wastewater as shown in fig 1 the cold rolling wastewater firstly is pretreated by ion exchange resins ier for absorbing the mg2 and ca2 in the wastewater then the ier effluent was concentrated via ro process in order to achieve solution with high saline the solution was concentrated with a two stage ed process the effects of voltage drop membrane type and volume ratio were investigated through concentration factor energy consumption and water transport furthermore the effluent from two stage ed dilution solution could be treated by ro process again the ed concentrate solution which enriches na2so4 can be used for the bmed process to recycle the naoh and h2so4 however before the treatment of bmed process the ed concentrate solution was processed by ion exchange resins for the treatment of mg2 and ca2 again subsequently the parameters such as membrane type and volume ratio between feed and acid base compartment were studied during bmed process a small amount of acid and base could be used to regenerate and transform the exhausted cation exchange resins as well the findings of this study would not only enrich reference for the treatment of cold rolling wastewater but also provide guidance for optimization process 2 experimental 2 1 materials the cold rolling wastewater was obtained from baosteel in shanghai province china the main compositions of the cold rolling wastewater are illustrated in table 1 the used cation exchange membranes were cmx tokuyama co japan fkb fuma techgmbh co germany and cmb astom co japan the tested anion exchange membranes were amx astom co japan fab fuma techgmbh co germany and aha astom co japan bp 1e astom co japan was selected as bipolar membrane was the main properties of the commercial membranes are given in table 2 the membrane used in ro process was purchased from ge power water technologies the solutions of naoh and h2so4 were made from analytical grade reagents aladdin china the material characteristics of ro membrane provided by the manufacturer are presented in table 3 the physical and chemical properties of 732 resins were given in table 4 deionized water was used in all experiments 2 2 experiment setup and process design to avoid the phenomenon of membrane fouling caused by ca2 and mg2 a deep removal process of ier is carried out in this study in the following experiment a laboratory scale ier column 10 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height into which a kind of cation exchange resin 732 solarbio co china is contained for further removing ca2 and mg2 meanwhile a magnetic pump is carried out to drive the cold rolling wastewater from brine tank to effluent tank at the constant flow rate of 5 bv h the units of ro experimental set up contained retentate tank permeate tank membrane cell manometer rotameter and rotary vane pump the ro membrane should be circulated by 2 citric acid for 30 min before the experiment subsequently circulated by deionized water at an experimental pressure of 10 bar during the operation of ier process the retentate tank initially fed with cold rolling wastewater from ier effluent tank the cold rolling wastewater would be concentrated in retentate tank at an experimental pressure of 30 bar after the experiment the fresh water from ro permeate solution could be used in the process of resin regeneration the schematic of the ed and bmed stack were illustrated in fig 2 the operational two stage ed stack was mainly divided into the following sections 1 five repeating unit each unit was composed of anion exchange membranes a 189 cm2 and cation exchange membranes c 189 cm2 in series 2 each membrane was isolated by the spacers with thickness of 0 7 mm 3 each unit was divided into a dilute compartment and a concentrate compartment 4 the ro concentrate was added into dilute and concentrate tank respectively 5 3 na2so4 solution was added into electrode tank similarly the bmed stack was mainly divided into the following sections 1 five repeating unit each unit was composed of bipolar membrane a 189 cm2 anion exchange membranes a 189 cm2 and cation exchange membranes c 189 cm2 in series 2 each membrane was isolated by the spacers with thickness of 0 7 mm 3 each unit was divided into a feed compartment base compartment and acid compartment 4 feed tank was fed with 16 36 salt solution from second stage ed concentrate solution base tank and acid tank were fed with deionized water 5 3 na2so4 solution was selected as the electrode rinse solution in electrode tank before the ed and bmed experiment the solution in each tank should circulate about 30 min to eliminate the gas bubbles on the membrane surface in order to obtain a high saline wastewater a two stage ed process was operated with different volume ratios between dilute and concentrate tank 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 fe3 were measured by icp ms elan drc e perkinelmer usa respectivity the concentrations of so4 2 and cl were measured by ion chromatography 792 basic ic metrohm switzerland the solution conductivity was analyzed by a conductivity meter s220 type mettler toledo switzerland the concentration of naoh was measured with a standard h2so4 using methyl orange as indicator the h2so4 concentration was determined by measuring a standard naoh using phenolphthalein as indicator voltage drop and current were recorded directly from the power supply 2 4 data analysis the current efficiency η of ed was defined as eq 1 24 1 η z c t v t c 0 v t f n i t 100 where c0 and ct mol l are the concentration of na2so4 at time 0 and t respectively v0 and vt l are the solution volume in the concentrate tank at time 0 and t respectively f 96 485 c mol indicates the faraday constant n 5 represents the number of repeating unit i a indicates the applied current the energy consumption e kwh m3 of ed can be defined as eq 2 2 e 0 t u t i d t v d where ut v is the voltage drop across the ed stack at time t respectively vd is the initial volume of the dilute solution the average flux of na2so4 can be defined as eq 3 3 j ed c t v t n a t where a is the effective membrane area the water transport wt was calculated as eq 4 25 4 wt v 0 v t v 0 where v0 and vt l represent the solution volume in the concentrate tank at time 0 and t respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 pretreatment of cold rolling wastewater via ier ro process according to the reference ro filtration process can be defined as a cost economic procedure to preliminary treat the wastewater with low conductivity 21 in the following experiment breakthrough curves of ca2 and mg2 were analysed by processing of cold rolling wastewater after the ier process the resin was washed by fresh water from ro process and then the resin was regenerated with 4 h2so4 solution from bmed process furthermore the ier effluent was introduced into the ro retentate tank for achieving a high saline solution the influence of operating pressure 30 bar on the concentration factor and permeate flux during ro filtration operation was studied the initial volume of 10 l cold rolling wastewater was added to the retentate tank and the following experiment was stopped when the conductivity of retentate approached 35 ms cm fig 3 a shows the ca2 mg2 breakthrough curves for the resin at different bed volumes the results showed that the experimental time for the breakthrough point was significantly affected with increasing the bed volume of cold rolling wastewater which indicated that the measured resin capacity was limited below 1 6 bv this is because there were not enough active sites on the resin to adsorb so much ca2 mg2 from the cold rolling wastewater furthermore the comparison of ier with chemical precipitation was displayed in fig 3b it can be observed that the removal rate of ca2 mg2 by using h2c2o4 was 99 42 while the removal rate of ca2 mg2 achieved by used resin was 99 69 obviously the byproduct of cac2o4 and mgc2o4 may pollute the environment via chemical precipitation but the application of resins effectively avoided the problem in the following experiments considering the concentration of ca2 mg2 would be enriched by ed again ier should be conducted to treat the wastewater in order to mitigate the membrane fouling during bmed process fig 3c shows the temporal evolution of permeate flux and concentration factor after 100 min filtration it can be seen that the permeate flux presents a decreasing trend as a function of time simultaneously the concentration factor increasing with time the decline of ro permeate flux in a continuous working mode is caused by the contributions of the increment of the osmotic pressure in the retentate tank 26 moreover ro produces the permeate solution with low conductivity fresh water and the retentate solution of na2so4 could be used as the ed feed solution for deep concentrating according to the experimental data the final salt concentration was 3 17 times higher than the initial wastewater salt content and the average permeate flux approximately reached a high value of 35 9 l m2h 3 2 two stage ed process for salt concentration 3 2 1 first stage ed performances of membrane type the ed stack performance is mainly affected by the membrane performances in agreement with the different functional groups and polymer skeleton structure of membranes they exhibit different desalination and concentrating abilities 27 in this section three types of commercial membrane stacks were used in ed process the initial volumes of dilute and concentrate solutions were selected as 600 ml and 300 ml respectively the voltage drop applied on the ed stack was fixed at 10 v fig 4 a illustrates the current change for various membrane stacks i e fkb fab cmb aha and cmx amx during the ed process it was found that the current across the ed stack exhibits a downward trend the current declined sharply during the initial phase of experiment which was mainly due to the decrease of na2so4 conductivity in the dilute compartment subsequently the current curve reached a stable state in the subsequent phase after 30 min of experimental time the reason for this phenomenon suggests that the resistance of the membrane stack is almost constant at the latter period of experiment the relationship between the membrane type and conductivity of dilute and concentrate solution is illustrated in fig 4b the feed solution conductivity of dilute compartment decreases with the migration of na and so4 2 meanwhile the conductivity of concentrate solution displays a relatively slow upward trend at the latter period of experiment which is ascribed to the higher concentration gradient between the concentrate and dilute compartment with the migration of na and so4 2 the phenomenon of co ions leakage across the ion exchange membranes was occurred subsequently this has been verified by many previous literature reports 28 fig 4c illustrates the influence of membrane type on the concentration factor and water transport it can be seen that that cmx amx stack shows a better concentration factor 2 19 than the other membrane stacks furthermore the water transport of cmb aha stack is higher than the other membrane stacks obviously the phenomenon of water transport significantly affected the concentration factor the occurrence of water transport in ed process is usually caused by two reasons on the one hand the concentration gradient osmotic is caused by concentration difference between concentrate and dilute compartment on the other hand electro osmosis is promoted by the transport of hydrated ions under an electrochemical potential gradient 8 29 because the concentration gradient of the three membrane stacks are very similar the differences between concentrating factor and water transport are caused by electro osmosis according to the literature the electro osmosis is directly related to the membranes compactness the ion exchange membranes with a dense structure can effectively minimize the phenomenon of water migration thereby increasing the concentration factor 30 fig 4d illustrates the influence of membrane type on the energy consumption and na2so4 average flux the energy consumption for fkb fab stack approached a lowest value at 26 19 kw h m3 comparing to 26 90 kw h m3 and 27 80 kw h m3 for cmb aha and cmx amx stack respectively a possible reason for this effect is mainly caused by the lowest water transport observed for fkb fab stack meanwhile a highest na2so4 average flux of 4 89 mol m2h could be obtained by cmx amx stack which is higher than the obtained values for other membrane stacks according to mass flux continuity principle in ed concentrating process the na2so4 average flux is proportional to the transport number of membrane and current across the membrane stack the current applied on the cmx amx stack was the highest compared to the other two membrane stacks therefore cmx amx stack achieved a relatively high average flux by considering the similar transport number of different ion exchange membranes considering the higher concentration factor and na2so4 average flux cmx amx stack is more suitable for na2so4 concentrating in further experiments 3 2 2 first stage ed performances of voltage drop the voltage drop is considered as an important parameter affecting the ed stack performance generally the voltage drop applied on one unit of ed stack is in the range of 0 5 2 5 v in this section the selected voltage drops were 6 8 10 and 12 v with cmx amx stack fig 5 a shows the temporal evolution of current in the course of ed process at different voltage drops as expected the highest current value was achieved for 12 v voltage drop at the beginning of the experiment as the voltage drop increases from 6 v to 12 v the total operation time easily decreases from 60 min to 35 min this is because a higher applied voltage drop resulting in higher driving force during ed operation thereby a less experimental time will be furthermore it can be seen that the concentrate conductivity curves significantly increase with the increment of voltage drop as is shown in fig 5b the current exhibits a downward trend with time which is ascribed to the migration of ions from dilute solution to concentrate solution fig 5c illustrates the influence of voltage drop on the concentration factor and water transport the values of concentration factor were similar at different voltage drops but it is interesting to note that the water transport was significantly affected a highest water transport of 12 50 can be seen for 10 v which is slightly higher than that of 6 v and 8 v this phenomenon is due to the electro osmosis and duration time of experiment a severe electro osmosis will be occurred at higher voltage drop thus a higher amount of h2o will transport from dilute compartment to concentrate compartment at voltage drop of 10 v 31 however the water transport exhibits a lower value of 10 00 when the voltage drop increases up to 12 v the similar phenomenon has been reported by yan et al 25 as is shown in fig 5d the energy consumption is intensified with the increment of voltage drop this phenomenon demonstrates that a large amount of energy will be used to promote the ionic migration at the higher voltage drop meanwhile the na2so4 average flux is also intensified with the increment of voltage drop a highest na2so4 average flux of 4 94 mol m2h can be obtained at 12 v therefore high voltage drop usually enhances the ionic migration rates for a given duration of experiment 3 2 3 two stage ed performances of volume ratio the volume ratio between concentrate and dilute solution plays a significant role in na2so4 concentration in this section the initial volume of the concentrate solution was selected as 300 ml while the volume of dilute solution varied from 300 ml to 1200 ml the operation voltage drop was fixed at 8 v as it can be seen in fig 6 a the recorded current decreases with the increment of the volume ratio between concentrate and dilute solution this phenomenon is ascribed to the na and so4 2 ions migration from dilute to concentrate compartment thus the membrane resistance gradually declines as a function of time meanwhile the current value is directly proportional to the volume ratio value during the experiment fig 6b illustrates the concentrate solution conductivity rises consistently over the experiment when the volume ratio fixed at 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 respectively it s indicated that final na2so4 concentration in the concentrate compartment is directly related to the volume ratio the higher volume ratio always tends to achieve a higher salts concentration in the concentrate compartment however there is no increase in na2so4 concentration at the latter stage of experiment during this time period there are small amount of na2so4 electrolytes in the dilute compartment but the conductivity of concentrate solution is not further increased this effect shows that salt transport is lower than solvent permeation demonstrating that water transport caused by osmotic pressure difference has been emerged as a dominant factor at the end of experiment fig 6c presents the influence of volume ratio on the concentrate factor and water transport it can be seen that the concentration factor is almost proportional to the volume ratio the higher volume ratio applied between dilute and concentrate solution the higher concentration of na2so4 can be achieved this is because the high mole number of salt ions in high volume ratio and thus a maximum water transport is obtained with vd vc 4 1 fig 6d illustrates the influence of volume ratio on the energy consumption and na2so4 average flux as it can be observed there is a slight increase in average flux as the increment of volume ratio the average flux increase demonstrates that more salts migration can be achieved at high volume ratio however the influence of volume ratio on energy consumption is not pronounced due to the limitation of the first stage ed mode a second stage ed process is also introduced to further increase the concentration in contrast to the first stage ed process the recorded current in the second stage ed vd vc 3 1 can be achieved a highest value which is because the lowest membrane stack resistance during the experiment as is presented in fig 7 a fig 7b shows the evolution of conductivity of dilute and concentrate compartment during the second stage concentrating and a higher na2so4 concentration can be achieved at the second stage ed similarly the conductivity of concentrate solution exhibits a downward trend at the later stage of experiment which is because the concentration gradient formed between dilute compartment and concentrate compartment fig 7c illustrates the influence of volume ratio on the water transport and concentrate factor in second stage ed it should be noted that a highest concentration factor 5 14 is achieved during two stage ed vd vc 4 1 furthermore the water transport is also proportional to the volume ratio as mentioned above the water osmosis caused by osmotic pressure difference will be intensified with the quantity of na2so4 in dilute compartment meanwhile the electro osmosis will be intensified at a high saline solution in the second stage ed process fig 7d illustrates the influence of volume ratio on the concentrate factor and water transport in second stage ed it shows that the energy consumption in second stage ed is much higher than that in first stage ed one possible reason is the processing capacity increased at a higher salt concentration therefore due to the leakage of coions the current efficiency decreases and simultaneously the energy consumption increases meanwhile the salt flux during the second stage ed is much higher than the first stage ed which is because the lower membrane stack resistance in first stage ed in general the ionic electrolyte is necessary to be concentrated to a high concentration through a two stage ed process in addition it should be noted that in lab scale experiment the energy consumption of electrode reaction maybe consumes a large amount of the total energy consumption the energy consumption in practical applications should be much lower than that in lab scale experiment 3 3 acid and base recovery via bmed process during the bmed process water transport caused by osmosis also emerged as an important factor due to the migration of na and so4 2 limiting the concentration of acid and base however a high saline solution is always required in the bmed process and simultaneously the feed solution concentration is expected to be decreased as much as possible therefore the bmed process was evaluated by decreasing the volume of the base acid solution vb va from 500 to 300 ml the feed solution was fixed at a constant initial volume of 500 ml furthermore three types of commercial membranes bp 1e amx cmx bp 1e aha cmb and bp 1e fab fkb were investigated in bmed process as it can be seen in fig 8 a when the volume ratio changes from 500 500 500 to 500 300 300 the final oh concentration improves from 1 45 to 2 03 mol l and simultaneously the final h concentration increases from 1 51 to 2 35 mol l importantly the demand global market concerning high acid base concentrations is always increasing due to the high value of these chemicals however in ed applications the final h oh concentration could diffuse from acid base solution to feed solution under concentration gradient in this case the final h oh concentration presents a stable trend at the later period of the experiment from this phenomenon the investigation of different membrane stacks on the acid base production with high concentration is necessary fig 8b illustrates the effect of membrane type on the acid base production the final oh concentration of the bp 1e amx cmx stack is 2 03 mol l while the final h concentration of the bp 1e aha cmb stack and bp 1e fab fkb stack are 1 73 and 1 62 mol l respectively demonstrating that the water splitting capability of bp 1e cmx amx stack is the best this can be ascribed to the following two reasons on the one hand a higher water splitting capability of the bipolar membrane usually results in more h oh ions thereby maintaining the electric neutrality in the corresponding compartment on the other hand membrane resistance differently with three membrane stacks membranes with dense structure can maximum the stack resistance thereby reducing the base acid concentration in the base acid compartment therefore it can be inferred that the bp 1e amx cmx stack is suitable for acid base production with high efficiency 4 conclusions this work proposes an integration ro ed bmed process for sustainable recovery of resources from cold rolling wastewater i e na2so4 concentrating base acid recovery and fresh water regeneration the ro membrane has achieved 3 17 times pre concentration of salts in wastewater in ed process the effect of voltage drop membrane type and volume ratio were investigated according to concentration factor energy consumption and water transport results show that cmx amx stack exhibit better performance in terms of concentration factor and na2so4 average flux the concentration factor was proportional to the increment of volume ratio and a higher average flux can be obtained at volume ratio 4 1 specifically a highest average flux was accomplished at volume ratio 4 1 via second stage ed through the operation of bmed base and acid can be generated from the high saline solution via an optimal bp 1e amx cmx stack furthermore the change of volume ratios vf vb va 5 3 3 between feed base and acid solution significantly increased the final h oh concentration hence the hybrid ro ed bmed process proves a strong technical applicability for sustainable resource recovery from cold rolling wastewater in consideration of closing the material circulation and minimizing the liquid discharge

treatment of cold rolling wastewater in ed concentrating process parameters such as the most suitable voltage drop membrane type and volume ratio were investigated according to concentration factor energy consumption and water transport the results indicated that the cmx amx stack showed good concentration factor of 2 19 in first stage ed and that the average flux of na2so4 approached a high value 4 94 mol m2h at voltage drop of 12 v furthermore an optimal volume ratio of 4 1 was selected for two stage ed process the concentration factor could approach 5 14 through two stage ed vd vc 4 1 while the energy consumption was 61 88 kw h m3 with second stage ed as result of bmed application the na2so4 containing ed concentrate solution was sucessfully desalinated for acid base production and pure water generation the generated naoh concentration can increased up to 2 03 mol l with bp 1e amx cmx stack vf vb va 5 3 3 the results demonstrated that the hybrid ro ed bmed process has potential applicability for the sustainable treatment of cold rolling wastewater keywords cold rolling wastewater reverse osmosis electrodialysis bipolar membrane electrodialysis zero liquid discharge 1 introduction currently water scarcity has become one of the main problems in our society as the global demand for fresh water for agricultural industrial and the rapid development of the economy seriously surface and groundwater contamination produced by the discharge of industrial wastewater further aggravates the problem of water scarcity 1 2 in many industrial sectors steel industry produces a large amount of cold rolling wastewater 3 the steel industry is one of the largest energy intensive and water intensive process industries fresh water is mainly used in facilities cooling process and environmental applications like the sanitary applications and wet gas cleaning especially in integrated routes that produce steel from fossils and iron ore 4 therefore the wastewater generated by different processes always has specific characteristics and water treatment variability is mainly ascribed to the differences of process conditions cold rolling wastewater discharged in steel industry is usually treated with aerobic mbr after floatation coagulation and sedimentation however the aerobic mbr effluent typically presents high inorganic salt contents 5 6 as a consequence the effective treatment of aerobic mbr effluent not only can restore important water pollution resource but also reduce the amount of fresh water used by the industry as a remedy due to its importance for environmental protection zero discharge of industrial wastewater has been emerged as a hot topic to achieve zero liquid discharge industrial wastewater desalination three steps are necessary desalination concentration and recovery of salts in the previous works vacuum evaporation was selected to treat the high salinity solutions in order to produce separate streams of salts and freshwater but the process consumed 20 25 kw h m3 of power 7 8 pisarska et al proposed the use of electro electrodialysis for the treatment of wastewater from cyclohexanone production but the energy consumption for electro electrodialysis limiting its range of applications 9 furthermore na2so4 is a cheap chemical at the market the concentrate solution formed by salt recovery is energy consuming and the impurities in na2so4 always make it unsaleable therefore the improvement of salt value is also a considerable problem in the following studies due to the application of more energy efficient pumps and advanced membranes membrane technologies processes are coming closer to the minimum energy consumption electrodialysis processes ed such as conventional electrodialysis ced selective electrodialysis sed and bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed are separation process for the concentrating and desalination of high saline solution under the applied electrical potential difference which has been widely used in seawater desalination and treatment of concentrated brine 10 13 it is suitable for recycling salts and regenerating freshwater to avoid the discharge of concentrate solution to the environment zhou et al presented a new technique for lithium recovery from primary resource by ed process 14 nazila et al studied the lithium recovery from na contaminated libr solution by ed 15 yan et al carried out investigations on an ed membrane stack treating high salinity solutions through multistage batch ed 16 as a consequence the results indicated that ed has been emerged as a potential technique to process the polluted salts solution 17 furthermore bmed has been investigated to convert various salts such as nacl licl and na2so4 into their corresponding acid and base without other addition of chemicals li et al demonstrated the feasibility of hcl and nh3 h2o generation for the recovery of ammonium chloride wastewater by bmed 18 qiu et al carried out experiments on ed and bmed stack processing salt lake brine for the recovery of lioh 19 meanwhile reverse osmosis ro has been demonstrated to be the lowest cost energy and efficient technique to concentrate salts and simultaneously produce freshwater such as iron and steel wastewater treatment 20 especially integrating ro with ed has been investigated previously for brine water desalination coproduction of salt and water from seawater and for industrial water treatment qiu et al presented a high level process integrating ro and multi stage ed for producing li2co3 from lithium containing wastewater 21 zhang et al evaluated the economics of hybridizing ed and bmed process for producing fresh water and sodium hydroxide from ro effluent 22 therefore it is meaningful to treat cold rolling wastewater discharged from mbr effluent and recovery of acid base in a full scale reclamation scheme with advanced integration technologies herein in this study a combination zero liquid discharge of ro ed and bmed for salt concentration and acid base production with optimal operating parameters is proposed to process the cold rolling wastewater as shown in fig 1 the cold rolling wastewater firstly is pretreated by ion exchange resins ier for absorbing the mg2 and ca2 in the wastewater then the ier effluent was concentrated via ro process in order to achieve solution with high saline the solution was concentrated with a two stage ed process the effects of voltage drop membrane type and volume ratio were investigated through concentration factor energy consumption and water transport furthermore the effluent from two stage ed dilution solution could be treated by ro process again the ed concentrate solution which enriches na2so4 can be used for the bmed process to recycle the naoh and h2so4 however before the treatment of bmed process the ed concentrate solution was processed by ion exchange resins for the treatment of mg2 and ca2 again subsequently the parameters such as membrane type and volume ratio between feed and acid base compartment were studied during bmed process a small amount of acid and base could be used to regenerate and transform the exhausted cation exchange resins as well the findings of this study would not only enrich reference for the treatment of cold rolling wastewater but also provide guidance for optimization process 2 experimental 2 1 materials the cold rolling wastewater was obtained from baosteel in shanghai province china the main compositions of the cold rolling wastewater are illustrated in table 1 the used cation exchange membranes were cmx tokuyama co japan fkb fuma techgmbh co germany and cmb astom co japan the tested anion exchange membranes were amx astom co japan fab fuma techgmbh co germany and aha astom co japan bp 1e astom co japan was selected as bipolar membrane was the main properties of the commercial membranes are given in table 2 the membrane used in ro process was purchased from ge power water technologies the solutions of naoh and h2so4 were made from analytical grade reagents aladdin china the material characteristics of ro membrane provided by the manufacturer are presented in table 3 the physical and chemical properties of 732 resins were given in table 4 deionized water was used in all experiments 2 2 experiment setup and process design to avoid the phenomenon of membrane fouling caused by ca2 and mg2 a deep removal process of ier is carried out in this study in the following experiment a laboratory scale ier column 10 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height into which a kind of cation exchange resin 732 solarbio co china is contained for further removing ca2 and mg2 meanwhile a magnetic pump is carried out to drive the cold rolling wastewater from brine tank to effluent tank at the constant flow rate of 5 bv h the units of ro experimental set up contained retentate tank permeate tank membrane cell manometer rotameter and rotary vane pump the ro membrane should be circulated by 2 citric acid for 30 min before the experiment subsequently circulated by deionized water at an experimental pressure of 10 bar during the operation of ier process the retentate tank initially fed with cold rolling wastewater from ier effluent tank the cold rolling wastewater would be concentrated in retentate tank at an experimental pressure of 30 bar after the experiment the fresh water from ro permeate solution could be used in the process of resin regeneration the schematic of the ed and bmed stack were illustrated in fig 2 the operational two stage ed stack was mainly divided into the following sections 1 five repeating unit each unit was composed of anion exchange membranes a 189 cm2 and cation exchange membranes c 189 cm2 in series 2 each membrane was isolated by the spacers with thickness of 0 7 mm 3 each unit was divided into a dilute compartment and a concentrate compartment 4 the ro concentrate was added into dilute and concentrate tank respectively 5 3 na2so4 solution was added into electrode tank similarly the bmed stack was mainly divided into the following sections 1 five repeating unit each unit was composed of bipolar membrane a 189 cm2 anion exchange membranes a 189 cm2 and cation exchange membranes c 189 cm2 in series 2 each membrane was isolated by the spacers with thickness of 0 7 mm 3 each unit was divided into a feed compartment base compartment and acid compartment 4 feed tank was fed with 16 36 salt solution from second stage ed concentrate solution base tank and acid tank were fed with deionized water 5 3 na2so4 solution was selected as the electrode rinse solution in electrode tank before the ed and bmed experiment the solution in each tank should circulate about 30 min to eliminate the gas bubbles on the membrane surface in order to obtain a high saline wastewater a two stage ed process was operated with different volume ratios between dilute and concentrate tank 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 fe3 were measured by icp ms elan drc e perkinelmer usa respectivity the concentrations of so4 2 and cl were measured by ion chromatography 792 basic ic metrohm switzerland the solution conductivity was analyzed by a conductivity meter s220 type mettler toledo switzerland the concentration of naoh was measured with a standard h2so4 using methyl orange as indicator the h2so4 concentration was determined by measuring a standard naoh using phenolphthalein as indicator voltage drop and current were recorded directly from the power supply 2 4 data analysis the current efficiency η of ed was defined as eq 1 24 1 η z c t v t c 0 v t f n i t 100 where c0 and ct mol l are the concentration of na2so4 at time 0 and t respectively v0 and vt l are the solution volume in the concentrate tank at time 0 and t respectively f 96 485 c mol indicates the faraday constant n 5 represents the number of repeating unit i a indicates the applied current the energy consumption e kwh m3 of ed can be defined as eq 2 2 e 0 t u t i d t v d where ut v is the voltage drop across the ed stack at time t respectively vd is the initial volume of the dilute solution the average flux of na2so4 can be defined as eq 3 3 j ed c t v t n a t where a is the effective membrane area the water transport wt was calculated as eq 4 25 4 wt v 0 v t v 0 where v0 and vt l represent the solution volume in the concentrate tank at time 0 and t respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 pretreatment of cold rolling wastewater via ier ro process according to the reference ro filtration process can be defined as a cost economic procedure to preliminary treat the wastewater with low conductivity 21 in the following experiment breakthrough curves of ca2 and mg2 were analysed by processing of cold rolling wastewater after the ier process the resin was washed by fresh water from ro process and then the resin was regenerated with 4 h2so4 solution from bmed process furthermore the ier effluent was introduced into the ro retentate tank for achieving a high saline solution the influence of operating pressure 30 bar on the concentration factor and permeate flux during ro filtration operation was studied the initial volume of 10 l cold rolling wastewater was added to the retentate tank and the following experiment was stopped when the conductivity of retentate approached 35 ms cm fig 3 a shows the ca2 mg2 breakthrough curves for the resin at different bed volumes the results showed that the experimental time for the breakthrough point was significantly affected with increasing the bed volume of cold rolling wastewater which indicated that the measured resin capacity was limited below 1 6 bv this is because there were not enough active sites on the resin to adsorb so much ca2 mg2 from the cold rolling wastewater furthermore the comparison of ier with chemical precipitation was displayed in fig 3b it can be observed that the removal rate of ca2 mg2 by using h2c2o4 was 99 42 while the removal rate of ca2 mg2 achieved by used resin was 99 69 obviously the byproduct of cac2o4 and mgc2o4 may pollute the environment via chemical precipitation but the application of resins effectively avoided the problem in the following experiments considering the concentration of ca2 mg2 would be enriched by ed again ier should be conducted to treat the wastewater in order to mitigate the membrane fouling during bmed process fig 3c shows the temporal evolution of permeate flux and concentration factor after 100 min filtration it can be seen that the permeate flux presents a decreasing trend as a function of time simultaneously the concentration factor increasing with time the decline of ro permeate flux in a continuous working mode is caused by the contributions of the increment of the osmotic pressure in the retentate tank 26 moreover ro produces the permeate solution with low conductivity fresh water and the retentate solution of na2so4 could be used as the ed feed solution for deep concentrating according to the experimental data the final salt concentration was 3 17 times higher than the initial wastewater salt content and the average permeate flux approximately reached a high value of 35 9 l m2h 3 2 two stage ed process for salt concentration 3 2 1 first stage ed performances of membrane type the ed stack performance is mainly affected by the membrane performances in agreement with the different functional groups and polymer skeleton structure of membranes they exhibit different desalination and concentrating abilities 27 in this section three types of commercial membrane stacks were used in ed process the initial volumes of dilute and concentrate solutions were selected as 600 ml and 300 ml respectively the voltage drop applied on the ed stack was fixed at 10 v fig 4 a illustrates the current change for various membrane stacks i e fkb fab cmb aha and cmx amx during the ed process it was found that the current across the ed stack exhibits a downward trend the current declined sharply during the initial phase of experiment which was mainly due to the decrease of na2so4 conductivity in the dilute compartment subsequently the current curve reached a stable state in the subsequent phase after 30 min of experimental time the reason for this phenomenon suggests that the resistance of the membrane stack is almost constant at the latter period of experiment the relationship between the membrane type and conductivity of dilute and concentrate solution is illustrated in fig 4b the feed solution conductivity of dilute compartment decreases with the migration of na and so4 2 meanwhile the conductivity of concentrate solution displays a relatively slow upward trend at the latter period of experiment which is ascribed to the higher concentration gradient between the concentrate and dilute compartment with the migration of na and so4 2 the phenomenon of co ions leakage across the ion exchange membranes was occurred subsequently this has been verified by many previous literature reports 28 fig 4c illustrates the influence of membrane type on the concentration factor and water transport it can be seen that that cmx amx stack shows a better concentration factor 2 19 than the other membrane stacks furthermore the water transport of cmb aha stack is higher than the other membrane stacks obviously the phenomenon of water transport significantly affected the concentration factor the occurrence of water transport in ed process is usually caused by two reasons on the one hand the concentration gradient osmotic is caused by concentration difference between concentrate and dilute compartment on the other hand electro osmosis is promoted by the transport of hydrated ions under an electrochemical potential gradient 8 29 because the concentration gradient of the three membrane stacks are very similar the differences between concentrating factor and water transport are caused by electro osmosis according to the literature the electro osmosis is directly related to the membranes compactness the ion exchange membranes with a dense structure can effectively minimize the phenomenon of water migration thereby increasing the concentration factor 30 fig 4d illustrates the influence of membrane type on the energy consumption and na2so4 average flux the energy consumption for fkb fab stack approached a lowest value at 26 19 kw h m3 comparing to 26 90 kw h m3 and 27 80 kw h m3 for cmb aha and cmx amx stack respectively a possible reason for this effect is mainly caused by the lowest water transport observed for fkb fab stack meanwhile a highest na2so4 average flux of 4 89 mol m2h could be obtained by cmx amx stack which is higher than the obtained values for other membrane stacks according to mass flux continuity principle in ed concentrating process the na2so4 average flux is proportional to the transport number of membrane and current across the membrane stack the current applied on the cmx amx stack was the highest compared to the other two membrane stacks therefore cmx amx stack achieved a relatively high average flux by considering the similar transport number of different ion exchange membranes considering the higher concentration factor and na2so4 average flux cmx amx stack is more suitable for na2so4 concentrating in further experiments 3 2 2 first stage ed performances of voltage drop the voltage drop is considered as an important parameter affecting the ed stack performance generally the voltage drop applied on one unit of ed stack is in the range of 0 5 2 5 v in this section the selected voltage drops were 6 8 10 and 12 v with cmx amx stack fig 5 a shows the temporal evolution of current in the course of ed process at different voltage drops as expected the highest current value was achieved for 12 v voltage drop at the beginning of the experiment as the voltage drop increases from 6 v to 12 v the total operation time easily decreases from 60 min to 35 min this is because a higher applied voltage drop resulting in higher driving force during ed operation thereby a less experimental time will be furthermore it can be seen that the concentrate conductivity curves significantly increase with the increment of voltage drop as is shown in fig 5b the current exhibits a downward trend with time which is ascribed to the migration of ions from dilute solution to concentrate solution fig 5c illustrates the influence of voltage drop on the concentration factor and water transport the values of concentration factor were similar at different voltage drops but it is interesting to note that the water transport was significantly affected a highest water transport of 12 50 can be seen for 10 v which is slightly higher than that of 6 v and 8 v this phenomenon is due to the electro osmosis and duration time of experiment a severe electro osmosis will be occurred at higher voltage drop thus a higher amount of h2o will transport from dilute compartment to concentrate compartment at voltage drop of 10 v 31 however the water transport exhibits a lower value of 10 00 when the voltage drop increases up to 12 v the similar phenomenon has been reported by yan et al 25 as is shown in fig 5d the energy consumption is intensified with the increment of voltage drop this phenomenon demonstrates that a large amount of energy will be used to promote the ionic migration at the higher voltage drop meanwhile the na2so4 average flux is also intensified with the increment of voltage drop a highest na2so4 average flux of 4 94 mol m2h can be obtained at 12 v therefore high voltage drop usually enhances the ionic migration rates for a given duration of experiment 3 2 3 two stage ed performances of volume ratio the volume ratio between concentrate and dilute solution plays a significant role in na2so4 concentration in this section the initial volume of the concentrate solution was selected as 300 ml while the volume of dilute solution varied from 300 ml to 1200 ml the operation voltage drop was fixed at 8 v as it can be seen in fig 6 a the recorded current decreases with the increment of the volume ratio between concentrate and dilute solution this phenomenon is ascribed to the na and so4 2 ions migration from dilute to concentrate compartment thus the membrane resistance gradually declines as a function of time meanwhile the current value is directly proportional to the volume ratio value during the experiment fig 6b illustrates the concentrate solution conductivity rises consistently over the experiment when the volume ratio fixed at 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 respectively it s indicated that final na2so4 concentration in the concentrate compartment is directly related to the volume ratio the higher volume ratio always tends to achieve a higher salts concentration in the concentrate compartment however there is no increase in na2so4 concentration at the latter stage of experiment during this time period there are small amount of na2so4 electrolytes in the dilute compartment but the conductivity of concentrate solution is not further increased this effect shows that salt transport is lower than solvent permeation demonstrating that water transport caused by osmotic pressure difference has been emerged as a dominant factor at the end of experiment fig 6c presents the influence of volume ratio on the concentrate factor and water transport it can be seen that the concentration factor is almost proportional to the volume ratio the higher volume ratio applied between dilute and concentrate solution the higher concentration of na2so4 can be achieved this is because the high mole number of salt ions in high volume ratio and thus a maximum water transport is obtained with vd vc 4 1 fig 6d illustrates the influence of volume ratio on the energy consumption and na2so4 average flux as it can be observed there is a slight increase in average flux as the increment of volume ratio the average flux increase demonstrates that more salts migration can be achieved at high volume ratio however the influence of volume ratio on energy consumption is not pronounced due to the limitation of the first stage ed mode a second stage ed process is also introduced to further increase the concentration in contrast to the first stage ed process the recorded current in the second stage ed vd vc 3 1 can be achieved a highest value which is because the lowest membrane stack resistance during the experiment as is presented in fig 7 a fig 7b shows the evolution of conductivity of dilute and concentrate compartment during the second stage concentrating and a higher na2so4 concentration can be achieved at the second stage ed similarly the conductivity of concentrate solution exhibits a downward trend at the later stage of experiment which is because the concentration gradient formed between dilute compartment and concentrate compartment fig 7c illustrates the influence of volume ratio on the water transport and concentrate factor in second stage ed it should be noted that a highest concentration factor 5 14 is achieved during two stage ed vd vc 4 1 furthermore the water transport is also proportional to the volume ratio as mentioned above the water osmosis caused by osmotic pressure difference will be intensified with the quantity of na2so4 in dilute compartment meanwhile the electro osmosis will be intensified at a high saline solution in the second stage ed process fig 7d illustrates the influence of volume ratio on the concentrate factor and water transport in second stage ed it shows that the energy consumption in second stage ed is much higher than that in first stage ed one possible reason is the processing capacity increased at a higher salt concentration therefore due to the leakage of coions the current efficiency decreases and simultaneously the energy consumption increases meanwhile the salt flux during the second stage ed is much higher than the first stage ed which is because the lower membrane stack resistance in first stage ed in general the ionic electrolyte is necessary to be concentrated to a high concentration through a two stage ed process in addition it should be noted that in lab scale experiment the energy consumption of electrode reaction maybe consumes a large amount of the total energy consumption the energy consumption in practical applications should be much lower than that in lab scale experiment 3 3 acid and base recovery via bmed process during the bmed process water transport caused by osmosis also emerged as an important factor due to the migration of na and so4 2 limiting the concentration of acid and base however a high saline solution is always required in the bmed process and simultaneously the feed solution concentration is expected to be decreased as much as possible therefore the bmed process was evaluated by decreasing the volume of the base acid solution vb va from 500 to 300 ml the feed solution was fixed at a constant initial volume of 500 ml furthermore three types of commercial membranes bp 1e amx cmx bp 1e aha cmb and bp 1e fab fkb were investigated in bmed process as it can be seen in fig 8 a when the volume ratio changes from 500 500 500 to 500 300 300 the final oh concentration improves from 1 45 to 2 03 mol l and simultaneously the final h concentration increases from 1 51 to 2 35 mol l importantly the demand global market concerning high acid base concentrations is always increasing due to the high value of these chemicals however in ed applications the final h oh concentration could diffuse from acid base solution to feed solution under concentration gradient in this case the final h oh concentration presents a stable trend at the later period of the experiment from this phenomenon the investigation of different membrane stacks on the acid base production with high concentration is necessary fig 8b illustrates the effect of membrane type on the acid base production the final oh concentration of the bp 1e amx cmx stack is 2 03 mol l while the final h concentration of the bp 1e aha cmb stack and bp 1e fab fkb stack are 1 73 and 1 62 mol l respectively demonstrating that the water splitting capability of bp 1e cmx amx stack is the best this can be ascribed to the following two reasons on the one hand a higher water splitting capability of the bipolar membrane usually results in more h oh ions thereby maintaining the electric neutrality in the corresponding compartment on the other hand membrane resistance differently with three membrane stacks membranes with dense structure can maximum the stack resistance thereby reducing the base acid concentration in the base acid compartment therefore it can be inferred that the bp 1e amx cmx stack is suitable for acid base production with high efficiency 4 conclusions this work proposes an integration ro ed bmed process for sustainable recovery of resources from cold rolling wastewater i e na2so4 concentrating base acid recovery and fresh water regeneration the ro membrane has achieved 3 17 times pre concentration of salts in wastewater in ed process the effect of voltage drop membrane type and volume ratio were investigated according to concentration factor energy consumption and water transport results show that cmx amx stack exhibit better performance in terms of concentration factor and na2so4 average flux the concentration factor was proportional to the increment of volume ratio and a higher average flux can be obtained at volume ratio 4 1 specifically a highest average flux was accomplished at volume ratio 4 1 via second stage ed through the operation of bmed base and acid can be generated from the high saline solution via an optimal bp 1e amx cmx stack furthermore the change of volume ratios vf vb va 5 3 3 between feed base and acid solution significantly increased the final h oh concentration hence the hybrid ro ed bmed process proves a strong technical applicability for sustainable resource recovery from cold rolling wastewater in consideration of closing the material circulation and minimizing the liquid discharge

13667,activated sludge was submitted to the aerobic dynamic feeding strategy in a sequencing batch reactor sbr to evaluate the effect of the carbon nitrogen c n ratio on the polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulation capability the sbr was operated for 233 days using leachates from the stabilization of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes ofmsw as carbon source with a volatile fatty acids vfa content of 13 95 7 81 g cod l the influence of the c n ratio on pha accumulation capability was evaluated by supplementing the leachates with acetate or ammonium then applying c n ratios within the range of 13 3 to 42 1 low c n ratios of 13 3 and 23 3 promoted pha accumulation in form of polyhydroxybutyrate phb reaching a maximum of 16 8 stored whereas the application of the highest c n ratios led to a reduction on the pha accumulation capacity this probably due to an inhibition induced by the high carbon concentration moreover during the experimental period it was observed that the reduction on the respiration activity of the culture reflected in a decreasing on the specific oxygen uptake rate sour from 1 67 down to 0 42 mg o2 g vss min this phenomenon could be the result of the continuous exposure of the microorganisms to long famine periods as well as the inhibitory effect of specific organic compounds commonly found in leachates overall the phb production is negatively

represents an environmentally friendly alternative as a substitute for synthetic plastics due to their nature and biological origin pha are bio polymers that consist of hydroxylic acid monomers linked by an ester bond they are synthesized intracellularly by microorganisms as cytoplasmic inclusions for carbon and energy storage forming granules with an average diameter between 0 2 and 0 5 μm these materials are biocompatible biodegradable and usually present crystallinity thermal and mechanical properties similar to synthetic plastics such as hydrophobicity resistance to uv no toxicity and a lower density than water 1 3 pha synthesis requires 3 hydroxy acids or α hydroxy acids as primary substrates among them acetic acid is the most significant 4 it moves into the cell by active transport at the expense of an adenosine triphosphate atp mol being intracellularly activated to acetyl coa at the expense of another atp mol through the β oxidation pathway 5 7 fig 1 acetyl coa is regularly consumed in the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca for atp synthesis in the presence of an excess of a carbon source acetyl coa is drifted to the pha synthesis pathway in which two acetyl coa units will be condensed to form acetoacetyl coa by the β ketothiolase enzyme then a reductase dependent of nadph reduces acetoacetyl coa to r hydroxy acyl coa being r alkyl groups with 1 11 c atoms polyester synthases or pha synthases are the key enzymes in pha biosynthesis as they catalyze the polymerization of r hydroxy acyl coa thioesters to polyesters with the concomitant liberation of coa as well as the conversion of r 3 hydroxybutyril coa to poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb which is the most frequently reported form of pha 5 7 currently the production of pha has been successfully carried out using pure strains 8 9 or mixed microbial cultures mmc fed with synthetic mineral media rich in volatile fatty acids vfa this is achieved by a process composed of two stages 1 enrichment of mixed microbial cultures under the aerobic dynamic feeding strategy with alternating feast famine conditions and 2 maximization of pha accumulation with vfa pulses 10 13 however the use of synthetic mineral media and pure strains under sterile conditions increases production costs making the pha unattractive for mass production in order to overcome this issue several wastes and wastewater types have been studied for pha production using mmc including a first fermentation step for the organic matter conversion to vfa consequently the interest of the utilization of either agricultural wastes the organic fraction of municipal solids wastes ofmsw wastewaters ww and even wasted polystyrene as substrate media for pha synthesis has grown substantially 14 17 this represents a sustainable alternative which allows the revalorization of wastes and their stabilization among the different types of waste ofmsw naturally undergoes an acidic fermentation producing organic leachates characterized by being rich in short chain vfa with an average content ranging from 16 to 24 g l with acetic acid as the main component 71 18 this aspect represents a technical advantage allowing the use of leachates as a direct carbon source for the pha production avoiding the pre fermentation stage in such a way that their application as substrate medium in mmc feeding could considerably reduce the costs and simplify the overall pha production process in this regard korkakaki et al 17 and colombo et al 19 reported that leachates from ofmsw produced under controlled conditions are suitable for polyhydroxybutyrate phb production using mmc under an aerobic dynamic feeding adf regime based on the application of alternating feast famine conditions however there is still a lack of information about the assesstment of the factors which can potentialize the pha production when the substrate for mmc is a complex medium rich in vfa for this reason the present study aims to evaluate the effect of the carbon nitrogen c n ratio towards pha accumulation capacity of a mixed culture acclimated to the adf feast famine regime as well as the the long term performance of the sequencing batch reactor sbr fed with diluted compost leachates from the stabilization of the ofmsw 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbr reactor for pha accumulating biomass enrichment the experimental unit was a sbr of 5 l of working volume

ratio resulting in the application of c n ratios of 25 2 38 1 and 41 2 mg c mg n table 1 another assay consisted of an increase of the nitrogen concentration by the addition of ammonium chloride resulting in a c n ratio of 13 3 table 1 assays with 13 3 and 23 2 c n ratios were evaluated on days 30 and 60 while those containing 25 2 38 1 and 41 2 c n ratios were assessed on days 103 118 and 133 respectively 2 3 1 analytical methods analysis performed to determine the physicochemical composition of raw leachate influent and effluent of the sbr consisted of determining ph total and soluble cod tcod and scod ammonium orthophosphates and volatile suspended solids concentration according to standard methods 20 total orgánic carbon toc was determined using a hach high range total organic carbon kit 10128 vfa were quantified by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector fid detector and at 1000 column pha in the culture were identified by staining with nile blue using fluorescence microscopy at 460 nm olympus bx 50 japan where yellow orange fluorescent polymer inclusions could be observed 21 pha quantification was performed using the gravimetric method adapted from hahn et al 22 for every 10 ml of mixed liquor five drops of formaldehyde at 7 were added to inhibit microbial activity then the sample was dried at 100 c for every 20 mg of dry biomass 1 ml of sodium hypochlorite solution 4 5 weight volume and 1 ml of chloroform 99 v v were added each sample was stirred at 200 rpm and 30 c over 2 5 h and subsequently centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the organic phase containing the polymer was separated and methanol was added until precipitation then the sample was allowed to stand overnight at 4 c afterwards the sample was evaporated at 60 c and followed by three washes with methanol were performed finally the extracted polymer was dried and weighed and reported as g pha g vss or pha according to serafim et al 12 polymer composition was determined according to the method proposed by law and slepecky 23 for poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb in this method 10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid were added to a sample of the extracted polymer and heated in a water bath using a hot plate cimarec thermo scientific usa at 100 c for 15 min to transform the polymer into crotonic acid the resulting sample was then analyzed by spectrometry scanning from 200 to 275 nm genesys 10s uv vis thermo scientific ma usa phb identification occurred when the hydrolyzed sample s absorbance was equaled to the crotonic acid maximum absorbance at a wavelength of 235 nm pha was characterized by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy dry samples were equilibrated at laboratory humidity 40 rh and placed directly onto the glass plate for measurements fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded on a perkin elmer spectrophotometer spectrum 100 perkin elmer waltham ma usa equipped with a crystal diamond universal atr sampling accessory where each spectrum representes an average of four scans all spectra were deconvoluted using gaussian and lorentzian functions in this case the assumed line shape was lorentzian with a half width of 15 cm 1 and resolution enhancement factor 1 5 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was used to compare mean mass values of accumulated phb at different c n ratios a tukey s test was used to compare mean values and assess the significance of the differences between mean values using the spss statistical software version 25 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 ofmsw leachates characterization fresh raw leachates had an acidic ph of 4 67 0 32 with a scod between 92 and 96 of tcod and a nitrogen limitating concentration of 1 1 g l table 2 vfa content as cod was 13 95 7 81 g cod vfa l with a proportion of 52 16 28 4 of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids respectively due to acetic acid predominance which is the primary substrate for pha synthesis 4 compost leachates were considered an appropriate medium for enriching pha accumulating microorganisms the concentration of contaminants in the leachates sampled in this study was similar to that reported by castilla hernández et al 18 who monitored the same composting plant for 2 years reporting average values of tcod of 100 1 16 6 in raining seasons and 119 11 6 g l for dry seasons and an ammonium concentration of 0 8 0 4 g l however they reported a higher vfa concentration with an interval value of 16 2 24 5 g l for both studies it was observed a wide variability in the composition of the leachates for all the analyzed parameters this variation is due to the natural change within the composition of the organic wastes as well as by climatic factors like seasonality 3 2 sbr performance the sbr operated under the aerobic dynamic feeding strategy to select those microorganisms able to accumulate pha the overall experimental period consisted of 233 days fig 2 during this time the mmc exhibited tcod scod n nh4 and p po4 3 average removal efficiencies of 64 6 13 5 79 6 6 6 99 2 1 0 and 75 6 15 5 respectively these values are lower than those reported by bengtsson et al 14 who achieved scod removal efficiencies of 90 using prefermented paper mill wastewater and liu et al 24 who obtained a 84 scod removal using the effluent from the tomato cannery industry the low organic removal efficiency indicates that leachates contained a fraction of recalcitrant organic compounds consisting of long chain fatty acids proteins and humic acids regarding n nh4 and inorganic phosphate po4 3 removal the culture showed a high performance which is comparable to other studies 24 during operation biomass to substrate yield coefficient yx s was around 0 58 g vss g scod suggesting that more than 50 of the consumed substrate was used for biomass synthesis this fact provoked the daily purge of biomass in order to maintain a constant concentration close to 2 0 g vss l in the reactor 2 13 0 35 which resulted in a sludge retention time srt of 3 8 days it is considered that such a short srt was not a limitation for pha accumulation since it was reported that phosphate accumulating organisms pao which present a high pha accumulation capacity require a minimum srt of 1 25 d 25 in this respect albuquerque et al 10 and coats et al 26 reported biopolymers production at srt of 1 4 and 10 days whereas chua et al 27 reported high pha accumulation at srt of 3 days these results indicate that the srt is not a key factor on the pha accumulation process the sour and the first order our ko2 were determined during the entire experimentation fig 3 the sour ranged within the initial 15 days reaching a maximum of 1 67 mg o2 g vss min in the second month fig 3a indicating the mmc s successful acclimation to the feast famine regime nevertheless after four months under the same regime a decreasing sour trend was observed with values going as low as 0 95 mg o2 g vss min in the fourth month indicating the mmc respiratory capability loss after this the sbr was operated with the basal feeding for biomass recovery which allowed an increase on the sour up to 1 42 0 75 mg o2 g vss min during the fifth month to then present a new decrease to a minimum value of 0 42 0 04 mg o2 g vss min suggesting that when the culture is submited to long famine periods the loss on its respiratory activity could be expected the first order our ko2 followed a similar pattern fig 3b with a decrease from a mean value of 0 57 min 1 in the first month down to 0 14 min 1 in the last month of operation in this case where the wide disperssion of the values were reported fig 3 this effect can be attributed to the natural variation of the composition of leachates used as fed for the sbr table 2 the reduction on the respiratory activity of the cultures has already been reported before by ramírez 28 who used a synthetic culture medium added with acetate propionate 70 30 for phb synthesis attributing volumetric oxygen uptake rate diminution to the culture s age in this study the loss of respiratory capability can be attributed to the culture s continuous exposure to the feast famine regime and the leachate fed s nitrogen limitation conditions the feast famine regime applied during the aeration stage consisted on approximately 1 25 h of feast per 10 75 h of famine resulting in a feast famine ratio of 0 11 h h this value is within the interval pointed out by colombo et al 19 and morgan et al 29 who suggested that a desirable value for acclimation and selection of pha accumulating biomass should be less than 0 2 h h however the prolonged exposition of the culture to extended famine periods is a factor that leads to the continuous consumption of endogenous reserves e g glycogen and pha and to an eventual biomass decay which could influence the respiratory capability loss moreover organic leachates may contain different organic compounds such as humic substances which can be toxic for a long term reactor operation accordingly korkakaki et al 17 tested several leachates dilutions over the growth rate of a pure culture of p acidovorans resulting in a reduction of the specific oxygen uptake rate sour when increasing the fraction of leacheate 3 3 effect of acetic acid increasing concentrations 3 3 1 phb accumulation kinetic control assay c n ratio of 23 2 this assay was carried out after 30 days of operation which is equivalent to 15 hrt of acclimation to the feast famine regime time after which nile blue staining revealed the presence of pha inclusions in the culture cells pha obtained in this work was identified as phb with a composition in agreement with that reported by serafim et al 12 who fed an acclimated mixed culture with acetic acid as the sole carbon source it is also in accordance with ramírez 28 when acetate and propionate 70 30 were used for phb synthesis as well as with albuquerque et al 10 and marang et al 30 who used acetic and butyric acids as their primary carbon sources the consumption and accumulation patterns followed by the control assay c n of 23 2 is shown in fig 4 after feeding do got reduced down to 0 07 mg l in 5 min fig 4a at a sour of 1 209 mg o2 g vss min and a first order our ko2 of 0 795 min 1 table 3 do concentration remained between 0 07 and 0 18 mg l during 74 min the time in which the available carbon sources such as vfa were consumed while the phb was synthesized and accumulated fig 4b from this time onwards do increased gradually indicating the feast stage ending and the famine stage beginning as shown in fig 4a toc was consumed within the first 240 min at a rate qc of 0 949 mg l min table 3 leading to a maximum removal efficiency of 81 which resulted in a remnant of 66 2 mg l of non available carbon for phb synthesis these residues might be composed by long chain fatty acids and proteins which can be hardly degraded acetate fig 4b was completely consumed within 80 min at an uptake rate qc acetate of 0 852 mg l min and a first order rate kc acetate of 0 026 min 1 table 3 while propionate and butyrate were consumed in 40 min at a rate qc vfa of 0 984 mg l min fig 4b phb accumulation was observed simultaneously to vfa consumption at a specific rate qs phb of 0 066 g g vss h fig 4a and table 3 with a product to substrate yield coefficient yp s of 0 1037 and a maximum accumulation after 90 min of 16 81 the phb production obtained in this study is lower than other reports using leachates from ofmsw korkakaki et al 17 and colombo et al 19 attained 20 2 and 36 3 respectively however in the first case the leachate was obtained from an acidogenic reactor under controlled conditions at a laboratory scale whyle in the second case the leachates received a pretreatment to remove nitrogen therefore it can be inferred that the application of pretreatments to the leachates can potentialize the phb accumulation however the addition of pretreatment stages can make more complex the global process of pha production making it unnatractive for its industrial scalation fig 5 shows phosphate and ammonium uptake profiles phosphate initial concentration was 33 4 mg l which was removed at a rate qpo4 3 of 0 0516 mg l min table 3 achieving 54 5 removal this value is lower than that reported by liu et al 24 who obtained 76 using tomato cannery wastewater although phosphate removal is comparatively low it can be considered that the mmc had enough phosphorus for phb synthesis since the transportation of atp for acetate and is later activated to acetyl coa is achieved from the phosphate removed under aerobic conditions 7 31 the ammonium initial concentration of 15 mg n nh4 l was depleted in 80 min at a rate qn nh4 of 0 292 mg l min table 3 it is worth noting that ammonium is consumed along with oxygen and c vfa and when ammonium is depleted phb synthesis stops as can be seen in figs 4a 4 b and 5 3 3 2 phb accumulation kinetic assays at c n ratios of 25 2 38 1 and 41 2 for the kinetic assay at a c n ratio of 25 2 the do diminished to a minimum value of 1 1 mg l after feeding and then it gradually started to increase after 7 min of the beginning of the assay fig 6 this behavior resulted on considerably low sour and first order our of 0 351 mg vss min and 0 30 min 1 respectively which were around three times smaller than those observed for the control table 3 the sour reduction was accompanied by a reduction on the c acetate volumetric uptake rate to 0 615 mg l min and the first order uptake rate to 0 009 min 1 due to an initial lag phase of 30 min fig 7 a consequently c vfa and toc consumption rates went down to 0 897 and 0 728 mg l min respectively fig 8 a 8b and table 3 nevertheless acetate and other vfa were completely consumed in a comparatively longer time the change of the substrate consumption rates was reflected in the phb specific accumulation rate that attained 0 012 g g ssv h which is 5 5 times smaller than that found in the control assay in contrast maximum accumulation was 15 1 fig 7a and table 3 ammonium was utterly consumed within the first 80 min of the cycle fig 9 a whereas from the phosphate in leachates 68 3 was consumed fig 9b for both cases the consumption pattern was comparable to the one observed for the control assay being independent of the oxygen and carbon source uptake table 3 for a c n ratio of 38 1 an increase in c acetate and c vfa volumetric uptake rate was registered at values of 0 945 mg l min and 1 347 mg l min respectively figs 7b and 8 a the acetate first order consumption rate kc acetate diminished seven times when compared against the control assay furthermore fig 6 shows that the oxygen uptake profile in the first 16 min reached a minimum of 0 67 mg l afterward there was an erratic profile and an apparent culture medium saturation initiated at 180 min consequently a diminution in the sour and first order uptake rate was observed with values of 0 180 mg o2 g vss min and 0 094 min 1 respectively table 3 in this assay c acetate consumption diminished to 78 2 fig 7b and c vfa consumption to 81 2 fig 8a the decrease in these parameters resulted in the decline of phb accumulation fig 7a attaining 10 48 accumulated phb at a specific rate of 0 006 g g vss h table 3 this result suggests that the carbon source concentration was excessive and inhibited the phb synthesis pathway probably a significant fraction of the formed acetyl coa was drifted to the tca pathway for cell maintenance which results on the pha degradation since these substances are intracellular polymers used as carbon and energy sources 5 31 in turn ammonium was completely consumed in 80 min fig 9a as well as 75 3 of phosphate fig 9b both processes were independent of oxygen and carbon uptake with consumption rates being comparable to those of the control assay table 3 a rapid diminution of all kinetic parameters occurred for a c n ratio of 41 2 fig 6 shows that the respiratory pattern for this c n ratio is entirely different from the one observed in the control assay do diminished to 1 6 mg l in 15 min immediately culture medium saturation began indicating that the culture stoped consuming the available substrates as shown in figs 7b 8 a and 8 b the culture was not able to consume all available organic carbon sources probably due to the disproportionate carbon concentration and nitrogen limitation the maximum c acetate consumption was 51 7 at a volumetric rate of 0 498 mg l min and a first order rate close to zero consequently c vfa consumption diminished to 53 4 fig 8a and the consumption rate to 0 562 mg l min resulting in a residual toc of 243 mg l fig 8b in this case it is considered that the formed acetyl coa was completely drifted to the tca cycle for cell maintenance 5 31 in this case the amount of phb at the beginning of the cycle was quite similar to that observed at the end of the assay fig 7a and the difference between their values can be attributed to experimental error therefore phb specific accumulation rate and yield coefficients were zero table 3 for this c n ratio ammonium was entirely consumed within 100 min fig 9a whereas only 70 4 of phosphate was removed fig 9b consumption rates for both nutrients were similar to those determined in other ratios assayed table 3 in all c n ratios used in this study the ammonium was the limiting nutirient being completely consumed before the start of the famine stage this behavior has been reported for low c n ratios in wich the low ammonium concentration induces its fast consumption johnson et al 11 on other hand the phosphate consumption showed a delay with respect to that of the toc this pattern is similar to the one reported by rodgers et al 32 who indicated that phosphate will not be absorbed if there is an excess of available organic carbon under aerobic conditions 3 4 effect of the increase in nitrogen concentration in phb accumulation c n ratio of 13 3 leachates were added with ammonium 31 mg n nh4 l to evaluate the effect of a c n ratio lower than that of the control assay this experiment was performed after 60 days of culture acclimation the leachate batch used to prepare the feeding was not further added with an external carbon source fig 10 a shows oxygen organic carbon uptake and phb accumulation profiles a higher oxygen uptake rate was observed compared to the other c n ratios since oxygen diminished to 0 02 mg l in 2 min after feeding at a sour of 2 458 mg o2 g vss min and a ko2 of 1 89 min 1 table 3 to remain between 0 01 and 0 02 mg l during the following 115 min these uptake rates are 5 and 2 times higher than those of the control assay indicating that a higher amount of nitrogen promotes the respiratory culture process organic carbon was consumed within the first 240 min at a rate of 1 348 mg l min resulting on a remaining concentration at the end of the cycle of 141 mg l and a removal of 65 7 fig 10a the partial consumption of the carbon sources at all the assessed c n ratios confirms that leachates formed from the composting of ofmsw contain a non available carbon fraction regarding the vfa acetate was consumed and depleted fig 10b during the first 120 min at a volumetric rate qc acetate of 0 659 mg l min and a first order rate kc acetate of 0 018 min 1 this resulted on a maximum phb of 13 96 accumulated in 90 min at a specific rate qs phb of 0 042 g g vss h for a yield coefficient of 0 098 table 3 moreover when the carbon sources were depleted it was observed a parcial phb consumption which confirms the use of phb as carbon and energy sources by the mmc during the famine stage fig 10a this behavior is similar to that presented when using c n ratios of 23 2 38 1 fig 7a the highest sour was registered in this assay table 3 which was twice higher than that of the control this fact suggests that the reduction on the c n ratio allows the microbial culture to partially recover its respiratory capacity despite this fact no significant differences were found in the phb accumulation capacity and on the product to substrate yield coefficient yp s with respect to the control assay table 3 fig 11 depicts ammonium and phosphate consumption profiles ammonium consumption had a lag phase of 60 min afterward it was utterly consumed in 180 min simultaneously with organic carbon and acetate fig 9a and b at a rate qn nh4 of 0 17 mg l min being the lowest rate registered among all assays similarly phosphate also showed a lag phase of 100 min and 50 2 was consumed at a rate qpo4 3 of 0 0614 mg l min compared to other studies johnson et al 11 obtained a maximum phb accumulation of 7 4 at a low c n ratio of 12 85 using a mineral media containing sodium acetate as the sole carbon source the kinetic behaviour was similary to the observed in the present study characterized by the depletion of ammonia during the feast stage this indicates that the presence of ammonium and its consumption during feast stage is fundamental for the phb production in such a way that application of low c n ratios allows a higher nitrogen availability which leads to a higher phb productivity results obtained in this study are compared with those reported elsewhere using wastewaters containing vfa prefermented wastewaters and mineral culture mediums added with vfa table 4 the phb accumulation results obtained for c n ratios of 13 3 23 3 and 25 2 are similar to those reported by bengtsson et al 14 who attained 11 of pha using fermented wastewater from the paper industry with acetate as the predominant vfa furthermore liu et al 24 attained a maximum of 11 of accumulated pha using raw tomato cannery wastewater similarly morgan et al 33 obtained 8 7 using fermented centrate from waste sludge stabilization nevertheless korkakaki et al 17 and colombo et al 19 attained 20 2 and 36 3 respectively in enrichments acclimated with leachates from the acidic stabilization of ofmsw regarding the use of synthetic media containing sodium acetate as sole carbon source serafim et al 12 reports phb accumulation yields of 17 5 32 8 and 38 4 at c n ratios of 18 37 and 73 respectively in a similar way johnson et al 11 obtained a phb accumulation of 36 at a c n ratio of 20 5 additionally ramírez 28 used an acetate propionate mixture 70 30 as carbon sources at a c n ratio of 7 obtaining 15 pha contrastingly marang et al 30 obtained a phb accumulation of 54 at a c n ratio of 6 using an acetate butyrate mixture in a proportion 2 1 concluding that such proportion is a preferred substrate over acetate for phb synthesis as shown in table 4 increasing c n ratios using synthetic culture mediums positively influenced the phb accumulation except in the case of the results reported by marang et al 30 nevertheless regarding the use of real effluents of complex composition increasing c n ratios can result on an inhibitory effect due to the presence and accumulation of several toxic or recalcitrant compounds this is reflected on a reduction on the cabron uptake rates and the consequent fall on the phb accumulation as well as on the loss on the respiratory activity on the long term operation 3 5 carbon balance mass balance for the different c n ratios used in the present study showed that c a and other vfa were consumed but not fully incorporated into phb table 5 the maximum c vfa incorporated into phb was 9 4 and was observed for the c n ratio of 13 3 however with the increase in the carbon source concentration the fraction of c a incorporated to phb diminished to a value close to zero this result was probably associated with the decrease of the respiratory capacity exhibited when high c n ratios kinetics were applied it is coincident that as the c n ratio increased sour diminished along with phb accumulation capacity due to the reduction of the carbon fraction incorporated to phb these results suggest that the culture used a large proportion of the supplied vfa for growth and cellular maintenance and only a small fraction for phb accumulation reflected in the yx s value of 0 58 table 3 in this case the increase in acetic acid concentration diverted carbon from phb synthesis pathway to other metabolic processes thus the small amount of carbon from acetate incorporated to phb clearly indicates a switch in metabolic pathways in which part of the formed acetylcoa was probably drifted to the tca pathway for cell mantainance instead to phb formation 5 31 this behavior is similar to that reported by narancic et al 34 who used a pure strain rhodospirillum rubrum obtaining an incorporation of carbon to phb of only 15 with the rest being assimilated as bacterial biomass which shows that this behavior is commonly observed in pure strains and mmc it is worth to note that c n ratio modification based on increasing acetic acid concentration induced a modification on the vfa species ratio e g propionic butyric and valeric acids producing an unbalance which could have influenced the fraction of carbon incorporated as phb since other vfa species are also associated with phb accumulation 4 35 36 3 6 ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy was conducted to assess the functional groups of the obtained biopolymer the resulting ftir spectrum is presented in fig 12 showing the presence of different conformational bands 37 the peaks in the region 2800 3100 cm 1 are related to stretching vibrations of c h bonds in particular the absorption band at about 2934 cm 1 is commonly ascribed to an asymmetric methyl group the large peak at 1724 cm 1 is attributed to co groups in the pha polyester and confirmed by the co functional group s vibrations in the 1280 cm 1 band the band at 1185 cm 1 is related to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the distinct coc group these bands are similar to those reported by arcos et al 38 in mixed cultures for pha kanzis et al 39 misra et al 40 who confirmed phb presence in a band around 1730 cm 1 and 1724 cm 1 respectively regarding pure strains azizi et al 41 and tugarova et al 42 detected the same bands for cupriavidus necator and azospirillum brasilense the bands in 1280 1300 cm 1 correspond to small chain length pha such as phb and the bands around 1279 1228 and 1185 cm 1 are sensitive to the degree of crystallinity which differentiates phb from being more crystalline than polyhydroxyvalerate phv the diverse peaks about 1185 cm 1 reflect stretching vibrations of the coc group the above groups location agrees with previous studies 43 44 demonstrating that the accumulated biopolymer corresponds to phb 4 conclusions the leachates from ofmsw are an alternative substrate source for pha synthesis in form of phb due to its high acetic acid content allowing obtaining comparable accumulation yields to those reported for other effluents giving a valorization to this toxic waste the c n ratios are a key factor for the phb production c n ratios that resulted adequate for phb accumulation were 13 3 23 2 and 25 2 attaining a maximum of 14 16 81 and 15 1 respectively the application of c n ratios higher than 25 2 negatively affected the phb accumulation specific rate and product yield coefficient promoting catabolic pathways that lead to the biomass growth against the metabolic pathway of phb synthesis the feeding of the culture with organic leachates and the continuous exposure to long famine periods leads to the loss of its respiratory activity affecting the capability of the mmc to incorporate the carbon into phb declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

13667,activated sludge was submitted to the aerobic dynamic feeding strategy in a sequencing batch reactor sbr to evaluate the effect of the carbon nitrogen c n ratio on the polyhydroxyalkanoates pha accumulation capability the sbr was operated for 233 days using leachates from the stabilization of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes ofmsw as carbon source with a volatile fatty acids vfa content of 13 95 7 81 g cod l the influence of the c n ratio on pha accumulation capability was evaluated by supplementing the leachates with acetate or ammonium then applying c n ratios within the range of 13 3 to 42 1 low c n ratios of 13 3 and 23 3 promoted pha accumulation in form of polyhydroxybutyrate phb reaching a maximum of 16 8 stored whereas the application of the highest c n ratios led to a reduction on the pha accumulation capacity this probably due to an inhibition induced by the high carbon concentration moreover during the experimental period it was observed that the reduction on the respiration activity of the culture reflected in a decreasing on the specific oxygen uptake rate sour from 1 67 down to 0 42 mg o2 g vss min this phenomenon could be the result of the continuous exposure of the microorganisms to long famine periods as well as the inhibitory effect of specific organic compounds commonly found in leachates overall the phb production is negatively

represents an environmentally friendly alternative as a substitute for synthetic plastics due to their nature and biological origin pha are bio polymers that consist of hydroxylic acid monomers linked by an ester bond they are synthesized intracellularly by microorganisms as cytoplasmic inclusions for carbon and energy storage forming granules with an average diameter between 0 2 and 0 5 μm these materials are biocompatible biodegradable and usually present crystallinity thermal and mechanical properties similar to synthetic plastics such as hydrophobicity resistance to uv no toxicity and a lower density than water 1 3 pha synthesis requires 3 hydroxy acids or α hydroxy acids as primary substrates among them acetic acid is the most significant 4 it moves into the cell by active transport at the expense of an adenosine triphosphate atp mol being intracellularly activated to acetyl coa at the expense of another atp mol through the β oxidation pathway 5 7 fig 1 acetyl coa is regularly consumed in the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca for atp synthesis in the presence of an excess of a carbon source acetyl coa is drifted to the pha synthesis pathway in which two acetyl coa units will be condensed to form acetoacetyl coa by the β ketothiolase enzyme then a reductase dependent of nadph reduces acetoacetyl coa to r hydroxy acyl coa being r alkyl groups with 1 11 c atoms polyester synthases or pha synthases are the key enzymes in pha biosynthesis as they catalyze the polymerization of r hydroxy acyl coa thioesters to polyesters with the concomitant liberation of coa as well as the conversion of r 3 hydroxybutyril coa to poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb which is the most frequently reported form of pha 5 7 currently the production of pha has been successfully carried out using pure strains 8 9 or mixed microbial cultures mmc fed with synthetic mineral media rich in volatile fatty acids vfa this is achieved by a process composed of two stages 1 enrichment of mixed microbial cultures under the aerobic dynamic feeding strategy with alternating feast famine conditions and 2 maximization of pha accumulation with vfa pulses 10 13 however the use of synthetic mineral media and pure strains under sterile conditions increases production costs making the pha unattractive for mass production in order to overcome this issue several wastes and wastewater types have been studied for pha production using mmc including a first fermentation step for the organic matter conversion to vfa consequently the interest of the utilization of either agricultural wastes the organic fraction of municipal solids wastes ofmsw wastewaters ww and even wasted polystyrene as substrate media for pha synthesis has grown substantially 14 17 this represents a sustainable alternative which allows the revalorization of wastes and their stabilization among the different types of waste ofmsw naturally undergoes an acidic fermentation producing organic leachates characterized by being rich in short chain vfa with an average content ranging from 16 to 24 g l with acetic acid as the main component 71 18 this aspect represents a technical advantage allowing the use of leachates as a direct carbon source for the pha production avoiding the pre fermentation stage in such a way that their application as substrate medium in mmc feeding could considerably reduce the costs and simplify the overall pha production process in this regard korkakaki et al 17 and colombo et al 19 reported that leachates from ofmsw produced under controlled conditions are suitable for polyhydroxybutyrate phb production using mmc under an aerobic dynamic feeding adf regime based on the application of alternating feast famine conditions however there is still a lack of information about the assesstment of the factors which can potentialize the pha production when the substrate for mmc is a complex medium rich in vfa for this reason the present study aims to evaluate the effect of the carbon nitrogen c n ratio towards pha accumulation capacity of a mixed culture acclimated to the adf feast famine regime as well as the the long term performance of the sequencing batch reactor sbr fed with diluted compost leachates from the stabilization of the ofmsw 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbr reactor for pha accumulating biomass enrichment the experimental unit was a sbr of 5 l of working volume inoculated with 2 7 l activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant at a concentration of 2 g volatile suspended solids vss l mmc was fed with organic leachates containing 8 28 up to 21 57 of vfa in form of chemical oxygen demand cod vfa for culture acclimation enrichment and long term run leachates were diluted with tap water at a final concentration of 1 0 g cod l resulting in an f

decreasing do slope produced due to the cod consumption during the feast phase specific oxygen uptake rate sour was calculated by dividing the our over the designed biomass concentration of 2 g vss l also a first order constant rate ko2 was determined from the oxygen consumption first order model eq 1 1 d c o 2 d t k c o 2 a similar first order model was used to calculate the constant rate for the available organic carbon consumption in acetate kc acetate 2 2 leachates from the ofmsw leachates were obtained from the ofmsw composting plant bordo poniente 19 27 41 3 n 99 01 04 2 w in mexico state the ofmsw is composed of solid fractions generated by households restaurants markets and tree prunings and grass clippings from mexico city batches of 20 l of leachates were collected and kept at 4 c for subsequent analysis at laboratory 2 3 kinetics assays with enriched mmc a first kinetic assay was performed on the 30th operation day at a 1 0 g cod l concentration and c n of 23 3 this experiment was considered the control assay for assessing the vfa and oxygen consumption dynamics and the consequent pha accumulation capability then the feeding was amended with acetic acid to increase the c n ratio resulting in the application of c n ratios of 25 2 38 1 and 41 2 mg c mg n table 1 another assay consisted of an increase of the nitrogen concentration by the addition of ammonium chloride resulting in a c n ratio of 13 3 table 1 assays with 13 3 and 23 2 c n ratios were evaluated on days 30 and 60 while those containing 25 2 38 1 and 41 2 c n ratios were assessed on days 103 118 and 133 respectively 2 3 1 analytical methods analysis performed to determine the physicochemical composition of raw leachate influent and effluent of the sbr consisted of determining ph total and soluble cod tcod and scod ammonium orthophosphates and volatile suspended solids concentration according to standard methods 20 total orgánic carbon toc was determined using a hach high range total organic carbon kit 10128 vfa were quantified by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector fid detector and at 1000 column pha in the culture were identified by staining with nile blue using fluorescence microscopy at 460 nm olympus bx 50 japan where yellow orange fluorescent polymer inclusions could be observed 21 pha quantification was performed using the gravimetric method adapted from hahn et al 22 for every 10 ml of mixed liquor five drops of formaldehyde at 7 were added to inhibit microbial activity then the sample was dried at 100 c for every 20 mg of dry biomass 1 ml of sodium hypochlorite solution 4 5 weight volume and 1 ml of chloroform 99 v v were added each sample was stirred at 200 rpm and 30 c over 2 5 h and subsequently centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the organic phase containing the polymer was separated and methanol was added until precipitation then the sample was allowed to stand overnight at 4 c afterwards the sample was evaporated at 60 c and followed by three washes with methanol were performed finally the extracted polymer was dried and weighed and reported as g pha g vss or pha according to serafim et al 12 polymer composition was determined according to the method proposed by law and slepecky 23 for poly 3 hydroxybutyric acid phb in this method 10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid were added to a sample of the extracted polymer and heated in a water bath using a hot plate cimarec thermo scientific usa at 100 c for 15 min to transform the polymer into crotonic acid the resulting sample was then analyzed by spectrometry scanning from 200 to 275 nm genesys 10s uv vis thermo scientific ma usa phb identification occurred when the hydrolyzed sample s absorbance was equaled to the crotonic acid maximum absorbance at a wavelength of 235 nm pha was characterized by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy dry samples were equilibrated at laboratory humidity 40 rh and placed directly onto the glass plate for measurements fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded on a perkin elmer spectrophotometer spectrum 100 perkin elmer waltham ma usa equipped with a crystal diamond universal atr sampling accessory where each spectrum representes an average of four scans all spectra were deconvoluted using gaussian and lorentzian functions in this case the assumed line shape was lorentzian with a half width of 15 cm 1 and resolution enhancement factor 1 5 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was used to compare mean mass values of accumulated phb at different c n ratios a tukey s test was used to compare mean values and assess the significance of the differences between mean values using the spss statistical software version 25 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 ofmsw leachates characterization fresh raw leachates had an acidic ph of 4 67 0 32 with a scod between 92 and 96 of tcod and a nitrogen limitating concentration of 1 1 g l table 2 vfa content as cod was 13 95 7 81 g cod vfa l with a proportion of 52 16 28 4 of acetic propionic butyric and valeric acids respectively due to acetic acid predominance which is the primary substrate for pha synthesis 4 compost leachates were considered an appropriate medium for enriching pha accumulating microorganisms the concentration of contaminants in the leachates sampled in this study was similar to that reported by castilla hernández et al 18 who monitored the same composting plant for 2 years reporting average values of tcod of 100 1 16 6 in raining seasons and 119 11 6 g l for dry seasons and an ammonium concentration of 0 8 0 4 g l however they reported a higher vfa concentration with an interval value of 16 2 24 5 g l for both studies it was observed a wide variability in the composition of the leachates for all the analyzed parameters this variation is due to the natural change within the composition of the organic wastes as well as by climatic factors like seasonality 3 2 sbr performance the sbr operated under the aerobic dynamic feeding strategy to select those microorganisms able to accumulate pha the overall experimental period consisted of 233 days fig 2 during this time the mmc exhibited tcod scod n nh4 and p po4 3 average removal efficiencies of 64 6 13 5 79 6 6 6 99 2 1 0 and 75 6 15 5 respectively these values are lower than those reported by bengtsson et al 14 who achieved scod removal efficiencies of 90 using prefermented paper mill wastewater and liu et al 24 who obtained a 84 scod removal using the effluent from the tomato cannery industry the low organic removal efficiency indicates that leachates contained a fraction of recalcitrant organic compounds consisting of long chain fatty acids proteins and humic acids regarding n nh4 and inorganic phosphate po4 3 removal the culture showed a high performance which is comparable to other studies 24 during operation biomass to substrate yield coefficient yx s was around 0 58 g vss g scod suggesting that more than 50 of the consumed substrate was used for biomass synthesis this fact provoked the daily purge of biomass in order to maintain a constant concentration close to 2 0 g vss l in the reactor 2 13 0 35 which resulted in a sludge retention time srt of 3 8 days it is considered that such a short srt was not a limitation for pha accumulation since it was reported that phosphate accumulating organisms pao which present a high pha accumulation capacity require a minimum srt of 1 25 d 25 in this respect albuquerque et al 10 and coats et al 26 reported biopolymers production at srt of 1 4 and 10 days whereas chua et al 27 reported high pha accumulation at srt of 3 days these results indicate that the srt is not a key factor on the pha accumulation process the sour and the first order our ko2 were determined during the entire experimentation fig 3 the sour ranged within the initial 15 days reaching a maximum of 1 67 mg o2 g vss min in the second month fig 3a indicating the mmc s successful acclimation to the feast famine regime nevertheless after four months under the same regime a decreasing sour trend was observed with values going as low as 0 95 mg o2 g vss min in the fourth month indicating the mmc respiratory capability loss after this the sbr was operated with the basal feeding for biomass recovery which allowed an increase on the sour up to 1 42 0 75 mg o2 g vss min during the fifth month to then present a new decrease to a minimum value of 0 42 0 04 mg o2 g vss min suggesting that when the culture is submited to long famine periods the loss on its respiratory activity could be expected the first order our ko2 followed a similar pattern fig 3b with a decrease from a mean value of 0 57 min 1 in the first month down to 0 14 min 1 in the last month of operation in this case where the wide disperssion of the values were reported fig 3 this effect can be attributed to the natural variation of the composition of leachates used as fed for the sbr table 2 the reduction on the respiratory activity of the cultures has already been reported before by ramírez 28 who used a synthetic culture medium added with acetate propionate 70 30 for phb synthesis attributing volumetric oxygen uptake rate diminution to the culture s age in this study the loss of respiratory capability can be attributed to the culture s continuous exposure to the feast famine regime and the leachate fed s nitrogen limitation conditions the feast famine regime applied during the aeration stage consisted on approximately 1 25 h of feast per 10 75 h of famine resulting in a feast famine ratio of 0 11 h h this value is within the interval pointed out by colombo et al 19 and morgan et al 29 who suggested that a desirable value for acclimation and selection of pha accumulating biomass should be less than 0 2 h h however the prolonged exposition of the culture to extended famine periods is a factor that leads to the continuous consumption of endogenous reserves e g glycogen and pha and to an eventual biomass decay which could influence the respiratory capability loss moreover organic leachates may contain different organic compounds such as humic substances which can be toxic for a long term reactor operation accordingly korkakaki et al 17 tested several leachates dilutions over the growth rate of a pure culture of p acidovorans resulting in a reduction of the specific oxygen uptake rate sour when increasing the fraction of leacheate 3 3 effect of acetic acid increasing concentrations 3 3 1 phb accumulation kinetic control assay c n ratio of 23 2 this assay was carried out after 30 days of operation which is equivalent to 15 hrt of acclimation to the feast famine regime time after which nile blue staining revealed the presence of pha inclusions in the culture cells pha obtained in this work was identified as phb with a composition in agreement with that reported by serafim et al 12 who fed an acclimated mixed culture with acetic acid as the sole carbon source it is also in accordance with ramírez 28 when acetate and propionate 70 30 were used for phb synthesis as well as with albuquerque et al 10 and marang et al 30 who used acetic and butyric acids as their primary carbon sources the consumption and accumulation patterns followed by the control assay c n of 23 2 is shown in fig 4 after feeding do got reduced down to 0 07 mg l in 5 min fig 4a at a sour of 1 209 mg o2 g vss min and a first order our ko2 of 0 795 min 1 table 3 do concentration remained between 0 07 and 0 18 mg l during 74 min the time in which the available carbon sources such as vfa were consumed while the phb was synthesized and accumulated fig 4b from this time onwards do increased gradually indicating the feast stage ending and the famine stage beginning as shown in fig 4a toc was consumed within the first 240 min at a rate qc of 0 949 mg l min table 3 leading to a maximum removal efficiency of 81 which resulted in a remnant of 66 2 mg l of non available carbon for phb synthesis these residues might be composed by long chain fatty acids and proteins which can be hardly degraded acetate fig 4b was completely consumed within 80 min at an uptake rate qc acetate of 0 852 mg l min and a first order rate kc acetate of 0 026 min 1 table 3 while propionate and butyrate were consumed in 40 min at a rate qc vfa of 0 984 mg l min fig 4b phb accumulation was observed simultaneously to vfa consumption at a specific rate qs phb of 0 066 g g vss h fig 4a and table 3 with a product to substrate yield coefficient yp s of 0 1037 and a maximum accumulation after 90 min of 16 81 the phb production obtained in this study is lower than other reports using leachates from ofmsw korkakaki et al 17 and colombo et al 19 attained 20 2 and 36 3 respectively however in the first case the leachate was obtained from an acidogenic reactor under controlled conditions at a laboratory scale whyle in the second case the leachates received a pretreatment to remove nitrogen therefore it can be inferred that the application of pretreatments to the leachates can potentialize the phb accumulation however the addition of pretreatment stages can make more complex the global process of pha production making it unnatractive for its industrial scalation fig 5 shows phosphate and ammonium uptake profiles phosphate initial concentration was 33 4 mg l which was removed at a rate qpo4 3 of 0 0516 mg l min table 3 achieving 54 5 removal this value is lower than that reported by liu et al 24 who obtained 76 using tomato cannery wastewater although phosphate removal is comparatively low it can be considered that the mmc had enough phosphorus for phb synthesis since the transportation of atp for acetate and is later activated to acetyl coa is achieved from the phosphate removed under aerobic conditions 7 31 the ammonium initial concentration of 15 mg n nh4 l was depleted in 80 min at a rate qn nh4 of 0 292 mg l min table 3 it is worth noting that ammonium is consumed along with oxygen and c vfa and when ammonium is depleted phb synthesis stops as can be seen in figs 4a 4 b and 5 3 3 2 phb accumulation kinetic assays at c n ratios of 25 2 38 1 and 41 2 for the kinetic assay at a c n ratio of 25 2 the do diminished to a minimum value of 1 1 mg l after feeding and then it gradually started to increase after 7 min of the beginning of the assay fig 6 this behavior resulted on considerably low sour and first order our of 0 351 mg vss min and 0 30 min 1 respectively which were around three times smaller than those observed for the control table 3 the sour reduction was accompanied by a reduction on the c acetate volumetric uptake rate to 0 615 mg l min and the first order uptake rate to 0 009 min 1 due to an initial lag phase of 30 min fig 7 a consequently c vfa and toc consumption rates went down to 0 897 and 0 728 mg l min respectively fig 8 a 8b and table 3 nevertheless acetate and other vfa were completely consumed in a comparatively longer time the change of the substrate consumption rates was reflected in the phb specific accumulation rate that attained 0 012 g g ssv h which is 5 5 times smaller than that found in the control assay in contrast maximum accumulation was 15 1 fig 7a and table 3 ammonium was utterly consumed within the first 80 min of the cycle fig 9 a whereas from the phosphate in leachates 68 3 was consumed fig 9b for both cases the consumption pattern was comparable to the one observed for the control assay being independent of the oxygen and carbon source uptake table 3 for a c n ratio of 38 1 an increase in c acetate and c vfa volumetric uptake rate was registered at values of 0 945 mg l min and 1 347 mg l min respectively figs 7b and 8 a the acetate first order consumption rate kc acetate diminished seven times when compared against the control assay furthermore fig 6 shows that the oxygen uptake profile in the first 16 min reached a minimum of 0 67 mg l afterward there was an erratic profile and an apparent culture medium saturation initiated at 180 min consequently a diminution in the sour and first order uptake rate was observed with values of 0 180 mg o2 g vss min and 0 094 min 1 respectively table 3 in this assay c acetate consumption diminished to 78 2 fig 7b and c vfa consumption to 81 2 fig 8a the decrease in these parameters resulted in the decline of phb accumulation fig 7a attaining 10 48 accumulated phb at a specific rate of 0 006 g g vss h table 3 this result suggests that the carbon source concentration was excessive and inhibited the phb synthesis pathway probably a significant fraction of the formed acetyl coa was drifted to the tca pathway for cell maintenance which results on the pha degradation since these substances are intracellular polymers used as carbon and energy sources 5 31 in turn ammonium was completely consumed in 80 min fig 9a as well as 75 3 of phosphate fig 9b both processes were independent of oxygen and carbon uptake with consumption rates being comparable to those of the control assay table 3 a rapid diminution of all kinetic parameters occurred for a c n ratio of 41 2 fig 6 shows that the respiratory pattern for this c n ratio is entirely different from the one observed in the control assay do diminished to 1 6 mg l in 15 min immediately culture medium saturation began indicating that the culture stoped consuming the available substrates as shown in figs 7b 8 a and 8 b the culture was not able to consume all available organic carbon sources probably due to the disproportionate carbon concentration and nitrogen limitation the maximum c acetate consumption was 51 7 at a volumetric rate of 0 498 mg l min and a first order rate close to zero consequently c vfa consumption diminished to 53 4 fig 8a and the consumption rate to 0 562 mg l min resulting in a residual toc of 243 mg l fig 8b in this case it is considered that the formed acetyl coa was completely drifted to the tca cycle for cell maintenance 5 31 in this case the amount of phb at the beginning of the cycle was quite similar to that observed at the end of the assay fig 7a and the difference between their values can be attributed to experimental error therefore phb specific accumulation rate and yield coefficients were zero table 3 for this c n ratio ammonium was entirely consumed within 100 min fig 9a whereas only 70 4 of phosphate was removed fig 9b consumption rates for both nutrients were similar to those determined in other ratios assayed table 3 in all c n ratios used in this study the ammonium was the limiting nutirient being completely consumed before the start of the famine stage this behavior has been reported for low c n ratios in wich the low ammonium concentration induces its fast consumption johnson et al 11 on other hand the phosphate consumption showed a delay with respect to that of the toc this pattern is similar to the one reported by rodgers et al 32 who indicated that phosphate will not be absorbed if there is an excess of available organic carbon under aerobic conditions 3 4 effect of the increase in nitrogen concentration in phb accumulation c n ratio of 13 3 leachates were added with ammonium 31 mg n nh4 l to evaluate the effect of a c n ratio lower than that of the control assay this experiment was performed after 60 days of culture acclimation the leachate batch used to prepare the feeding was not further added with an external carbon source fig 10 a shows oxygen organic carbon uptake and phb accumulation profiles a higher oxygen uptake rate was observed compared to the other c n ratios since oxygen diminished to 0 02 mg l in 2 min after feeding at a sour of 2 458 mg o2 g vss min and a ko2 of 1 89 min 1 table 3 to remain between 0 01 and 0 02 mg l during the following 115 min these uptake rates are 5 and 2 times higher than those of the control assay indicating that a higher amount of nitrogen promotes the respiratory culture process organic carbon was consumed within the first 240 min at a rate of 1 348 mg l min resulting on a remaining concentration at the end of the cycle of 141 mg l and a removal of 65 7 fig 10a the partial consumption of the carbon sources at all the assessed c n ratios confirms that leachates formed from the composting of ofmsw contain a non available carbon fraction regarding the vfa acetate was consumed and depleted fig 10b during the first 120 min at a volumetric rate qc acetate of 0 659 mg l min and a first order rate kc acetate of 0 018 min 1 this resulted on a maximum phb of 13 96 accumulated in 90 min at a specific rate qs phb of 0 042 g g vss h for a yield coefficient of 0 098 table 3 moreover when the carbon sources were depleted it was observed a parcial phb consumption which confirms the use of phb as carbon and energy sources by the mmc during the famine stage fig 10a this behavior is similar to that presented when using c n ratios of 23 2 38 1 fig 7a the highest sour was registered in this assay table 3 which was twice higher than that of the control this fact suggests that the reduction on the c n ratio allows the microbial culture to partially recover its respiratory capacity despite this fact no significant differences were found in the phb accumulation capacity and on the product to substrate yield coefficient yp s with respect to the control assay table 3 fig 11 depicts ammonium and phosphate consumption profiles ammonium consumption had a lag phase of 60 min afterward it was utterly consumed in 180 min simultaneously with organic carbon and acetate fig 9a and b at a rate qn nh4 of 0 17 mg l min being the lowest rate registered among all assays similarly phosphate also showed a lag phase of 100 min and 50 2 was consumed at a rate qpo4 3 of 0 0614 mg l min compared to other studies johnson et al 11 obtained a maximum phb accumulation of 7 4 at a low c n ratio of 12 85 using a mineral media containing sodium acetate as the sole carbon source the kinetic behaviour was similary to the observed in the present study characterized by the depletion of ammonia during the feast stage this indicates that the presence of ammonium and its consumption during feast stage is fundamental for the phb production in such a way that application of low c n ratios allows a higher nitrogen availability which leads to a higher phb productivity results obtained in this study are compared with those reported elsewhere using wastewaters containing vfa prefermented wastewaters and mineral culture mediums added with vfa table 4 the phb accumulation results obtained for c n ratios of 13 3 23 3 and 25 2 are similar to those reported by bengtsson et al 14 who attained 11 of pha using fermented wastewater from the paper industry with acetate as the predominant vfa furthermore liu et al 24 attained a maximum of 11 of accumulated pha using raw tomato cannery wastewater similarly morgan et al 33 obtained 8 7 using fermented centrate from waste sludge stabilization nevertheless korkakaki et al 17 and colombo et al 19 attained 20 2 and 36 3 respectively in enrichments acclimated with leachates from the acidic stabilization of ofmsw regarding the use of synthetic media containing sodium acetate as sole carbon source serafim et al 12 reports phb accumulation yields of 17 5 32 8 and 38 4 at c n ratios of 18 37 and 73 respectively in a similar way johnson et al 11 obtained a phb accumulation of 36 at a c n ratio of 20 5 additionally ramírez 28 used an acetate propionate mixture 70 30 as carbon sources at a c n ratio of 7 obtaining 15 pha contrastingly marang et al 30 obtained a phb accumulation of 54 at a c n ratio of 6 using an acetate butyrate mixture in a proportion 2 1 concluding that such proportion is a preferred substrate over acetate for phb synthesis as shown in table 4 increasing c n ratios using synthetic culture mediums positively influenced the phb accumulation except in the case of the results reported by marang et al 30 nevertheless regarding the use of real effluents of complex composition increasing c n ratios can result on an inhibitory effect due to the presence and accumulation of several toxic or recalcitrant compounds this is reflected on a reduction on the cabron uptake rates and the consequent fall on the phb accumulation as well as on the loss on the respiratory activity on the long term operation 3 5 carbon balance mass balance for the different c n ratios used in the present study showed that c a and other vfa were consumed but not fully incorporated into phb table 5 the maximum c vfa incorporated into phb was 9 4 and was observed for the c n ratio of 13 3 however with the increase in the carbon source concentration the fraction of c a incorporated to phb diminished to a value close to zero this result was probably associated with the decrease of the respiratory capacity exhibited when high c n ratios kinetics were applied it is coincident that as the c n ratio increased sour diminished along with phb accumulation capacity due to the reduction of the carbon fraction incorporated to phb these results suggest that the culture used a large proportion of the supplied vfa for growth and cellular maintenance and only a small fraction for phb accumulation reflected in the yx s value of 0 58 table 3 in this case the increase in acetic acid concentration diverted carbon from phb synthesis pathway to other metabolic processes thus the small amount of carbon from acetate incorporated to phb clearly indicates a switch in metabolic pathways in which part of the formed acetylcoa was probably drifted to the tca pathway for cell mantainance instead to phb formation 5 31 this behavior is similar to that reported by narancic et al 34 who used a pure strain rhodospirillum rubrum obtaining an incorporation of carbon to phb of only 15 with the rest being assimilated as bacterial biomass which shows that this behavior is commonly observed in pure strains and mmc it is worth to note that c n ratio modification based on increasing acetic acid concentration induced a modification on the vfa species ratio e g propionic butyric and valeric acids producing an unbalance which could have influenced the fraction of carbon incorporated as phb since other vfa species are also associated with phb accumulation 4 35 36 3 6 ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy was conducted to assess the functional groups of the obtained biopolymer the resulting ftir spectrum is presented in fig 12 showing the presence of different conformational bands 37 the peaks in the region 2800 3100 cm 1 are related to stretching vibrations of c h bonds in particular the absorption band at about 2934 cm 1 is commonly ascribed to an asymmetric methyl group the large peak at 1724 cm 1 is attributed to co groups in the pha polyester and confirmed by the co functional group s vibrations in the 1280 cm 1 band the band at 1185 cm 1 is related to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the distinct coc group these bands are similar to those reported by arcos et al 38 in mixed cultures for pha kanzis et al 39 misra et al 40 who confirmed phb presence in a band around 1730 cm 1 and 1724 cm 1 respectively regarding pure strains azizi et al 41 and tugarova et al 42 detected the same bands for cupriavidus necator and azospirillum brasilense the bands in 1280 1300 cm 1 correspond to small chain length pha such as phb and the bands around 1279 1228 and 1185 cm 1 are sensitive to the degree of crystallinity which differentiates phb from being more crystalline than polyhydroxyvalerate phv the diverse peaks about 1185 cm 1 reflect stretching vibrations of the coc group the above groups location agrees with previous studies 43 44 demonstrating that the accumulated biopolymer corresponds to phb 4 conclusions the leachates from ofmsw are an alternative substrate source for pha synthesis in form of phb due to its high acetic acid content allowing obtaining comparable accumulation yields to those reported for other effluents giving a valorization to this toxic waste the c n ratios are a key factor for the phb production c n ratios that resulted adequate for phb accumulation were 13 3 23 2 and 25 2 attaining a maximum of 14 16 81 and 15 1 respectively the application of c n ratios higher than 25 2 negatively affected the phb accumulation specific rate and product yield coefficient promoting catabolic pathways that lead to the biomass growth against the metabolic pathway of phb synthesis the feeding of the culture with organic leachates and the continuous exposure to long famine periods leads to the loss of its respiratory activity affecting the capability of the mmc to incorporate the carbon into phb declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

13668,the reduction of sulfate to sulfide was seldom considered for high salt wastewater treatment although sulfide could supply electron donors to remove nitrite the sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification were integrated in one biofilm enhanced high salt wastewater treatment system and the sulfate reduction was used as an intermediate reaction both the reactor performances and the spatial distribution of the bacterial communities were studied the metabolic pathways of carbon nitrogen and sulfur were also discussed based on functional genes analysis the removal efficiencies of nitrite and organics reached 100 attributed to the stable and functional bacterial community desulfobacter sulfurimonas fastidiosipila and pseudomonas were the dominant functional bacteria in the biofilm the abundance and diversity of bacteria decreased with the increase of water depth because the different spatial concentrations of the substrates brought the various strength of each bio reaction sulfate reduction was achieved through the assimilation pathway by various sulfate reduction genes the oxidation of sulfide and reduction of nitrite were achieved through the autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification pathways with functional genes the seawater s high salinity promoted the synergistic effect of sulfate reducing bacteria and desulfurization denitrification bacteria which helped the efficient operation of this biofilm enhanced treatment system keywords desulfurization denitrification high salt functional genes metabolic pathway 1 introduction the economy of coastal areas is developing rapidly while the aquaculture and seafood processing industry s scale is continually expanding 1 as a result the amount of high salt wastewater from these industries is also increasing year by year the aquaculture feed entered the seawater in the form of residuals and metabolites these residuals are further decomposed to ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 2 which leads to the existence of much no2 and organics in the high salt wastewater 3 seafood processing wastewater is also rich in high concentrations of organics salinity and nh4 4 these high concentrations of no2 and organics pose a threat to human health and lead to environmental problems such as eutrophication 5 besides the deterioration of water quality caused by the accumulation of nitrogenous compounds will also increase the generation of pathogenic bacteria and carcinogens and introduce exotic invasive pathogenic species which will eventually lead to outbreaks of severe disease 6 7 therefore the wastewaters from aquaculture and seafood processing industries need to be treated carefully the adjacent geographical location of these two industries and the complementary wastewater quality provide the possibility to treat these two wastewaters synergistically which will reduce the energy consumption and operation cost the biological wastewater treatment method has hardly any secondary pollution and this advantage brings an excellent prospect to its application in the treatment of aquaculture and seafood processing wastewater 8 the aerobic nitrification anaerobic denitrification is one of the main traditional biological treatment processes 9 via which nh4 is converted to no2 in the aerobic phase and no2 is reduced to nitrogen n2 in the anaerobic phase however due to the existence of high salinity and sulfate so4 2 the environment for removing nitrogenous pollutants in the seawater is different from that in non low salt wastewater the high salt stress of seawater will reduce metabolic enzymes activity and inhibit the average growth of microorganisms it is challenging to treat high salt wastewater by normal heterotrophic denitrification processes directly 10 the salinity acclimation or direct using salt tolerant bacteria can be used to improve the microbial activity to solve the problem of high salt inhibition 11 and the heterotrophic denitrification sludge acclimated by saline wastewater has been proved to be used in the treatment of high salt wastewater 12 under the anaerobic conditions with organics so4 2 in the seawater will be reduced to sulfide s2 by the sulfate reducing bacteria srb 13 recently s2 has been proved to replace organics to provide electrons to no2 and induce autotrophic denitrification 14 the coexistence of organics and s2 can stimulate the interaction between heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification 15 heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria can consume no2 simultaneously to improve denitrification efficiency 16 based on this principle sulfate reduction was combined with the autotrophic desulfurization denitrification in sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process 17 and biodegradation electron transfer with sulfur metabolism integrated besi process 18 to solve the pollution of s2 and no2 however in sani or besi the sulfate reduction and desulfurization denitrification processes were placed in two separate units and then connected the complexity of management and operation was high because of two sets in reaction systems the independent sulfate reduction unit was easy to produce more s2 which might bring the secondary pollution to avoid secondary pollution the sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and the autotrophic desulfurization denitrification processes were integrated into one reaction system in which many kinds of reactions could cooperate to remove multiple pollutants simultaneously the sulfate reduction was used as an intermediate reaction to provide s2 to remove no2 s2 was converted to so4 2 again via autotrophic desulfurization denitrification the residual no2 and organics were removed via heterotrophic denitrification the generated s2 served as an intermediate to meet the needs of autotrophic denitrification 19 and would not cause secondary pollution compared with the traditional series processes this integrated system had more complicated reactions and had no apparent physical barrier among various functional bacteria however the overlap of the microbial niche might impede the enhancement of operation efficiency the bacterial community s performances depend on the types of bacteria genus and specific functional genes in the activated sludge when s2 was further oxidized to so4 2 thauera and azoarcus were found to be the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification reactor and the functional genes nirk and sox were highly expressed 20 the halophilic denitrifying bacteria s existence was considered an essential and vital factor for the efficient running denitrification system under high salt environments halomonas arcobacter and thiohalobacter were found to be the typical halophilic bacteria in the high salt desulfurization denitrification system 21 which were different from those under no low salt environments desulfobacteraceae and thiobacillus were found to be the functional bacteria in the sulfate reduction and autotrophic denitrification zones of the sani process but the interactions between these two bacteria were not discussed as the functional zones were isolated and the main functional bacteria were relatively independent 17 recently bacteroides has been reported to exist in both the sulfate reduction zone and the autotrophic denitrification zone of the sani process but this kind of bacteria had different functions in these two zones 22 therefore some bacteria were indicated to survive in the integrated reaction system with both sulfate reduction and autotrophic denitrification in a word the deep understanding of the mechanism of the temporal spacial competition cooperation among various microorganisms is the vital point to ensure the efficient and stable operation of the integrated system the objective of this work was to integrate the sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic desulfurization denitrification into one biofilm system to treat the seawater wastewater containing high concentrations of no2 and organics to achieve the efficient removal of pollutants by understanding the interaction of bioreactor operation and microorganisms in the reactor the inoculating activated sludge was directly cultivated by seawater to form biofilms the temporal spacial succession regularity of the bacterial community structure and functional genes were analyzed and the characteristics of the bacterial community were discussed contrasting to the degradation of various pollutants the conversion mechanism of c n and s by the functional bacteria in the biofilm system was revealed to help the biofilm high salt wastewater treatment system s efficient operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor and operation the circulating flow reactor of 432 0 l was used in this experiment and was shown in fig 1 the coarse sand of 1 5 3 mm and the fine sand of 0 25 0 35 mm were filled into the bottom as fillers for biofilm attachment the layer of coarse sand was located below the layer of fine sand the sands were repeatedly washed before they were put into the reactor to remove the substances attached to the sands surfaces all the baffles extended down through the activated sludge and bonded to the reactor bottom in this way the reactor s interior space was separated into several zones by the baffles to increase the running distance and residence time of the wastewater flow which was conducive to the spatial separation of the various functional bacteria the stirring paddle was used to rotate clockwise to promote the wastewater s moving and increase the contact degree between the wastewater and activated sludge the wastewater was pumped into the reactor bottom via the water inlet and discharged via the water outlet on the reactor s top the reaction zone s water depth was set as 1 1 m to form a water seal to prevent much oxygen from diffusing to the sludge area and generate pressure on the bottom sludge to prevent the sludge from floating the temperature of the reactor varied with the external environment which was 17 2 three sampling points were set along the flow direction as shown in fig 1 b 2 2 inoculation and wastewater the activated sludge was inoculated from a stable running desulphurization denitrification reactor of treating s2 and no2 seawater wastewater in the inoculation reactor the microorganisms had been pre screened to have high salt resistance therefore this inoculation sludge could adapt to the new reaction system quickly and be helpful to maintain the high abundance of functional autotrophic bacteria moreover basing on the push flow operating mode most organics were degraded by srb in the fore part and little was left to flow to the rear part along the whole flow path in which way the inhibition of organics on autotrophic bacteria was decreased the generating s2 from so4 2 was also beneficial for maintaining the autotrophic denitrification bacteria s activity the volume and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss of inoculated sludge were 10 l and 22 6 g l respectively the sodium acetate and sodium nitrite were added to the natural seawater to provide organic matter and no2 to simulate the wastewater from seafood processing and aquaculture the influent was simulated by adding organics and nitrite to the natural seawater whose characters were close to the seafood processing and aquaculture wastewater there were two main reasons for the use of acetate as the carbon substrate in the pre process of seafood processing wastewater treatment most macromolecular organics were degraded to the micro molecular ones and acetate was representative in micro molecular organics the abundance of srb was low in the inoculation which was unfavorable for the reactor operation however adding micro molecular organics acetate could accelerate srb proliferation to start up the reactor quickly the concentrations of organics and no2 are high in seafood processing wastewater but they are usually low in aquaculture wastewater therefore the flow volume ratio of these two wastewaters can be regulated to meet the reactor s bearing loadings of organics and no2 in order to prevent the sulfate reduction product s2 from entering the atmosphere in the form of hydrogen sulfide h2s 23 influent ph was adjusted to 8 0 by adding sodium bicarbonate to ensure the existence of s2 as an intermediate in the system because the volume of the inoculated activated sludge was much smaller compared to that of the whole reactor at the initial stage of reactor start up the influent operation mode was set as intermittent influent with no effluent and the influent volume was increased day by day until the reactor was filled up when the removal efficiencies of no2 and total organic carbon toc maintained above 90 the continuous influent was adopted and hydraulic retention time hrt was set 24 h the reactor operated for 190 days continuously and the influent parameters of each phase were shown in table 1 because the generation time of srb was long the sulfate reduction reaction might be weak at the initial stage of operation and its product s2 might not be enough for the desulfurization denitrification reaction in order to prevent this phenomenon s2 was added to the influent in phase a c and when s2 produced by the sulfate reduction was able to cope with the desulfurization denitrification reaction s2 was no longer added to the influent in phase d the activated sludge was replenished to the bottom of reactor every 10 days 2 3 chemical analysis the n 1 nye ethylenediamine spectrophotometry method ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1900 24 was used to analyze no2 n the ion chromatography method ion chromatograph aquion was adopted to analyze so4 2 s the p amino dimethylaniline spectrophotometry method ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1900 25 was used to detect s2 s the organics concentration was expressed by toc and detected by toc analyzer aurora 1030 ph value was detected by ph meter phs 3c 2 4 high throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial communities along the direction of wastewater flow nine biofilm samples were collected from different heights of activated sludge zone during the stable operation stage for the high throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial communities as shown in fig 1 b the biofilm samples obtained from up middle and low layers at a1 were named as a1 1 a1 2 and a1 3 respectively the samples at a2 were named as a2 1 a2 2 and a2 3 the samples at a3 were named as a3 1 a3 2 and a3 3 the collected samples were quickly put into the sterilized centrifuge tubes under

thereto fisher scientific ma usa p7589 the purified dna of each sample was put into the illumina miseq platform for sequencing and the sequence assembly software flash was used for splicing then the splicing sequence merged sequences were obtained and used as the sequence for sequencing data statistics the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime platform was used to filter the sequenced original fastq file and to remove the data whose average quality score and read length were less than 20 and 150bp respectively 27 the community diversity indexes were generated by mothur principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the bacterial community composition structure of genus and the bacterial heatmaps of different samples were formed via r software the meta genomes of original 16 s rdna data were predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust and the metabolic pathways of bacteria were predicted by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg sequences were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database the allotted accession numbers were srp229762 3 results and discussions 3 1 bioreactor performances the biofilm enhanced reactor had been operated for 190 days the removal efficiencies of no2 toc s2 and so4 2 were shown in fig 2 the removal efficiency was defined as the difference between influent and effluent concentrations divided by the influent concentration the reaction rate was defined as the difference between influent and effluent concentrations divided by hrt due to the long generation time of srb s2 produced by sulfate reduction could not meet the growing needs of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification bacteria at the reactor s initial start up stage then the additional s2 was added to the influent to serve as the electron donor and mass ratio of s2 s to no2 n was set 1 1 in phrase a b the removal efficiency of s2 was above 90 and could reach 100 while the removal efficiency of so4 2 was below zero it was analyzed that a large amount of s2 in water could promote the activity of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification bacteria and s n had a significant influence on autotrophic desulfurization denitrification in the mixotrophic environment 28 therefore the injection of s2 to the reactor s influent promoted the reaction rate of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification leading to the high removal efficiency of s2 and generation efficiency of so4 2 on the one hand the inoculated activated sludge was from the well running desulfurization denitrification reactor where the abundance of srb was low high influent concentration of s2 and no2 would inhibit the growth of srb and the sulfate reduction in the seawater leading to the high concentration so4 2 in the effluent 29 on the other hand the autotrophic desulfurization denitrification would generate a large amount of so4 2 via the oxidation of s2 leading to the accumulation of so4 2 in phase c the removal efficiency of so4 2 increased gradually and the removal efficiency of s2 decreased sharply which was caused by two reasons on the one hand the decreasing concentration of influent s2 weakened the inhibition of s2 on the sulfate reduction on the other hand the high concentration of so4 2 and organics in the reactor promoted the growth of srb then the reaction rate of sulfate reduction was enhanced leading to the high removal efficiency of so4 2 in phase d because the srb s activity to reduce so4 2 was improved the s2 generated via the reduction of so4 2 could meet the needs of desulfurization denitrification then the additional s2 was not added to the influent anymore the high concentration of s2 could infiltrate the cell to destroy the proteins inside and deactivate the cell to inhibit srb growth therefore with influent s2 concentration decreasing the inhibition of s2 on srb was further decreased the superiority of srb has emerged and so4 2 was smoothly degraded the removal efficiency of no2 decreased rapidly to 53 81 on the 3rd day of phase a and the removal efficiency of s2 remained above 99 indicating that the reactor s adaptability to the load shock of no2 was weak at the startup stage no2 was accumulated during the initial experimental periods which was attributed to the inhibition of no2 load on heterotrophic denitrification bacteria 30 31 it was also reported that s2 concentration above 100 mg l could inhibit the heterotrophic denitrifying enzyme activity to cause no2 accumulation 32 accordingly the low removal efficiency of no2 in phase a b was co caused by the lag time in the development of microbial communities capable of no2 reduction and high concentration of s2 therefore the concentration of influent no2 was decreased to 70 mgn l in phase b to reduce the influent load of no2 the accumulated no2 was gradually consumed and the removal efficiency of no2 increased slowly in phase c d the removal efficiency of no2 was stable above 99 because the reduced concentration of s2 in the influent weakened its inhibition on the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and the utilization capacity of no2 by desulfurization denitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria was enhanced the removal efficiency of toc was only about 80 in phase a it was analyzed that the bacteria utilizing the organics in the reactor were mainly heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and organic carbon degrading bacteria in the absence of a large amount of srb in phase a the organics were mainly used by the heterotrophic denitrification the reaction rate of heterotrophic denitrification was weak and organics could not be used in large amounts leading to the lower removal efficiency of no2 in phase a in phase b the removal efficiency of toc decreased continuously because the decreasing influent concentration of no2 led to the decreasing reaction rate of heterotrophic denitrification besides the presence of a large amount of s2 could also inhibit the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and organic carbon degrading bacteria s utilization of organics during phase a d the influent concentration of s2 decreased gradually causing the inhibitory effect of s2 on the heterotrophic microorganisms to reduce the removal efficiency of toc increased stepwise and reached nearly 100 in phase d simultaneously the total amounts of electron donors s2 and organics in the influent decreased significantly while the quantities of electron acceptors no2 and so4 2 did not change thus the heterotrophic bacteria such as sulfate reducing bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria needed to obtain much more electrons from organics which increased the removal efficiency of toc significantly the removal efficiencies of no2 and toc were close to 100 indicating that no2 and organics could be removed simultaneously and efficiently in high salt environments by combining the sulfate reduction and desulfurization denitrification in this biofilm enhanced system 3 2 abundance and diversity of bacteria the abundances and diversities of bacteria in different depths of a1 to a3 were analyzed by the α diversity index and shown in fig 3 the higher the chao and ace values indicate the higher species abundance 33 the higher shannon value indicates the higher diversity and complexity of the community 34 the β diversity index pca was used to analyze the difference in community composition at the genera level in each site as shown in fig 4 the shorter distance between the two sites indicates the higher similarity of the two microbial community structures the chao ace and shannon index of each sample in a3 site decreased with the water depth increasing the changing tendency of each sample s α diversity index in a2 and a1 was similar to that in a3 this result indicated that the abundance and diversity of bacteria in each site were affected by water depth furthermore in pca analysis the points representing the samples in the up layer were close to those in the middle layer but far away from those in the low layer in a1 a2 and a3 sites respectively the result indicated that the bacterial community structure in the up layer was similar to that in the middle layer but quite different from that in the low layer the main reasons for these phenomena were discussed as follows 1 because the low layer was the influent zone the types of influent substrates were few which was not beneficial for various bacteria to proliferate and resulted in the low layer s bacterial abundance and diversity lower than those in the middle and up layers 2 wastewater was pumped into the reactor through the low layer and pushed from the coarse sand zone below to the fine sand zone above then so4 2 no2 and organics were gradually degraded by the bacteria along the way from below to above especially for the degradation of organics acetate was degraded by the bacteria via the synthesis and catabolism reaction to generate a variety of small molecular organic acids which enriched the types of substrates in the middle layer and was conducive to the increase of the bacterial abundance and diversity 3 the mass transfer was good and the interchange rate was high at the junction zone of the fine sand zone and the main part of seawater which was conducive to the increase of bacterial abundance and diversity 4 the particle size of sands filled in the up and middle layers was small then the surface area provided for the biofilm s growth was more extensive than that in the low layer which was also beneficial for the increase of bacterial diversity and abundance the chao ace and shannon index in the up layer were similar to those in the middle layer it might be attributed to the distribution of dissolved oxygen do in the seawater and do decreasing gradually with the increase of water depth the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria are anaerobes and the key enzyme of denitrification nitrite reductase needs to be formed under anaerobic conditions 35 therefore the increasing do inhibited the anaerobic bacteria s growth which resulted in no more significant increase of bacterial diversity in the up layer than in the middle layer although the substrates types were more in the up layer than that in the middle layer 3 3 general variation tendency of microbial communities the experimental flow passed through a1 a2 and a3 regions successively as shown in fig 1 b the overall variation of the bacterial community in each zone along flow direction was analyzed and results were shown in fig 5 the types of bacterial genera with high relative abundance in a1 a3 were the same but the abundances of genera were different desulfobacter 28 4 sulfurimonas 21 3 fastidiosipila 6 8 pseudomonas 4 0 and desulfuromusa 2 8 were the top dominant bacteria in a1 desulfobacter 21 2 sulfurimonas 15 0 fastidiosipila 9 0 pseudomonas 3 0 and sedimentibacter 3 0 were the top dominant bacteria in a2 sulfurimonas 14 0 desulfobacter 13 8 fastidiosipila 8 0 sedimentibacter 3 4 and pseudomonas 3 3 were the top dominant bacteria in a3 desulfobacter is a typical srb with the function of restoring so4 2 36 sulfurimonas is the chemolithotrophic denitrifying bacterium which can use s2 as electron donors to reduce no2 to n2 37 however it was also reported that some organic compounds could promote its growth 38 it might be why sulfurimonas could exist in the mixotrophic environment of this work and had a high abundance fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter are the organics degrading bacteria that can degrade the macromolecular organics such as carbohydrates or proteins into small molecular organics 39 pseudomonas is a facultative denitrifying bacterium which is easier to grow under the heterotrophic conditions and reduces no2 to n2 40 therefore desulfobacter sulfurimonas fastidiosipila and pseudomonas were the main functional bacteria in the biofilm enhanced system which were involved in the degradation of so4 2 no2 and organics the different relative abundances of functional bacteria in a1 a3 indicated that each bacterial genus was involved in sulfate reduction organic degradation desulfurization denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification but the reaction rates were different this phenomenon was mainly attributed to the varying concentrations of pollutants in different sites a1 was close to the influent zone therefore the concentration of organics in a1 was high which was conducive to the multiplication of heterotrophic bacteria moreover large amounts of so4 2 could also serve as the abundant substrates for srb making desulfobacter the genus with the highest abundance in a1 meanwhile the high salt environment of high concentrations organics and so4 2 in a1 promoted the emergence of the salt tolerant srb desulfuromusa 41 therefore desulfobacter and desulfuromusa in a1 promoted the reduction of so4 2 to s2 as the substrate for desulfurization denitrification bacteria s2 promoted the proliferation of sulfurimonas and was consumed by sulfurimonas in large amounts the consumption of s2 promoted the forward reaction of sulfate reduction which was conducive to the growth of srb in a1 furthermore the high concentrations of organics and no2 in the wastewater also promoted the emergence of a large amount of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas and organics degrading bacteria fastidiosipila however the abundance of pseudomonas and fastidiosipila was less than that of desulfobacter indicating that the high salt mixotrophic environment was more conducive to the synergistic effect of srb and desulphurization denitrifying bacteria a2 was in the middle zone along the flow direction the concentrations of so4 2 and no2 decreased for their consumption in the front area resulting in the slight decrease in the abundance of desulfobacter sulfurimonas and pseudomonas using so4 2 and no2 as substrates meanwhile the demand for the organics by desulfobacter and pseudomonas decreased accordingly the concentration of remaining organics increased which was conducive to the proliferation of organics degrading bacteria hence the relative abundances of fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter increased a3 was the effluent zone the substrates required for srb in a3 had been mostly consumed in a1 and a2 sites ahead resulting in desulfobacter s abundance decreasing to 13 8 nevertheless a large amount of s2 produced by the sulfate reduction in a1 and a2 flowed to a3 it provided favorable condition for the desulfurization denitrifying bacteria s proliferation and sulfurimonas became the first dominant genus due to the decrease in srb s abundance the abundance of fastidiosipila sedimentibacter and pseudomonas that competed with srb for organic substrates increased slightly the seawater was used as the influent and brought the high salt stress environment which was an unfavorable factor for the bioreactor to run however the activated sludge was acclimated successfully and finally contained various salt tolerant bacteria such as desulfuromusa litoreibacter 42 the formation of this unique bacterial community was the basis for the efficient removal of no2 and organics in a high salt environment 10 additionally the mixotrophic environment was adopted in this system and the abundance of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria was much higher than that of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria two reasons caused this result first the sands of different sizes provided shelters and attaching carriers for the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria to elude organics second the autotrophic desulfurization denitrifying bacteria had higher salt tolerance than heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria which had also been confirmed by some other studies 43 3 4 spatial distribution characteristics of functional bacteria the bacteria involved in the conversion of sulfur nitrogen and carbon were considered as the functional bacteria in this system the top 40 genera of each sample were used to generate a heat map to show each functional genus s shift in different phases as shown in fig 6 desulfobacter 31 desulfobacterium 44 dethiosulfatibacter 45 fusibacter 46 and desulfotignum 47 could reduce so4 2 or thiosulfate s2o3 2 to s2 which were found to be the dominant bacteria in the reactor nevertheless the types of these srb were greatly different in 9 sites the phenomenon was caused by the gradual consumption of so4 2 and organics during the wastewater running forwards and upwards the carbon source was the main factor to affect the growth of srb 48 and the complex organic compounds could be degraded to the low molecular organic compounds by srb via the biological enzymes in its body 49 therefore the influent organics could be degraded by srb to the various low molecular organics that could be used by the other bacteria easily a1 was the influent zone and the concentrations of substrates were high but the types were few so that desulfobacter with acetate as the only electron donor had a high abundance so4 2 and organics were degraded to s2o3 2 and various small molecular organics in a1 these products were carried to a2 by the flowing wastewater s2o3 2 helped increase the abundances of desulfobacterium and fusibacter in a2 because these genera utilized s2o3 2 as substrates a3 was the effluent area and the concentration of organics was low in a3 which was helpful for the proliferation of the autotrophic srb desulfotignum that used carbon dioxide co2 as a carbon source the wastewater entered the reactor from the coarse sand zone at the bottom and flowed upwards through the fine sand zone to the main part of seawater finally with the decrease of water depth the abundance of so4 2 using srb decreased but the abundance of s2o3 2 using srb increased this phenomenon was discussed below a1 3 was near the entry point and the types of substrates were few there which led to the few species of dominant bacteria desulfobacter became the dominant bacteria a1 2 was close to a1 3 the species and abundances of srb in a1 2 were similar to those in a1 3 the relative abundance of heterotrophic srb desulfobacter decreased obviously in a1 1 because much organics was degraded in the low and middle layers in contrast the relative abundance of autotrophic srb desulfotignum increased much s2o3 2 was generated by desulfobacter in a1 3 and brought forwards to a2 3 by the flowing water leading to desulfobacterium s emergence in a2 3 the concentrations of s2o3 2 and do were higher in a2 1 than in a2 2 making the dominant srb change to fusibacter because fusibacter used s2o3 2 as an electron acceptor and had a high tolerance for do the concentrations of low molecular organics and s2o3 2 were relatively high in a3 3 which promoted the relative abundance of desulfotignum the concentration of organics was the lowest in a3 1 because a3 1 was near to the effluent point but the concentration of s2o3 2 was relatively high which promoted the abundance of fusibacter the srb in this system was different from those in the ordinary sewage treatment environment because of the high salt and high concentrations so4 2 the salt tolerant srb proliferated much under high salt stress in this system such as desulfuromusa sulfurimonas 50 was found to be the dominant functional bacteria for the desulfurization denitrification in the reactor while thermovirga 51 and desulfuromonas 48 were the main functional bacteria for sulfur s0 reduction so4 2 was reduced by srb to s2 which was the substrate for desulfurization denitrification bacteria the consumption of s2 by desulfurization denitrification bacteria promoted the forward reaction of sulfate reduction therefore srb and desulfurization denitrification bacteria could grow together under the conditions of high concentrations of organics and so4 2 in the a1 zone the concentrations of substrates were high in a1 3 close to the influent point much so4 2 was reduced to s2 in a1 3 promoting the proliferation of sulfurimonas to produce more s0 however the flow shear force was large in a1 3 to bring s0 to the middle and up layers a1 2 and a1 1 and so4 2 type srb was easier to proliferate than s0 type srb with high concentration so4 2 in a1 3 therefore the abundance of s0 type srb was low in the low layer a large amount of s0 and small molecule organics were generated in the low layer and were carried to a1 2 by the up flowing wastewater promoting the proliferation of litoreibacter and thermovirga in a1 2 in the a2 zone the concentrations of s2 and no2 brought to a2 3 by the flowing wastewater were relatively high leading to the high abundance of sulfurimonas the high concentrations of organics and s0 promoted the growth of desulfuromonas in a2 2 the ability of s0 type srb to utilize organics was higher than that of so4 2 type srb with the low concentrations so4 2 because so4 2 was degraded gradually with the decrease of water depth therefore the abundance of thermovirga was high in a2 1 in a3 the changing trend of relative abundances of desulphurization denitrification bacteria and s0 type srb was similar to that in a1 and a2 the abundances of so4 2 type srb and desulfurization denitrification bacteria decreased with the water depth decreasing in contrast the abundance of s0 type srb increased pseudomonas lentimicrobium 52 acidovorax 53 paracoccus 54 halomonas 55 defluviimonas 56 hyphomicrobium 57 and rhodobacter 58 were found to be the main functional bacteria for denitrification in the reactor the abundances and species of denitrifying bacteria increased gradually from a1 to a3 the main reasons for this phenomenon were discussed as follows on the one hand heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria competed with heterotrophic srb for organic carbon thus srb with high abundance in a1 was not conducive to the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria s proliferation on the other hand heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria competed with desulfurization denitrification bacteria for the electron acceptors no2 thus the desulfurization denitrification bacteria with high abundance in a1 and a2 were not conducive to the proliferation of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria therefore the competitiveness and abundance of pseudomonas were low in a1 the concentrations of macromolecular organics were high in a1 promoting the proliferation of lentimicrobium using macromolecular organics as substrates the macromolecular organics were degraded to the micromolecular organic acids these micromolecular organics were then carried to a2 by the water flow and promoted the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria s abundance the organics were degraded gradually along the water flowing direction and its concentration was low in a3 which was conducive to the proliferation of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria acidovorax and paracoccus in a3 furthermore heterotrophic denitrification reaction enhanced the alkalinity in a2 and a3 which promoted the growth of the halophilic alkali tolerant denitrifying bacteria halomonas the changing trend of the types and abundances of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the vertical direction was similar to that in the horizontal direction a1 3 a2 3 and a3 3 were the low layers in the reactor where the types of organic substrates were simple but the concentrations of so4 2 and s0 were relatively high compared to srb the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria had lower competitiveness for organics in the low layers leading to the low abundance of pseudomonas a1 2 a2 2 and a3 2 were the middle layers of the activated sludge zone where the types of organics were various but the concentration of s2 was not high the decreasing concentration of s2 reduced the competitiveness of desulfurization denitrification bacteria for no2 resulting in the emergence of defluviimonas and hyphomicrobium because they were the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria to use various organics and no2 as substrates a1 1 a2 1 and a3 1 were the up layers of the activated sludge zone where the concentrations of various organics decreased obviously this concentration of organics could not meet the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria s metabolic needs and the abundance of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria increased instead the up layer of sludge was close to the main part of seawater wastewater it could receive some light from the water surface which led to the emergence of rhodobacter using light energy for denitrification fastidiosipila sedimentibacter sphaerochaeta 59 ercella 60 alkalispirochaeta 61 anerovorax 62 thermovirga 63 and syntrophomonas 64 were found to be the dominant functional bacteria for the organics degradation in the reactor in a1 a3 the changing trend of the organics degrading bacteria s abundance was opposite to that of srb the reason was discussed as follows the concentration of so4 2 was high in a1 close to the influent point the competitiveness of srb for organics in the high salt environment of a1 was more potent than that of organics degrading bacteria furthermore the high concentration of s2 generated by sulfate reduction also inhibited the metabolic activity of organics degrading bacteria 26 the various types of organics in a2 promoted the proliferation of fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter the concentrations of organics were not high in a3 but the types were various it promoted the enhancement of the abundance of sphaerochaeta ercella and sphingobium which were involved in the hydrolytic acidification the high alkalinity at the end of the reaction zone a3 promoted the proliferation of the halophilic alkali tolerant alkalispirochaeta in the vertical direction the abundance of organics degrading bacteria in the low layer was quite different from that in the middle and up layers fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter were mainly found in the middle and up layer and the abundances of organics degrading bacteria in the low layer were very low it was because that the srb utilized organics in the low layer and the produced s2 had the inhibition effect on the organics degrading bacteria s activity the types of organics were various in the middle and up layers and the concentration of do was not low thus fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter were more suitable to survive at this do level compared with srb anerovorax thermovirga and syntrophomonas using micromolecular organics as substrates also liked to proliferate in the environments with various organics and not low do the pollutants were gradually degraded along the water flowing direction resulting in a high complexity of the substrates in the a3 zone therefore many functional bacteria had high abundances in a3 2 and a3 1 close to the effluent point ottowia and thauera were found to be the main functional bacteria ottowia is a mixotrophic denitrifying bacteria to use both sulfur and carbon as electron donors and use no2 as an electron acceptor 65 thauera has the functions of denitrifying 66 and oxidizing s2 to s0 it also uses organics as electron donors and carbon sources to reduce so4 2 to s2 67 which played an essential role in the cycle of c n and s in the reactor additionally a high abundance of nitrogen fixing bacteria saccharicrinis emerged in a3 which could convert n2 to ammonia 68 because n2 was generated from the denitrification reaction the emergence of saccharicrinis indicated the high reaction rate of autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification reaction in a3 to sum up the methods adopted in this work promoted the gradual degradation of various pollutants and the reasonable spatial distribution of various functional bacteria such as setting influent point at the bottom using sands of different particle sizes as fillers for biofilm adopting horizontal push flow and prolonging the salt wastewater flow path these methods ensured the reaction system to run efficiently and stably 3 5 functional genes and metabolic pathway the relative abundance of each genus based on the second level metabolic pathway analysis of kegg was shown in fig 7 and the dominating functional genes and their encoded related enzymes were shown in fig 8 the abundances of bacteria with amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism functions were relatively high in the reaction system which indicated that these two kinds of metabolism were the main metabolic ways in the biofilm enhanced system it was analyzed that there were two main amino acid sources in this reactor no2 could be used by desulfurization denitrification bacteria to generate amino acid via the anabolism 69 the organics released by the dead microorganisms could be further degraded to amino acid via catabolism the amino acid metabolism could enhance extracellular polymeric substances eps formation and eps was an essential structural component of the biofilm to protect cells from external shocks and buffer the adverse effects on cells 70 72 therefore the functional flora with amino acid metabolism represented by pseudomonas played an important role in maintaining the biofilm system s stable operation in this study the abundances of bacteria with the amino acid metabolism increased gradually with reducing water depth indicating that the biofilms in the middle and up layers were stable and the transformation among nitrogenous compounds was intense this deduction corresponded to the high abundances of acidovorax paracoccus defluviimonas hyphomicrobium and rhodobacter in the middle and up layers of the activated sludge zone fig 6 moreover it was reported that high salt stress could reduce the dehydrogenase activity of denitrifying bacteria to inhibit their growth and metabolism but domesticated denitrifying bacteria had high tolerance to the high salt stress 73 in this work the denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas was found to have a high abundance in high salt environments which confirmed the view above that domesticated denitrifying bacteria could adapt to high salt environments well with the help of the amino acid metabolism and formation of eps carbohydrate metabolism is the primary channel to degrade organics to inorganics and release co2 and water h2o it is also a typical bacterial energy generation and biosynthesis process in activated sludge 74 as shown in fig 7 the abundances of bacteria with carbohydrate metabolism increased gradually with the water depth reducing the reason for this phenomenon was discussed below in the low layer the dominant bacteria srb degraded organics by the enzymes in the body and excreted some micro molecular organics outside the cell the heterotrophic bacteria also degraded organics to the micro molecular carbohydrates by the extracellular enzymes these organics were then brought from the low layer to the up layer by the flowing water as a result the types of organics in the middle and up layers were diversified which was beneficial for the abundances of bacteria with organic metabolic to increase the abundances of heterotrophic bacteria except for srb were relatively high in the up layer corresponding to the high abundances of desulfobacter fastidiosipila and pseudomonas fig 5 and the high removal efficiencies of toc fig 2 various functional genes related to the sulfate reduction and desulfurization denitrification in the system were detected including sulfate reduction genes sulfur oxidation genes and denitrification genes as shown in fig 8 a total of 11 sulfate reduction genes were found to have high abundances indicating the sulfate reduction reaction s high strength in the system 7 sulfate reduction genes were involved in the assimilation sulfate reduction including sat k00958 encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase cysn k00956 encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 1 cysd k00957 encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 2 cysc k00860 encoding adenylysulfate kinase cysh k00390 encoding phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase cysj k00380 encoding sulfite reductase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph flavoprotein alpha component and cysi k00381 encoding sulfite reductase nadph hemoprotein beta component 75 so4 2 was transformed into adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps via sat cysn and cysd aps was transformed into 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate paps via cysc paps was transformed into sulfite so3 2 via cysh so3 2 was transformed into s2 via cysj and cysi four other sulfate reduction genes were involved in the dissimilation sulfate reduction including apra k00394 and aprb k00395 encoding adenylylsulfate reductase subunit a and b dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase alpha subunit and beta subunit 76 furthermore sat was also involved in the dissimilation reaction so4 2 was transformed into aps via sat aps was transformed into so3 2 via apra and aprb so3 2 was transformed into s2 via dsra and dsrb as shown in fig 8 a the abundances of functional genes assimilated sulfate reduction were higher than those of functional genes dissimilated sulfate reduction this result indicated that the sulfate reduction in this bacterial system was mainly accomplished by the assimilation way and partly accomplished by the dissimilation way contrary to the conclusion obtained by ruckert c 77 with the conditions of toc so4 2 less than 2 the carbon sources were in short supply and the produced stream of electrons was less which was conducive to the assimilation of sulfate 76 dsra and dsrb could be found in desulfobacter desulfobacterium deslfotignum and arpa could be found in desulfotignum a total of 4 functional genes for sulfur oxidation were detected in the biofilm including sqr k00344 encoding sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sox k00301 encoding sarcosine oxidase dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase alpha subunit and beta subunit sqr was mainly involved in the oxidation of s2 to s0 76 sox was involved in the process of s0 s2o3 2 oxidation to so4 2 dsra and dsrb were only involved in the oxidation of s0 78 s2 was the reaction product of so4 2 reduction and was oxidized to s0 via sqr s0 was further oxidized to so4 2 via sox dsra and dsrb sulfur oxidation and sulfate reduction cooperated to form a closed cycle in which s2 and s0 acted only as intermediates as shown in fig 8 b the abundances of sqr and sox decreased with the water depth increasing it was discussed below on the one hand the abundance of srb was high in the low layer leading to the high reaction rate of sulfate reduction then much s2 was generated and brought to the up layer to react with intracellular metal ions to inhibit the other bacteria s enzyme activity 79 on the other hand the concentration of do was relatively high in the up layer promoting the increase of sulfur oxidation genes abundances in the up layer because oxygen o2 could also provide electrons for the oxidation of s2 and s0 sqr and sox could be found in pseudomonas and thauera a total of 7 denitrification functional genes were found in the system they were nira k00366 nirb k00362 nirc k002598 nird k00363 and nirs k00368 encoding nitrite reductase norq k04748 encoding nitric oxide reductase nos k00376 encoding nitrous oxide reductase 80 among them nirs was a special gene in salt tolerant bacteria and had high tolerance to high salt environment 79 no2 was reduced to nitric oxide no via nira nirb nirc nird and nirs then no was reduced to nitrous oxide n2o via norq n2o was converted to n2 via nos many nitrite reductase genes were detected in this reaction system indicating that there were many types of nitrite reducing bacteria because nitrite reductase had attributes of exclusiveness and only one type of nitrite reductase could be detected in one type of bacteria 81 it might be caused by many reducing substances such as organics s2 polysulfide sn 2 s0 and s2o3 2 because all of them could provide electrons for no2 and different bacteria used different substances as electron donors nirs and nosz could be found in thauera under the high salty environment the various metabolic genes functions and their relative abundances in different reaction system sites were analyzed comprehensively to speculate the metabolic pathways of c n and s via desulfobacter sulfurimonas and pseudomonas as shown in fig 9 on the one hand the stable operation efficiency was achieved in the reaction system because various substrates were degraded and utilized via the synergistic competitive action of srb desulfurization denitrification bacteria and denitrifying bacteria on the other hand the changing concentrations of pollutants in different sites promoted the unique bacterial communities formation and affected the microorganisms central metabolic pathways furthermore the high concentration of so4 2 was the basis for the efficient operation of this biofilm enhanced seawater treatment system so4 2 stimulated the activity of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification bacteria and made them participate in the sulfur oxidation reduction cycle which in turn promoted the degradation of organics and the reduction of no2 82 4 conclusions the biofilm enhanced high salt wastewater treatment reactor was used to remove no2 and organics simultaneously using sulfate reduction as an intermediate reaction the main conclusions were drawn as follows firstly the removal efficiencies of no2 and toc reached 100 respectively s2 was added to the influent in the initial stage of the system operation which had inhibition on heterotrophic reactions thus the heterotrophic denitrification was weak leading to the low removal efficiencies of no2 and toc however with the increasing reaction rate of sulfate reduction in the middle and later stages the biofilm enhanced system achieved high operational efficiencies via the synergistic actions of heterotrophic autotrophic denitrification and sulfate reduction reaction secondly desulfobacter sulfurimonas fastidiosipila and pseudomonas were found to be the main functional bacteria in the biofilm because the various pollutants were gradually degraded and transformed along the water flow direction the relative abundances of bacteria varied in different sites the reaction rates of sulfate reduction desulfurization denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification also changed in different sites in the horizontal direction the overall abundances and diversities of bacteria were the lowest at the end of water flow in the vertical direction the bacterial community structures of biofilm in the up and middle layers were quite different from that in the low layer the overall bacterial abundances and diversities decreased with the increase of water depth thirdly various functional genes for sulfate reduction sulfur oxidation and denitrification were found in the system the sulfate reduction was accomplished by sat cysn cysd cysc cysh cysj cysi apra aprb dsra and dsrb genes via the assimilation and dissimilation sulfate pathway the sulfide oxidation and nitrite reduction were mainly accomplished by sqr sox dsra dsrb nira nirb nirc nird nirs norq and nos genes via autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification pathway finally the high salt seawater promoted the synergistic reaction of srb and desulfurization denitrification bacteria the measures such as water intake at the bottom adopting sands with different particle sizes as fillers for biofilm and horizontal push flow to prolong the flowing path promoted the gradual degradation of various pollutants and the spatial distribution of various functional bacteria which ensured the stable and efficient operation of the biofilm enhanced seawater wastewater treatment

13668,the reduction of sulfate to sulfide was seldom considered for high salt wastewater treatment although sulfide could supply electron donors to remove nitrite the sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification were integrated in one biofilm enhanced high salt wastewater treatment system and the sulfate reduction was used as an intermediate reaction both the reactor performances and the spatial distribution of the bacterial communities were studied the metabolic pathways of carbon nitrogen and sulfur were also discussed based on functional genes analysis the removal efficiencies of nitrite and organics reached 100 attributed to the stable and functional bacterial community desulfobacter sulfurimonas fastidiosipila and pseudomonas were the dominant functional bacteria in the biofilm the abundance and diversity of bacteria decreased with the increase of water depth because the different spatial concentrations of the substrates brought the various strength of each bio reaction sulfate reduction was achieved through the assimilation pathway by various sulfate reduction genes the oxidation of sulfide and reduction of nitrite were achieved through the autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification pathways with functional genes the seawater s high salinity promoted the synergistic effect of sulfate reducing bacteria and desulfurization denitrification bacteria which helped the efficient operation of this biofilm enhanced treatment system keywords desulfurization denitrification high salt functional genes metabolic pathway 1 introduction the economy of coastal areas is developing rapidly while the aquaculture and seafood processing industry s scale is continually expanding 1 as a result the amount of high salt wastewater from these industries is also increasing year by year the aquaculture feed entered the seawater in the form of residuals and metabolites these residuals are further decomposed to ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 2 which leads to the existence of much no2 and organics in the high salt wastewater 3 seafood processing wastewater is also rich in high concentrations of organics salinity and nh4 4 these high concentrations of no2 and organics pose a threat to human health and lead to environmental problems such as eutrophication 5 besides the deterioration of water quality caused by the accumulation of nitrogenous compounds will also increase the generation of pathogenic bacteria and carcinogens and introduce exotic invasive pathogenic species which will eventually lead to outbreaks of severe disease 6 7 therefore the wastewaters from aquaculture and seafood processing industries need to be treated carefully the adjacent geographical location of these two industries and the complementary wastewater quality provide the possibility to treat these two wastewaters synergistically which will reduce the energy consumption and operation cost the biological wastewater treatment method has hardly any secondary pollution and this advantage brings an excellent prospect to its application in the treatment of aquaculture and seafood processing wastewater 8 the aerobic nitrification anaerobic denitrification is one of the main traditional biological treatment processes 9 via which nh4 is converted to no2 in the aerobic phase and no2 is reduced to nitrogen n2 in the anaerobic phase however due to the existence of high salinity and sulfate so4 2 the environment for removing nitrogenous pollutants in the seawater is different from that in non low salt wastewater the high salt stress of seawater will reduce metabolic enzymes activity and inhibit the average growth of microorganisms it is challenging to treat high salt wastewater by normal heterotrophic denitrification processes directly 10 the salinity acclimation or direct using salt tolerant bacteria can be used to improve the microbial activity to solve the problem of high salt inhibition 11 and the heterotrophic denitrification sludge acclimated by saline wastewater has been proved to be used in the treatment of high salt wastewater 12 under the anaerobic conditions with organics so4 2 in the seawater will be reduced to sulfide s2 by the sulfate reducing bacteria srb 13 recently s2 has been proved to replace organics to provide electrons to no2 and induce autotrophic denitrification 14 the coexistence of organics and s2 can stimulate the interaction between heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification 15 heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria can consume no2 simultaneously to improve denitrification efficiency 16 based on this principle sulfate reduction was combined with the autotrophic desulfurization denitrification in sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process 17 and biodegradation electron transfer with sulfur metabolism integrated besi process 18 to solve the pollution of s2 and no2 however in sani or besi the sulfate reduction and desulfurization denitrification processes were placed in two separate units and then connected the complexity of management and operation was high because of two sets in reaction systems the independent sulfate reduction unit was easy to produce more s2 which might bring the secondary pollution to avoid secondary pollution the sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and the autotrophic desulfurization denitrification processes were integrated into one reaction system in which many kinds of reactions could cooperate to remove multiple pollutants simultaneously the sulfate reduction was used as an intermediate reaction to provide s2 to remove no2 s2 was converted to so4 2 again via autotrophic desulfurization denitrification the residual no2 and organics were removed via heterotrophic denitrification the generated s2 served as an intermediate to meet the needs of autotrophic denitrification 19 and would not cause secondary pollution compared with the traditional series processes this integrated system had more complicated reactions and had no apparent physical barrier among various functional bacteria however the overlap of the microbial niche might impede the enhancement of operation efficiency the bacterial community s performances depend on the types of bacteria genus and specific functional genes in the activated sludge when s2 was further oxidized to so4 2 thauera and azoarcus were found to be the dominant denitrifying bacteria in the autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification reactor and the functional genes nirk and sox were highly expressed 20 the halophilic denitrifying bacteria s existence was considered an essential and vital factor for the efficient running denitrification system under high salt environments halomonas arcobacter and thiohalobacter were found to be the typical halophilic bacteria in the high salt desulfurization denitrification system 21 which were different from those under no low salt environments desulfobacteraceae and thiobacillus were found to be the functional bacteria in the sulfate reduction and autotrophic denitrification zones of the sani process but the interactions between these two bacteria were not discussed as the functional zones were isolated and the main functional bacteria were relatively independent 17 recently bacteroides has been reported to exist in both the sulfate reduction zone and the autotrophic denitrification zone of the sani process but this kind of bacteria had different functions in these two zones 22 therefore some bacteria were indicated to survive in the integrated reaction system with both sulfate reduction and autotrophic denitrification in a word the deep understanding of the mechanism of the temporal spacial competition cooperation among various microorganisms is the vital point to ensure the efficient and stable operation of the integrated system the objective of this work was to integrate the sulfate reduction heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic desulfurization denitrification into one biofilm system to treat the seawater wastewater containing high concentrations of no2 and organics to achieve the efficient removal of pollutants by understanding the interaction of bioreactor operation and microorganisms in the reactor the inoculating activated sludge was directly cultivated by seawater to form biofilms the temporal spacial succession regularity of the bacterial community structure and functional genes were analyzed and the characteristics of the bacterial community were discussed contrasting to the degradation of various pollutants the conversion mechanism of c n and s by the functional bacteria in the biofilm system was revealed to help the biofilm high salt wastewater treatment system s efficient operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor and operation the circulating flow reactor of 432 0 l was used in this experiment and was shown in fig 1 the coarse sand of 1 5 3 mm and the fine sand of 0 25 0 35 mm were filled into the bottom as fillers for biofilm attachment the layer of coarse sand was located below the layer of fine sand the sands were repeatedly washed before they were put into the reactor to remove the substances attached to the sands surfaces all the baffles extended down through the activated sludge and bonded to the reactor bottom in this way the reactor s interior space was separated into several zones by the baffles to increase the running distance and residence time of the wastewater flow which was conducive to the spatial separation of the various functional bacteria the stirring paddle was used to rotate clockwise to promote the wastewater s moving and increase the contact degree between the wastewater and activated sludge the wastewater was pumped into the reactor bottom via the water inlet and discharged via the water outlet on the reactor s top the reaction zone s water depth was set as 1 1 m to form a water seal to prevent much oxygen from diffusing to the sludge area and generate pressure on the bottom sludge to prevent the sludge from floating the temperature of the reactor varied with the external environment which was 17 2 three sampling points were set along the flow direction as shown in fig 1 b 2 2 inoculation and wastewater the activated sludge was inoculated from a stable running desulphurization denitrification reactor of treating s2 and no2 seawater wastewater in the inoculation reactor the microorganisms had been pre screened to have high salt resistance therefore this inoculation sludge could adapt to the new reaction system quickly and be helpful to maintain the high abundance of functional autotrophic bacteria moreover basing on the push flow operating mode most organics were degraded by srb in the fore part and little was left to flow to the rear part along the whole flow path in which way the inhibition of organics on autotrophic bacteria was decreased the generating s2 from so4 2 was also beneficial for maintaining the autotrophic denitrification bacteria s activity the volume and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss of inoculated sludge were 10 l and 22 6 g l respectively the sodium acetate and sodium nitrite were added to the natural seawater to provide organic matter and no2 to simulate the wastewater from seafood processing and aquaculture the influent was simulated by adding organics and nitrite to the natural seawater whose characters were close to the seafood processing and aquaculture wastewater there were two main reasons for the use of acetate as the carbon substrate in the pre process of seafood processing wastewater treatment most macromolecular organics were degraded to the micro molecular ones and acetate was representative in micro molecular organics the abundance of srb was low in the inoculation which was unfavorable for the reactor operation however adding micro molecular organics acetate could accelerate srb proliferation to start up the reactor quickly the concentrations of organics and no2 are high in seafood processing wastewater but they are usually low in aquaculture wastewater therefore the flow volume ratio of these two wastewaters can be regulated to meet the reactor s bearing loadings of organics and no2 in order to prevent the sulfate reduction product s2 from entering the atmosphere in the form of hydrogen sulfide h2s 23 influent ph was adjusted to 8 0 by adding sodium bicarbonate to ensure the existence of s2 as an intermediate in the system because the volume of the inoculated activated sludge was much smaller compared to that of the whole reactor at the initial stage of reactor start up the influent operation mode was set as intermittent influent with no effluent and the influent volume was increased day by day until the reactor was filled up when the removal efficiencies of no2 and total organic carbon toc maintained above 90 the continuous influent was adopted and hydraulic retention time hrt was set 24 h the reactor operated for 190 days continuously and the influent parameters of each phase were shown in table 1 because the generation time of srb was long the sulfate reduction reaction might be weak at the initial stage of operation and its product s2 might not be enough for the desulfurization denitrification reaction in order to prevent this phenomenon s2 was added to the influent in phase a c and when s2 produced by the sulfate reduction was able to cope with the desulfurization denitrification reaction s2 was no longer added to the influent in phase d the activated sludge was replenished to the bottom of reactor every 10 days 2 3 chemical analysis the n 1 nye ethylenediamine spectrophotometry method ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1900 24 was used to analyze no2 n the ion chromatography method ion chromatograph aquion was adopted to analyze so4 2 s the p amino dimethylaniline spectrophotometry method ultraviolet spectrophotometer tu 1900 25 was used to detect s2 s the organics concentration was expressed by toc and detected by toc analyzer aurora 1030 ph value was detected by ph meter phs 3c 2 4 high throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial communities along the direction of wastewater flow nine biofilm samples were collected from different heights of activated sludge zone during the stable operation stage for the high throughput sequencing analysis of bacterial communities as shown in fig 1 b the biofilm samples obtained from up middle and low layers at a1 were named as a1 1 a1 2 and a1 3 respectively the samples at a2 were named as a2 1 a2 2 and a2 3 the samples at a3 were named as a3 1 a3 2 and a3 3 the collected samples were quickly put into the sterilized centrifuge tubes under the environment of blowing n2 and sealed at 80 for the subsequent extraction of total deoxyribonucleic acid dna the 16 s rdna sequence of the v3 v4 region in each sample was amplified by primer 338 f

a soil kit omega biotec norcross ga usa d5625 01 the concentration of dna was detected by nanodropnd 2000 thermo scientific wilmington usa the pcr reaction system 30 μ l included 15 μl q5 high

thereto fisher scientific ma usa p7589 the purified dna of each sample was put into the illumina miseq platform for sequencing and the sequence assembly software flash was used for splicing then the splicing sequence merged sequences were obtained and used as the sequence for sequencing data statistics the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime platform was used to filter the sequenced original fastq file and to remove the data whose average quality score and read length were less than 20 and 150bp respectively 27 the community diversity indexes were generated by mothur principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the bacterial community composition structure of genus and the bacterial heatmaps of different samples were formed via r software the meta genomes of original 16 s rdna data were predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust and the metabolic pathways of bacteria were predicted by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg sequences were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database the allotted accession numbers were srp229762 3 results and discussions 3 1 bioreactor performances the biofilm enhanced reactor had been operated for 190 days the removal efficiencies of no2 toc s2 and so4 2 were shown in fig 2 the removal efficiency was defined as the difference between influent and effluent concentrations divided by the influent concentration the reaction rate was defined as the difference between influent and effluent concentrations divided by hrt due to the long generation time of srb s2 produced by sulfate reduction could not meet the growing needs of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification bacteria at the reactor s initial start up stage then the additional s2 was added to the influent to serve as the electron donor and mass ratio of s2 s to no2 n was set 1 1 in phrase a b the removal efficiency of s2 was above 90 and could reach 100 while the removal efficiency of so4 2 was below zero it was analyzed that a large amount of s2 in water could promote the activity of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification bacteria and s n had a significant influence on autotrophic desulfurization denitrification in the mixotrophic environment 28 therefore the injection of s2 to the reactor s influent promoted the reaction rate of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification leading to the high removal efficiency of s2 and generation efficiency of so4 2 on the one hand the inoculated activated sludge was from the well running desulfurization denitrification reactor where the abundance of srb was low high influent concentration of s2 and no2 would inhibit the growth of srb and the sulfate reduction in the seawater leading to the high concentration so4 2 in the effluent 29 on the other hand the autotrophic desulfurization denitrification would generate a large amount of so4 2 via the oxidation of s2 leading to the accumulation of so4 2 in phase c the removal efficiency of so4 2 increased gradually and the removal efficiency of s2 decreased sharply which was caused by two reasons on the one hand the decreasing concentration of influent s2 weakened the inhibition of s2 on the sulfate reduction on the other hand the high concentration of so4 2 and organics in the reactor promoted the growth of srb then the reaction rate of sulfate reduction was enhanced leading to the high removal efficiency of so4 2 in phase d because the srb s activity to reduce so4 2 was improved the s2 generated via the reduction of so4 2 could meet the needs of desulfurization denitrification then the additional s2 was not added to the influent anymore the high concentration of s2 could infiltrate the cell to destroy the proteins inside and deactivate the cell to inhibit srb growth therefore with influent s2 concentration decreasing the inhibition of s2 on srb was further decreased the superiority of srb has emerged and so4 2 was smoothly degraded the removal efficiency of no2 decreased rapidly to 53 81 on the 3rd day of phase a and the removal efficiency of s2 remained above 99 indicating that the reactor s adaptability to the load shock of no2 was weak at the startup stage no2 was accumulated during the initial experimental periods which was attributed to the inhibition of no2 load on heterotrophic denitrification bacteria 30 31 it was also reported that s2 concentration above 100 mg l could inhibit the heterotrophic denitrifying enzyme activity to cause no2 accumulation 32 accordingly the low removal efficiency of no2 in phase a b was co caused by the lag time in the development of microbial communities capable of no2 reduction and high concentration of s2 therefore the concentration of influent no2 was decreased to 70 mgn l in phase b to reduce the influent load of no2 the accumulated no2 was gradually consumed and the removal efficiency of no2 increased slowly in phase c d the removal efficiency of no2 was stable above 99 because the reduced concentration of s2 in the influent weakened its inhibition on the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and the utilization capacity of no2 by desulfurization denitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria was enhanced the removal efficiency of toc was only about 80 in phase a it was analyzed that the bacteria utilizing the organics in the reactor were mainly heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and organic carbon degrading bacteria in the absence of a large amount of srb in phase a the organics were mainly used by the heterotrophic denitrification the reaction rate of heterotrophic denitrification was weak and organics could not be used in large amounts leading to the lower removal efficiency of no2 in phase a in phase b the removal efficiency of toc decreased continuously because the decreasing influent concentration of no2 led to the decreasing reaction rate of heterotrophic denitrification besides the presence of a large amount of s2 could also inhibit the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and organic carbon degrading bacteria s utilization of organics during phase a d the influent concentration of s2 decreased gradually causing the inhibitory effect of s2 on the heterotrophic microorganisms to reduce the removal efficiency of toc increased stepwise and reached nearly 100 in phase d simultaneously the total amounts of electron donors s2 and organics in the influent decreased significantly while the quantities of electron acceptors no2 and so4 2 did not change thus the heterotrophic bacteria such as sulfate reducing bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria needed to obtain much more electrons from organics which increased the removal efficiency of toc significantly the removal efficiencies of no2 and toc were close to 100 indicating that no2 and organics could be removed simultaneously and efficiently in high salt environments by combining the sulfate reduction and desulfurization denitrification in this biofilm enhanced system 3 2 abundance and diversity of bacteria the abundances and diversities of bacteria in different depths of a1 to a3 were analyzed by the α diversity index and shown in fig 3 the higher the chao and ace values indicate the higher species abundance 33 the higher shannon value indicates the higher diversity and complexity of the community 34 the β diversity index pca was used to analyze the difference in community composition at the genera level in each site as shown in fig 4 the shorter distance between the two sites indicates the higher similarity of the two microbial community structures the chao ace and shannon index of each sample in a3 site decreased with the water depth increasing the changing tendency of each sample s α diversity index in a2 and a1 was similar to that in a3 this result indicated that the abundance and diversity of bacteria in each site were affected by water depth furthermore in pca analysis the points representing the samples in the up layer were close to those in the middle layer but far away from those in the low layer in a1 a2 and a3 sites respectively the result indicated that the bacterial community structure in the up layer was similar to that in the middle layer but quite different from that in the low layer the main reasons for these phenomena were discussed as follows 1 because the low layer was the influent zone the types of influent substrates were few which was not beneficial for various bacteria to proliferate and resulted in the low layer s bacterial abundance and diversity lower than those in the middle and up layers 2 wastewater was pumped into the reactor through the low layer and pushed from the coarse sand zone below to the fine sand zone above then so4 2 no2 and organics were gradually degraded by the bacteria along the way from below to above especially for the degradation of organics acetate was degraded by the bacteria via the synthesis and catabolism reaction to generate a variety of small molecular organic acids which enriched the types of substrates in the middle layer and was conducive to the increase of the bacterial abundance and diversity 3 the mass transfer was good and the interchange rate was high at the junction zone of the fine sand zone and the main part of seawater which was conducive to the increase of bacterial abundance and diversity 4 the particle size of sands filled in the up and middle layers was small then the surface area provided for the biofilm s growth was more extensive than that in the low layer which was also beneficial for the increase of bacterial diversity and abundance the chao ace and shannon index in the up layer were similar to those in the middle layer it might be attributed to the distribution of dissolved oxygen do in the seawater and do decreasing gradually with the increase of water depth the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and autotrophic denitrifying bacteria are anaerobes and the key enzyme of denitrification nitrite reductase needs to be formed under anaerobic conditions 35 therefore the increasing do inhibited the anaerobic bacteria s growth which resulted in no more significant increase of bacterial diversity in the up layer than in the middle layer although the substrates types were more in the up layer than that in the middle layer 3 3 general variation tendency of microbial communities the experimental flow passed through a1 a2 and a3 regions successively as shown in fig 1 b the overall variation of the bacterial community in each zone along flow direction was analyzed and results were shown in fig 5 the types of bacterial genera with high relative abundance in a1 a3 were the same but the abundances of genera were different desulfobacter 28 4 sulfurimonas 21 3 fastidiosipila 6 8 pseudomonas 4 0 and desulfuromusa 2 8 were the top dominant bacteria in a1 desulfobacter 21 2 sulfurimonas 15 0 fastidiosipila 9 0 pseudomonas 3 0 and sedimentibacter 3 0 were the top dominant bacteria in a2 sulfurimonas 14 0 desulfobacter 13 8 fastidiosipila 8 0 sedimentibacter 3 4 and pseudomonas 3 3 were the top dominant bacteria in a3 desulfobacter is a typical srb with the function of restoring so4 2 36 sulfurimonas is the chemolithotrophic denitrifying bacterium which can use s2 as electron donors to reduce no2 to n2 37 however it was also reported that some organic compounds could promote its growth 38 it might be why sulfurimonas could exist in the mixotrophic environment of this work and had a high abundance fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter are the organics degrading bacteria that can degrade the macromolecular organics such as carbohydrates or proteins into small molecular organics 39 pseudomonas is a facultative denitrifying bacterium which is easier to grow under the heterotrophic conditions and reduces no2 to n2 40 therefore desulfobacter sulfurimonas fastidiosipila and pseudomonas were the main functional bacteria in the biofilm enhanced system which were involved in the degradation of so4 2 no2 and organics the different relative abundances of functional bacteria in a1 a3 indicated that each bacterial genus was involved in sulfate reduction organic degradation desulfurization denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification but the reaction rates were different this phenomenon was mainly attributed to the varying concentrations of pollutants in different sites a1 was close to the influent zone therefore the concentration of organics in a1 was high which was conducive to the multiplication of heterotrophic bacteria moreover large amounts of so4 2 could also serve as the abundant substrates for srb making desulfobacter the genus with the highest abundance in a1 meanwhile the high salt environment of high concentrations organics and so4 2 in a1 promoted the emergence of the salt tolerant srb desulfuromusa 41 therefore desulfobacter and desulfuromusa in a1 promoted the reduction of so4 2 to s2 as the substrate for desulfurization denitrification bacteria s2 promoted the proliferation of sulfurimonas and was consumed by sulfurimonas in large amounts the consumption of s2 promoted the forward reaction of sulfate reduction which was conducive to the growth of srb in a1 furthermore the high concentrations of organics and no2 in the wastewater also promoted the emergence of a large amount of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas and organics degrading bacteria fastidiosipila however the abundance of pseudomonas and fastidiosipila was less than that of desulfobacter indicating that the high salt mixotrophic environment was more conducive to the synergistic effect of srb and desulphurization denitrifying bacteria a2 was in the middle zone along the flow direction the concentrations of so4 2 and no2 decreased for their consumption in the front area resulting in the slight decrease in the abundance of desulfobacter sulfurimonas and pseudomonas using so4 2 and no2 as substrates meanwhile the demand for the organics by desulfobacter and pseudomonas decreased accordingly the concentration of remaining organics increased which was conducive to the proliferation of organics degrading bacteria hence the relative abundances of fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter increased a3 was the effluent zone the substrates required for srb in a3 had been mostly consumed in a1 and a2 sites ahead resulting in desulfobacter s abundance decreasing to 13 8 nevertheless a large amount of s2 produced by the sulfate reduction in a1 and a2 flowed to a3 it provided favorable condition for the desulfurization denitrifying bacteria s proliferation and sulfurimonas became the first dominant genus due to the decrease in srb s abundance the abundance of fastidiosipila sedimentibacter and pseudomonas that competed with srb for organic substrates increased slightly the seawater was used as the influent and brought the high salt stress environment which was an unfavorable factor for the bioreactor to run however the activated sludge was acclimated successfully and finally contained various salt tolerant bacteria such as desulfuromusa litoreibacter 42 the formation of this unique bacterial community was the basis for the efficient removal of no2 and organics in a high salt environment 10 additionally the mixotrophic environment was adopted in this system and the abundance of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria was much higher than that of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria two reasons caused this result first the sands of different sizes provided shelters and attaching carriers for the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria to elude organics second the autotrophic desulfurization denitrifying bacteria had higher salt tolerance than heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria which had also been confirmed by some other studies 43 3 4 spatial distribution characteristics of functional bacteria the bacteria involved in the conversion of sulfur nitrogen and carbon were considered as the functional bacteria in this system the top 40 genera of each sample were used to generate a heat map to show each functional genus s shift in different phases as shown in fig 6 desulfobacter 31 desulfobacterium 44 dethiosulfatibacter 45 fusibacter 46 and desulfotignum 47 could reduce so4 2 or thiosulfate s2o3 2 to s2 which were found to be the dominant bacteria in the reactor nevertheless the types of these srb were greatly different in 9 sites the phenomenon was caused by the gradual consumption of so4 2 and organics during the wastewater running forwards and upwards the carbon source was the main factor to affect the growth of srb 48 and the complex organic compounds could be degraded to the low molecular organic compounds by srb via the biological enzymes in its body 49 therefore the influent organics could be degraded by srb to the various low molecular organics that could be used by the other bacteria easily a1 was the influent zone and the concentrations of substrates were high but the types were few so that desulfobacter with acetate as the only electron donor had a high abundance so4 2 and organics were degraded to s2o3 2 and various small molecular organics in a1 these products were carried to a2 by the flowing wastewater s2o3 2 helped increase the abundances of desulfobacterium and fusibacter in a2 because these genera utilized s2o3 2 as substrates a3 was the effluent area and the concentration of organics was low in a3 which was helpful for the proliferation of the autotrophic srb desulfotignum that used carbon dioxide co2 as a carbon source the wastewater entered the reactor from the coarse sand zone at the bottom and flowed upwards through the fine sand zone to the main part of seawater finally with the decrease of water depth the abundance of so4 2 using srb decreased but the abundance of s2o3 2 using srb increased this phenomenon was discussed below a1 3 was near the entry point and the types of substrates were few there which led to the few species of dominant bacteria desulfobacter became the dominant bacteria a1 2 was close to a1 3 the species and abundances of srb in a1 2 were similar to those in a1 3 the relative abundance of heterotrophic srb desulfobacter decreased obviously in a1 1 because much organics was degraded in the low and middle layers in contrast the relative abundance of autotrophic srb desulfotignum increased much s2o3 2 was generated by desulfobacter in a1 3 and brought forwards to a2 3 by the flowing water leading to desulfobacterium s emergence in a2 3 the concentrations of s2o3 2 and do were higher in a2 1 than in a2 2 making the dominant srb change to fusibacter because fusibacter used s2o3 2 as an electron acceptor and had a high tolerance for do the concentrations of low molecular organics and s2o3 2 were relatively high in a3 3 which promoted the relative abundance of desulfotignum the concentration of organics was the lowest in a3 1 because a3 1 was near to the effluent point but the concentration of s2o3 2 was relatively high which promoted the abundance of fusibacter the srb in this system was different from those in the ordinary sewage treatment environment because of the high salt and high concentrations so4 2 the salt tolerant srb proliferated much under high salt stress in this system such as desulfuromusa sulfurimonas 50 was found to be the dominant functional bacteria for the desulfurization denitrification in the reactor while thermovirga 51 and desulfuromonas 48 were the main functional bacteria for sulfur s0 reduction so4 2 was reduced by srb to s2 which was the substrate for desulfurization denitrification bacteria the consumption of s2 by desulfurization denitrification bacteria promoted the forward reaction of sulfate reduction therefore srb and desulfurization denitrification bacteria could grow together under the conditions of high concentrations of organics and so4 2 in the a1 zone the concentrations of substrates were high in a1 3 close to the influent point much so4 2 was reduced to s2 in a1 3 promoting the proliferation of sulfurimonas to produce more s0 however the flow shear force was large in a1 3 to bring s0 to the middle and up layers a1 2 and a1 1 and so4 2 type srb was easier to proliferate than s0 type srb with high concentration so4 2 in a1 3 therefore the abundance of s0 type srb was low in the low layer a large amount of s0 and small molecule organics were generated in the low layer and were carried to a1 2 by the up flowing wastewater promoting the proliferation of litoreibacter and thermovirga in a1 2 in the a2 zone the concentrations of s2 and no2 brought to a2 3 by the flowing wastewater were relatively high leading to the high abundance of sulfurimonas the high concentrations of organics and s0 promoted the growth of desulfuromonas in a2 2 the ability of s0 type srb to utilize organics was higher than that of so4 2 type srb with the low concentrations so4 2 because so4 2 was degraded gradually with the decrease of water depth therefore the abundance of thermovirga was high in a2 1 in a3 the changing trend of relative abundances of desulphurization denitrification bacteria and s0 type srb was similar to that in a1 and a2 the abundances of so4 2 type srb and desulfurization denitrification bacteria decreased with the water depth decreasing in contrast the abundance of s0 type srb increased pseudomonas lentimicrobium 52 acidovorax 53 paracoccus 54 halomonas 55 defluviimonas 56 hyphomicrobium 57 and rhodobacter 58 were found to be the main functional bacteria for denitrification in the reactor the abundances and species of denitrifying bacteria increased gradually from a1 to a3 the main reasons for this phenomenon were discussed as follows on the one hand heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria competed with heterotrophic srb for organic carbon thus srb with high abundance in a1 was not conducive to the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria s proliferation on the other hand heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria competed with desulfurization denitrification bacteria for the electron acceptors no2 thus the desulfurization denitrification bacteria with high abundance in a1 and a2 were not conducive to the proliferation of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria therefore the competitiveness and abundance of pseudomonas were low in a1 the concentrations of macromolecular organics were high in a1 promoting the proliferation of lentimicrobium using macromolecular organics as substrates the macromolecular organics were degraded to the micromolecular organic acids these micromolecular organics were then carried to a2 by the water flow and promoted the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria s abundance the organics were degraded gradually along the water flowing direction and its concentration was low in a3 which was conducive to the proliferation of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria acidovorax and paracoccus in a3 furthermore heterotrophic denitrification reaction enhanced the alkalinity in a2 and a3 which promoted the growth of the halophilic alkali tolerant denitrifying bacteria halomonas the changing trend of the types and abundances of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the vertical direction was similar to that in the horizontal direction a1 3 a2 3 and a3 3 were the low layers in the reactor where the types of organic substrates were simple but the concentrations of so4 2 and s0 were relatively high compared to srb the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria had lower competitiveness for organics in the low layers leading to the low abundance of pseudomonas a1 2 a2 2 and a3 2 were the middle layers of the activated sludge zone where the types of organics were various but the concentration of s2 was not high the decreasing concentration of s2 reduced the competitiveness of desulfurization denitrification bacteria for no2 resulting in the emergence of defluviimonas and hyphomicrobium because they were the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria to use various organics and no2 as substrates a1 1 a2 1 and a3 1 were the up layers of the activated sludge zone where the concentrations of various organics decreased obviously this concentration of organics could not meet the heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria s metabolic needs and the abundance of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria increased instead the up layer of sludge was close to the main part of seawater wastewater it could receive some light from the water surface which led to the emergence of rhodobacter using light energy for denitrification fastidiosipila sedimentibacter sphaerochaeta 59 ercella 60 alkalispirochaeta 61 anerovorax 62 thermovirga 63 and syntrophomonas 64 were found to be the dominant functional bacteria for the organics degradation in the reactor in a1 a3 the changing trend of the organics degrading bacteria s abundance was opposite to that of srb the reason was discussed as follows the concentration of so4 2 was high in a1 close to the influent point the competitiveness of srb for organics in the high salt environment of a1 was more potent than that of organics degrading bacteria furthermore the high concentration of s2 generated by sulfate reduction also inhibited the metabolic activity of organics degrading bacteria 26 the various types of organics in a2 promoted the proliferation of fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter the concentrations of organics were not high in a3 but the types were various it promoted the enhancement of the abundance of sphaerochaeta ercella and sphingobium which were involved in the hydrolytic acidification the high alkalinity at the end of the reaction zone a3 promoted the proliferation of the halophilic alkali tolerant alkalispirochaeta in the vertical direction the abundance of organics degrading bacteria in the low layer was quite different from that in the middle and up layers fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter were mainly found in the middle and up layer and the abundances of organics degrading bacteria in the low layer were very low it was because that the srb utilized organics in the low layer and the produced s2 had the inhibition effect on the organics degrading bacteria s activity the types of organics were various in the middle and up layers and the concentration of do was not low thus fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter were more suitable to survive at this do level compared with srb anerovorax thermovirga and syntrophomonas using micromolecular organics as substrates also liked to proliferate in the environments with various organics and not low do the pollutants were gradually degraded along the water flowing direction resulting in a high complexity of the substrates in the a3 zone therefore many functional bacteria had high abundances in a3 2 and a3 1 close to the effluent point ottowia and thauera were found to be the main functional bacteria ottowia is a mixotrophic denitrifying bacteria to use both sulfur and carbon as electron donors and use no2 as an electron acceptor 65 thauera has the functions of denitrifying 66 and oxidizing s2 to s0 it also uses organics as electron donors and carbon sources to reduce so4 2 to s2 67 which played an essential role in the cycle of c n and s in the reactor additionally a high abundance of nitrogen fixing bacteria saccharicrinis emerged in a3 which could convert n2 to ammonia 68 because n2 was generated from the denitrification reaction the emergence of saccharicrinis indicated the high reaction rate of autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification reaction in a3 to sum up the methods adopted in this work promoted the gradual degradation of various pollutants and the reasonable spatial distribution of various functional bacteria such as setting influent point at the bottom using sands of different particle sizes as fillers for biofilm adopting horizontal push flow and prolonging the salt wastewater flow path these methods ensured the reaction system to run efficiently and stably 3 5 functional genes and metabolic pathway the relative abundance of each genus based on the second level metabolic pathway analysis of kegg was shown in fig 7 and the dominating functional genes and their encoded related enzymes were shown in fig 8 the abundances of bacteria with amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism functions were relatively high in the reaction system which indicated that these two kinds of metabolism were the main metabolic ways in the biofilm enhanced system it was analyzed that there were two main amino acid sources in this reactor no2 could be used by desulfurization denitrification bacteria to generate amino acid via the anabolism 69 the organics released by the dead microorganisms could be further degraded to amino acid via catabolism the amino acid metabolism could enhance extracellular polymeric substances eps formation and eps was an essential structural component of the biofilm to protect cells from external shocks and buffer the adverse effects on cells 70 72 therefore the functional flora with amino acid metabolism represented by pseudomonas played an important role in maintaining the biofilm system s stable operation in this study the abundances of bacteria with the amino acid metabolism increased gradually with reducing water depth indicating that the biofilms in the middle and up layers were stable and the transformation among nitrogenous compounds was intense this deduction corresponded to the high abundances of acidovorax paracoccus defluviimonas hyphomicrobium and rhodobacter in the middle and up layers of the activated sludge zone fig 6 moreover it was reported that high salt stress could reduce the dehydrogenase activity of denitrifying bacteria to inhibit their growth and metabolism but domesticated denitrifying bacteria had high tolerance to the high salt stress 73 in this work the denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas was found to have a high abundance in high salt environments which confirmed the view above that domesticated denitrifying bacteria could adapt to high salt environments well with the help of the amino acid metabolism and formation of eps carbohydrate metabolism is the primary channel to degrade organics to inorganics and release co2 and water h2o it is also a typical bacterial energy generation and biosynthesis process in activated sludge 74 as shown in fig 7 the abundances of bacteria with carbohydrate metabolism increased gradually with the water depth reducing the reason for this phenomenon was discussed below in the low layer the dominant bacteria srb degraded organics by the enzymes in the body and excreted some micro molecular organics outside the cell the heterotrophic bacteria also degraded organics to the micro molecular carbohydrates by the extracellular enzymes these organics were then brought from the low layer to the up layer by the flowing water as a result the types of organics in the middle and up layers were diversified which was beneficial for the abundances of bacteria with organic metabolic to increase the abundances of heterotrophic bacteria except for srb were relatively high in the up layer corresponding to the high abundances of desulfobacter fastidiosipila and pseudomonas fig 5 and the high removal efficiencies of toc fig 2 various functional genes related to the sulfate reduction and desulfurization denitrification in the system were detected including sulfate reduction genes sulfur oxidation genes and denitrification genes as shown in fig 8 a total of 11 sulfate reduction genes were found to have high abundances indicating the sulfate reduction reaction s high strength in the system 7 sulfate reduction genes were involved in the assimilation sulfate reduction including sat k00958 encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase cysn k00956 encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 1 cysd k00957 encoding sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 2 cysc k00860 encoding adenylysulfate kinase cysh k00390 encoding phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase cysj k00380 encoding sulfite reductase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph flavoprotein alpha component and cysi k00381 encoding sulfite reductase nadph hemoprotein beta component 75 so4 2 was transformed into adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps via sat cysn and cysd aps was transformed into 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate paps via cysc paps was transformed into sulfite so3 2 via cysh so3 2 was transformed into s2 via cysj and cysi four other sulfate reduction genes were involved in the dissimilation sulfate reduction including apra k00394 and aprb k00395 encoding adenylylsulfate reductase subunit a and b dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase alpha subunit and beta subunit 76 furthermore sat was also involved in the dissimilation reaction so4 2 was transformed into aps via sat aps was transformed into so3 2 via apra and aprb so3 2 was transformed into s2 via dsra and dsrb as shown in fig 8 a the abundances of functional genes assimilated sulfate reduction were higher than those of functional genes dissimilated sulfate reduction this result indicated that the sulfate reduction in this bacterial system was mainly accomplished by the assimilation way and partly accomplished by the dissimilation way contrary to the conclusion obtained by ruckert c 77 with the conditions of toc so4 2 less than 2 the carbon sources were in short supply and the produced stream of electrons was less which was conducive to the assimilation of sulfate 76 dsra and dsrb could be found in desulfobacter desulfobacterium deslfotignum and arpa could be found in desulfotignum a total of 4 functional genes for sulfur oxidation were detected in the biofilm including sqr k00344 encoding sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sox k00301 encoding sarcosine oxidase dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase alpha subunit and beta subunit sqr was mainly involved in the oxidation of s2 to s0 76 sox was involved in the process of s0 s2o3 2 oxidation to so4 2 dsra and dsrb were only involved in the oxidation of s0 78 s2 was the reaction product of so4 2 reduction and was oxidized to s0 via sqr s0 was further oxidized to so4 2 via sox dsra and dsrb sulfur oxidation and sulfate reduction cooperated to form a closed cycle in which s2 and s0 acted only as intermediates as shown in fig 8 b the abundances of sqr and sox decreased with the water depth increasing it was discussed below on the one hand the abundance of srb was high in the low layer leading to the high reaction rate of sulfate reduction then much s2 was generated and brought to the up layer to react with intracellular metal ions to inhibit the other bacteria s enzyme activity 79 on the other hand the concentration of do was relatively high in the up layer promoting the increase of sulfur oxidation genes abundances in the up layer because oxygen o2 could also provide electrons for the oxidation of s2 and s0 sqr and sox could be found in pseudomonas and thauera a total of 7 denitrification functional genes were found in the system they were nira k00366 nirb k00362 nirc k002598 nird k00363 and nirs k00368 encoding nitrite reductase norq k04748 encoding nitric oxide reductase nos k00376 encoding nitrous oxide reductase 80 among them nirs was a special gene in salt tolerant bacteria and had high tolerance to high salt environment 79 no2 was reduced to nitric oxide no via nira nirb nirc nird and nirs then no was reduced to nitrous oxide n2o via norq n2o was converted to n2 via nos many nitrite reductase genes were detected in this reaction system indicating that there were many types of nitrite reducing bacteria because nitrite reductase had attributes of exclusiveness and only one type of nitrite reductase could be detected in one type of bacteria 81 it might be caused by many reducing substances such as organics s2 polysulfide sn 2 s0 and s2o3 2 because all of them could provide electrons for no2 and different bacteria used different substances as electron donors nirs and nosz could be found in thauera under the high salty environment the various metabolic genes functions and their relative abundances in different reaction system sites were analyzed comprehensively to speculate the metabolic pathways of c n and s via desulfobacter sulfurimonas and pseudomonas as shown in fig 9 on the one hand the stable operation efficiency was achieved in the reaction system because various substrates were degraded and utilized via the synergistic competitive action of srb desulfurization denitrification bacteria and denitrifying bacteria on the other hand the changing concentrations of pollutants in different sites promoted the unique bacterial communities formation and affected the microorganisms central metabolic pathways furthermore the high concentration of so4 2 was the basis for the efficient operation of this biofilm enhanced seawater treatment system so4 2 stimulated the activity of autotrophic desulfurization denitrification bacteria and made them participate in the sulfur oxidation reduction cycle which in turn promoted the degradation of organics and the reduction of no2 82 4 conclusions the biofilm enhanced high salt wastewater treatment reactor was used to remove no2 and organics simultaneously using sulfate reduction as an intermediate reaction the main conclusions were drawn as follows firstly the removal efficiencies of no2 and toc reached 100 respectively s2 was added to the influent in the initial stage of the system operation which had inhibition on heterotrophic reactions thus the heterotrophic denitrification was weak leading to the low removal efficiencies of no2 and toc however with the increasing reaction rate of sulfate reduction in the middle and later stages the biofilm enhanced system achieved high operational efficiencies via the synergistic actions of heterotrophic autotrophic denitrification and sulfate reduction reaction secondly desulfobacter sulfurimonas fastidiosipila and pseudomonas were found to be the main functional bacteria in the biofilm because the various pollutants were gradually degraded and transformed along the water flow direction the relative abundances of bacteria varied in different sites the reaction rates of sulfate reduction desulfurization denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification also changed in different sites in the horizontal direction the overall abundances and diversities of bacteria were the lowest at the end of water flow in the vertical direction the bacterial community structures of biofilm in the up and middle layers were quite different from that in the low layer the overall bacterial abundances and diversities decreased with the increase of water depth thirdly various functional genes for sulfate reduction sulfur oxidation and denitrification were found in the system the sulfate reduction was accomplished by sat cysn cysd cysc cysh cysj cysi apra aprb dsra and dsrb genes via the assimilation and dissimilation sulfate pathway the sulfide oxidation and nitrite reduction were mainly accomplished by sqr sox dsra dsrb nira nirb nirc nird nirs norq and nos genes via autotrophic heterotrophic denitrification pathway finally the high salt seawater promoted the synergistic reaction of srb and desulfurization denitrification bacteria the measures such as water intake at the bottom adopting sands with different particle sizes as fillers for biofilm and horizontal push flow to prolong the flowing path promoted the gradual degradation of various pollutants and the spatial distribution of various functional bacteria which ensured the stable and efficient operation of the biofilm enhanced seawater wastewater treatment

13669,the preparation and characterization of a solid adsorbent consisting of magnetic and iron modified calcium silicate hydrate mag fenanocsh was studied the adsorbent prepared using two kinds of magnetite fe3o4 was evaluated for the simultaneous removal of cations and anions from synthetic aqueous mine water the adsorbent synthesis was found to be very efficient and reproducible sem and tem images showed that the adsorbent is formed by agglomerates of spherical particles with diameters between 20 nm and 170 nm bet porosimetry analysis indicated that the resulting solid presents a specific surface area of 50 70 m2 g vsm analysis confirmed that the particles exhibit a magnetic saturation between 33 emu g and 64 emu g which is high enough to enable their separation from aqueous raffinates using common magnets the adsorbents are chemically stable in aqueous solutions with ph values above 3 0 in this ph range approximately 99 of the cu ii cd ii and pb ii initially present in aqueous solution was removed via ion exchange and salt and or hydroxide formation chemisorption mechanisms furthermore the magnetic and fe modified calcium silicates enabled as v adsorption close to 98 when a sufficient adsorbent dosage was used forming very insoluble and stable salts that could be safely disposed of later using the mag fenanocsh adsorbents a high initial rate of ion adsorption was observed the kinetics data are well explained by a pseudo second order kinetic model keywords ion adsorbents magnetic compounds iron modified calcium silicate acid waters adsorption kinetics 1 introduction the atacama desert located in the northern part of chile and widely known as one of the most arid areas in the world is where most of the national mining activity takes place the scarcity of water resources has spread over the last few years the significant rainwater shortage not exceeding 80 mm or less per year plus the high levels of water evaporation have led to negative water balances every year moreover the increase in water demand in several areas not only for mining activities but also for agriculture domestic use and other industries has worsened this challenge 1 2 in addition to the recycling of plant water commonly observed in mining operations during the last few decades other options to provide water to mine sites have been implemented such as the direct use of seawater or if applicable partially or fully desalinated seawater 3 regardless of the plant water origin intensive efficient simple and low cost treatments are inevitably required the wastewaters coming from mining plants as well as those naturally produced by weathering of tailings materials including acid mine drainage amd contain many pollutants that need to be removed to comply with current environmental regulations 4 the considered pollutants encompass a wide variety of heavy metals anions and oxyanions many of which are toxic and dangerous and contain excess acid alkali high salinity and a large proportion of suspended fine solid colloidal material 5 6 several technologies can be used to treat acidic waters produced from mining activities such as chemical precipitation 7 ion exchange 8 solvent extraction 9 membrane technologies 10 and biological methods 11 all of these technologies present advantages and shortcomings for instance chemical precipitation with lime presents various problems such as redissolution of metal precipitates a requirement for large amounts of chemicals generation of a large volume of sludge whose disposal is quite complex and unsuitability for eliminating traces or low contents of many pollutants other widely used technologies include solvent extraction processing however this presents some difficulties such as the loss of extractant and solvent and entrainment between phases currently adsorption technologies can become a practical and valuable unit operation in water treatment given the diversity of available efficient and low cost adsorbents the most common adsorbent used for water treatment is activated carbon 12 but other compounds including zeolites 13 14 clays 15 and organic compounds such as chitosan 16 17 and modified alginates 18 have also been studied inorganic adsorbents are more convenient than bioadsorbents given their stability in acidic and oxidizing environments for example mno2 zro2 al2o3 cuo and tio2 19 20 have been widely used nevertheless normally such inorganic absorbents are incapable of adsorbing cations and anions simultaneously these adsorbents have very different adsorption properties and capabilities but the application of some of them in industrial applications is limited the novelty of this manuscript resides in the synthesis of a magnetic iron modified calcium silicate hydrate for use as an adsorbent for ions contained in aqueous solutions that simulate acidic mine waters this study also includes the corresponding adsorption kinetic analysis applied to these new adsorbents previously we reported the synthesis and characterization of non modified nanostructured calcium silicate hydrates without magnetic properties having excellent adsorption capacities for metal ions 21 later the treatment of acidic mine drainage using non magnetized iron modified calcium silicates was reported using fecl3 and fe oh 3 as iron bearing reagents the removal of arsenic species was achieved at levels matching those required to meet environmental regulations for water discharge to continental or marine water bodies 22 effectively most of the mining waters in our country contain a relatively significant and variable amount of dissolved arsenic species however the separation of the adsorbent from the treated mine aqueous solutions by conventional settling and or filtration methodologies remains quite cumbersome one option to overcome this difficulty is to confer magnetic properties to the adsorbents 23 28 initially we magnetized nanostructured calcium silicate not modified with fe which exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity for different contaminants 29 then the adsorbent composite prepared in this work was expected to enhance the removal of arsenical species without losing the adsorption capacity of other ions simultaneously facilitating the separation of the adsorbent from aqueous raffinate using a conventional magnet this adsorbent was synthetized and contacted with laboratory prepared aqueous solutions that simulate real acidic mine waters 2 experimental procedure 2 1 synthesis of the adsorbents two types of adsorbents were prepared i a nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate modified with fe iii and magnetized with commercial magnetite nanoparticles 50 100 nm molecular weight 231 53 supplied by sigma aldrich mag fenanocsh cm and ii a calcium silicate hydrate modified with fe iii but magnetized with synthesized magnetite mag fenanocsh sm in the latter case first fe3o4 was synthesized using fecl2 4h2o and fecl3 6h2o as iron precursors supplied by merck r g as reported previously 26 30 a blackish product was easily separated from the reaction mixture using a neodymium magnet the resulting solid was washed with distilled water and dried at 40 c for 12 h second the magnetized adsorbent was prepared by mixing ca oh 2 and fecl3 6h2o in a glass reactor in water acidified with hcl all reagents from merck r g the reaction mixture was gently stirred until complete dissolution of the calcium hydroxide then magnetite commercial or synthesized was aggregated followed by the addition of na2sio3 aqueous solution whose composition included 26 5 sio2 and 10 6 na2o with a specific gravity of 1 39 25 c this final mixture was stirred at 2000 rpm for approximately 1 h after completion of the reaction the resulting solid was removed from the reaction vessel with the aid of a neodymium magnet the solid was washed with small portions of ethanol merck r g the final wet cake was dried at 80 c for 12 h 2 2 characterization of adsorbents the prepared adsorbents were subjected to chemical physical and magnetic analyses scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem analyses were performed using an fei inspector f50 model bet porosimetry analysis was also performed using a 2010 asap micrometrics asap device with nitrogen gas at 77 k to verify whether or not the prepared solids have crystalline or amorphous characteristics the particles of the synthesized adsorbents were submitted to x ray diffraction xrd analysis using a bruker d8 advance device information regarding the sample magnetic behaviour was gathered by obtaining magnetism curves using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm the calcium and iron contents in the synthesized adsorbents were determined using acid digestion followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas using perkin elmer pinaacle 900 equipment the percentage of silicon in the adsorbents was measured using elemental analysis when necessary inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was employed to measure the trace metal contents 2 3 adsorbent stability and adsorption studies considering that the adsorbents will be used to remove ionic species from acidic aqueous solutions the first experiments were designed to test the chemical stability of the obtained solids as a function of the acidity of the aqueous solutions targeted for treatment fifty milligrams of the adsorbent was placed into an orbital shaker at 25 c with aqueous solutions with different ph values ranging between 1 and 6 the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m h2so4 and naoh 0 1 m the amounts of ca and fe dissolved in the aqueous solutions were measured by aas after completion of the experiment adsorption experiments were carried out at ph 4 0 and 25 c with aqueous solutions that simulate mine water with varying chemical compositions 100 mg l cu ii 50 mg l cd ii 40 mg l as v and 10 mg l pb ii the experiments were performed using a glass batch stirred reactor specific adsorption values are reported after the adsorption experiments were completed the solid adsorbent loaded with the removed ionic species was easily separated from the raffinate using a permanent neodymium magnet the equilibrium ph of the raffinate was measured and reported as well as the residual concentration of the ionic species not removed by the adsorbent the mass of ions adsorbed onto the adsorbent ion was determined by using a mass balance specific adsorption kinetics experiments for cu ii cd ii and as v ions were also carried out using magnetized iron modified nanostructured calcium silicates the experimental results obtained were analysed using different kinetics adsorption models 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of the adsorbents first magnetite was synthesized via coprecipitation of fe ii and fe iii salts in an alkaline medium under an inert atmosphere obtaining a black oxide material according to the following equation 1 2 f e 3 f e 2 4 o h f e 3 o 4 4 h the synthesis of magnetite proved to be efficient fast and reproducible with yields close to 92 the synthesized magnetite exhibited particle sizes ranging between 40 nm and 80 nm slightly finer than the particle size of commercial magnetite according to the supplier information the material has a particle size ranging between 80 nm and 120 nm this result explains why higher surface areas were obtained for the case of the adsorbent prepared with the magnetite synthesized in this study than when commercial magnetite was used as presented in table 1 below however this difference in surface area did not affect the good adsorption capacity of either type of adsorbent second nanostructured calcium silicate modified with fe iii and magnetized with fe3o4 was synthesized the chemical reaction governing this step is presented in eq 2 which is based on the reaction of an aqueous solution of na2sio3 and ca oh 2 in an acidic medium using a high stirring speed 2 na 2 sio 3 a q ca oh 2 s 2 hcl a q casio 3 s 2 nacl a q 2 h 2 o l this reaction is very fast and the interaction of ca ii ions with soluble silicate leads to the formation of very insoluble and amorphous solids iron atoms added as fecl3 tend to replace some calcium atoms in calcium silicate however as previously published there is a limit for iron addition to calcium silicate of approximately 13 molar because any excess over this value produces a brittle solid in which fe oh 3 is deposited on the surface losing the nanostructure and lowering its adsorption capacity 22 the magnetization of the adsorbent composite occurs during the formation of calcium silicate according to eq 2 by the addition of a certain amount of synthesized or commercial magnetite the addition of hcl is relevant to facilitate the dissolution and dispersion of ca oh 2 in the reaction medium given its low solubility in water fe3o4 was added after adding hcl thus preventing the acid medium and possible oxidizing conditions from partially dissolving the iron oxide or producing maghemite fe2o3 with lower magnetic susceptibility than the original magnetite this oxidation of magnetite to maghemite during the synthesis can explain the lower magnetic saturation of the adsorbent prepared using this synthesized magnetite as is later shown in table 2 the synthesis yield was determined to be 95 for obtaining a product that was a fine solid easy to grind with a reddish black colour thixotropic in nature 31 and with magnetic properties the thixotropic character explains the agglomeration of the resulting particles previously it had been reported that the structure of these silicates consists of a backbone of silicate plates with a thickness of approximately 2 nm 10 nm based on silicate tetrahedrals with calcium ions and silanol groups on the surface which can act as binding or nucleation sites 21 32 however this yield is apparent since more than one synthesis product can be obtained and all of the products are different types of calcium silicate hydrates with various degrees of hydration the latter takes place since these solutions particularly those with an industrial nature typically contain silicates and silica oligomers with different chain lengths which can produce different types of silicates can the characteristics of the prepared adsorbent composite and its structure explain its subsequent efficient behaviour as adsorbent different silicates were synthesized using two proportions of iron modified calcium silicate hydrate and magnetite ratios fenanocsh fe3o4 1 1 and 2 1 once the synthesis was completed the solid was easily separated from the reaction medium by introducing a permanent neodymium magnet 3 2 characterization of the adsorbent composites figs 1 and 2 show sem micrographs of the nanostructured calcium silicates modified with fe iii magnetized with commercial magnetite and with the fe3o4 prepared in this study respectively smaller particle sizes are observed varying between 20 40 nm for the adsorbents prepared with the synthesized magnetite evidencing in this case its characteristic of being a nanomaterial fig 2 such nanomaterial is formed without a clear shape the particle size measured for the adsorbents prepared with commercial magnetite turned out to be larger particle sizes ranging between 80 nm and 170 nm still in the upper range of the nanomaterial following a clearer spherical shape the coarser particle sizes observed in this case may be explained by the initial particle size of the commercial magnetite used in the experiment between 80 nm and 120 nm both sem images exhibit agglomerated structures consisting of small spherical particles when the particles agglomerate macropores are generated between them which also become available adsorption sites as was later verified with bet porosimetry analyses fig 3 shows a tem image of a sample of nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate modified with iron and magnetized with commercial magnetite particle agglomeration and particle sizes ranging between 80 nm and 160 nm are confirmed x ray diffraction xrd analysis indicated that the non magnetized nanostructured calcium silicates possess an amorphous structure 32 however the magnetized adsorbents prepared in this work show a dark nucleus with a certain degree of crystallinity most likely corresponding to magnetite being surrounded by more amorphous layers of calcium silicate as is also observed in the tem images of fig 3 moreover the diffractogram for an adsorbent prepared previously and corresponding to a nanostructured calcium silicate not modified with fe iii but magnetized with fe3o4 showed that the solid only showed crystallinity signals due to the presence of magnetite 29 porosimetry analysis was performed by n2 sorptometry at 77 k using approximately 0 2 g samples previously dried at 60 c the results are presented in table 1 table 1 shows that commercial magnetite presents a bet surface much smaller than that of the synthesized material all the composites have mesoporous structures with similar surface areas in the range of 50 70 m2 g pore volumes of approximately 0 24 0 38 cm3 g and pore diameters ranging between 5 nm and 9 nm 33 the surface areas obtained are consistent with a large number of adsorption sites both on the external surface and on the accessible internal surface of the composites figs 4 and 5 show the adsorption desorption isotherms for the prepared adsorbents magnetized with commercial and synthesized fe3o4 respectively fig 5 a greater volume of n2 intrusion is observed for the case of adsorbents prepared with synthesized magnetite compared to the compounds prepared with commercial magnetite this is consistent with the greater pore volume measured for these composites table 1 the desorption curves coincide practically with the adsorption curves corresponding to a mixture between types ii and iii indicating the existence of not only a weak gas solid interaction but also large pores 34 desorption of the gas is somewhat slower than adsorption and eventual pore condensation 35 this narrow type hysteresis cycle indicates that the adsorbent presents a regular and uniform pore size distribution the filling of the mesopores at relative pressures between 0 1 and 0 8 p p0 is observed in all the hysteresis curves at higher relative pressures 0 8 filling with the gas can correspond to the macropores formed around the agglomeration or aggregation of particles all of which are associated with the internal structure of the silicates formed however the difference in the surface areas determined for the adsorbents prepared with both types of magnetite did not affect their adsorption capacity obtaining similar results for the removal of the different ions table 2 shows the measured magnetic saturation ms results for each of the prepared adsorbents using vsm analysis it is confirmed that all the compounds maintain their magnetic properties table 2 with the samples associated with commercial magnetite exhibiting the highest magnetization value 91 5 emu g similar to values described in the literature 36 magnetization losses are observed as the proportion of fe modified calcium silicate increases with respect to the amount of magnetite employed in the synthesis it is also observed that the magnetic saturation values for the adsorbent magnetized with commercial magnetite are higher than those for magnetite synthesized in our laboratory this can be attributed to the fact that during magnetite synthesis and the preparation of the adsorbent partial oxidation of magnetite fe3o4 to maghemite fe2o3 can occur 37 figs 6 and 7 present the magnetization curves corresponding to the adsorbents prepared using commercial and synthetized magnetite respectively the values for the coercivity and residual magnetization are close to zero which can indicate the presence of superparamagnetic nanoparticles a single magnetic domain this is consistent with the particle size measured for adsorbents varying between 20 nm and 200 nm depending on the type of magnetite used in the synthesis such superparamagnetic behaviour can allow particles to be separated using a magnet and easily redispersed by gentle agitation in the aqueous phase the latter can facilitate their reuse in several adsorption desorption cycles samples of non magnetized nanostructured calcium silicates do not have a magnetic response therefore they are not separable from an aqueous solution by the action of a conventional magnet on the other hand the adsorbent properties of magnetite are low then it can be established that the magnetized nanostructured calcium silicate compound is a suitable adsorbent with magnetic properties and simultaneously a high adsorption capacity the results presented in table 2 as determined from figs 6 and 7 show that all the synthesized compounds possess sufficient magnetic saturation variable between 33 emu g and 63 emu g which enabled complete separation of the adsorbents loaded with the ions removed from aqueous raffinate one of the main objectives of this study table 3 shows the mass percent of calcium and iron in the synthesized adsorbents the chemical analysis is consistent with the proportion of calcium silicate modified with fe iii with respect to the amount of fe3o4 used in the synthesis moreover a silicon content ranging between 5 6 and 11 2 was measured in the adsorbents it is clear that as the silicate ratio with respect to magnetite increases the percentage of calcium and silicon increases and the iron content decreases 3 3 adsorption experiments 3 3 1 adsorbent stability towards acid solutions the modification of nano structured calcium silicate with fe iii did not affect the chemical stability of the adsorbent and was stable when in contact with aqueous solutions with ph values equal to or higher than 2 0 however the magnetization of both types of magnetite commercial and synthesized slightly affected the chemical stability being approximately stable only from ph 3 0 towards the alkaline region fig 8 presents the results of experiments carried out to measure the chemical stability of the adsorbents when in contact with aqueous solutions of variable acidity the iron dissolution is practically zero even less than 1 when contacted with aqueous solutions of ph greater than 2 0 the calcium dissolution is somewhat higher but it does not increase beyond 3 in the ph range between 2 and 3 above ph 3 0 the dissolution of calcium ions is negligible these values ensure an acceptable chemical stability for the adsorbents prepared in this study to be used when treating acid mines and metallurgical waters highly polluted with many ions the presence of fe atoms can provide calcium silicate with a more rigid and inert structure within the magnetic structure most of the iron atoms form the nucleus of the adsorbent and are protected from the action of hydrogen ions present in aqueous solutions in turn coating external layers of the adsorbent can correspond to amorphous calcium silicate hydrate which is more exposed to the effect of the acidity of the aqueous phase slightly increasing calcium dissolution 3 3 2 effect of the initial ph of the aqueous solution the acidity of mine waters can vary enormously depending on which mineral they are associated with the characteristics and composition of the mineral exploited and the natural conditions typical of mining operations therefore the first experiments for treating mine water were carried out using different technologies to observe how they respond in different acidity conditions in particular regarding the use of nanostructured calcium silicates modified or not in all our experiments including those in this study the results indicate that if an adequate adsorbent mass is utilized independent of the initial acidity of the treated mine water a very high removal of ionic species is reached 22 29 using a variable initial acidity range between ph 3 and 7 the equilibrium ph values in all cases shifted to ph values ranging between 8 and 9 5 the silicates can act as buffers stabilizing the final ph of the raffinate obtained th us avoiding the redissolution of the solids obtained given this in this communication we report the results of adsorption tests in which an aqueous solution with an initial ph of 4 0 was used a representative average acidity value for many mine waters 3 3 3 effect of the dosage of adsorbent fig 9 shows the results obtained for the adsorption of ionic species namely as v cu ii cd ii and pb ii from an aqueous solution that simulates mine water at ph 4 0 when in contact with various adsorbent quantities prepared with a proportion of fenanocsh fe3o4 of 1 1 the adsorption of ions is not significantly affected by the nature of the magnetite present at the core of the adsorbent particles fig 9 also presents the adsorption using the composites and the impact of the modification of nanostructured calcium silicate with fe iii on as v adsorption the adsorption of the ions increases with the amount of adsorbent available which is consistent with a higher availability of active adsorption sites however the experimental results indicate that at low or insufficient amounts of the adsorbent compound the removal of divalent metallic ions prevails over the uptake of arsenic indeed a low quantity of mag fenanocsh is required to reach almost quantitative adsorption of cu ii cd ii and pb ii nevertheless when a sufficient amount of adsorbent is used to treat this type of aqueous acid solution as v ions are also quantitatively removed therefore it can be stated that under certain experimental conditions these adsorbents show a significant capacity to simultaneously remove both cationic and anionic species interestingly the adsorption of as v ions is enhanced when the nanostructured calcium silicate adsorbent is modified with fe iii which confirms the active role of this metal in wastewater treatment the results from previous adsorption tests indicate that when using calcium silicate modified with neither fe iii nor magnetized the removal of arsenic species is low however modification of calcium silicate with fe iii not only improves the adsorption yield of as v but also leads to the formation of a stabilized double salt of calcium and iron that is more insoluble than calcium arsenate as expected for the case of the adsorbent without modification with iron this aspect is relevant because in the labour of practical mining regardless of the strategy implemented to remove arsenic from acidic aqueous solutions the solids produced must be safely disposed of in tailings ponds one possibility to achieve the latter is to produce highly insoluble and inert materials to avoid groundwater contamination in principle the iron within the magnetite structure will only impart magnetic properties to the adsorbent and will not interfere with the adsorption mechanisms in fact adsorption tests performed only with fe3o4 did not show significant adsorption of the tested ions 3 3 4 discussion as v is usually found in acidic waters forming arsenate type species aso4 3 haso4 2 h2aso4 and to a lesser extent at strongly acidic ph values forms arsenic acid h3aso4 38 arsenites aso3 3 can also be found in many mine waters the adsorption of arsenic species in these adsorbents can occur in a process based on an anion exchange mechanism between the silicate and the arsenate ions according to the following stages i first stage of diffusion of anionic arsenical species in solution towards the surface of the adsorbent ii second stage of adsorption of the arsenate ions by electrostatic attraction onto the iron modified calcium silicate surface and iii release of the sio3 2 ions to the raffinate aqueous solutions considering that at over ph 2 the predominant as v species are h2aso4 and haso4 2 eqs 3 and 4 illustrate the anionic exchange mechanism for the arsenates eq 3 represents the adsorption of haso4 2 species on the surface of the adsorbent while eq 4 shows the release of silicate ions towards the raffinate solutions 3 f e c a s i o 3 s h a s o 4 2 a q f e c a s i o 3 h a s o 4 2 s 4 f e c a s i o 3 h a s o 4 2 s f e c a h a s o 4 s s i o 3 2 a q where fe ca sio3 represents the iron modified calcium silicate the subscript s denotes the solid surface of the adsorbent and the subscript aq denotes the aqueous solution then calcium and iron atoms act as binding sites for the removal of arsenate ions the solids obtained during the adsorption process are very stable and insoluble having enough magnetic properties that enable their easy separation from the raffinate via use of a common magnet the double salts fe ca haso4 are more insoluble than ca haso4 mitigating redissolution mechanisms in the resulting aqueous raffinate 39 excellent removal of the cationic species cd ii cu ii and pb ii was achieved therefore nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate modified with iron and magnetized with both types of fe3o4 does not lose its ability to simultaneously adsorb cationic and anionic species in addition to the chemisorption of these cations onto the adsorbent surface physical adsorption of fine solid particles suspended in treated water was also observed the adsorption of these cationic species is fast and efficient probably because fe modified calcium silicate alkalizes the aqueous solution quickly acting as a buffer and keeping the ph of the raffinate above 8 0 experiments carried out with aqueous solutions with different initial acidities also led to good adsorption results divalent ions m2 such as cu ii cd ii or pb ii can be adsorbed by combined and parallel mechanisms one option involves forming the respective hydroxide or mixed hydroxides with the oh of the silanol groups of the silicates generating sufficient alkalinity for their precipitation as proposed in eqs 5 and 6 5 f e c a s i o h s 2 o h f e c a s i o h o h 2 2 s 6 f e c a s i o h o h 2 s 2 m a q 2 f e c a s i o h s m o h 2 s where fe ca si oh represents the hydrate type adsorbent that can form an intermediate polyhydroxylated species according to eq 5 this species can then enable the formation of the metal hydroxide m oh 2 as represented in eq 6 another possible and parallel mechanism entails a cation exchange mechanism between the adsorbed metal and the ca atoms present in the silicate structure which can be released into the raffinate solution as shown in eq 7 7 f e c a s i o h s m 2 a q f e m s i o h c a a q 2 the presence of calcium in the raffinates was evidenced by measuring its contents by aas nevertheless it has been confirmed that hydroxides can also form on the surface of silicate adsorbents generating complex solid species that are also easily removed from the aqueous solution by a neodymium magnet it is possible to verify that neither modification with iron nor magnetization detrimentally impacts the potential of previously reported adsorbents based on nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate due to economic reasons or with the purpose of recovering valuable species from the loaded adsorbents when it is technically possible some of the industrial adsorbents are regenerated in order to be used in new adsorption and desorption cycles however in this case it is unnecessary because of their low cost of production in industrial scale tests industrial lime an industrial sodium silicate solution used in the detergent industry and mineral magnetite have been employed as raw materials maintaining their adsorbent properties on the other hand as a compound based on silicate it can be safely disposed of in tailings ponds or landfills 3 4 adsorption kinetics of ionic species adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out to track and understand the progress of the process with time and the results obtained were analysed using kinetics models different authors have proposed distinct adsorption rate models to explain the experimental results using natural or synthetic adsorbents 40 43 these models generally consider a mass transfer process accompanied by chemical reactions that includes the diffusion of the adsorbate from the bulk aqueous phase towards the external surface of the adsorbent physisorption mechanism followed by a chemical reaction mechanism between the adsorbent and the adsorbate chemisorption mechanism first a diffusional model was also applied however it could not explain the experimental results therefore it was not included in this communication 44 a pseudo first order model pfo corresponding to a model developed by ho and mckay in 1998 and applied by other authors was also analysed 45 46 which is represented by eq 8 8 d q t d t k 1 q e q t where qt expressed in m m o l g is the molar amount of the adsorbed metal per gram of adsorbent at any time t m i n q e is the molar amount of the metal ions adsorbed under equilibrium conditions in m m o l g and k represents the kinetic adsorption constant of the model expressed in m i n 1 integrating the previous equation using the boundary conditions a t 0 q 0 and a t t q qt eq 9 is obtained 9 q t q e 1 e k 1 t in addition a pseudo second order kinetics model pso states that the adsorption rate depends on the number of active sites available for adsorption raised to the second power 47 48 as expressed by eq 10 10 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 integrating and rearranging the previous equation between the limits at t 0 qt 0 and a t t qt qe eq 11 is obtained 11 q t q e 2 k t 1 q e k t where k2 represents the rate adsorption constant of the model expressed in g m g m i n both kinetics pseudo order models are sensitive to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent rather than the concentration of the adsorbate in the aqueous phase this means that the adsorption will depend not only on the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction but also on the particle size adsorbent dosage stirring speed used in the process adsorbate concentration and the diffusion of the adsorbate towards the adsorbent 49 many experiments were carried out using the same aqueous solution that simulates mine water but different synthesized adsorbents representative adsorption kinetics curves for as v cu ii and cd ii using some of the adsorbents prepared in this study are shown below fig 10 shows the as v kinetic curves obtained using fenanocsh cm as the adsorbent and the curve fitting using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 11 shows the results obtained from the adsorption kinetics experiments for cu ii utilizing fenanocsh sm 1 1 as the adsorbent and fig 12 shows the adsorption kinetics for cd ii employing fenanocsh cm 2 1 in figs 10 12 the results obtained are presented plotting the loading capacity q of the ion expressed in mg ion g adsorbent in the ordinate and the time in the abscissa the kinetic models were applied directly without linearizing them and using the χ2 value as a fitting parameter the parameters were evaluated by non linear regression using the lavenberg marquardt iteration method 50 the solid lines represent the calculated values for q according to the models used in the analysis of the experimental values a fast initial adsorption rate is observed in all cases reaching the maximum loading capacities qmax within only a few minutes at the initial stage of the adsorption process there is a large number of active sites available for adsorption as there is also a greater number of reactive species of the adsorbate triggering the development of a fast process under these conditions in contrast as adsorption occurs the number of available active sites decreases thus decreasing the speed of the process table 4 shows the kinetic parameters calculated using both models including the experimental error χ2 which represents the difference or deviation between the experimentally measured value of q and that calculated by the model the lower the value of this parameter the better the fit to the model table 4 shows the pseudo second order model that best explains the experimental results in all cases lower values of χ2 were obtained confirming a small deviation between the experimental values and those calculated using this model these results demonstrate that chemisorption is the rate determining step in the process when using the adsorbents prepared in this study the chemical reactions that can explain the adsorption of arsenate species and metallic ions correspond to the ion exchange mechanisms leading to the formation of very insoluble and stable salts and hydroxides as indicated in a previous section of this communication undoubtedly the driving force of the process is the term qe qt indicated in eq 10 which depends on the square of the number of vacant active adsorption sites these vacant sites diminish with time as the adsorption process progresses furthermore small values for the kinetic constants were calculated for the entire process which can explain the rapid decrease in the adsorption kinetics with time from a practical standpoint the initial adsorption speed is important because it determines the speed of the process and makes its potential application possible at the industrial level table 4 also exhibits a good correlation and coincidence between the experimental loading capacity qe exp values and those calculated by using the model qe calc the computed values for the loading capacity of each ion onto the adsorbent shown in table 4 are consistent with the relative initial concentration of each ionic species in aqueous solution and with the amount of adsorbent used in the experimental runs 4 conclusions a magnetized iron modified nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate was successfully synthesized and assessed as an adsorbent to remove cu ii cd ii pb ii and as v ions present in aqueous solutions two types of magnetite were used a commercial magnetite and another magnetite previously synthesized in the laboratory the synthesis was efficient simple and reproducible the characterization showed that the adsorbent composites can be formed by structures consisting of small spherical particles with a tendency to agglomerate having a magnetite dark crystalline nucleus surrounded by amorphous layers of calcium silicate particle sizes ranging between 20 40 nm and 80 70 nm were measured for the adsorbent prepared with the synthesized magnetite and the commercial magnetite respectively bet porosimetry analysis indicated that the adsorbents have surface areas ranging between 50 70 m2 g and vsm analysis confirmed a sufficiently high magnetic saturation for the adsorbents which enables their complete separation from aqueous solution using magnets once adsorption is concluded the adsorbents were found to be quite stable in aqueous solutions with ph over 3 0 under this condition the magnetic composite preferably adsorbs metallic ions following cation exchange and hydroxide formation mechanisms however if a sufficient quantity of adsorbent is employed anionic species can also be simultaneously removed through an anion exchange mechanism leading to very stable and insoluble salts kinetic adsorption experiments evidenced high initial adsorption rates for the ions removed using the mag fenanocsh adsorbents kinetic data were explained by a pseudo second order kinetic model the magnetized iron modified adsorbent maintains the cation uptake capabilities of the non magnetized nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate enhancing the removal of arsenic anionic species in this way these adsorbents are an attractive option to obtain streams depleted of ionic pollutant species that meet environmental regulations related to the discharge of mining and industrial effluents into natural waters declaration of competing interest

13669,the preparation and characterization of a solid adsorbent consisting of magnetic and iron modified calcium silicate hydrate mag fenanocsh was studied the adsorbent prepared using two kinds of magnetite fe3o4 was evaluated for the simultaneous removal of cations and anions from synthetic aqueous mine water the adsorbent synthesis was found to be very efficient and reproducible sem and tem images showed that the adsorbent is formed by agglomerates of spherical particles with diameters between 20 nm and 170 nm bet porosimetry analysis indicated that the resulting solid presents a specific surface area of 50 70 m2 g vsm analysis confirmed that the particles exhibit a magnetic saturation between 33 emu g and 64 emu g which is high enough to enable their separation from aqueous raffinates using common magnets the adsorbents are chemically stable in aqueous solutions with ph values above 3 0 in this ph range approximately 99 of the cu ii cd ii and pb ii initially present in aqueous solution was removed via ion exchange and salt and or hydroxide formation chemisorption mechanisms furthermore the magnetic and fe modified calcium silicates enabled as v adsorption close to 98 when a sufficient adsorbent dosage was used forming very insoluble and stable salts that could be safely disposed of later using the mag fenanocsh adsorbents a high initial rate of ion adsorption was observed the kinetics data are well explained by a pseudo second order kinetic model keywords ion adsorbents magnetic compounds iron modified calcium silicate acid waters adsorption kinetics 1 introduction the atacama desert located in the northern part of chile and widely known as one of the most arid areas in the world is where most of the national mining activity takes place the scarcity of water resources has spread over the last few years the significant rainwater shortage not exceeding 80 mm or less per year plus the high levels of water evaporation have led to negative water balances every year moreover the increase in water demand in several areas not only for mining activities but also for agriculture domestic use and other industries has worsened this challenge 1 2 in addition to the recycling of plant water commonly observed in mining operations during the last few decades other options to provide water to mine sites have been implemented such as the direct use of seawater or if applicable partially or fully desalinated seawater 3 regardless of the plant water origin intensive efficient simple and low cost treatments are inevitably required the wastewaters coming from mining plants as well as those naturally produced by weathering of tailings materials including acid mine drainage amd contain many pollutants that need to be removed to comply with current environmental regulations 4 the considered pollutants encompass a wide variety of heavy metals anions and oxyanions many of which are toxic and dangerous and contain excess acid alkali high salinity and a large proportion of suspended fine solid colloidal material 5 6 several technologies can be used to treat acidic waters produced from mining activities such as chemical precipitation 7 ion exchange 8 solvent extraction 9 membrane technologies 10 and biological methods 11 all of these technologies present advantages and shortcomings for instance chemical precipitation with lime presents various problems such as redissolution of metal precipitates a requirement for large amounts of chemicals generation of a large volume of sludge whose disposal is quite complex and unsuitability for eliminating traces or low contents of many pollutants other widely used technologies include solvent extraction processing however this presents some difficulties such as the loss of extractant and solvent and entrainment between phases currently adsorption technologies can become a practical and valuable unit operation in water treatment given the diversity of available efficient and low cost adsorbents the most common adsorbent used for water treatment is activated carbon 12 but other compounds including zeolites 13 14 clays 15 and organic compounds such as chitosan 16 17 and modified alginates 18 have also been studied inorganic adsorbents are more convenient than bioadsorbents given their stability in acidic and oxidizing environments for example mno2 zro2 al2o3 cuo and tio2 19 20 have been widely used nevertheless normally such inorganic absorbents are incapable of adsorbing cations and anions simultaneously these adsorbents have very different adsorption properties and capabilities but the application of some of them in industrial applications is limited the novelty of this manuscript resides in the synthesis of a magnetic iron modified calcium silicate hydrate for use as an adsorbent for ions contained in aqueous solutions that simulate acidic mine waters this study also includes the corresponding adsorption kinetic analysis applied to these new adsorbents previously we reported the synthesis and characterization of non modified nanostructured calcium silicate hydrates without magnetic properties having excellent adsorption capacities for metal ions 21 later the treatment of acidic mine drainage using non magnetized iron modified calcium silicates was reported using fecl3 and fe oh 3 as iron bearing reagents the removal of arsenic species was achieved at levels matching those required to meet environmental regulations for water discharge to continental or marine water bodies 22 effectively most of the mining waters in our country contain a relatively significant and variable amount of dissolved arsenic species however the separation of the adsorbent from the treated mine aqueous solutions by conventional settling and or filtration methodologies remains quite cumbersome one option to overcome this difficulty is to confer magnetic properties to the adsorbents 23 28 initially we magnetized nanostructured calcium silicate not modified with fe which exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity for different contaminants 29 then the adsorbent composite prepared in this work was expected to enhance the removal of arsenical species without losing the adsorption capacity of other ions simultaneously facilitating the separation of the adsorbent from aqueous raffinate using a conventional magnet this adsorbent was synthetized and contacted with laboratory prepared aqueous solutions that simulate real acidic mine waters 2 experimental procedure 2 1 synthesis of the adsorbents two types of adsorbents were prepared i a nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate modified with fe iii and magnetized with commercial magnetite nanoparticles 50 100 nm molecular weight 231 53 supplied by sigma aldrich mag fenanocsh cm and ii a calcium silicate hydrate modified with fe iii but magnetized with synthesized magnetite mag fenanocsh sm in the latter case first fe3o4 was synthesized using fecl2 4h2o and fecl3 6h2o as iron precursors supplied by merck r g as reported previously 26 30 a blackish product was easily separated from the reaction mixture using a neodymium magnet the resulting solid was washed with distilled water and dried at 40 c for 12 h second the magnetized adsorbent was prepared by mixing ca oh 2 and fecl3 6h2o in a glass reactor in water acidified with hcl all reagents from merck r g the reaction mixture was gently stirred until complete dissolution of the calcium hydroxide then magnetite commercial or synthesized was aggregated followed by the addition of na2sio3 aqueous solution whose composition included 26 5 sio2 and 10 6 na2o with a specific gravity of 1 39 25 c this final mixture was stirred at 2000 rpm for approximately 1 h after completion of the reaction the resulting solid was removed from the reaction vessel with the aid of a neodymium magnet the solid was washed with small portions of ethanol merck r g the final wet cake was dried at 80 c for 12 h 2 2 characterization of adsorbents the prepared adsorbents were subjected to chemical physical and magnetic analyses scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem analyses were performed using an fei inspector f50 model bet porosimetry analysis was also performed using a 2010 asap micrometrics asap device with nitrogen gas at 77 k to verify whether or not the prepared solids have crystalline or amorphous characteristics the particles of the synthesized adsorbents were submitted to x ray diffraction xrd analysis using a bruker d8 advance device information regarding the sample magnetic behaviour was gathered by obtaining magnetism curves using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm the calcium and iron contents in the synthesized adsorbents were determined using acid digestion followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas using perkin elmer pinaacle 900 equipment the percentage of silicon in the adsorbents was measured using elemental analysis when necessary inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was employed to measure the trace metal contents 2 3 adsorbent stability and adsorption studies considering that the adsorbents will be used to remove ionic species from acidic aqueous solutions the first experiments were designed to test the chemical stability of the obtained solids as a function of the acidity of the aqueous solutions targeted for treatment fifty milligrams of the adsorbent was placed into an orbital shaker at 25 c with aqueous solutions with different ph values ranging between 1 and 6 the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m h2so4 and naoh 0 1 m the amounts of ca and fe dissolved in the aqueous solutions were measured by aas after completion of the experiment adsorption experiments were carried out at ph 4 0 and 25 c with aqueous solutions that simulate mine water with varying chemical compositions 100 mg l cu ii 50 mg l cd ii 40 mg l as v and 10 mg l pb ii the experiments were performed using a glass batch stirred reactor specific adsorption values are reported after the adsorption experiments were completed the solid adsorbent loaded with the removed ionic species was easily separated from the raffinate using a permanent neodymium magnet the equilibrium ph of the raffinate was measured and reported as well as the residual concentration of the ionic species not removed by the adsorbent the mass of ions adsorbed onto the adsorbent ion was determined by using a mass balance specific adsorption kinetics experiments for cu ii cd ii and as v ions were also carried out using magnetized iron modified nanostructured calcium silicates the experimental results obtained were analysed using different kinetics adsorption models 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of the adsorbents first magnetite was synthesized via coprecipitation of fe ii and fe iii salts in an alkaline medium under an inert atmosphere obtaining a black oxide material according to the following equation 1 2 f e 3 f e 2 4 o h f e 3 o 4 4 h the synthesis of magnetite proved to be efficient fast and reproducible with yields close to 92 the synthesized magnetite exhibited particle sizes ranging between 40 nm and 80 nm slightly finer than the particle size of commercial magnetite according to the supplier information the material has a particle size ranging between 80 nm and 120 nm this result explains why higher surface areas were obtained for the case of the adsorbent prepared with the magnetite synthesized in this study than when commercial magnetite was used as presented in table 1 below however this difference in surface area did not affect the good adsorption capacity of either type of adsorbent second nanostructured calcium silicate modified with fe iii and magnetized with fe3o4 was synthesized the chemical reaction governing this step is presented in eq 2 which is based on the reaction of an aqueous solution of na2sio3 and ca oh 2 in an acidic medium using a high stirring speed 2 na 2 sio 3 a q ca oh 2 s 2 hcl a q casio 3 s 2 nacl a q 2 h 2 o l this reaction is very fast and the interaction of ca ii ions with soluble silicate leads to the formation of very insoluble and amorphous solids iron atoms added as fecl3 tend to replace some calcium atoms in calcium silicate however as previously published there is a limit for iron addition to calcium silicate of approximately 13 molar because any excess over this value produces a brittle solid in which fe oh 3 is deposited on the surface losing the nanostructure and lowering its adsorption capacity 22 the magnetization of the adsorbent composite occurs during the formation of calcium silicate according to eq 2 by the addition of a certain amount of synthesized or commercial magnetite the addition of hcl is relevant to facilitate the dissolution and dispersion of ca oh 2 in the reaction medium given its low solubility in water fe3o4 was added after adding hcl thus preventing the acid medium and possible oxidizing conditions from partially dissolving the iron oxide or producing maghemite fe2o3 with lower magnetic susceptibility than the original magnetite this oxidation of magnetite to maghemite during the synthesis can explain the lower magnetic saturation of the adsorbent prepared using this synthesized magnetite as is later shown in table 2 the synthesis yield was determined to be 95 for obtaining a product that was a fine solid easy to grind with a reddish black colour thixotropic in nature 31 and with magnetic properties the thixotropic character explains the agglomeration of the resulting particles previously it had been reported that the structure of these silicates consists of a backbone of silicate plates with a thickness of approximately 2 nm 10 nm based on silicate tetrahedrals with calcium ions and silanol groups on the surface which can act as binding or nucleation sites 21 32 however this yield is apparent since more than one synthesis product can be obtained and all of the products are different types of calcium silicate hydrates with various degrees of hydration the latter takes place since these solutions particularly those with an industrial nature typically contain silicates and silica oligomers with different chain lengths which can produce different types of silicates can the characteristics of the prepared adsorbent composite and its structure explain its subsequent efficient behaviour as adsorbent different silicates were synthesized using two proportions of iron modified calcium silicate hydrate and magnetite ratios fenanocsh fe3o4 1 1 and 2 1 once the synthesis was completed the solid was easily separated from the reaction medium by introducing a permanent neodymium magnet 3 2 characterization of the adsorbent composites figs 1 and 2 show sem micrographs of the nanostructured calcium silicates modified with fe iii magnetized with commercial magnetite and with the fe3o4 prepared in this study respectively smaller particle sizes are observed varying between 20 40 nm for the adsorbents prepared with the synthesized magnetite evidencing in this case its characteristic of being a nanomaterial fig 2 such nanomaterial is formed without a clear shape the particle size measured for the adsorbents prepared with commercial magnetite turned out to be larger particle sizes ranging between 80 nm and 170 nm still in the upper range of the nanomaterial following a clearer spherical shape the coarser particle sizes observed in this case may be explained by the initial particle size of the commercial magnetite used in the experiment between 80 nm and 120 nm both sem images exhibit agglomerated structures consisting of small spherical particles when the particles agglomerate macropores are generated between them which also become available adsorption sites as was later verified with bet porosimetry analyses fig 3 shows a tem image of a sample of nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate modified with iron and magnetized with commercial magnetite particle agglomeration and particle sizes ranging between 80 nm and 160 nm are confirmed x ray diffraction xrd analysis indicated that the non magnetized nanostructured calcium silicates possess an amorphous structure 32 however the magnetized adsorbents prepared in this work show a dark nucleus with a certain degree of crystallinity most likely corresponding to magnetite being surrounded by more amorphous layers of calcium silicate as is also observed in the tem images of fig 3 moreover the diffractogram for an adsorbent prepared previously and corresponding to a nanostructured calcium silicate not modified with fe iii but magnetized with fe3o4 showed that the solid only showed crystallinity signals due to the presence of magnetite 29 porosimetry analysis was performed by n2 sorptometry at 77 k using approximately 0 2 g samples previously dried at 60 c the results are presented in table 1 table 1 shows that commercial magnetite presents a bet surface much smaller than that of the synthesized material all the composites have mesoporous structures with similar surface areas in the range of 50 70 m2 g pore volumes of approximately 0 24 0 38 cm3 g and pore diameters ranging between 5 nm and 9 nm 33 the surface areas obtained are consistent with a large number of adsorption sites both on the external surface and on the accessible internal surface of the composites figs 4 and 5 show the adsorption desorption isotherms for the prepared adsorbents magnetized with commercial and synthesized fe3o4 respectively fig 5 a greater volume of n2 intrusion is observed for the case of adsorbents prepared with synthesized magnetite compared to the compounds prepared with commercial magnetite this is consistent with the greater pore volume measured for these composites table 1 the desorption curves coincide practically with the adsorption curves corresponding to a mixture between types ii and iii indicating the existence of not only a weak gas solid interaction but also large pores 34 desorption of the gas is somewhat slower than adsorption and eventual pore condensation 35 this narrow type hysteresis cycle indicates that the adsorbent presents a regular and uniform pore size distribution the filling of the mesopores at relative pressures between 0 1 and 0 8 p p0 is observed in all the hysteresis curves at higher relative pressures 0 8 filling with the gas can correspond to the macropores formed around the agglomeration or aggregation of particles all of which are associated with the internal structure of the silicates formed however the difference in the surface areas determined for the adsorbents prepared with both types of magnetite did not affect their adsorption capacity obtaining similar results for the removal of the different ions table 2 shows the measured magnetic saturation ms results for each of the prepared adsorbents using vsm analysis it is confirmed that all the compounds maintain their magnetic properties table 2 with the samples associated with commercial magnetite exhibiting the highest magnetization value 91 5 emu g similar to values described in the literature 36 magnetization losses are observed as the proportion of fe modified calcium silicate increases with respect to the amount of magnetite employed in the synthesis it is also observed that the magnetic saturation values for the adsorbent magnetized with commercial magnetite are higher than those for magnetite synthesized in our laboratory this can be attributed to the fact that during magnetite synthesis and the preparation of the adsorbent partial oxidation of magnetite fe3o4 to maghemite fe2o3 can occur 37 figs 6 and 7 present the magnetization curves corresponding to the adsorbents prepared using commercial and synthetized magnetite respectively the values for the coercivity and residual magnetization are close to zero which can indicate the presence of superparamagnetic nanoparticles a single magnetic domain this is consistent with the particle size measured for adsorbents varying between 20 nm and 200 nm depending on the type of magnetite used in the synthesis such superparamagnetic behaviour can allow particles to be separated using a magnet and easily redispersed by gentle agitation in the aqueous phase the latter can facilitate their reuse in several adsorption desorption cycles samples of non magnetized nanostructured calcium silicates do not have a magnetic response therefore they are not separable from an aqueous solution by the action of a conventional magnet on the other hand the adsorbent properties of magnetite are low then it can be established that the magnetized nanostructured calcium silicate compound is a suitable adsorbent with magnetic properties and simultaneously a high adsorption capacity the results presented in table 2 as determined from figs 6 and 7 show that all the synthesized compounds possess sufficient magnetic saturation variable between 33 emu g and 63 emu g which enabled complete separation of the adsorbents loaded with the ions removed from aqueous raffinate one of the main objectives of this study table 3 shows the mass percent of calcium and iron in the synthesized adsorbents the chemical analysis is consistent with the proportion of calcium silicate modified with fe iii with respect to the amount of fe3o4 used in the synthesis moreover a silicon content ranging between 5 6 and 11 2 was measured in the adsorbents it is clear that as the silicate ratio with respect to magnetite increases the percentage of calcium and silicon increases and the iron content decreases 3 3 adsorption experiments 3 3 1 adsorbent stability towards acid solutions the modification of nano structured calcium silicate with fe iii did not affect the chemical stability of the adsorbent and was stable when in contact with aqueous solutions with ph values equal to or higher than 2 0 however the magnetization of both types of magnetite commercial and synthesized slightly affected the chemical stability being approximately stable only from ph 3 0 towards the alkaline region fig 8 presents the results of experiments carried out to measure the chemical stability of the adsorbents when in contact with aqueous solutions of variable acidity the iron dissolution is practically zero even less than 1 when contacted with aqueous solutions of ph greater than 2 0 the calcium dissolution is somewhat higher but it does not increase beyond 3 in the ph range between 2 and 3 above ph 3 0 the dissolution of calcium ions is negligible these values ensure an acceptable chemical stability for the adsorbents prepared in this study to be used when treating acid mines and metallurgical waters highly polluted with many ions the presence of fe atoms can provide calcium silicate with a more rigid and inert structure within the magnetic structure most of the iron atoms form the nucleus of the adsorbent and are protected from the action of hydrogen ions present in aqueous solutions in turn coating external layers of the adsorbent can correspond to amorphous calcium silicate hydrate which is more exposed to the effect of the acidity of the aqueous phase slightly increasing calcium dissolution 3 3 2 effect of the initial ph of the aqueous solution the acidity of mine waters can vary enormously depending on which mineral they are associated with the characteristics and composition of the mineral exploited and the natural conditions typical of mining operations therefore the first experiments for treating mine water were carried out using different technologies to observe how they respond in different acidity conditions in particular regarding the use of nanostructured calcium silicates modified or not in all our experiments including those in this study the results indicate that if an adequate adsorbent mass is utilized independent of the initial acidity of the treated mine water a very high removal of ionic species is reached 22 29 using a variable initial acidity range between ph 3 and 7 the equilibrium ph values in all cases shifted to ph values ranging between 8 and 9 5 the silicates can act as buffers stabilizing the final ph of the raffinate obtained th us avoiding the redissolution of the solids obtained given this in this communication we report the results of adsorption tests in which an aqueous solution with an initial ph of 4 0 was used a representative average acidity value for many mine waters 3 3 3 effect of the dosage of adsorbent fig 9 shows the results obtained for the adsorption of ionic species namely as v cu ii cd ii and pb ii from an aqueous solution that simulates mine water at ph 4 0 when in contact with various adsorbent quantities prepared with a proportion of fenanocsh fe3o4 of 1 1 the adsorption of ions is not significantly affected by the nature of the magnetite present at the core of the adsorbent particles fig 9 also presents the adsorption using the composites and the impact of the modification of nanostructured calcium silicate with fe iii on as v adsorption the adsorption of the ions increases with the amount of adsorbent available which is consistent with a higher availability of active adsorption sites however the experimental results indicate that at low or insufficient amounts of the adsorbent compound the removal of divalent metallic ions prevails over the uptake of arsenic indeed a low quantity of mag fenanocsh is required to reach almost quantitative adsorption of cu ii cd ii and pb ii nevertheless when a sufficient amount of adsorbent is used to treat this type of aqueous acid solution as v ions are also quantitatively removed therefore it can be stated that under certain experimental conditions these adsorbents show a significant capacity to simultaneously remove both cationic and anionic species interestingly the adsorption of as v ions is enhanced when the nanostructured calcium silicate adsorbent is modified with fe iii which confirms the active role of this metal in wastewater treatment the results from previous adsorption tests indicate that when using calcium silicate modified with neither fe iii nor magnetized the removal of arsenic species is low however modification of calcium silicate with fe iii not only improves the adsorption yield of as v but also leads to the formation of a stabilized double salt of calcium and iron that is more insoluble than calcium arsenate as expected for the case of the adsorbent without modification with iron this aspect is relevant because in the labour of practical mining regardless of the strategy implemented to remove arsenic from acidic aqueous solutions the solids produced must be safely disposed of in tailings ponds one possibility to achieve the latter is to produce highly insoluble and inert materials to avoid groundwater contamination in principle the iron within the magnetite structure will only impart magnetic properties to the adsorbent and will not interfere with the adsorption mechanisms in fact adsorption tests performed only with fe3o4 did not show significant adsorption of the tested ions 3 3 4 discussion as v is usually found in acidic waters forming arsenate type species aso4 3 haso4 2 h2aso4 and to a lesser extent at strongly acidic ph values forms arsenic acid h3aso4 38 arsenites aso3 3 can also be found in many mine waters the adsorption of arsenic species in these adsorbents can occur in a process based on an anion exchange mechanism between the silicate and the arsenate ions according to the following stages i first stage of diffusion of anionic arsenical species in solution towards the surface of the adsorbent ii second stage of adsorption of the arsenate ions by electrostatic attraction onto the iron modified calcium silicate surface and iii release of the sio3 2 ions to the raffinate aqueous solutions considering that at over ph 2 the predominant as v species are h2aso4 and haso4 2 eqs 3 and 4 illustrate the anionic exchange mechanism for the arsenates eq 3 represents the adsorption of haso4 2 species on the surface of the adsorbent while eq 4 shows the release of silicate ions towards the raffinate solutions 3 f e c a s i o 3 s h a s o 4 2 a q f e c a s i o 3 h a s o 4 2 s 4 f e c a s i o 3 h a s o 4 2 s f e c a h a s o 4 s s i o 3 2 a q where fe ca sio3 represents the iron modified calcium silicate the subscript s denotes the solid surface of the adsorbent and the subscript aq denotes the aqueous solution then calcium and iron atoms act as binding sites for the removal of arsenate ions the solids obtained during the adsorption process are very stable and insoluble having enough magnetic properties that enable their easy separation from the raffinate via use of a common magnet the double salts fe ca haso4 are more insoluble than ca haso4 mitigating redissolution mechanisms in the resulting aqueous raffinate 39 excellent removal of the cationic species cd ii cu ii and pb ii was achieved therefore nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate modified with iron and magnetized with both types of fe3o4 does not lose its ability to simultaneously adsorb cationic and anionic species in addition to the chemisorption of these cations onto the adsorbent surface physical adsorption of fine solid particles suspended in treated water was also observed the adsorption of these cationic species is fast and efficient probably because fe modified calcium silicate alkalizes the aqueous solution quickly acting as a buffer and keeping the ph of the raffinate above 8 0 experiments carried out with aqueous solutions with different initial acidities also led to good adsorption results divalent ions m2 such as cu ii cd ii or pb ii can be adsorbed by combined and parallel mechanisms one option involves forming the respective hydroxide or mixed hydroxides with the oh of the silanol groups of the silicates generating sufficient alkalinity for their precipitation as proposed in eqs 5 and 6 5 f e c a s i o h s 2 o h f e c a s i o h o h 2 2 s 6 f e c a s i o h o h 2 s 2 m a q 2 f e c a s i o h s m o h 2 s where fe ca si oh represents the hydrate type adsorbent that can form an intermediate polyhydroxylated species according to eq 5 this species can then enable the formation of the metal hydroxide m oh 2 as represented in eq 6 another possible and parallel mechanism entails a cation exchange mechanism between the adsorbed metal and the ca atoms present in the silicate structure which can be released into the raffinate solution as shown in eq 7 7 f e c a s i o h s m 2 a q f e m s i o h c a a q 2 the presence of calcium in the raffinates was evidenced by measuring its contents by aas nevertheless it has been confirmed that hydroxides can also form on the surface of silicate adsorbents generating complex solid species that are also easily removed from the aqueous solution by a neodymium magnet it is possible to verify that neither modification with iron nor magnetization detrimentally impacts the potential of previously reported adsorbents based on nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate due to economic reasons or with the purpose of recovering valuable species from the loaded adsorbents when it is technically possible some of the industrial adsorbents are regenerated in order to be used in new adsorption and desorption cycles however in this case it is unnecessary because of their low cost of production in industrial scale tests industrial lime an industrial sodium silicate solution used in the detergent industry and mineral magnetite have been employed as raw materials maintaining their adsorbent properties on the other hand as a compound based on silicate it can be safely disposed of in tailings ponds or landfills 3 4 adsorption kinetics of ionic species adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out to track and understand the progress of the process with time and the results obtained were analysed using kinetics models different authors have proposed distinct adsorption rate models to explain the experimental results using natural or synthetic adsorbents 40 43 these models generally consider a mass transfer process accompanied by chemical reactions that includes the diffusion of the adsorbate from the bulk aqueous phase towards the external surface of the adsorbent physisorption mechanism followed by a chemical reaction mechanism between the adsorbent and the adsorbate chemisorption mechanism first a diffusional model was also applied however it could not explain the experimental results therefore it was not included in this communication 44 a pseudo first order model pfo corresponding to a model developed by ho and mckay in 1998 and applied by other authors was also analysed 45 46 which is represented by eq 8 8 d q t d t k 1 q e q t where qt expressed in m m o l g is the molar amount of the adsorbed metal per gram of adsorbent at any time t m i n q e is the molar amount of the metal ions adsorbed under equilibrium conditions in m m o l g and k represents the kinetic adsorption constant of the model expressed in m i n 1 integrating the previous equation using the boundary conditions a t 0 q 0 and a t t q qt eq 9 is obtained 9 q t q e 1 e k 1 t in addition a pseudo second order kinetics model pso states that the adsorption rate depends on the number of active sites available for adsorption raised to the second power 47 48 as expressed by eq 10 10 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 integrating and rearranging the previous equation between the limits at t 0 qt 0 and a t t qt qe eq 11 is obtained 11 q t q e 2 k t 1 q e k t where k2 represents the rate adsorption constant of the model expressed in g m g m i n both kinetics pseudo order models are sensitive to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent rather than the concentration of the adsorbate in the aqueous phase this means that the adsorption will depend not only on the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction but also on the particle size adsorbent dosage stirring speed used in the process adsorbate concentration and the diffusion of the adsorbate towards the adsorbent 49 many experiments were carried out using the same aqueous solution that simulates mine water but different synthesized adsorbents representative adsorption kinetics curves for as v cu ii and cd ii using some of the adsorbents prepared in this study are shown below fig 10 shows the as v kinetic curves obtained using fenanocsh cm as the adsorbent and the curve fitting using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 11 shows the results obtained from the adsorption kinetics experiments for cu ii utilizing fenanocsh sm 1 1 as the adsorbent and fig 12 shows the adsorption kinetics for cd ii employing fenanocsh cm 2 1 in figs 10 12 the results obtained are presented plotting the loading capacity q of the ion expressed in mg ion g adsorbent in the ordinate and the time in the abscissa the kinetic models were applied directly without linearizing them and using the χ2 value as a fitting parameter the parameters were evaluated by non linear regression using the lavenberg marquardt iteration method 50 the solid lines represent the calculated values for q according to the models used in the analysis of the experimental values a fast initial adsorption rate is observed in all cases reaching the maximum loading capacities qmax within only a few minutes at the initial stage of the adsorption process there is a large number of active sites available for adsorption as there is also a greater number of reactive species of the adsorbate triggering the development of a fast process under these conditions in contrast as adsorption occurs the number of available active sites decreases thus decreasing the speed of the process table 4 shows the kinetic parameters calculated using both models including the experimental error χ2 which represents the difference or deviation between the experimentally measured value of q and that calculated by the model the lower the value of this parameter the better the fit to the model table 4 shows the pseudo second order model that best explains the experimental results in all cases lower values of χ2 were obtained confirming a small deviation between the experimental values and those calculated using this model these results demonstrate that chemisorption is the rate determining step in the process when using the adsorbents prepared in this study the chemical reactions that can explain the adsorption of arsenate species and metallic ions correspond to the ion exchange mechanisms leading to the formation of very insoluble and stable salts and hydroxides as indicated in a previous section of this communication undoubtedly the driving force of the process is the term qe qt indicated in eq 10 which depends on the square of the number of vacant active adsorption sites these vacant sites diminish with time as the adsorption process progresses furthermore small values for the kinetic constants were calculated for the entire process which can explain the rapid decrease in the adsorption kinetics with time from a practical standpoint the initial adsorption speed is important because it determines the speed of the process and makes its potential application possible at the industrial level table 4 also exhibits a good correlation and coincidence between the experimental loading capacity qe exp values and those calculated by using the model qe calc the computed values for the loading capacity of each ion onto the adsorbent shown in table 4 are consistent with the relative initial concentration of each ionic species in aqueous solution and with the amount of adsorbent used in the experimental runs 4 conclusions a magnetized iron modified nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate was successfully synthesized and assessed as an adsorbent to remove cu ii cd ii pb ii and as v ions present in aqueous solutions two types of magnetite were used a commercial magnetite and another magnetite previously synthesized in the laboratory the synthesis was efficient simple and reproducible the characterization showed that the adsorbent composites can be formed by structures consisting of small spherical particles with a tendency to agglomerate having a magnetite dark crystalline nucleus surrounded by amorphous layers of calcium silicate particle sizes ranging between 20 40 nm and 80 70 nm were measured for the adsorbent prepared with the synthesized magnetite and the commercial magnetite respectively bet porosimetry analysis indicated that the adsorbents have surface areas ranging between 50 70 m2 g and vsm analysis confirmed a sufficiently high magnetic saturation for the adsorbents which enables their complete separation from aqueous solution using magnets once adsorption is concluded the adsorbents were found to be quite stable in aqueous solutions with ph over 3 0 under this condition the magnetic composite preferably adsorbs metallic ions following cation exchange and hydroxide formation mechanisms however if a sufficient quantity of adsorbent is employed anionic species can also be simultaneously removed through an anion exchange mechanism leading to very stable and insoluble salts kinetic adsorption experiments evidenced high initial adsorption rates for the ions removed using the mag fenanocsh adsorbents kinetic data were explained by a pseudo second order kinetic model the magnetized iron modified adsorbent maintains the cation uptake capabilities of the non magnetized nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate enhancing the removal of arsenic anionic species in this way these adsorbents are an attractive option to obtain streams depleted of ionic pollutant species that meet environmental regulations related to the discharge of mining and industrial effluents into natural waters declaration of competing interest
