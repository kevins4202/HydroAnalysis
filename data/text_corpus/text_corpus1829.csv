9145,quantitative evaluation of best management practice bmp effectiveness can help stakeholders to make better watershed management decisions however such evaluations are always challenging as they require complex algorithms to simulate the relevant hydrological processes crop growth and the corresponding pollutant transport pathways in order to evaluate potential bmps and select the best one for the specific field conditions in this study a web based interface calbmp was developed to predict bmp effectiveness in california focusing on pesticide modeling at the field scale with built in databases for soil weather crop pesticides and bmps users can run simulations for baseline and bmp scenarios using their site specific field conditions by simply providing the field information such as zip code soil crop management and pesticide application data calbmp uses przm5 a usepa model to simulate pesticide transport and fate at the field edge the calbmp simulations were validated based on measurements from an alfalfa field study the results indicated that the calbmp interface could reasonably simulate the runoff and adsorbed pesticide loss leaving the field with default parameters from previously known field parameters or public databases calbmp underestimated sediment erosion possibly due to uncertainties in field measurements or inaccurate simulation of the temporal distribution of flood irrigation calbmp is likely to underestimate pesticides with greater solubility such as diuron because przm5 uses the simplified instantaneous equilibrium sorption model in addition a strawberry field study was adopted to demonstrate the capability of the calbmp interface for simulating bmp effectiveness pesticide reduction percentage in the main pathways with easy to understand graphs and tables the results indicated that users can easily compare and review the results from multiple scenarios which could facilitate the decision making process for mitigating the amount of active ingredient bifenthrin leaving the field the calbmp tool provides useful information on pesticide runoff potential and bmp selection at the field scale with increasingly stringent regulations for water quality protection calbmp will add to the growers toolbox for minimizing the environmental impacts from their inevitable pesticide usage graphical abstract ga1 keywords best

2022 1 introduction pesticides are widely used to control the insects diseases weeds and other organisms that are pests to agricultural crops zhang et al 2019 california is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world and pesticide use in california has increased dramatically over the past ten years to meet the increasing global food demand the most recently available statistics show that about 209 million pounds of agricultural pesticides were used in california in 2018 california department of pesticide regulation 2020 despite their efficacy the use of pesticides raises serious concerns for the risks to ecosystems and human health due to their residues on food and in the environment as well as the direct exposure of farm workers during pesticide applications pesticide offsite movement through runoff sediment drainage and spray drift is largely responsible for the resulting surface water pollution thus there is an urgent need to apply on farm best management practices bmps in order to alleviate pesticide offsite movement from agricultural fields to the adjacent waterways bmps include many different structural and nonstructural conservation practices such as application reduction application timing control improved spray efficiency sediment ponds vegetative filter strips constructed wetlands buffer zones and many others extensive research has examined the effectiveness of bmps and significant reductions in the major offsite pathways of pesticides have been reported bennett et al 2005 chen et al 2016 hou et al 2021 li et al 2019 sahin and karpuzcu 2020 watanabe et al 2007 yazdi et al 2021 there are two main approaches for evaluating bmp efficacy including in situ experiments harmel et al 2018 and numerical modeling field experiments can usually generate accurate measurements but they are costly in terms of time and money in addition their results are ultimately limited in applicability by the unique local conditions of each field to overcome these limitations numerical modeling has become a valuable supplemental tool thanks to its ability to run different bmp scenarios using any set of field condition data in recent decades a few field scale models have been developed for simulating pesticide transport and fate at the scale of individual fields among them some of the most widely used models are the pesticide root zone model przm carsel et al 1998 the root zone water quality model rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 and agricultural policy environmental extender apex gassman et al 2010 these models can provide acceptable simulation accuracy because they have been widely validated in recent decades chen et al 2017 feng et al 2019 gassman et al 2010 ma et al 1999 ma et al 2004 ma et al 2007 wang et al 2012 zhang and goh 2015 more comprehensive environmental regulations have been developed in recent years to encourage the use of bmps that reduce pesticide off site movement for example on april 15 2021 the california regional water quality control board crwqcb 2021 approved agricultural order 4 0 formally general waste discharge requirements for discharges from irrigated lands r3 2021 0040 this order includes incentives for the use of bmps such as cover crops to improve soil health and increase moisture retention as well as carbon and nitrogen sequestration it also includes provisions and incentives for growers and technical service providers to form or join third party programs that provide compliance assistance to growers growers may choose to comply with certain requirements either on an individual basis or via membership in a third party program as a result various agricultural stakeholders including farmers regulatory communities consultants and other agribusiness personnel are increasingly interested in receiving quantitative assessments regarding the effectiveness of specific bmps for reducing pesticide runoff based on precise site specific field conditions zhang and zhang 2011 given the increasingly stringent regulations for water quality protection the farmer s toolbox for battling pests is becoming more limited in addition selecting the appropriate bmps for the site specific field conditions is a prerequisite for achieving effective pesticide runoff reduction however evaluating bmps on farm using field scale models requires a professional background in hydrology and environmental chemistry which can limit their direct use by farmers and other agricultural practitioners within the united states some tools have been developed in various states that can assist in the use of bmps for reducing nutrient and sediment runoff into the surface water system for instance the agricultural bmp assessment and tracking tool developed by the minnesota department of agriculture http mda houstoneng net map and the bmp selection tool by the state of arkansas merriman et al 2009 have contributed greatly to the investigation and implementation of bmps within the academic community the nutrient tracking tool https ntt tiaer tarleton edu welcomes new locale en is a free online user friendly decision making tool that quantitatively estimates the nitrogen phosphorus and sediment losses from crop pasture forest lands which was developed by the modeling team at texas institute for applied environmental research tiaer at tarleton state university in cooperation with usda s office of environmental markets nrcs and ars saleh et al 2011 the texas bmp evaluation tool tbet developed by usda ars could aid in science based bmp selection on farm and cost effective conservation spending white et al 2012 however such tools tend to require a professional background as a prerequisite for usage so they are not very user friendly for field agricultural practitioners thus developing an easy to use bmp evaluation system i e one that requires simple inputs and provides users with a graphical user interface so that the user does not need to know programming could greatly facilitate the processes of selection design installation and maintenance of various bmps among a wide variety of stakeholders this study aims to provide all stakeholders with a tool for making quantitative assessments of various bmps in order to guide their decision making in reducing the offsite movement of pesticide applications this goal is achieved through the development of an easy to use interactive platform named calbmp which has the ability to scientifically represent all of the involved processes and this tool can be of great use when implementing on farm bmps the specific objectives of this study are 1 to develop a web based bmp evaluation interface capable of estimating the main pesticide offsite movement pathways runoff sediment and volatilization before and after the implementation of bmps on the farm under the site specific conditions for upland crops in california 2 to demonstrate the application of the calbmp tool on an actual field for the evaluation of bmps with respect to the levels of erosion runoff volatilization corresponding pesticide loads and concentrations and bmp effectiveness under different scenarios of user selected pesticide usage and bmp selections and 3 to compare and analyze the results obtained from the calbmp tool with the random selection of bmps to aid in evidence based bmp selection 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology and model structure of calbmp in developing calbmp as an on farm decision support system for the identification of effective bmps for upland crops in california this study focuses on the integration of three main components site specific field characteristics bmp performance with respect to pesticide removal and the inclusion of user selected preferences fig 1 represents the conceptual framework of the calbmp interface which is comprised of four parts the front end the back end supporting databases and environmental models the schematic diagram of the calbmp web design and features is presented in fig 2 in which the related functions are shown in bold the front end is used for collecting the text information entered or selected by the user to generate the model input files and set up the models its graphical user interface gui serves an important role in the framework since the online interface is the user s first impression of calbmp additionally all the outputs are visualized and downloadable in the front end in either excel or graphical formats the back end is responsible for the data request processing and response of the front end and it interacts with the background databases for the field scale pesticide modeling in calbmp we chose pesticide root zone model version 5 0 przm5 which is the most recent version of przm young and fry 2020 included inside the pesticide water calculator pwc young 2016a przm is a flexible model which is capable of simulating the pesticide leaving the field based on relevant local parameters of soil weather crop field management and others compared to other environmental models it has distinct advantages in its capability for modeling various agricultural scenarios such as pesticide applications plant growth and development field management practices and others luo and zhang 2010 in addition przm has been extensively validated and has shown good performance in reproducing the hydrological processes and pesticide movement at the field scale noshadi and jamshidi 2014 trevisan et al 2000 the model itself is able to simulate some non structural bmps on the farm such as adjustments in pesticide application rate or date cover crops tillage and contour planting it has also been coupled with some other environmental models to simulate many commonly used structural bmps such as vegetative filter strips vegetated drainage ditches sediment ponds and buffer zones przm5 is conceptually the same as the original przm version 3 12 1 and its major modification is the removal of some routines which were not functioning correctly in the older versions of przm the przm5 manual provides a detailed description of the algorithms and theoretical basis young and fry 2020 five databases included in the back end store the datasets for field locations county name zip code climate daily high resolution weather data from gridmet soils ssurgo pesticide usage pur and properties crops and field management practices the detailed procedures of calbmp development are given in sections 2 1 1 to 2 1 3 below 2 1 1 web interface development in this system users can select input text to specify the unique field conditions with without bmp implementation in the front end webpage in order to set up the przm5 model and run the baseline bmp scenario once a user logs into the account a unique project will be initiated by starting from the find your field webpage one temporary sub folder will be created within the user s account folder to store all the files created by this run and the sub folder name is unique for its creation date and time such as 06182021093000 the user s selections will be updated and locked in the order of county to zip code in the find your field webpage in which the process variables are extracted from the location database that includes the county names and zip code numbers for all of california based on the soil database the user can then choose from a list of soil series associated with the selected zip code and the displayed list will be updated when the zip code changes the nearest weather station for the chosen zip code will be shown directly on the map on the right and this linkage will be saved in the weather database after entering the field area as a numeric input the user will click on the next button and specify the crop management and pesticide application data once crop irrigation method and pesticide application method are selected the user can select the management dates that are recommended for a specific period based on the crop information database in the back end once the user completes information selection input in the front end webpage for running the baseline scenario and clicks on the submit and run button the front end interface will call the weather station search program to determine the station id and then extract the weather datasets required by przm5 from the weather database the properties of the selected soil series will be extracted from the soil database and the corresponding pesticide physicochemical properties will be extracted from the pesticide database in the back end subsequently the values for all the parameters will be requested by the back end to generate the przm5 input file then the executable file of the przm5 model will be called to run the baseline scenario after the baseline scenario run is completed output zts files will be extracted from the temporary folder and the user will be able to select variables of interest for visualization by clicking on the try bmp button the user can select any bmp bmps and submit them and the interface will extract the input parameters corresponding to the different bmp scenarios from the bmp database in the back end some parameters in the original baseline scenario przm5 input file will then be rewritten to generate a new input file for the bmp scenario similarly the executable przm5 model will be called after that and the new output zts files will be extracted automatically based on the user selected outputs of the bmp scenario in the visualization additionally the user could choose different bmp scenarios for comparison the webpage will provide various visualization options including different outputs from a single bmp scenario or comparisons between bmp and baseline scenarios 2 1 2 background database development there are five databases in the back end the field location database is a table which lists all of the counties in california and the corresponding zip code numbers within each county the soil database was prepared using the united states department of agriculture usda s natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic ssurgo database usda nrcs soil survey staff 2020 and only those columns which are required as przm5 s model input were retained in the ssurgo database soils are grouped into map units based on their similar properties slope class and hydrologic soil group and each map unit has a unique map unit key mukey each soil contains one or more components which are individual soil series with a unique component key cokey soil properties can vary with depth within each component and a chorizon key chokey is used to reflect the differences in soil properties with depth four tables in the ssurgo database muaggatt component chorizon and valu were combined to provide all the required soil and landscape inputs for przm5 ultimately two tables are included in the final soil database one table summarizes the connections among zip code mukey and cokey the other table summarizes all the corresponding soil property parameters required for przm5 s input file supplementary material table s1 and the soil properties were extracted from this table by mukey cokey and chokey for the weather database all derived indices were calculated using the university of idaho s gridded meteorological data gridmet http www climatologylab org gridmet html abatzoglou 2013 this gridmet dataset covers the contiguous us with high space time resolution daily temporal and 4 km spatial resolution and it is a perfect tool for developing our weather database as it includes all of our required variables from 1979 to the current year there are two tables in the final weather database one table links the nearest weather station to each zip code and it was used to locate the nearest weather station based on the user selected zip code the other table supplementary material table s2 includes the 12 columns of station id zip code longitude latitude year month day precipitation reference evapotranspiration temperature wind speed and solar radiation which are used for preparing the przm5 weather input file wea file once the user specifies the simulation year or period the crop database includes two tables one table provides crop growth parameters to reproduce the crop growth process in przm5 and the other table has templates of crop scenarios which are used for extracting the various parameters including the universal soil loss equation crop management factor usle c curve number cn and manning s roughness coefficient n in order to calculate the runoff and erosion processes in przm5 based on the usda national agricultural statistic service nass cropland data layer for 2008 2020 https www nass usda gov research and science cropland release the 26 upland crops with the highest planted acreages in california were selected and included in the current crop database and the number of crops will be expanded in our future database development efforts relevant crop parameters were derived from the usepa standard przm field and orchard crop scenarios for california usepa 2004 the commonly applied pesticides for the 26 selected upland crops were summarized from the california department of pesticide regulation cdpr agricultural use pesticide use report pur dataset from 2007 to 2009 once the user selects a pesticide in the front end webpage all the required pesticide properties are extracted from the pesticide database to generate the chemical input parameters for the przm5 run their corresponding pesticide properties were collected from the pesticide use risk evaluation pure decision support system dss zhan and zhang 2012 and the pesticide properties database ppdb university of hertfordshire 2007 currently seven non structural bmp options are included in the calbmp interface contouring farming strip cropping parallel terracing cover crops pesticide application reduction pesticide application timing and crop rotation and residue management the specific parameters that need to be changed for each bmp were obtained from arabi et al 2008 przm5 already has an established method for modeling several agricultural practices including cover crop tillage crop residue etc this built in feature indicates this model s capacity to represent many commonly used non structural bmps on the farm by altering the appropriate input parameters which are involved in various hydrological and water quality processes including surface runoff erosion infiltration pesticide loading etc when the bmp bmps are selected the corresponding parameters will be extracted from the bmp database and used to update the original input files 2 1 3 implementation and updates multiple programming languages including html css and javascript were adopted for the front end interface the vue was adopted as the framework for the front end to provide more flexibility using javascript three javascript libraries boostrap echarts and leaflet were used to develop the webpage appearance display the map with the nearest weather station and achieve visualization respectively golang and sql were two main programming languages used in the back end gin was adopted as the framework for the back end design taking over the data request and response between itself and the front end and interacting with the databases two packages named gorm and jwt token were used for the back end s interactive activities with the databases and user authorization respectively all the databases were stored in an sql postgresql database the source code package and all the database files of the calbmp interface are available for download on github com https github com m0ng0lfalcon calbmp in the available supplementary materials we provide the column titles for the soil and weather database tables since calbmp is a web based platform no software or plug in installation effort is required to use it additionally regular updates and maintenance will be applied to calbmp in order to provide the most up to date data for users for the updating and maintenance manual efforts and python scripts will be adopted to semi automatically oversee and download source datasets from publicly available databases new crop types pesticides and bmp selections will be added upon request as well 2 2 calbmp application 2 2 1 performance evaluation using alfalfa field measurements the przm5 model in the calbmp interface was evaluated using a field study conducted in two adjacent alfalfa fields located at davis california zhang and goh 2015 detailed field properties management information and pesticide characteristics are presented in table 1 and table 2 since there was negligible rainfall during the alfalfa growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 six flood irrigation treatments were applied to fields a and b during the alfalfa growing season a flood irrigation controller was installed at the head of each field to deliver water along the alfalfa rows to the end both fields were sprayed with chlorpyrifos and diuron in 2012 and 2013 respectively at the edge of the field there was a tailwater ditch where the collection of water samples and measurements of outflow were taken specifically generated runoff was recorded at 2 min intervals and the concentrations of suspended sediment particles and pesticides were calculated based on the measurements as a result only the total pesticide concentration was recorded in this study since the low concentration of suspended sediment made it impossible to quantify the sediment phase pesticide values of user end inputs including field size soil types pesticide application rate and dates irrigation date and rates soil hydraulics and pesticide characteristics were set by field measurements and the calbmp databases without model calibration to evaluate how well calbmp performed in simulating the site specific pesticide offsite movement the simulated runoff flow sediment and pesticide loss were compared to the measured data from the field experiments in addition three goodness of fit statistical indices based on event based simulations and observations including root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent of bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used in this study for calbmp evaluation a regression based term like r 2 was not selected as an index since that it is commonly used for long term simulations and its application in event based simulations with small sample sizes can introduce large uncertainties garen and moore 2005 miao et al 2016 detailed calculations of these indexes were as follows 1 nse 1 i 1 n o s i o m i 2 i 1 n o m i o m 2 2 rmse i 1 n o s i o m i 2 n 0 5 3 pbias i 1 n o s i o m i i 1 n o m i 100 where n is the number of simulations o s and o m are simulated and measured values of model outputs respectively o s and o m are the mean values of the simulated and measured model outputs respectively and σ s and σ m indicate the standard deviations in simulations and measurements respectively with a range from to 1 nse 1 indicates a perfect match between the measurements and simulations and values between 0 5 and 1 are usually considered to represent an acceptable level of model performance moriasi et al 2007 the rmse indicates a good match between measurements and simulations when it approaches 0 and a higher rmse indicates a worse match of the simulations and measurements pbias with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation and it has an optimal value of 0 positive values indicate model underestimation bias whereas negative values indicate model overestimation bias in the model gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2007 proposed that model simulation could be taken as satisfactory if nse 0 5 pbias 25 for streamflow pbias 55 for sediment and pbias 70 for nutrient it is worth noting that corresponding performance evaluation criteria of performance measures can be adjusted within acceptable bounds based on additional considerations such as quality and quantity of available measured data spatial and temporal scales etc moriasi et al 2015 2 2 2 simulations of baseline bmp scenarios using strawberry field study the current active bmp options in the calbmp interface are not suitable for alfalfa fields except for the pesticide application reduction and the application timing adjustment to better demonstrate how calbmp users can evaluate bmp s and what information can be provided to them as advisory support with or without bmps a strawberry field located in monterey county was used in this study as a representative crop which is heavily dosed with pesticide in california and has more applicable bmps in calbmp referring to the statistical record over 80 of the fresh market and processed strawberries grown in the united states are produced in california goldberger et al 2019 two thirds of california s strawberry production comes from the santa maria region among which monterey tops the chart in heavy pesticide use mossler and nesheim 2004 in this study strawberry was planted in beds designed to allow for proper drainage in fallow conditions the soil series is oceano which is a hydrologic group a sandy loamy soil on slopes of 0 50 usda 2006 the strawberry crop was planted on december 15th of 2018 and harvested on may 18th of 2019 drip irrigation was used over the entire crop growing season the active ingredient bifenthrin was ground applied at 0 1 lb acre on march 15th to control pests during this period for more detailed information on the user inputs which specify the field conditions please refer to the calbmp webpage screenshots for this case study in section 3 2 individual bmps and combined bmps were considered in the case study to compare their removal effectiveness table 1 it is worth noting that there are no nationally recognized standardized test methods for bmp performance as of today whelton et al 2016 so the percentage of pesticide mass reduction will be simulated as the bmp effectiveness in this study since there is no observed bmp efficiency dataset for this field the simulated bmp effectiveness could not be compared to an observed value and the bmp efficiency data reported in previous research will be provided as a reference scenario 1 was pesticide application reduction pr since it is the most straightforward and cost free way to reduce potential pesticide pollution based on previous studies by zhang and zhang 2011 a 15 reduction in the current pesticide use could result in a significant load reduction of about 30 for the pesticides thus 15 pesticide application reduction was adopted in the case study strawberry fields are sometimes rotated with cover crops such as rye or barley or another cash crop such as beans broccoli lettuce or cauliflower to reduce pest populations and improve the soil structure thus cover crop cc and crop rotation and residue management cr as two commonly used conservation practices in california s strawberry field management were included as bmp scenarios 2 and 3 legume was selected as the cover crop before strawberry it was planted on june 24th of 2018 and was flail mowed and incorporated with a disk on september 3rd of 2018 after 9 weeks of growth for the cr scenario scenario 3 broccoli was planted as a rotation crop before strawberry in this field it was planted on june 21st of 2018 and harvested on september 21st of 2018 the active ingredient imidacloprid was ground applied once at 0 71 lb acre on august 15th to control pests during this period for the residue management 4 t ha broccoli residue cover was selected the pesticide use rates and dates in the baseline and bmp scenarios were based on the actual product usage data in the pesticide use report pur database http www cdpr ca gov docs pur purmain htm accessed on august 21 2021 besides the three single bmps above two combined bmps of pr cc and pr cr scenarios 4 and 5 in table 3 were selected in the case study 3 results and discussion 3 1 calbmp performance evaluation in the alfalfa field study in this study six irrigation induced runoff events were generated and accounted for 18 5 of the total irrigation water amounts the performance of calbmp in simulating the pesticide offsite movement from the alfalfa fields in davis are presented in fig 3 with the values of the goodness of fit indexes to provide a better understanding of the simulation accuracy of calbmp table 4 summarized the goodness of fit indices from two previous studies conducted by zhang and goh 2015 and chen et al 2017 using przm and the same measurements from the alfalfa fields in addition to facilitate the analysis and demonstrate the model performance the event based values of runoff sediment and pesticide loss are presented in fig 4 these results indicated that calbmp tended to slightly overestimate the runoff for most of these events and three exceptions were detected as the notably low runoff estimation on march 22 of 2013 from field a event 5 in fig 4a as well as the overestimations on may 21 and june 15 of 2012 from field b events 1 and 2 in fig 4b this may have resulted from the simplified curve number method in przm5 that was used to calculate surface runoff young and carleton 2006 zhang and goh 2015 in addition the przm5 model has limitations in simulating flood irrigation since it does not include the runoff generation mechanisms for water moving from the head to the end of the field which may also result in the inaccurate simulations of runoff generated by flood irrigation in calbmp the goodness of fit indexes with a rmse of 1 29 cm a nse of 1 55 and a pbias 22 14 could be greatly improved to a rmse of 0 6 cm a nse of 0 8 and a pbias 12 2 respectively by removing these three points from analysis furthermore calbmp is capable of reproducing the overall trends in surface runoff which is mainly driven by the amount of irrigation water fig 4a b sediment erosion was drastically underestimated in three of six events in both fields with an rmse of 23 98 kg a nse of 0 2 and a pbias of 46 78 fig 3b and fig 4c d this could mainly be attributed to two factors one refers to the measurement errors since the collected sediment from ditches originated partially from the field and partially from the bottom of the ditch zhang and goh 2015 the other factor might be the longer but less intensive daily irrigation input in the simulation in przm5 a flood irrigation event was added as a daily rainfall input distributed across 24 h while actually the average duration of an irrigation event was much shorter in this study only about 7 h since the peak runoff volume was basically determined by the rainfall distribution in przm5 a lower intensity of irrigation spanning 24 h input could result in a decreased peak runoff volume as well as less sediment in the simulation which would lead to an underestimation of calbmp based sediment values however it is predictable that the overall accuracy of sediment can be largely improved with more reliable measurements for pesticide loss along with runoff flow leaving the field the results showed that calbmp based chlorpyrifos losses matched well with the measured data rmse 7 50 mg nse 0 79 and pbias 9 82 while diuron losses were underestimated to a great extent rmse 4 31 g nse 0 71 and pbias 79 54 fig 3c d and fig 4e f this validation result was quite similar with previous research conducted by chen et al 2017 in the same alfalfa field and the only difference is that limited calibration of hydrologic parameters like cn and field capacity were taken to improve the performance of przm in previous study as mentioned above the pesticide loss was measured as the total mass in the runoff sample in this study and pesticide in both soluble and adsorbed phases were summed to represent the simulated pesticide loss surface runoff was identified as the preferred pathway for pesticide offsite movement among which 90 chlorpyrifos and 98 diuron were transferred in soluble phase in the simulation this finding was quite consistent with previous studies boithias et al 2011 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the underestimation of diuron can be partly caused by the uncertainty in simulating the pesticide concentration in the top soil profile in przm5 in which an instantaneous equilibrium was used to predict sorption the actual sorption and desorption processes however are significantly slower than those that could be simulated by the instantaneous equilibrium sorption approach as demonstrated by numerous earlier studies köhne et al 2006 pignatello and xing 1995 gatel et al 2019 thus more pesticide was expected to remain in the top soil layer for the subsequent runoff events than that predicted by the simulation especially for pesticides with higher water solubility like diuron to fairly evaluate the performance of calbmp goodness of fit indexes from the validated calbmp were compared to those from a well calibrated przm5 applied in the alfalfa field table 5 two highly sensitive parameters including cn and field capacity were calibrated to match the field condition the results indicated that the calibrated przm5 performed much better than calbmp which includes przm5 as its core model this implied the great potential for improving the calbmp performance after calibrations in future research work however as can be seen in table 5 the accuracies of simulating runoff sediment and diuron loads were not improved to a satisfactory level nse 0 5 in the calibrated przm5 thus the artifacts and limitations of przm5 could be another main reason for calbmp s fair performance in addition to its lack of calibration to properly present the runoff and sediment as well as pesticide simulation in calbmp there are several viable methods for different crops under site specific field conditions the calibration of the appropriate parameters such as curve number manning s roughness coefficient pesticide physiochemical parameters and management factors can provide a better description of runoff sediment and pesticide behavior in the field to some extent in addition instead of using a linear or instantaneous equilibrium assumption to calculate all pesticide movement in the top soil layer the kinetic sorption model malone et al 2004 wauchope et al 2002 also referred to as the time dependent sorption model will be included when developing future versions of calbmp to better characterize the slow sorption desorption processes and thus to improve the model s performance on simulating leaching as well as runoff of a pesticide with higher solubility besides a valid flow routing mechanism for simulating the runoff hydrograph could better describe the runoff processes generated by rainfall and various irrigation types thus the overall model performance in a field with the application of flood irrigation could be greatly improved considering our intention of developing the calbmp interface as a user friendly interface without requiring users to have a hydrology and environmental modeling background various soil crop and management scenarios should be considered it is worth noting that the set of parameters for individual fields can vary greatly in practice even for the same soil series crop type and management practices etc which may result in model uncertainty when it was applied from field to field even using the calibrated parameters overall the developed calbmp interface was able to reasonably simulate the runoff sediment erosion and adsorbed pesticide loss leaving the field after calibration 3 2 visual demonstrations of baseline bmp simulations in the strawberry field study in the strawberry field study the calbmp web pages with the inputs filled in for the baseline scenario are shown in figs 5 7 after the submission of all the required user inputs in the front end the outputs of the baseline scenario can be selected to visualize the water depths irrigation precipitation and runoff sediment pesticide loadings and concentrations in three main pathways in fig 8 we selected the runoff sediment pesticide loading and concentrations in the main pathways as examples to show the output visualization in the baseline scenario these visualizations clearly indicate that three runoff events occurred along with three sediment events during the crop growing season of strawberry fig 8a b if users place the cursor on the curve the daily index value and date will be shown beside it the water balance components can give the user a clue about the possible factors resulting in pesticide leaving the field such as over irrigation or pesticide application before heavy rainfall for pesticide loading in runoff erosion and volatilization the daily values and cumulative values are presented at the same time fig 8c users can also review the variations in a single index with time by graying out the other legends fig 8d e the pesticide loadings in the three runoff events are given as 0 2 10 5 1 1 10 5 and 1 4 10 5 g cm2 respectively and the pesticide loadings in erosion are 0 3 10 5 1 5 10 5 and 2 0 10 5 g cm2 respectively the user can also choose to review the pesticide concentration in runoff and the us epa aquatic life benchmark pesticide concentration is included in the graph as a reference line fig 8f it is worth noting that the pesticide concentration in runoff here is just the event based concentration which was transported to the surface water by runoff and not the pesticide exposure level in the nearby receiving water body to assess the pesticide exposure in the receiving water body a waterbody model would need to be integrated with przm5 and this extension of the model is under development by our project team and will be included in a future version of calbmp however the comparisons between pesticide concentrations in the runoff with benchmark values could provide a soft reference to help users understand the quality of runoff water leaving their fields a summary table including the field information and the event based output values of the baseline scenario will be presented in the front end when user clicks on the summary button on the right fig 8g after reviewing the outputs of the baseline scenario three single bmps and two combined bmps were selected in the sidebar fig 9a and run one by one in this case study the screenshots in fig 9b e show the pop ups for collecting inputs for pr cc and cr respectively these user inputs will be used to automatically generate new input files with replacement of the original parameters note that the slide bar was dragged to 15 in fig 9b the cover crop name emergence date and mowed date were entered in fig 9c and the crop name for rotation emergence date harvest date residue weight and pesticide application information for the rotation crop were entered in fig 9d e as shown in fig 9e broccoli planted for rotation also required additional pesticide inputs imidacloprid to the field and its loadings and concentrations in the main pathways can be reviewed in calbmp as well we do not present this aspect in the visualization results shown since the main point of this case study is to compare the removal effectiveness of different bmp scenarios for bifenthrin use in strawberry fields but the additional pesticide inputs from crop rotation should never be ignored in actual bmp selections in the output visualization section of the bmp scenarios calbmp not only provides the convenience of reviewing the same outputs as in the baseline scenario but it also provides the opportunity to review and compare bmp effectiveness among different bmp scenarios in this case study fig 10a e and fig 10f show the effectiveness of the five bmp scenarios individually and the comparisons among them respectively in bmp scenario 1 pr a 15 reduction in pesticide application will result in about 14 9 loading reduction in all of the three main pathways fig 10a this result is consistent with a previous study by zhang and zhang 2011 in which a close to linear relationship was found between pesticide use reduction and the pesticide loading reduction in the main pathways for bmp scenario 2 cc legume was planted as a cover crop and mowed into the soil to improve the soil structure before the planting of strawberry the pesticide loadings in runoff and erosion were reduced by 78 and 84 compared to the baseline scenario respectively with loading in volatilization remaining the same fig 10b similar results were found in hoorman 2009 where cover crops could help reduce pesticide loading in runoff by 50 or more and reduce sediment loading by 75 or more the great benefits of cover crops for improving soil and water quality have been reported by many previous studies as its contributions to reducing sediment production decreasing the impacts of rainfall events and decreasing runoff velocity in addition cover crops like legumes can increase soil nitrogen through nitrogen fixation which could reduce fertilizer use in daily field management in fig 10c the cr bmp reduced pesticide loadings in runoff and erosion by about 77 and 83 respectively in calbmp cover crop and crop rotation are represented with przm5 in a similar way by changing specific parameters including the scs curve number cn manning s roughness coefficient ov n for overland flow and the usle cover factor usle c arabi et al 2008 for residue management practices after the harvest of broccoli the cn value was reduced by 2 units from its original calibrated value arabi et al 2008 for the cover crop after legume was mowed into the soil the cn value was also considered to be 2 units smaller than the original calibrated value overall the effectiveness of cc and cr were found to be very close in this case study for the three combined bmps about 81 87 and 15 loading reductions were found in runoff erosion and volatilization in the pr cc scenario and 80 86 and 15 loading reductions were found in the pr cr scenario respectively fig 10d e in addition to reviewing the removal effectiveness of individual bmp a comparison of bmp effectiveness is presented in fig 10f users can also review the summary table including the details of each bmp scenario and the ratios of pesticide reduction in the main pathways fig 10g among the five bmp scenarios in this case study the combined bmp scenarios of pr cc and pr cr were the two most effective bmp options this result is consistent with the conclusions of many previous studies which have found that applying a reasonable set of combined bmps could provide a greater removal effect than a single bmp loperfido et al 2014 wang et al 2019 when users are selecting bmp scenarios for their site specific conditions they need to consider other factors such as implementation costs maintenance costs soil organic benefits and others especially in cases where the bmp effectiveness makes little difference for instance the use of cover crops will not only help with pesticide removal but it will also increase organic matter in the field which may increase the yields of subsequent crops and bring a higher income however planting a cover crop costs money with no harvest and yield in the end and crop rotation costs money but the harvesting of the rotation crop will bring some income to offset the costs in the southern and central coast areas of california where land and water costs are high cover crops are not economically feasible acharya et al 2019 another major factor for pesticide issues in the central coast region is multi cropping which results in increased pesticide inputs to the same field within a year basically bmp selection is a result of multi objective decision making and the quantitative evaluation of bmp effectiveness is only a starting point in this online advisory interface the costs and soil plant benefits of bmp implementation need more attention and will be taken into consideration in the future development of calbmp 3 3 summary and advantages of the web based calbmp interface a web based interface capable of evaluating bmps in pesticide modeling on farm was developed for contiguous california in this study the 26 most widely planted upland crops and seven most commonly used bmps in california can be selected based on the user s preferences in this interface the required user end inputs are minimal users will not need to build a model for their field since this interface has an integrated database for soil climate management crop pesticide and bmps and only the field configurations referring to location soil slope acreage crop growth dates and management irrigation and pesticide application need to be specified to run the przm5 model using this interface the current bmp sections include the seven non structural bmps of contour farming strip cropping parallel terracing crop rotation and residue management cover crop pesticide reduction and pesticide application timing the calbmp tool will help agricultural business organizations such as advisory organizations growers researchers and policymakers to perform timely virtual site specific assessments of pesticide use and management this tool allows agricultural practitioners to self assess the impacts of their pesticide usage through modeling and bmp evaluation which can save labor money and time compared to actually implementing installing bmps on farm compared with other existing environmental models and tools developed to support the use of bmps this calbmp interface has three main advantages i there is no need to install offline software users are able to use the interface and make przm5 run as long as they can get access to the internet using devices such as smart phones smart pads or laptops a grid responsive system was used to design the webpage so that the content can be adapted to any screen size ii calbmp allows users to avoid the time consuming preparation of input data calbmp has a very complete set of databases and relevant data are stored internally and will be automatically converted and formatted into the needed input files iii users do not need to learn and understand the model output structures to extract results from the text files users can freely select which outputs are presented in the graphs tables and texts in an easy to access way calbmp has great advantages in the interpretation step by helping users to review the bmp evaluation results and make decisions in two ways a enhanced graphical text presentation and b cross comparisons of results from different bmp scenarios 3 4 limitations and future development the proper selection of bmps based on site specific field conditions is a precondition for successful pesticide management in order to include the functions of pesticide modeling and bmp efficiency evaluation we built this interface of pesticide modeling at the field scale since that is the scale at which agricultural bmps are implemented some room for improvement in the calbmp interface still remains in several areas firstly a kinetic sorption model and valid flow routing mechanism need to be included in calbmp to help improve simulations of the runoff hydrograph and the movement potential of various pesticides secondly other structural bmps such as vegetative filter strips integrated ditches carbon socks sediment ponds and buffer strips will be included in a future version of calbmp in addition to the non structural bmps to achieve this functionality other environment models such as vvwm young 2016b vfsmod munoz carpena et al 1999 and or agdrift teske et al 2002 will be included in the updated interface thirdly the performance of calbmp needs to be tested in different cases using field experiment data since some of the parameters in the current calbmp lack calibration and validation the parameter sets used in current calbmp interface came from two sources during its development i suggested values obtained from the literature and previous studies or ii values obtained by consulting the przm modeling team at the us epa however since the przm model has been extensively tested at a field scale often by simulating hydrological processes and their corresponding pesticide transport parameters without calibration in the current calbmp interface can still be treated as proper and representative values of the inputs in most cases fourthly there is a need to include other factors such as the cost service life benefits and downsides of different bmp implementations that are important for the end user s preferences to enhance the advisory function of future versions of calbmp characteristics like cost effectiveness are often major components of the user s decision making criteria in selecting bmps and including the straightforward comparisons of bmp costs in calbmp will make its results more meaningful and convincing to various stakeholders 4 conclusions calbmp a web based modeling tool for non modelers was developed in this study it presents complex modeling results as more straightforward outputs in graphs and text and it provides the ability to compare different bmp scenarios in terms of their removal effectiveness the validation results of calbmp based on measurements in alfalfa indicated its capability of reasonably simulating over half of the runoff events and adsorbed pesticide loss leaving the field the simplified curve number method and lack of the runoff generation mechanisms of flood irrigation in przm5 could be the main reasons for the inaccurate simulations of runoff events generated by flood irrigation in calbmp underestimation of sediment could be attributed to the incorrect distribution of input water in przm5 and the inaccurate sediment measurements underprediction of the diuron loss indicated the limitation of the instantaneous equilibrium sorption model in simulating the leaching and runoff potential for many compounds with high water solubility to demonstrate the capabilities of calbmp for evaluating bmp performance effectiveness and selecting the optimum bmp scenario under site specific field conditions a case study was conducted for a strawberry field in california s coastal region bmp effectiveness expressed as the percentage reduction of pesticide loadings in three main pathways was compared and analyzed among five selected bmp scenarios the results indicated that combined bmps were more effective than individual bmps calbmp sets a precedent for the user friendly evaluation of bmps under individual field conditions online which fills the gaps in pesticide exposure assessments and bmp applications unlike the existing academic tools for pesticide removal this web based modeling tool can be a useful and appropriate tool for managing farms among regular agricultural practitioners by furthering our work in the development of the calbmp advisory interface such as upscaling the evaluation to the watershed basin level by integrating gis techniques more users will gain access to informative outputs this will comprehensively assist them in making decisions regarding their bmp implementation in order to achieve good removal

9145,quantitative evaluation of best management practice bmp effectiveness can help stakeholders to make better watershed management decisions however such evaluations are always challenging as they require complex algorithms to simulate the relevant hydrological processes crop growth and the corresponding pollutant transport pathways in order to evaluate potential bmps and select the best one for the specific field conditions in this study a web based interface calbmp was developed to predict bmp effectiveness in california focusing on pesticide modeling at the field scale with built in databases for soil weather crop pesticides and bmps users can run simulations for baseline and bmp scenarios using their site specific field conditions by simply providing the field information such as zip code soil crop management and pesticide application data calbmp uses przm5 a usepa model to simulate pesticide transport and fate at the field edge the calbmp simulations were validated based on measurements from an alfalfa field study the results indicated that the calbmp interface could reasonably simulate the runoff and adsorbed pesticide loss leaving the field with default parameters from previously known field parameters or public databases calbmp underestimated sediment erosion possibly due to uncertainties in field measurements or inaccurate simulation of the temporal distribution of flood irrigation calbmp is likely to underestimate pesticides with greater solubility such as diuron because przm5 uses the simplified instantaneous equilibrium sorption model in addition a strawberry field study was adopted to demonstrate the capability of the calbmp interface for simulating bmp effectiveness pesticide reduction percentage in the main pathways with easy to understand graphs and tables the results indicated that users can easily compare and review the results from multiple scenarios which could facilitate the decision making process for mitigating the amount of active ingredient bifenthrin leaving the field the calbmp tool provides useful information on pesticide runoff potential and bmp selection at the field scale with increasingly stringent regulations for water quality protection calbmp will add to the growers toolbox for minimizing the environmental impacts from their inevitable pesticide usage graphical abstract ga1 keywords best

2022 1 introduction pesticides are widely used to control the insects diseases weeds and other organisms that are pests to agricultural crops zhang et al 2019 california is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world and pesticide use in california has increased dramatically over the past ten years to meet the increasing global food demand the most recently available statistics show that about 209 million pounds of agricultural pesticides were used in california in 2018 california department of pesticide regulation 2020 despite their efficacy the use of pesticides raises serious concerns for the risks to ecosystems and human health due to their residues on food and in the environment as well as the direct exposure of farm workers during pesticide applications pesticide offsite movement through runoff sediment drainage and spray drift is largely responsible for the resulting surface water pollution thus there is an urgent need to apply on farm best management practices bmps in order to alleviate pesticide offsite movement from agricultural fields to the adjacent waterways bmps include many different structural and nonstructural conservation practices such as application reduction application timing control improved spray efficiency sediment ponds vegetative filter strips constructed wetlands buffer zones and many others extensive research has examined the effectiveness of bmps and significant reductions in the major offsite pathways of pesticides have been reported bennett et al 2005 chen et al 2016 hou et al 2021 li et al 2019 sahin and karpuzcu 2020 watanabe et al 2007 yazdi et al 2021 there are two main approaches for evaluating bmp efficacy including in situ experiments harmel et al 2018 and numerical modeling field experiments can usually generate accurate measurements but they are costly in terms of time and money in addition their results are ultimately limited in applicability by the unique local conditions of each field to overcome these limitations numerical modeling has become a valuable supplemental tool thanks to its ability to run different bmp scenarios using any set of field condition data in recent decades a few field scale models have been developed for simulating pesticide transport and fate at the scale of individual fields among them some of the most widely used models are the pesticide root zone model przm carsel et al 1998 the root zone water quality model rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 and agricultural policy environmental extender apex gassman et al 2010 these models can provide acceptable simulation accuracy because they have been widely validated in recent decades chen et al 2017 feng et al 2019 gassman et al 2010 ma et al 1999 ma et al 2004 ma et al 2007 wang et al 2012 zhang and goh 2015 more comprehensive environmental regulations have been developed in recent years to encourage the use of bmps that reduce pesticide off site movement for example on april 15 2021 the california regional water quality control board crwqcb 2021 approved agricultural order 4 0 formally general waste discharge requirements for discharges from irrigated lands r3 2021 0040 this order includes incentives for the use of bmps such as cover crops to improve soil health and increase moisture retention as well as carbon and nitrogen sequestration it also includes provisions and incentives for growers and technical service providers to form or join third party programs that provide compliance assistance to growers growers may choose to comply with certain requirements either on an individual basis or via membership in a third party program as a result various agricultural stakeholders including farmers regulatory communities consultants and other agribusiness personnel are increasingly interested in receiving quantitative assessments regarding the effectiveness of specific bmps for reducing pesticide runoff based on precise site specific field conditions zhang and zhang 2011 given the increasingly stringent regulations for water quality protection the farmer s toolbox for battling pests is becoming more limited in addition selecting the appropriate bmps for the site specific field conditions is a prerequisite for achieving effective pesticide runoff reduction however evaluating bmps on farm using field scale models requires a professional background in hydrology and environmental chemistry which can limit their direct use by farmers and other agricultural practitioners within the united states some tools have been developed in various states that can assist in the use of bmps for reducing nutrient and sediment runoff into the surface water system for instance the agricultural bmp assessment and tracking tool developed by the minnesota department of agriculture http mda houstoneng net map and the bmp selection tool by the state of arkansas merriman et al 2009 have contributed greatly to the investigation and implementation of bmps within the academic community the nutrient tracking tool https ntt tiaer tarleton edu welcomes new locale en is a free online user friendly decision making tool that quantitatively estimates the nitrogen phosphorus and sediment losses from crop pasture forest lands which was developed by the modeling team at texas institute for applied environmental research tiaer at tarleton state university in cooperation with usda s office of environmental markets nrcs and ars saleh et al 2011 the texas bmp evaluation tool tbet developed by usda ars could aid in science based bmp selection on farm and cost effective conservation spending white et al 2012 however such tools tend to require a professional background as a prerequisite for usage so they are not very user friendly for field agricultural practitioners thus developing an easy to use bmp evaluation system i e one that requires simple inputs and provides users with a graphical user interface so that the user does not need to know programming could greatly facilitate the processes of selection design installation and maintenance of various bmps among a wide variety of stakeholders this study aims to provide all stakeholders with a tool for making quantitative assessments of various bmps in order to guide their decision making in reducing the offsite movement of pesticide applications this goal is achieved through the development of an easy to use interactive platform named calbmp which has the ability to scientifically represent all of the involved processes and this tool can be of great use when implementing on farm bmps the specific objectives of this study are 1 to develop a web based bmp evaluation interface capable of estimating the main pesticide offsite movement pathways runoff sediment and volatilization before and after the implementation of bmps on the farm under the site specific conditions for upland crops in california 2 to demonstrate the application of the calbmp tool on an actual field for the evaluation of bmps with respect to the levels of erosion runoff volatilization corresponding pesticide loads and concentrations and bmp effectiveness under different scenarios of user selected pesticide usage and bmp selections and 3 to compare and analyze the results obtained from the calbmp tool with the random selection of bmps to aid in evidence based bmp selection 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology and model structure of calbmp in developing calbmp as an on farm decision support system for the identification of effective bmps for upland crops in california this study focuses on the integration of three main components site specific field characteristics bmp performance with respect to pesticide removal and the inclusion of user selected preferences fig 1 represents the conceptual framework of the calbmp interface which is comprised of four parts the front end the back end supporting databases and environmental models the schematic diagram of the calbmp web design and features is presented in fig 2 in which the related functions are shown in bold the front end is used for collecting the text information entered or selected by the user to generate the model input files and set up the models its graphical user interface gui serves an important role in the framework since the online interface is the user s first impression of calbmp additionally all the outputs are visualized and downloadable in the front end in either excel or graphical formats the back end is responsible for the data request processing and response of the front end and it interacts with the background databases for the field scale pesticide modeling in calbmp we chose pesticide root zone model version 5 0 przm5 which is the most recent version of przm young and fry 2020 included inside the pesticide water calculator pwc young 2016a przm is a flexible model which is capable of simulating the pesticide leaving the field based on relevant local parameters of soil weather crop field management and others compared to other environmental models it has distinct advantages in its capability for modeling various agricultural scenarios such as pesticide applications plant growth and development field management practices and others luo and zhang 2010 in addition przm has been extensively validated and has shown good performance in reproducing the hydrological processes and pesticide movement at the field scale noshadi and jamshidi 2014 trevisan et al 2000 the model itself is able to simulate some non structural bmps on the farm such as adjustments in pesticide application rate or date cover crops tillage and contour planting it has also been coupled with some other environmental models to simulate many commonly used structural bmps such as vegetative filter strips vegetated drainage ditches sediment ponds and buffer zones przm5 is conceptually the same as the original przm version 3 12 1 and its major modification is the removal of some routines which were not functioning correctly in the older versions of przm the przm5 manual provides a detailed description of the algorithms and theoretical basis young and fry 2020 five databases included in the back end store the datasets for field locations county name zip code climate daily high resolution weather data from gridmet soils ssurgo pesticide usage pur and properties crops and field management practices the detailed procedures of calbmp development are given in sections 2 1 1 to 2 1 3 below 2 1 1 web interface development in this system users can select input text to specify the unique field conditions with without bmp implementation in the front end webpage in order to set up the przm5 model and run the baseline bmp scenario once a user logs into the account a unique project will be initiated by starting from the find your field webpage one temporary sub folder will be created within the user s account folder to store all the files created by this run and the sub folder name is unique for its creation date and time such as 06182021093000 the user s selections will be updated and locked in the order of county to zip code in the find your field webpage in which the process variables are extracted from the location database that includes the county names and zip code numbers for all of california based on the soil database the user can then choose from a list of soil series associated with the selected zip code and the displayed list will be updated when the zip code changes the nearest weather station for the chosen zip code will be shown directly on the map on the right and this linkage will be saved in the weather database after entering the field area as a numeric input the user will click on the next button and specify the crop management and pesticide application data once crop irrigation method and pesticide application method are selected the user can select the management dates that are recommended for a specific period based on the crop information database in the back end once the user completes information selection input in the front end webpage for running the baseline scenario and clicks on the submit and run button the front end interface will call the weather station search program to determine the station id and then extract the weather datasets required by przm5 from the weather database the properties of the selected soil series will be extracted from the soil database and the corresponding pesticide physicochemical properties will be extracted from the pesticide database in the back end subsequently the values for all the parameters will be requested by the back end to generate the przm5 input file then the executable file of the przm5 model will be called to run the baseline scenario after the baseline scenario run is completed output zts files will be extracted from the temporary folder and the user will be able to select variables of interest for visualization by clicking on the try bmp button the user can select any bmp bmps and submit them and the interface will extract the input parameters corresponding to the different bmp scenarios from the bmp database in the back end some parameters in the original baseline scenario przm5 input file will then be rewritten to generate a new input file for the bmp scenario similarly the executable przm5 model will be called after that and the new output zts files will be extracted automatically based on the user selected outputs of the bmp scenario in the visualization additionally the user could choose different bmp scenarios for comparison the webpage will provide various visualization options including different outputs from a single bmp scenario or comparisons between bmp and baseline scenarios 2 1 2 background database development there are five databases in the back end the field location database is a table which lists all of the counties in california and the corresponding zip code numbers within each county the soil database was prepared using the united states department of agriculture usda s natural resources conservation service nrcs soil survey geographic ssurgo database usda nrcs soil survey staff 2020 and only those columns which are required as przm5 s model input were retained in the ssurgo database soils are grouped into map units based on their similar properties slope class and hydrologic soil group and each map unit has a unique map unit key mukey each soil contains one or more components which are individual soil series with a unique component key cokey soil properties can vary with depth within each component and a chorizon key chokey is used to reflect the differences in soil properties with depth four tables in the ssurgo database muaggatt component chorizon and valu were combined to provide all the required soil and landscape inputs for przm5 ultimately two tables are included in the final soil database one table summarizes the connections among zip code mukey and cokey the other table summarizes all the corresponding soil property parameters required for przm5 s input file supplementary material table s1 and the soil properties were extracted from this table by mukey cokey and chokey for the weather database all derived indices were calculated using the university of idaho s gridded meteorological data gridmet http www climatologylab org gridmet html abatzoglou 2013 this gridmet dataset covers the contiguous us with high space time resolution daily temporal and 4 km spatial resolution and it is a perfect tool for developing our weather database as it includes all of our required variables from 1979 to the current year there are two tables in the final weather database one table links the nearest weather station to each zip code and it was used to locate the nearest weather station based on the user selected zip code the other table supplementary material table s2 includes the 12 columns of station id zip code longitude latitude year month day precipitation reference evapotranspiration temperature wind speed and solar radiation which are used for preparing the przm5 weather input file wea file once the user specifies the simulation year or period the crop database includes two tables one table provides crop growth parameters to reproduce the crop growth process in przm5 and the other table has templates of crop scenarios which are used for extracting the various parameters including the universal soil loss equation crop management factor usle c curve number cn and manning s roughness coefficient n in order to calculate the runoff and erosion processes in przm5 based on the usda national agricultural statistic service nass cropland data layer for 2008 2020 https www nass usda gov research and science cropland release the 26 upland crops with the highest planted acreages in california were selected and included in the current crop database and the number of crops will be expanded in our future database development efforts relevant crop parameters were derived from the usepa standard przm field and orchard crop scenarios for california usepa 2004 the commonly applied pesticides for the 26 selected upland crops were summarized from the california department of pesticide regulation cdpr agricultural use pesticide use report pur dataset from 2007 to 2009 once the user selects a pesticide in the front end webpage all the required pesticide properties are extracted from the pesticide database to generate the chemical input parameters for the przm5 run their corresponding pesticide properties were collected from the pesticide use risk evaluation pure decision support system dss zhan and zhang 2012 and the pesticide properties database ppdb university of hertfordshire 2007 currently seven non structural bmp options are included in the calbmp interface contouring farming strip cropping parallel terracing cover crops pesticide application reduction pesticide application timing and crop rotation and residue management the specific parameters that need to be changed for each bmp were obtained from arabi et al 2008 przm5 already has an established method for modeling several agricultural practices including cover crop tillage crop residue etc this built in feature indicates this model s capacity to represent many commonly used non structural bmps on the farm by altering the appropriate input parameters which are involved in various hydrological and water quality processes including surface runoff erosion infiltration pesticide loading etc when the bmp bmps are selected the corresponding parameters will be extracted from the bmp database and used to update the original input files 2 1 3 implementation and updates multiple programming languages including html css and javascript were adopted for the front end interface the vue was adopted as the framework for the front end to provide more flexibility using javascript three javascript libraries boostrap echarts and leaflet were used to develop the webpage appearance display the map with the nearest weather station and achieve visualization respectively golang and sql were two main programming languages used in the back end gin was adopted as the framework for the back end design taking over the data request and response between itself and the front end and interacting with the databases two packages named gorm and jwt token were used for the back end s interactive activities with the databases and user authorization respectively all the databases were stored in an sql postgresql database the source code package and all the database files of the calbmp interface are available for download on github com https github com m0ng0lfalcon calbmp in the available supplementary materials we provide the column titles for the soil and weather database tables since calbmp is a web based platform no software or plug in installation effort is required to use it additionally regular updates and maintenance will be applied to calbmp in order to provide the most up to date data for users for the updating and maintenance manual efforts and python scripts will be adopted to semi automatically oversee and download source datasets from publicly available databases new crop types pesticides and bmp selections will be added upon request as well 2 2 calbmp application 2 2 1 performance evaluation using alfalfa field measurements the przm5 model in the calbmp interface was evaluated using a field study conducted in two adjacent alfalfa fields located at davis california zhang and goh 2015 detailed field properties management information and pesticide characteristics are presented in table 1 and table 2 since there was negligible rainfall during the alfalfa growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 six flood irrigation treatments were applied to fields a and b during the alfalfa growing season a flood irrigation controller was installed at the head of each field to deliver water along the alfalfa rows to the end both fields were sprayed with chlorpyrifos and diuron in 2012 and 2013 respectively at the edge of the field there was a tailwater ditch where the collection of water samples and measurements of outflow were taken specifically generated runoff was recorded at 2 min intervals and the concentrations of suspended sediment particles and pesticides were calculated based on the measurements as a result only the total pesticide concentration was recorded in this study since the low concentration of suspended sediment made it impossible to quantify the sediment phase pesticide values of user end inputs including field size soil types pesticide application rate and dates irrigation date and rates soil hydraulics and pesticide characteristics were set by field measurements and the calbmp databases without model calibration to evaluate how well calbmp performed in simulating the site specific pesticide offsite movement the simulated runoff flow sediment and pesticide loss were compared to the measured data from the field experiments in addition three goodness of fit statistical indices based on event based simulations and observations including root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent of bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used in this study for calbmp evaluation a regression based term like r 2 was not selected as an index since that it is commonly used for long term simulations and its application in event based simulations with small sample sizes can introduce large uncertainties garen and moore 2005 miao et al 2016 detailed calculations of these indexes were as follows 1 nse 1 i 1 n o s i o m i 2 i 1 n o m i o m 2 2 rmse i 1 n o s i o m i 2 n 0 5 3 pbias i 1 n o s i o m i i 1 n o m i 100 where n is the number of simulations o s and o m are simulated and measured values of model outputs respectively o s and o m are the mean values of the simulated and measured model outputs respectively and σ s and σ m indicate the standard deviations in simulations and measurements respectively with a range from to 1 nse 1 indicates a perfect match between the measurements and simulations and values between 0 5 and 1 are usually considered to represent an acceptable level of model performance moriasi et al 2007 the rmse indicates a good match between measurements and simulations when it approaches 0 and a higher rmse indicates a worse match of the simulations and measurements pbias with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation and it has an optimal value of 0 positive values indicate model underestimation bias whereas negative values indicate model overestimation bias in the model gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2007 proposed that model simulation could be taken as satisfactory if nse 0 5 pbias 25 for streamflow pbias 55 for sediment and pbias 70 for nutrient it is worth noting that corresponding performance evaluation criteria of performance measures can be adjusted within acceptable bounds based on additional considerations such as quality and quantity of available measured data spatial and temporal scales etc moriasi et al 2015 2 2 2 simulations of baseline bmp scenarios using strawberry field study the current active bmp options in the calbmp interface are not suitable for alfalfa fields except for the pesticide application reduction and the application timing adjustment to better demonstrate how calbmp users can evaluate bmp s and what information can be provided to them as advisory support with or without bmps a strawberry field located in monterey county was used in this study as a representative crop which is heavily dosed with pesticide in california and has more applicable bmps in calbmp referring to the statistical record over 80 of the fresh market and processed strawberries grown in the united states are produced in california goldberger et al 2019 two thirds of california s strawberry production comes from the santa maria region among which monterey tops the chart in heavy pesticide use mossler and nesheim 2004 in this study strawberry was planted in beds designed to allow for proper drainage in fallow conditions the soil series is oceano which is a hydrologic group a sandy loamy soil on slopes of 0 50 usda 2006 the strawberry crop was planted on december 15th of 2018 and harvested on may 18th of 2019 drip irrigation was used over the entire crop growing season the active ingredient bifenthrin was ground applied at 0 1 lb acre on march 15th to control pests during this period for more detailed information on the user inputs which specify the field conditions please refer to the calbmp webpage screenshots for this case study in section 3 2 individual bmps and combined bmps were considered in the case study to compare their removal effectiveness table 1 it is worth noting that there are no nationally recognized standardized test methods for bmp performance as of today whelton et al 2016 so the percentage of pesticide mass reduction will be simulated as the bmp effectiveness in this study since there is no observed bmp efficiency dataset for this field the simulated bmp effectiveness could not be compared to an observed value and the bmp efficiency data reported in previous research will be provided as a reference scenario 1 was pesticide application reduction pr since it is the most straightforward and cost free way to reduce potential pesticide pollution based on previous studies by zhang and zhang 2011 a 15 reduction in the current pesticide use could result in a significant load reduction of about 30 for the pesticides thus 15 pesticide application reduction was adopted in the case study strawberry fields are sometimes rotated with cover crops such as rye or barley or another cash crop such as beans broccoli lettuce or cauliflower to reduce pest populations and improve the soil structure thus cover crop cc and crop rotation and residue management cr as two commonly used conservation practices in california s strawberry field management were included as bmp scenarios 2 and 3 legume was selected as the cover crop before strawberry it was planted on june 24th of 2018 and was flail mowed and incorporated with a disk on september 3rd of 2018 after 9 weeks of growth for the cr scenario scenario 3 broccoli was planted as a rotation crop before strawberry in this field it was planted on june 21st of 2018 and harvested on september 21st of 2018 the active ingredient imidacloprid was ground applied once at 0 71 lb acre on august 15th to control pests during this period for the residue management 4 t ha broccoli residue cover was selected the pesticide use rates and dates in the baseline and bmp scenarios were based on the actual product usage data in the pesticide use report pur database http www cdpr ca gov docs pur purmain htm accessed on august 21 2021 besides the three single bmps above two combined bmps of pr cc and pr cr scenarios 4 and 5 in table 3 were selected in the case study 3 results and discussion 3 1 calbmp performance evaluation in the alfalfa field study in this study six irrigation induced runoff events were generated and accounted for 18 5 of the total irrigation water amounts the performance of calbmp in simulating the pesticide offsite movement from the alfalfa fields in davis are presented in fig 3 with the values of the goodness of fit indexes to provide a better understanding of the simulation accuracy of calbmp table 4 summarized the goodness of fit indices from two previous studies conducted by zhang and goh 2015 and chen et al 2017 using przm and the same measurements from the alfalfa fields in addition to facilitate the analysis and demonstrate the model performance the event based values of runoff sediment and pesticide loss are presented in fig 4 these results indicated that calbmp tended to slightly overestimate the runoff for most of these events and three exceptions were detected as the notably low runoff estimation on march 22 of 2013 from field a event 5 in fig 4a as well as the overestimations on may 21 and june 15 of 2012 from field b events 1 and 2 in fig 4b this may have resulted from the simplified curve number method in przm5 that was used to calculate surface runoff young and carleton 2006 zhang and goh 2015 in addition the przm5 model has limitations in simulating flood irrigation since it does not include the runoff generation mechanisms for water moving from the head to the end of the field which may also result in the inaccurate simulations of runoff generated by flood irrigation in calbmp the goodness of fit indexes with a rmse of 1 29 cm a nse of 1 55 and a pbias 22 14 could be greatly improved to a rmse of 0 6 cm a nse of 0 8 and a pbias 12 2 respectively by removing these three points from analysis furthermore calbmp is capable of reproducing the overall trends in surface runoff which is mainly driven by the amount of irrigation water fig 4a b sediment erosion was drastically underestimated in three of six events in both fields with an rmse of 23 98 kg a nse of 0 2 and a pbias of 46 78 fig 3b and fig 4c d this could mainly be attributed to two factors one refers to the measurement errors since the collected sediment from ditches originated partially from the field and partially from the bottom of the ditch zhang and goh 2015 the other factor might be the longer but less intensive daily irrigation input in the simulation in przm5 a flood irrigation event was added as a daily rainfall input distributed across 24 h while actually the average duration of an irrigation event was much shorter in this study only about 7 h since the peak runoff volume was basically determined by the rainfall distribution in przm5 a lower intensity of irrigation spanning 24 h input could result in a decreased peak runoff volume as well as less sediment in the simulation which would lead to an underestimation of calbmp based sediment values however it is predictable that the overall accuracy of sediment can be largely improved with more reliable measurements for pesticide loss along with runoff flow leaving the field the results showed that calbmp based chlorpyrifos losses matched well with the measured data rmse 7 50 mg nse 0 79 and pbias 9 82 while diuron losses were underestimated to a great extent rmse 4 31 g nse 0 71 and pbias 79 54 fig 3c d and fig 4e f this validation result was quite similar with previous research conducted by chen et al 2017 in the same alfalfa field and the only difference is that limited calibration of hydrologic parameters like cn and field capacity were taken to improve the performance of przm in previous study as mentioned above the pesticide loss was measured as the total mass in the runoff sample in this study and pesticide in both soluble and adsorbed phases were summed to represent the simulated pesticide loss surface runoff was identified as the preferred pathway for pesticide offsite movement among which 90 chlorpyrifos and 98 diuron were transferred in soluble phase in the simulation this finding was quite consistent with previous studies boithias et al 2011 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the underestimation of diuron can be partly caused by the uncertainty in simulating the pesticide concentration in the top soil profile in przm5 in which an instantaneous equilibrium was used to predict sorption the actual sorption and desorption processes however are significantly slower than those that could be simulated by the instantaneous equilibrium sorption approach as demonstrated by numerous earlier studies köhne et al 2006 pignatello and xing 1995 gatel et al 2019 thus more pesticide was expected to remain in the top soil layer for the subsequent runoff events than that predicted by the simulation especially for pesticides with higher water solubility like diuron to fairly evaluate the performance of calbmp goodness of fit indexes from the validated calbmp were compared to those from a well calibrated przm5 applied in the alfalfa field table 5 two highly sensitive parameters including cn and field capacity were calibrated to match the field condition the results indicated that the calibrated przm5 performed much better than calbmp which includes przm5 as its core model this implied the great potential for improving the calbmp performance after calibrations in future research work however as can be seen in table 5 the accuracies of simulating runoff sediment and diuron loads were not improved to a satisfactory level nse 0 5 in the calibrated przm5 thus the artifacts and limitations of przm5 could be another main reason for calbmp s fair performance in addition to its lack of calibration to properly present the runoff and sediment as well as pesticide simulation in calbmp there are several viable methods for different crops under site specific field conditions the calibration of the appropriate parameters such as curve number manning s roughness coefficient pesticide physiochemical parameters and management factors can provide a better description of runoff sediment and pesticide behavior in the field to some extent in addition instead of using a linear or instantaneous equilibrium assumption to calculate all pesticide movement in the top soil layer the kinetic sorption model malone et al 2004 wauchope et al 2002 also referred to as the time dependent sorption model will be included when developing future versions of calbmp to better characterize the slow sorption desorption processes and thus to improve the model s performance on simulating leaching as well as runoff of a pesticide with higher solubility besides a valid flow routing mechanism for simulating the runoff hydrograph could better describe the runoff processes generated by rainfall and various irrigation types thus the overall model performance in a field with the application of flood irrigation could be greatly improved considering our intention of developing the calbmp interface as a user friendly interface without requiring users to have a hydrology and environmental modeling background various soil crop and management scenarios should be considered it is worth noting that the set of parameters for individual fields can vary greatly in practice even for the same soil series crop type and management practices etc which may result in model uncertainty when it was applied from field to field even using the calibrated parameters overall the developed calbmp interface was able to reasonably simulate the runoff sediment erosion and adsorbed pesticide loss leaving the field after calibration 3 2 visual demonstrations of baseline bmp simulations in the strawberry field study in the strawberry field study the calbmp web pages with the inputs filled in for the baseline scenario are shown in figs 5 7 after the submission of all the required user inputs in the front end the outputs of the baseline scenario can be selected to visualize the water depths irrigation precipitation and runoff sediment pesticide loadings and concentrations in three main pathways in fig 8 we selected the runoff sediment pesticide loading and concentrations in the main pathways as examples to show the output visualization in the baseline scenario these visualizations clearly indicate that three runoff events occurred along with three sediment events during the crop growing season of strawberry fig 8a b if users place the cursor on the curve the daily index value and date will be shown beside it the water balance components can give the user a clue about the possible factors resulting in pesticide leaving the field such as over irrigation or pesticide application before heavy rainfall for pesticide loading in runoff erosion and volatilization the daily values and cumulative values are presented at the same time fig 8c users can also review the variations in a single index with time by graying out the other legends fig 8d e the pesticide loadings in the three runoff events are given as 0 2 10 5 1 1 10 5 and 1 4 10 5 g cm2 respectively and the pesticide loadings in erosion are 0 3 10 5 1 5 10 5 and 2 0 10 5 g cm2 respectively the user can also choose to review the pesticide concentration in runoff and the us epa aquatic life benchmark pesticide concentration is included in the graph as a reference line fig 8f it is worth noting that the pesticide concentration in runoff here is just the event based concentration which was transported to the surface water by runoff and not the pesticide exposure level in the nearby receiving water body to assess the pesticide exposure in the receiving water body a waterbody model would need to be integrated with przm5 and this extension of the model is under development by our project team and will be included in a future version of calbmp however the comparisons between pesticide concentrations in the runoff with benchmark values could provide a soft reference to help users understand the quality of runoff water leaving their fields a summary table including the field information and the event based output values of the baseline scenario will be presented in the front end when user clicks on the summary button on the right fig 8g after reviewing the outputs of the baseline scenario three single bmps and two combined bmps were selected in the sidebar fig 9a and run one by one in this case study the screenshots in fig 9b e show the pop ups for collecting inputs for pr cc and cr respectively these user inputs will be used to automatically generate new input files with replacement of the original parameters note that the slide bar was dragged to 15 in fig 9b the cover crop name emergence date and mowed date were entered in fig 9c and the crop name for rotation emergence date harvest date residue weight and pesticide application information for the rotation crop were entered in fig 9d e as shown in fig 9e broccoli planted for rotation also required additional pesticide inputs imidacloprid to the field and its loadings and concentrations in the main pathways can be reviewed in calbmp as well we do not present this aspect in the visualization results shown since the main point of this case study is to compare the removal effectiveness of different bmp scenarios for bifenthrin use in strawberry fields but the additional pesticide inputs from crop rotation should never be ignored in actual bmp selections in the output visualization section of the bmp scenarios calbmp not only provides the convenience of reviewing the same outputs as in the baseline scenario but it also provides the opportunity to review and compare bmp effectiveness among different bmp scenarios in this case study fig 10a e and fig 10f show the effectiveness of the five bmp scenarios individually and the comparisons among them respectively in bmp scenario 1 pr a 15 reduction in pesticide application will result in about 14 9 loading reduction in all of the three main pathways fig 10a this result is consistent with a previous study by zhang and zhang 2011 in which a close to linear relationship was found between pesticide use reduction and the pesticide loading reduction in the main pathways for bmp scenario 2 cc legume was planted as a cover crop and mowed into the soil to improve the soil structure before the planting of strawberry the pesticide loadings in runoff and erosion were reduced by 78 and 84 compared to the baseline scenario respectively with loading in volatilization remaining the same fig 10b similar results were found in hoorman 2009 where cover crops could help reduce pesticide loading in runoff by 50 or more and reduce sediment loading by 75 or more the great benefits of cover crops for improving soil and water quality have been reported by many previous studies as its contributions to reducing sediment production decreasing the impacts of rainfall events and decreasing runoff velocity in addition cover crops like legumes can increase soil nitrogen through nitrogen fixation which could reduce fertilizer use in daily field management in fig 10c the cr bmp reduced pesticide loadings in runoff and erosion by about 77 and 83 respectively in calbmp cover crop and crop rotation are represented with przm5 in a similar way by changing specific parameters including the scs curve number cn manning s roughness coefficient ov n for overland flow and the usle cover factor usle c arabi et al 2008 for residue management practices after the harvest of broccoli the cn value was reduced by 2 units from its original calibrated value arabi et al 2008 for the cover crop after legume was mowed into the soil the cn value was also considered to be 2 units smaller than the original calibrated value overall the effectiveness of cc and cr were found to be very close in this case study for the three combined bmps about 81 87 and 15 loading reductions were found in runoff erosion and volatilization in the pr cc scenario and 80 86 and 15 loading reductions were found in the pr cr scenario respectively fig 10d e in addition to reviewing the removal effectiveness of individual bmp a comparison of bmp effectiveness is presented in fig 10f users can also review the summary table including the details of each bmp scenario and the ratios of pesticide reduction in the main pathways fig 10g among the five bmp scenarios in this case study the combined bmp scenarios of pr cc and pr cr were the two most effective bmp options this result is consistent with the conclusions of many previous studies which have found that applying a reasonable set of combined bmps could provide a greater removal effect than a single bmp loperfido et al 2014 wang et al 2019 when users are selecting bmp scenarios for their site specific conditions they need to consider other factors such as implementation costs maintenance costs soil organic benefits and others especially in cases where the bmp effectiveness makes little difference for instance the use of cover crops will not only help with pesticide removal but it will also increase organic matter in the field which may increase the yields of subsequent crops and bring a higher income however planting a cover crop costs money with no harvest and yield in the end and crop rotation costs money but the harvesting of the rotation crop will bring some income to offset the costs in the southern and central coast areas of california where land and water costs are high cover crops are not economically feasible acharya et al 2019 another major factor for pesticide issues in the central coast region is multi cropping which results in increased pesticide inputs to the same field within a year basically bmp selection is a result of multi objective decision making and the quantitative evaluation of bmp effectiveness is only a starting point in this online advisory interface the costs and soil plant benefits of bmp implementation need more attention and will be taken into consideration in the future development of calbmp 3 3 summary and advantages of the web based calbmp interface a web based interface capable of evaluating bmps in pesticide modeling on farm was developed for contiguous california in this study the 26 most widely planted upland crops and seven most commonly used bmps in california can be selected based on the user s preferences in this interface the required user end inputs are minimal users will not need to build a model for their field since this interface has an integrated database for soil climate management crop pesticide and bmps and only the field configurations referring to location soil slope acreage crop growth dates and management irrigation and pesticide application need to be specified to run the przm5 model using this interface the current bmp sections include the seven non structural bmps of contour farming strip cropping parallel terracing crop rotation and residue management cover crop pesticide reduction and pesticide application timing the calbmp tool will help agricultural business organizations such as advisory organizations growers researchers and policymakers to perform timely virtual site specific assessments of pesticide use and management this tool allows agricultural practitioners to self assess the impacts of their pesticide usage through modeling and bmp evaluation which can save labor money and time compared to actually implementing installing bmps on farm compared with other existing environmental models and tools developed to support the use of bmps this calbmp interface has three main advantages i there is no need to install offline software users are able to use the interface and make przm5 run as long as they can get access to the internet using devices such as smart phones smart pads or laptops a grid responsive system was used to design the webpage so that the content can be adapted to any screen size ii calbmp allows users to avoid the time consuming preparation of input data calbmp has a very complete set of databases and relevant data are stored internally and will be automatically converted and formatted into the needed input files iii users do not need to learn and understand the model output structures to extract results from the text files users can freely select which outputs are presented in the graphs tables and texts in an easy to access way calbmp has great advantages in the interpretation step by helping users to review the bmp evaluation results and make decisions in two ways a enhanced graphical text presentation and b cross comparisons of results from different bmp scenarios 3 4 limitations and future development the proper selection of bmps based on site specific field conditions is a precondition for successful pesticide management in order to include the functions of pesticide modeling and bmp efficiency evaluation we built this interface of pesticide modeling at the field scale since that is the scale at which agricultural bmps are implemented some room for improvement in the calbmp interface still remains in several areas firstly a kinetic sorption model and valid flow routing mechanism need to be included in calbmp to help improve simulations of the runoff hydrograph and the movement potential of various pesticides secondly other structural bmps such as vegetative filter strips integrated ditches carbon socks sediment ponds and buffer strips will be included in a future version of calbmp in addition to the non structural bmps to achieve this functionality other environment models such as vvwm young 2016b vfsmod munoz carpena et al 1999 and or agdrift teske et al 2002 will be included in the updated interface thirdly the performance of calbmp needs to be tested in different cases using field experiment data since some of the parameters in the current calbmp lack calibration and validation the parameter sets used in current calbmp interface came from two sources during its development i suggested values obtained from the literature and previous studies or ii values obtained by consulting the przm modeling team at the us epa however since the przm model has been extensively tested at a field scale often by simulating hydrological processes and their corresponding pesticide transport parameters without calibration in the current calbmp interface can still be treated as proper and representative values of the inputs in most cases fourthly there is a need to include other factors such as the cost service life benefits and downsides of different bmp implementations that are important for the end user s preferences to enhance the advisory function of future versions of calbmp characteristics like cost effectiveness are often major components of the user s decision making criteria in selecting bmps and including the straightforward comparisons of bmp costs in calbmp will make its results more meaningful and convincing to various stakeholders 4 conclusions calbmp a web based modeling tool for non modelers was developed in this study it presents complex modeling results as more straightforward outputs in graphs and text and it provides the ability to compare different bmp scenarios in terms of their removal effectiveness the validation results of calbmp based on measurements in alfalfa indicated its capability of reasonably simulating over half of the runoff events and adsorbed pesticide loss leaving the field the simplified curve number method and lack of the runoff generation mechanisms of flood irrigation in przm5 could be the main reasons for the inaccurate simulations of runoff events generated by flood irrigation in calbmp underestimation of sediment could be attributed to the incorrect distribution of input water in przm5 and the inaccurate sediment measurements underprediction of the diuron loss indicated the limitation of the instantaneous equilibrium sorption model in simulating the leaching and runoff potential for many compounds with high water solubility to demonstrate the capabilities of calbmp for evaluating bmp performance effectiveness and selecting the optimum bmp scenario under site specific field conditions a case study was conducted for a strawberry field in california s coastal region bmp effectiveness expressed as the percentage reduction of pesticide loadings in three main pathways was compared and analyzed among five selected bmp scenarios the results indicated that combined bmps were more effective than individual bmps calbmp sets a precedent for the user friendly evaluation of bmps under individual field conditions online which fills the gaps in pesticide exposure assessments and bmp applications unlike the existing academic tools for pesticide removal this web based modeling tool can be a useful and appropriate tool for managing farms among regular agricultural practitioners by furthering our work in the development of the calbmp advisory interface such as upscaling the evaluation to the watershed basin level by integrating gis techniques more users will gain access to informative outputs this will comprehensively assist them in making decisions regarding their bmp implementation in order to achieve good removal

9146,the joint application of plastic mulch and interplanted patterns significantly increases the utilization efficiencies of water and energy in arid regions each individual crop transpiration

source evapotranspiration model swim was proposed to accurately estimate λet and its components in partially mulched interplanted croplands based on shuttleworth wallace model sw in swim the effect of partial plastic mulch was accounted for by introducing f m and mulched soil resistance r s m while the effect of intercepted energy distribution between the intercropped plants was considered by integrating a light interception sub model the performance of the swim model was evaluated against measurements from two partially mulched intercropped seed maize field under border irrigation bm and drip irrigation dm during different growth periods the results showed that 1 the swim model accurately estimated λet and its components and outperformed the sw model during the entire growing season especially significantly improved these items estimations during the sparse canopy growth period with reduced nrmse of 0 18 and 0 33 0 25 and 0 20 0 26 and 0 49 for λet λt rc and λe s of bm and dm

evapotranspiration and its components soil evaporation and plant transpiration link carbon exchange with water and energy distribution djaman et al 2015 cui et al 2021 and are crucial processes within the soil plant atmosphere continuum for coupling hydropedological processes and plant functioning climate feedbacks and water resources management katul et al 2012 fisher et al 2017 cui et al 2021 plastic mulch and interplanting patterns are as the two most important agricultural tillage management measures zhang et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 crusciol et al 2021 chen et al 2022 simultaneous application of plastic mulch and interplanting can achieve higher utilization efficiency of soil moisture and radiation energy and has already become a typical surface characteristic in the arid regions of china jiang et al 2019 qin et al 2019 chen et al 2022 plastic mulch can preserve soil moisture enhance crop growth and increase yield hou et al 2010 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 it has been shown to significantly decrease soil evaporation by increasing the soil surface resistance villagarcía et al 2007 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 however it can not completely suppress soil evaporation since water vapor from highly humid mulched soil can still evaporate from planting holes wu et al 2017 qin et al 2018 although the mulched soil evaporation rate is usually smaller than the bare soil evaporation rate the total amounts of mulched soil evaporation is notable since the mulched soil area usually accounting for most part of ground surface qin et al 2018 and the ratios of mulched soil evaporation λe sms to bare soil evaporation λe sbs could be as much as 46 63 under conditions of higher plastic mulch cover fraction and higher soil moisture in mulched soil thus for partially mulched croplands both λe sbs and λe sms should be accounted for the field soil evaporation λe s interplanted pattern involves the simultaneous cultivation of two or more plant species in the same field and is used in agronomic production worldwide because it increases land use efficiency crusciol et al 2021 chen et al 2022 yield of the interplanted component crops huang et al 2015 and solar radiation use efficiency awal et al 2006 chen et al 2022 accordingly for partial mulched interplanted croplands in arid regions the field evapotranspiration λet is mainly composed of transpiration λt rc and its sub components individual plant transpiration λt rci and soil evaporation λe s and its sub components λe sbs and λe sms accurately quantifying λet and its components is critical to understand water and energy transfer processes in the soil mulch plant atmosphere continuum and manage agricultural water resources in arid regions dual source λet models separate λet into evaporation from all surfaces and transpiration through plants kool et al 2014 they can be divided into an empirical model e g a dual source crop coefficient model fao dual kc allen et al 1998 and a physical process based model e g the shuttleworth wallace model sw shuttleworth and wallace 1985 therein fao dual kc model is a simple and indirect calculation method as it is using the crop coefficient multiplied by reference crop evapotranspiration allen et al 2005 quantities studies have been steadily conducted to update the values of various crop coefficients such as k c and k cb and preciously tabulated in fao56 pereira et al 2021 pereira et al 2021 pereira et al 2021 rallo et al 2021 thus transferability of these data can be assumed under similar conditions with well designed and performed field experiments nevertheless these is a great variability of reported k c and k cb for the same crop due to differences in irrigation management rainfall amounts and timings field methods and so on rallo et al 2021 the sw model was developed based on the penman monteith pm model monteith 1965 divides the ground surface into the soil layer and the vegetation layer and introduced five resistance parameters to describe the turbulent diffusion processes of water vapor arising from the soil layer and the vegetation layer to a reference height in order to separately account for vegetation and substrate contributions to evapotranspiration shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the model has been extensively tested for various underlying surfaces sauer et al 2007 gong et al 2019 cui et al 2021 chen et al 2022 and the model has produced good results in homogeneous canopies since vegetation canopy development has dynamic effects on light interception turbulent transfer and wind profiles shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and therefore has an important impact on the performance of physical process based models the sw model showed higher accuracy in estimating et during dense canopy period than sparse canopy period this is due to the fact that the model can more accurately simulate fractional light interception over uniform canopy gao et al 2013 li et al 2013 however the model performance has been unsatisfactory for surface covered by plastic mulch or with mixed canopies as the plastic mulch cover and mixed canopies increase the heterogeneity of water and energy distribution over the underlying surfaces li et al 2013 qin et al 2018 because of the spatial heterogeneity of soil characteristics accounting for the different physical properties of bare soil and mulched soil is important for accurate estimation of λet flux and its components wang et al 2019 to consider the effect of plastic mulch on soil evaporation li et al 2013 introduced a film mulch fraction f m into the sw model and ignored soil evaporation under plastic mulch their results indicated that the modified sw model can more accurately estimate λet but the error in λe s estimation remains noticeable qin et al 2018 calibrated the modified sw model using measured λe sms from a partial mulched irrigated maize field and demonstrated that considering λe sms can improve the sw model performance in estimating soil evaporation to consider radiation interception by the individual neighboring plants in mixed canopy ecosystems a light interception sub model evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring species erin based on the knowledge of canopy height leaf area and extinction coefficient of each constituent was implemented in the sw model to estimate the transpiration from each component of a multi species mixture subsequently erin has been extensively applied to intercropped ecosystems with pronounced differences in canopy morphological characteristics to describe intercropped individual plant intercepted radiation gao et al 2013 chen et al 2022 gao et al 2013 applied the erin model to estimate transpiration in a maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merrill intercropping system and reported good agreement between observed and estimated values however few studies can practically simultaneously consider the effects of both partial plastic mulch cover and radiation interception by neighboring species and there is no such a model that can accurately estimate the individual crop transpiration the mulched soil evaporation and the bare soil evaporation chen et al 2022 proposed a modified erin model to estimate et and soil evaporation variations for a corn tomato solanum lycopersicum l intercropped ecosystem under plastic mulch cover and demonstrated better performance in estimating et and soil evaporation variations compared with erin model however simply ignoring the mulched soil evaporation did not produce results that aligned with observations and the formula is limited to two interplanted crop species on the whole in a multi source λet model for a partially mulched intercropped ecosystem latent heat needs to be accurately divided into λt rci λe sbs and λe sms therefore further work is required regarding the comprehensive impacts of both plastic mulch and intercropped plant canopies on energy transfer and distribution under partially mulched intercropped conditions thus the main objectives of the present study were to 1 develop a model to simulate the effects of plastic mulch and interplanting on evapotranspiration and its components by modifying the shuttleworth wallace model and 2 evaluate the performance of the model in estimating evapotranspiration and its components during different growth periods 2 models 2 1

although plastic mulch greatly increases the soil surface resistance and suppresses mulched soil surface evaporation water vapor from the mulched soil can still evaporate into the atmosphere through the planting holes wu et al 2017 in addition the plastic mulch significantly alters soil surface albedo and changes the energy distribution in the underlying surface previous studies have indicated that for intercropped croplands the morphological characteristics of the mixed canopy will influence canopy resistance energy distribution and evapotranspiration partitioning wallace 1997 jiang et al 2016 thus for mulched irrigated interplanted cropland attentions should be given to the effects of plastic mulch and the interplanted canopy when considering energy distribution or evapotranspiration partitioning to simplify the energy transfer process in mulched cropland the following two assumptions have been made 1 energy storage in the plant and the plastic mulch can be neglected 2 thermal convection of the vapor condensing and evaporating between the plastic mulch and the soil surface can be neglected with the effects of plastic mulch and the mixed canopy taken into consideration the swim model for a partially mulched intercropped cropland surface can be described as follows the total λet of the irrigated mulched mixed canopy field is the sum of individual plant λt rci λe sbs and λe sms contributions of individual plant λt rci to the field total plant λt rc depend on its canopy energy interception partitioning factor i ci that is a function of both leaf area index l t and canopy height h c the contributions of λe sms and λe sbs to the field soil evaporation depend on the ratio of each area to the total field area i e the film mulching fraction f m and 1 f m

et al 2013 the model is run with a change in the value of one input parameter at a time first a 30 increase and then a 30 decrease from the original value li et al 2013 only one parameter of the model

continuous field measurements were made during the period of april to september from 2014 to 2016 at china agricultural university shiyanghe agricultural and ecological water saving experimental station 37 52 n 102 50 e 1581 m asl in northwest china the experimental site is located in a typical continental temperate climate zone having a mean annual sunshine duration over 3000 h and a mean annual temperature of 8 8 the region is limited in water resources with mean annual precipitation of 164 mm and mean annual pan evaporation of about 2000 mm the groundwater table at the station is 40 50 m below the ground surface qin et al 2019 transparent plastic mulch is widely used for maize cultivation in this region the seed maize cultivar funong 963 is widely grown in this region and was used in this study seed maize planting generally adopt interplanting patterns which differs from common field maize it is cross fertilized by female and male plants for seed maize female and male plants differ in canopy morphological characteristics and thus transpiration differs between female and male plants jiang et al 2019 qin et al 2019 during planting female plants and male plants are planted between lines strictly according to a planting ratio n i the ratio of male to female plant numbers and female plants are seeded 7 14 d earlier than male plants to guarantee favorable fertilization conditions male plants are removed after pollination has occurred to save water and fertilizer resources consequently the female plant and the male plant have different characteristics such as leaf area index and canopy height and the transpiration for female λt rcf and male plants λt rcm demonstrate different seasonal dynamics qin et al 2019 therefore two typical partially mulched intercropped croplands that are extensively found throughout the local region were selected for this study a border irrigated mulched seed maize field bm and a drip irrigated mulched seed maize field dm both sites were covered with transparent plastic mulch that was laid out from east to west with a width of 1 2 m separated by bare soil with a width of 0 4 m thus the mulching fraction mulched soil area to total soil surface area was approximately 0 75 qin et al 2019 before sowing six soil samples were collected by cutting rings with volume of 100 cm3 for each layer in the 0 100 cm soil depth at 20 cm intervals w cr g in both sites the field capacity of the undisturbed soil samples was measured in intact soil cores following chen 2005 to determine field capacity soil samples were saturated with water from the bottom by placing them in distilled water until the water surface reached the top edge of the cutting ring the weight of water drained by gravity from the saturated samples was measured by placing soil core cylinders on a dry sand layer for five days w5d g finally the weight of the cutting ring containing dry soil was measured after oven drying the soil at 105 for 48 h wcrds g field capacity was calculated as θ f w 5d w crds w crds w cr 100 the method also has been applied in zhu et al 2018 chen et al 2022 the irrigation planting and other tillage activities were strictly followed the local practical agricultural management specifically site bm had an area of 400 m 200 m during 2014 2016 the planting densities were 97 500 plants ha 1 108 000 plants ha 1 and 116 176

respectively from 2014 to 2016 qin et al 2019 site dm had an area of 2000 m 1000 m during 2014 2015 and 400 m 200 m in 2016 the overall planting densities for the three respective years of the study were 112 500 plants ha 1 112 500 plants ha 1 and109 474 plants ha 1 and the n i ratios were 1 7 1 7 and 1 6 respectively during 2014 2016 the soil texture in the 0 0 8 m layer was silty loam and silt

and 427 mm respectively from 2014 to 2016 qin et al 2019 3 2 in situ measurements 3 2 1 measurements of evapotranspiration plant transpiration soil evaporation and meteorological variables each site had an eddy covariance ec system to monitor field evapotranspiration and meteorological variables a thermal balance sap flow sf system to monitor specific interplanted crop transpiration and a series

monitor air temperature and vapor pressure deficit a series of soil moisture meters model cs616 to monitor mulched soil moisture and a series of soil temperature meters model 109 l the sonic anemometer thermometer the co2 h2o open path gas analyzer the surface temperature meter and the hydro thermograph meter were installed at 4 0 m above the ground level during 2014 2015 and at 3 5 m in 2016 the radiation meter was installed approximately 4 0 m above the ground level during 2014 2016 the series of soil moisture meters were installed under plastic mulch covered soil surface and distributed every 0 2 m in 0 1 0 m soil depth during 2014 2016 the series of soil temperature meters were installed distributed every 0 2 m in the 0 0 8 m soil layer during 2014 2016 the soil heat flux plates were installed in the mulched soil surface and in the bare soil surface at 5 cm below the ground surface all of the sensors were connected to a data logger with a sampling interval of 30 min qin et al 2019 the ec systems were located in fields of about 1 0 km2 surrounded by seed maize grown under the same treatment the source areas of the heat flux footprint for these ec measurements were less than 300 m li et al 2013 the thermal balance sap flow system model flow32 1k system dynamax houston tx usa has proved to be an effective method to measure maize transpiration ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 qin et al 2019 and has been applied in both bm and dm sites each thermal balance system was comprised of eight probes each probe was installed on a maize stem at 20 cm above the ground on five female plants and three male plants all of the probes in each treatment were connected to a cr1000 data logger with a sampling frequency of 10 hz and a sampling interval of 30 min the micro lysimeters were installed under the mulch and in the bare soil area with six replicates at each experimental site daily soil evaporation for each micro lysimeter was obtained as the difference between the weights measured by an electronic scale mettler toledo pl6001 l usa with an accuracy of 0 1 g at 19 00 every day qin et al 2018 3 2 2 ancillary measurements crop parameters such as leaf area index l t and canopy height h c were also measured in this study from two weeks after planting thirty plants in each experimental site were randomly selected to measure leaf length maximum width and canopy height at intervals of 7 10 days during the entire growing season leaf area l a was calculated by summing the rectangular area leaf length maximum width of each completely developed leaf multiplied by a factor of 0 74 li et al 2008 l t is defined as the ratio of leaf area to land area both l t and canopy height h c for the bm and dm maize fields were measured every seven days and interpolated using the cubic spline interpolation method to get daily values the mulched soil moisture and bare soil moisture were also simultaneously measured by oven drying method every seven days the soil moisture sensors measured mulched soil moistures were then calibrated using measurements with oven drying method and the bare soil moiture was interploted to day values using cubic spline interpolation method the mulched soil moisture and bare soil moisture applied in this study were from qin et al 2018 and qin et al 2019 3 3 data processing to reduce the effect of rainfall irrigation and strong advection a subset of the data deemed reliable was obtained by removing observations on days having those conditions song et al 2016 wen et al 2016 qin et al 2019 cui et al 2021 raw data acquired at 10 hz from the ec systems were postprocessed using eddy pro 4 0 software for quality control that included 1 detection and elimination of raw peaks 2 double coordinate rotation finnigan et al 2003 3 frequency loss correction and 4 air density correction webb et al 1980 paw et al 2000 data for which the footprint extended beyond the experimental area were deleted missing data were interpolated using the linear method when the data gap was less than two hours while the mean diurnal variation method was used when the data gap was five or more hours falge et al 2001 after the above steps were completed the energy balance closure ratios were evaluated at both sites with relatively high energy balance closure ratios of 0 81 and 0 83 at the bm site and the dm site respectively the measured energy budget components were forced to close using the bowen ratio closure method proposed by twine et al 2000 that assumes that the bowen ratio is correctly measured by the ec system and the residual energy flux should be divided into latent heat flux and sensible heat flux based on the bowen ratio then the standard field evapotranspiration λetec is thought to have been obtained the sap flow rate q i j l d 1 monitored by the sf system was initially scaled to the field female plant transpiration λt rcf and field male plant transpiration λt rcm using the leaf area l ai

or female parent thus the field total transpiration λt rc sap was obtained by weighting λt rcf sap and λt rcm sap using the female plant planting ratio n f and male plant planting ratio n m 59 λ t rc s ap n f λ t rcf s ap n m λ t rcm s ap the field daily soil evaporation under mulch λe sms lys was the average of the daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed under the plastic mulch while the field soil evaporation under bare soil λe sbs lys was the average of the daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed in bare soil finally the total field daily soil evaporation λe s lys at each experiment site was calculated by the sum of λe sms lys and λe sbs lys with the weighting factor f m qin et al 2019 60 λ e s l ys λ e sms l ys f m λ e sbs l ys 1 f m 4 results and discussion measurements of λetec λt rc and its sub components λt rcf and λt rcm and λe s and its sub components λe ms and λe bs from both bm and dm sites were used to validate the accuracy of the swim model proposed in this study therein to evaluate the model performance in terms of common abilities of the swim model and original sw model the comparisons of model performances in estimating λet λt rc and λe s have been made then the specific abilities of swim model in estimating sub components of field transpiration and soil evaporation have been evaluated 4 1 sensitivity analysis in order to better understand the model performance a sensitivity analysis was conducted though there are many input variables for the sw model and swim model most of them can be determined by measurements with only five resistances r a a r a c r a s r s s and r s c involved in the sw model and six resistances r a a r a c r a s r s s r s c and r s m involved in the swim model estimated therefore this study only focused on the sensitivity of models with respect to these resistance parameters table 1 both the swim and sw model were most sensitive to r s c and second most sensitive to r a a in estimating λt rc however both resistance parameters showed contrasting variations as canopy developed as sensitivity of λt rc to r s c decreased and sensitivity to r a a increased the sensitivities of sub components of λt rc λt rcf and λt rcm to r s c and r a a were the same because canopy energy interception was the only difference in estimating λt rcf and λt rcm in the swim model this was attributed to a direct correlation of r s c and r a a to canopy in croplands similar findings were also demonstrated in li et al 2013 chen et al 2022 for λe s estimation both models were sensitive to r s s and r a s its sensitivity to r s s was relatively stable with crop growth while its sensitivity to r a s demonstrated a significant increase as canopy developed besides swim model was also sensitive to r s m in estimating λe s as it plays an important role in estimating λe sms for the sub components of λe s λe sbs and λe sms estimation in swim λe sbs was sensitive to r s s r a s and r s c which was similarly to λe s sensitivity observed with the sw model λe sms was most steadily sensitive to r s m and second most sensitive to r s c and the sensitivity increased as canopy density increased overall both models were sensitive to r s c and r s s in estimating λet and the sensitivity to r s c increased while the sensitivity to r s s decreased as canopy developed the results were in lines with previous studies when applied modified sw model in estimating maize field evapotranspiration and its components li et al 2013 qin et al 2018 4 2 evaluation of model performance in estimating λet λtrc and λes model performance in terms of λet λt rc and λe s was compared between the sw model and the swim model at both the bm and dm sites in general both swim and sw models captured the seasonal dynamics of λet λt rc and λe s figs 2 4 comparisons of model performance during different growth stages in both bm and dm sites were shown in table 2 over the entire growing season the swim model exhibited higher accuracy and better agreement with the measured λet λt rc and λe s compared with the sw model table 2 for λet estimation compared with the sw model the swim model decreased rmse by 29 15 w m 2 and 28 28 w m 2 over the entire growing season at the bm and dm sites respectively decreased nrmse by 0 09 and 0 07 and increased r2 by 0 23 and 0 16 respectively for λt rc estimation the swim model decreased rmse by 23 02 w m 2 and 4 66 w m 2 at the bm and dm sites respectively decreased nrmse by 0 02 and 0 03 and increased r2 by 0 23 and 0 03 respectively for λe s estimation compared with the sw model the swim model decreased rmse by 39 73 w m 2 and 46 31 w m 2 at the bm and dm sites respectively decreased nrmse by 0 11 and 0 21 and increased r2 by 0 33 and 0 21 respectively a closer examination of the results reveal that the better performance of the swim model was most noticeable during the growing period with sparse canopy table 1 during the period of sparse canopy the swim model decreased nrmse values by 0 18 and 0 33 for λet in the bm and dm sites respectively by 0 25 and 0 20 for λt rc and by 0 26 and 0 49 for λe s respectively however during the dense canopy growth period the swim model decreased nrmse by only 0 10 and 0 06 for λet respectively by 0 02 and 0 03 for λt rc and by 0 01 and 0 16 for λe s respectively during the sparse canopy period the mixed canopy heterogeneity was significant due to the large differences in physical characteristics of the intercropped canopies and a model that assumes uniform distribution of energy in intercropped canopies will inevitably result in large errors the swim model considers the effects of neighboring species and surface heterogeneity on energy distribution and incorporated the strengths of the erin model in that it estimates neighboring species separately therefore it can more accurately characterizing the inhomogeneous energy distribution found in multi species canopies compared with the sw model wallace 1997 chen et al 2022 light competition among different crops in intercropped situations is likely the primary competition for aboveground resources bedoussac et al 2015 yin et al 2020 yuan et al 2022 and accurate energy partitioning between the intercropped crops is essential for estimating field transpiration in interplanted croplands additionally slight differences between estimated λet and measurements during the late crop growth period have been detected table 1 these differences may be due to uncertainty in specifying the canopy resistance because of the effects of canopy space overlap and not accurately accounting for effects of different canopy growth on λet jiang et al 2016 4 3 performance of the swim model in estimating individual intercropped crop transpiration female and male maize plants have different growth periods as mentioned in section 3 and therefore both species have different plant transpiration rates during the entire growing season fig 5 because the swim model considers the effects of intercropping it is able to further estimate individual crop transpiration rates e g female plant transpiration λt rcf and male plant transpiration λt rcm in the field fig 5 and table 3 show that the swim model has good estimation accuracy and agreement in estimating individual intercropped plant transpiration with averaged rmse during the entire growth period of 23 94 w m 2 and 20 95 w m 2 for λt rcf for bm and dm respectively nrmse of 0 13 and 0 11 r 2 of 0 81 and 0 88 and both slope of 0 97 respectively similar results were obtained for λt rcm see table 3 besides slightly better performance for the swim model in estimating individual intercropped plant transpiration was obtained during the dense canopy period than the sparse period during the dense canopy period nrmse were lower by 0 11 and 0 09 for λt rcf for bm and dm respectively and by 0 12 and 0 11 for λt rcm respectively the sw model was proposed based on the pm model that assumes that the crop canopy is uniformly distributed shuttleworth and wallace 1985 this assumption may limit the sw model s applicability such that it is not applicable to underlying surfaces composed of mixed canopies jiang et al 2019 both the sw model and the swim model estimated field transpiration more accurately during the dense canopy growth period than the sparse period table 3 and this is in line with previously reported performance of the sw model or its modified versions in estimating field transpiration li et al 2013 gong et al 2019 chen et al 2022 two reasons may explain this the first reason is that the crop canopy during the dense period is relatively uniform and fractional light interception for intercropped crops is better estimated li et al 2013 chen et al 2022 the second reason is that the sw model calculates λet by using surface resistances to regulate heat and mass transfer from plant and soil surfaces and by using aerodynamic resistances to regulate fluxes to the atmosphere octavio lagos et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 and the canopy surface resistance and the aerodynamic resistance estimated under uniform canopy conditions will be closer to the actual observations li et al 2013 4 4 performance of the swim model in estimating soil evaporation sub components in partially mulched croplands both λe sbs and λe sms are important components of λe s the swim model estimates these soil evaporation sub components by introducing the film mulching ratio and mulched soil resistance into the model over the entire growing season the swim model captured the seasonal dynamics of λe sbs and λe sms fig 6 with rmse of 33 77 w m 2 and 22 82 w m 2 for λe sbs for bm and dm respectively nrmse of 0 20 and 0 15 r 2 of 0 43 and 0 59 and slope of 1 00 and 0 96 respectively and with rmse of 7 02 w m 2 and 3 84 w m 2 for λe sms for bm and dm respectively nrmse of 0 21 and 0 18 r 2 of 0 24 and 0 50 and both slope of 0 94 respectively these results indicate that the model can accurately estimate of bare soil evaporation and mulched soil evaporation the swim model showed better performance in estimating soil evaporation sub components λe sbs and λe sms during the spare canopy period than dense period average nrmse values during the sparse canopy period were 0 04 and 0 02 smaller for λe sbs and 0 02 and 0 05 smaller for λe sms than during the dense period for bm and dm sites respectively table 3 this is different from the model performance for estimating plant transpiration compared with model performance in λe sms estimation the swim model has better performance in estimating λe sbs during entire growth period especially during the sparse canopy period during the sparse growth period nrmse for λe sbs were lower by 0 06 and 0 04 for bm and dm sites respectively while during the dense period these values were only lower by 0 01 for both bm and dm sites respectively and the difference in model performance between λe sbs and λe sms decreased as canopy developed the reasons are attributable to the fact that the plastic mulch suppressed the turbulence transfer above the soil surface which induced the underestimation of soil surface aerodynamic resistance and further resulted in overestimation of λe sms the dual effect of both plastic mulch and the dense canopy increased the uncertainty of λe sms estimation as the canopy developed both the sw and swim models provided better λe s estimates during the sparse canopy period than the dense period tables 2 and 3 the reasons mainly lie in the estimation of the soil surface aerodynamic resistance during the sparse canopy period plants were smaller and had lower canopy coverage therefore the effect of canopy on the wind profile could be ignored and the wind speed over the ground surface can be approximated by the logarithmic profile resulting in accurate estimates of the soil surface aerodynamic resistance in contrast during the dense canopy growth period the greater canopy coverage significantly influenced the wind profiles above the ground and caused large differences between the actual and estimated wind speed at the ground higher values of estimated wind speed over the ground surface produced an underestimation of soil surface aerodynamic resistance resulting in overestimation of λe s another possible reason for overestimation in soil evaporation is estimation of the soil surface resistance studies have shown that the sw model overestimated soil evaporation due to underestimation of the soil surface resistance zhang et al 2008 hu et al 2009 bao et al 2021 soil evaporation was significantly reduced by mulch as reported in previous studies villagarcía et al 2007 qin et al 2018 wang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 however some evaporation can still occur from the mulched soil surfaces because some water vapor beneath the plastic mulch can escape from the planting holes wu et al 2017 qin et al 2018 λesms could account for as much as 46 63 of λesbs under the conditions of high mulch ratio and high soil moisture qin et al 2018 the accuracy of the sw model was lower because the hinder effect of the plastic mulch on the latent heat flux was neglected in the model chen et al 2022 considering the effect of a partial mulch on the ground surface significantly improved the accuracy of the multi source swim model in estimating soil evaporation in both the sparse and dense canopy periods similar results have been reported in previous studies li et al 2013 tian et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study a multi source model swim that considered the effect of intercropping and partial plastic mulch cover was proposed based on the sw model to estimate field λet λt rc and its sub components λt rci λe s and its sub components λe sbs and λe sms in the partially mulched interplanted croplands the performance of the model was evaluated with measurements from eddy covariance systems sap flux systems and micro lysimeters from two partial mulched intercropped seed maize experiment sites e g bm site and dm sites the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed swim model well captured the dynamics of λet and its components and outperformed the sw model in estimating field λet λt rc and λe s during the entire growing season especially significantly improved λet λt rc and λe s estimations during the sparse canopy growth period 2 considering the effect of light interception between intercropped crop species in the swim model enabled us to obtain accurate individual λt rci e g λt rcf and λt rcm and good model performance was demonstrated for estimating transpiration during the dense canopy growth period 3 λe sms in a cropland with higher mulched soil moisture and higher film mulching ratio cannot simply be ignored taking effect of plastic mulch into consideration by introducing a mulched soil surface resistance and a film mulching ratio in the swim model enabled us to accurately obtain partially mulched field soil evaporation and its components swim model had better performance in estimating both λe sbs and λe sms during the sparse canopy growth period than during the dense canopy growth period and especially better estimated λe sbs than λe sms during the sparse canopy growth period understanding variations in partially mulched cropland evapotranspiration and its components helps provide more accurate estimation of underlying surface energy distribution over the soil mulch plant atmosphere system the results

9146,the joint application of plastic mulch and interplanted patterns significantly increases the utilization efficiencies of water and energy in arid regions each individual crop transpiration directly related with agricultural production soil evaporation under transparent plastic mulch is decreased but can not be ignored especially under the condition with higher soil moisture and large

its sub components bare soil evaporation λe sbs and mulched soil evaporation λe sms for partial mulched interplanted croplands is essential for water resources management in this study a multiple source evapotranspiration model swim was proposed to accurately estimate λet and its components in partially mulched interplanted croplands based on shuttleworth wallace model sw in swim the effect of partial plastic mulch was accounted for by introducing f m and mulched soil resistance r s m while the effect of intercepted energy distribution between the intercropped plants was considered by integrating a light interception sub model the performance of the swim model was evaluated against measurements from two partially mulched intercropped seed maize field under border irrigation bm and drip irrigation dm during different growth periods the results showed that 1 the swim model accurately estimated λet and its components and outperformed the sw model during the entire growing season especially significantly improved these items estimations during the sparse canopy growth period with reduced nrmse of 0 18 and 0 33 0 25 and 0 20 0 26 and 0 49 for λet λt rc and λe s of bm and dm

evapotranspiration and its components soil evaporation and plant transpiration link carbon exchange with water and energy distribution djaman et al 2015 cui et al 2021 and are crucial processes within the soil plant atmosphere continuum for coupling hydropedological processes and plant functioning climate feedbacks and water resources management katul et al 2012 fisher et al 2017 cui et al 2021 plastic mulch and interplanting patterns are as the two most important agricultural tillage management measures zhang et al 2018 xiong et al 2019 crusciol et al 2021 chen et al 2022 simultaneous application of plastic mulch and interplanting can achieve higher utilization efficiency of soil moisture and radiation energy and has already become a typical surface characteristic in the arid regions of china jiang et al 2019 qin et al 2019 chen et al 2022 plastic mulch can preserve soil moisture enhance crop growth and increase yield hou et al 2010 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 it has been shown to significantly decrease soil evaporation by increasing the soil surface resistance villagarcía et al 2007 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 however it can not completely suppress soil evaporation since water vapor from highly humid mulched soil can still evaporate from planting holes wu et al 2017 qin et al 2018 although the mulched soil evaporation rate is usually smaller than the bare soil evaporation rate the total amounts of mulched soil evaporation is notable since the mulched soil area usually accounting for most part of ground surface qin et al 2018 and the ratios of mulched soil evaporation λe sms to bare soil evaporation λe sbs could be as much as 46 63 under conditions of higher plastic mulch cover fraction and higher soil moisture in mulched soil thus for partially mulched croplands both λe sbs and λe sms should be accounted for the field soil evaporation λe s interplanted pattern involves the simultaneous cultivation of two or more plant species in the same field and is used in agronomic production worldwide because it increases land use efficiency crusciol et al 2021 chen et al 2022 yield of the interplanted component crops huang et al 2015 and solar radiation use efficiency awal et al 2006 chen et al 2022 accordingly for partial mulched interplanted croplands in arid regions the field evapotranspiration λet is mainly composed of transpiration λt rc and its sub components individual plant transpiration λt rci and soil evaporation λe s and its sub components λe sbs and λe sms accurately quantifying λet and its components is critical to understand water and energy transfer processes in the soil mulch plant atmosphere continuum and manage agricultural water resources in arid regions dual source λet models separate λet into evaporation from all surfaces and transpiration through plants kool et al 2014 they can be divided into an empirical model e g a dual source crop coefficient model fao dual kc allen et al 1998 and a physical process based model e g the shuttleworth wallace model sw shuttleworth and wallace 1985 therein fao dual kc model is a simple and indirect calculation method as it is using the crop coefficient multiplied by reference crop evapotranspiration allen et al 2005 quantities studies have been steadily conducted to update the values of various crop coefficients such as k c and k cb and preciously tabulated in fao56 pereira et al 2021 pereira et al 2021 pereira et al 2021 rallo et al 2021 thus transferability of these data can be assumed under similar conditions with well designed and performed field experiments nevertheless these is a great variability of reported k c and k cb for the same crop due to differences in irrigation management rainfall amounts and timings field methods and so on rallo et al 2021 the sw model was developed based on the penman monteith pm model monteith 1965 divides the ground surface into the soil layer and the vegetation layer and introduced five resistance parameters to describe the turbulent diffusion processes of water vapor arising from the soil layer and the vegetation layer to a reference height in order to separately account for vegetation and substrate contributions to evapotranspiration shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the model has been extensively tested for various underlying surfaces sauer et al 2007 gong et al 2019 cui et al 2021 chen et al 2022 and the model has produced good results in homogeneous canopies since vegetation canopy development has dynamic effects on light interception turbulent transfer and wind profiles shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and therefore has an important impact on the performance of physical process based models the sw model showed higher accuracy in estimating et during dense canopy period than sparse canopy period this is due to the fact that the model can more accurately simulate fractional light interception over uniform canopy gao et al 2013 li et al 2013 however the model performance has been unsatisfactory for surface covered by plastic mulch or with mixed canopies as the plastic mulch cover and mixed canopies increase the heterogeneity of water and energy distribution over the underlying surfaces li et al 2013 qin et al 2018 because of the spatial heterogeneity of soil characteristics accounting for the different physical properties of bare soil and mulched soil is important for accurate estimation of λet flux and its components wang et al 2019 to consider the effect of plastic mulch on soil evaporation li et al 2013 introduced a film mulch fraction f m into the sw model and ignored soil evaporation under plastic mulch their results indicated that the modified sw model can more accurately estimate λet but the error in λe s estimation remains noticeable qin et al 2018 calibrated the modified sw model using measured λe sms from a partial mulched irrigated maize field and demonstrated that considering λe sms can improve the sw model performance in estimating soil evaporation to consider radiation interception by the individual neighboring plants in mixed canopy ecosystems a light interception sub model evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring species erin based on the knowledge of canopy height leaf area and extinction coefficient of each constituent was implemented in the sw model to estimate the transpiration from each component of a multi species mixture subsequently erin has been extensively applied to intercropped ecosystems with pronounced differences in canopy morphological characteristics to describe intercropped individual plant intercepted radiation gao et al 2013 chen et al 2022 gao et al 2013 applied the erin model to estimate transpiration in a maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merrill intercropping system and reported good agreement between observed and estimated values however few studies can practically simultaneously consider the effects of both partial plastic mulch cover and radiation interception by neighboring species and there is no such a model that can accurately estimate the individual crop transpiration the mulched soil evaporation and the bare soil evaporation chen et al 2022 proposed a modified erin model to estimate et and soil evaporation variations for a corn tomato solanum lycopersicum l intercropped ecosystem under plastic mulch cover and demonstrated better performance in estimating et and soil evaporation variations compared with erin model however simply ignoring the mulched soil evaporation did not produce results that aligned with observations and the formula is limited to two interplanted crop species on the whole in a multi source λet model for a partially mulched intercropped ecosystem latent heat needs to be accurately divided into λt rci λe sbs and λe sms therefore further work is required regarding the comprehensive impacts of both plastic mulch and intercropped plant canopies on energy transfer and distribution under partially mulched intercropped conditions thus the main objectives of the present study were to 1 develop a model to simulate the effects of plastic mulch and interplanting on evapotranspiration and its components by modifying the shuttleworth wallace model and 2 evaluate the performance of the model in estimating evapotranspiration and its components during different growth periods 2 models 2 1

although plastic mulch greatly increases the soil surface resistance and suppresses mulched soil surface evaporation water vapor from the mulched soil can still evaporate into the atmosphere through the planting holes wu et al 2017 in addition the plastic mulch significantly alters soil surface albedo and changes the energy distribution in the underlying surface previous studies have indicated that for intercropped croplands the morphological characteristics of the mixed canopy will influence canopy resistance energy distribution and evapotranspiration partitioning wallace 1997 jiang et al 2016 thus for mulched irrigated interplanted cropland attentions should be given to the effects of plastic mulch and the interplanted canopy when considering energy distribution or evapotranspiration partitioning to simplify the energy transfer process in mulched cropland the following two assumptions have been made 1 energy storage in the plant and the plastic mulch can be neglected 2 thermal convection of the vapor condensing and evaporating between the plastic mulch and the soil surface can be neglected with the effects of plastic mulch and the mixed canopy taken into consideration the swim model for a partially mulched intercropped cropland surface can be described as follows the total λet of the irrigated mulched mixed canopy field is the sum of individual plant λt rci λe sbs and λe sms contributions of individual plant λt rci to the field total plant λt rc depend on its canopy energy interception partitioning factor i ci that is a function of both leaf area index l t and canopy height h c the contributions of λe sms and λe sbs to the field soil evaporation depend on the ratio of each area to the total field area i e the film mulching fraction f m and 1 f m

of the model is shown in fig 1 b 2 3 model parameters 2 3 1 energy interception factor in the swim model the energy interception factor i ci is assumed to be identical to the light interception for

et al 2013 the model is run with a change in the value of one input parameter at a time first a 30 increase and then a 30 decrease from the original value li et al 2013 only one parameter of the model was changed while the other parameters remained fixed for every model run and the same process was repeated for all parameters to investigate the impact of the changes on the estimation on field latent heat and its components the relative sensitivity rs was used to express the sensitivity as wilkerson 1983 53 rs y x δ x y x y x δ x x 2 5 model evaluation metrics the performance of simulations

continuous field measurements were made during the period of april to september from 2014 to 2016 at china agricultural university shiyanghe agricultural and ecological water saving experimental station 37 52 n 102 50 e 1581 m asl in northwest china the experimental site is located in a typical continental temperate climate zone having a mean annual sunshine duration over 3000 h and a mean annual temperature of 8 8 the region is limited in water resources with mean annual precipitation of 164 mm and mean annual pan evaporation of about 2000 mm the groundwater table at the station is 40 50 m below the ground surface qin et al 2019 transparent plastic mulch is widely used for maize cultivation in this region the seed maize cultivar funong 963 is widely grown in this region and was used in this study seed maize planting generally adopt interplanting patterns which differs from common field maize it is cross fertilized by female and male plants for seed maize female and male plants differ in canopy morphological characteristics and thus transpiration differs between female and male plants jiang et al 2019 qin et al 2019 during planting female plants and male plants are planted between lines strictly according to a planting ratio n i the ratio of male to female plant numbers and female plants are seeded 7 14 d earlier than male plants to guarantee favorable fertilization conditions male plants are removed after pollination has occurred to save water and fertilizer resources consequently the female plant and the male plant have different characteristics such as leaf area index and canopy height and the transpiration for female λt rcf and male plants λt rcm demonstrate different seasonal dynamics qin et al 2019 therefore two typical partially mulched intercropped croplands that are extensively found throughout the local region were selected for this study a border irrigated mulched seed maize field bm and a drip irrigated mulched seed maize field dm both sites were covered with transparent plastic mulch that was laid out from east to west with a width of 1 2 m separated by bare soil with a width of 0 4 m thus the mulching fraction mulched soil area to total soil surface area was approximately 0 75 qin et al 2019 before sowing six soil samples were collected by cutting rings with volume of 100 cm3 for each layer in the 0 100 cm soil depth at 20 cm intervals w cr g in both sites the field capacity of the undisturbed soil samples was measured in intact soil cores following chen 2005 to determine field capacity soil samples were saturated with water from the bottom by placing them in distilled water until the water surface reached the top edge of the cutting ring the weight of water drained by gravity from the saturated samples was measured by placing soil core cylinders on a dry sand layer for five days w5d g finally the weight of the cutting ring containing dry soil was measured after oven drying the soil at 105 for 48 h wcrds g field capacity was calculated as θ f w 5d w crds w crds w cr 100 the method also has been applied in zhu et al 2018 chen et al 2022 the irrigation planting and other tillage activities were strictly followed the local practical agricultural management specifically site bm had an area of 400 m 200 m during 2014 2016 the planting densities were 97 500 plants ha 1 108 000 plants ha 1 and 116 176

respectively from 2014 to 2016 qin et al 2019 site dm had an area of 2000 m 1000 m during 2014 2015 and 400 m 200 m in 2016 the overall planting densities for the three respective years of the study were 112 500 plants ha 1 112 500 plants ha 1 and109 474 plants ha 1 and the n i ratios were 1 7 1 7 and 1 6 respectively during 2014 2016 the soil texture in the 0 0 8 m layer was silty loam and silt in the 0 8 1 0 m layer with an average dry bulk density of 1 46 g cm 3 the volumetric soil water content for the 0 1 m layer at θ fc was 0 29 cm3 cm 3 the total irrigation amounts were 350 mm 400 mm and 427 mm respectively from 2014 to 2016 qin et al 2019 3 2 in situ measurements 3 2 1 measurements of evapotranspiration plant transpiration soil evaporation and meteorological variables each site had an eddy covariance ec system to monitor field evapotranspiration and meteorological variables a thermal balance sap flow sf system to monitor specific interplanted crop transpiration and a series

monitor air temperature and vapor pressure deficit a series of soil moisture meters model cs616 to monitor mulched soil moisture and a series of soil temperature meters model 109 l the sonic anemometer thermometer the co2 h2o open path gas analyzer the surface temperature meter and the hydro thermograph meter were installed at 4 0 m above the ground level during 2014 2015 and at 3 5 m in 2016 the radiation meter was installed approximately 4 0 m above the ground level during 2014 2016 the series of soil moisture meters were installed under plastic mulch covered soil surface and distributed every 0 2 m in 0 1 0 m soil depth during 2014 2016 the series of soil temperature meters were installed distributed every 0 2 m in the 0 0 8 m soil layer during 2014 2016 the soil heat flux plates were installed in the mulched soil surface and in the bare soil surface at 5 cm below the ground surface all of the sensors were connected to a data logger with a sampling interval of 30 min qin et al 2019 the ec systems were located in fields of about 1 0 km2 surrounded by seed maize grown under the same treatment the source areas of the heat flux footprint for these ec measurements were less than 300 m li et al 2013 the thermal balance sap flow system model flow32 1k system dynamax houston tx usa has proved to be an effective method to measure maize transpiration ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 qin et al 2019 and has been applied in both bm and dm sites each thermal balance system was comprised of eight probes each probe was installed on a maize stem at 20 cm above the ground on five female plants and three male plants all of the probes in each treatment were connected to a cr1000 data logger with a sampling frequency of 10 hz and a sampling interval of 30 min the micro lysimeters were installed under the mulch and in the bare soil area with six replicates at each experimental site daily soil evaporation for each micro lysimeter was obtained as the difference between the weights measured by an electronic scale mettler toledo pl6001 l usa with an accuracy of 0 1 g at 19 00 every day qin et al 2018 3 2 2 ancillary measurements crop parameters such as leaf area index l t and canopy height h c were also measured in this study from two weeks after planting thirty plants in each experimental site were randomly selected to measure leaf length maximum width and canopy height at intervals of 7 10 days during the entire growing season leaf area l a was calculated by summing the rectangular area leaf length maximum width of each completely developed leaf multiplied by a factor of 0 74 li et al 2008 l t is defined as the ratio of leaf area to land area both l t and canopy height h c for the bm and dm maize fields were measured every seven days and interpolated using the cubic spline interpolation method to get daily values the mulched soil moisture and bare soil moisture were also simultaneously measured by oven drying method every seven days the soil moisture sensors measured mulched soil moistures were then calibrated using measurements with oven drying method and the bare soil moiture was interploted to day values using cubic spline interpolation method the mulched soil moisture and bare soil moisture applied in this study were from qin et al 2018 and qin et al 2019 3 3 data processing to reduce the effect of rainfall irrigation and strong advection a subset of the data deemed reliable was obtained by removing observations on days having those conditions song et al 2016 wen et al 2016 qin et al 2019 cui et al 2021 raw data acquired at 10 hz from the ec systems were postprocessed using eddy pro 4 0 software for quality control that included 1 detection and elimination of raw peaks 2 double coordinate rotation finnigan et al 2003 3 frequency loss correction and 4 air density correction webb et al 1980 paw et al 2000 data for which the footprint extended beyond the experimental area were deleted missing data were interpolated using the linear method when the data gap was less than two hours while the mean diurnal variation method was used when the data gap was five or more hours falge et al 2001 after the above steps were completed the energy balance closure ratios were evaluated at both sites with relatively high energy balance closure ratios of 0 81 and 0 83 at the bm site and the dm site respectively the measured energy budget components were forced to close using the bowen ratio closure method proposed by twine et al 2000 that assumes that the bowen ratio is correctly measured by the ec system and the residual energy flux should be divided into latent heat flux and sensible heat flux based on the bowen ratio then the standard field evapotranspiration λetec is thought to have been obtained the sap flow rate q i j l d 1 monitored by the sf system was initially scaled to the field female plant transpiration λt rcf and field male plant transpiration λt rcm using the leaf area l ai j m2 of specific monitored plants and leaf area index l ti m2 m 2 jiang et al 2016 58 λ t rci s ap λ n s i n s i j 1 q i j l a i j l t i where n i is the number of sap flow measurements for the male or female parent thus the field total transpiration λt rc sap was obtained by weighting λt rcf sap and λt rcm sap using the female plant planting ratio n f and male plant planting ratio n m 59 λ t rc s ap n f λ t rcf s ap n m λ t rcm s ap the field daily soil evaporation under mulch λe sms lys was the average of the daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed under the plastic mulch while the field soil evaporation under bare soil λe sbs lys was the average of the daily soil evaporation at each micro lysimeter installed in bare soil finally the total field daily soil evaporation λe s lys at each experiment site was calculated by the sum of λe sms lys and λe sbs lys with the weighting factor f m qin et al 2019 60 λ e s l ys λ e sms l ys f m λ e sbs l ys 1 f m 4 results and discussion measurements of λetec λt rc and its sub components λt rcf and λt rcm and λe s and its sub components λe ms and λe bs from both bm and dm sites were used to validate the accuracy of the swim model proposed in this study therein to evaluate the model performance in terms of common abilities of the swim model and original sw model the comparisons of model performances in estimating λet λt rc and λe s have been made then the specific abilities of swim model in estimating sub components of field transpiration and soil evaporation have been evaluated 4 1 sensitivity analysis in order to better understand the model performance a sensitivity analysis was conducted though there are many input variables for the sw model and swim model most of them can be determined by measurements with only five resistances r a a r a c r a s r s s and r s c involved in the sw model and six resistances r a a r a c r a s r s s r s c and r s m involved in the swim model estimated therefore this study only focused on the sensitivity of models with respect to these resistance parameters table 1 both the swim and sw model were most sensitive to r s c and second most sensitive to r a a in estimating λt rc however both resistance parameters showed contrasting variations as canopy developed as sensitivity of λt rc to r s c decreased and sensitivity to r a a increased the sensitivities of sub components of λt rc λt rcf and λt rcm to r s c and r a a were the same because canopy energy interception was the only difference in estimating λt rcf and λt rcm in the swim model this was attributed to a direct correlation of r s c and r a a to canopy in croplands similar findings were also demonstrated in li et al 2013 chen et al 2022 for λe s estimation both models were sensitive to r s s and r a s its sensitivity to r s s was relatively stable with crop growth while its sensitivity to r a s demonstrated a significant increase as canopy developed besides swim model was also sensitive to r s m in estimating λe s as it plays an important role in estimating λe sms for the sub components of λe s λe sbs and λe sms estimation in swim λe sbs was sensitive to r s s r a s and r s c which was similarly to λe s sensitivity observed with the sw model λe sms was most steadily sensitive to r s m and second most sensitive to r s c and the sensitivity increased as canopy density increased overall both models were sensitive to r s c and r s s in estimating λet and the sensitivity to r s c increased while the sensitivity to r s s decreased as canopy developed the results were in lines with previous studies when applied modified sw model in estimating maize field evapotranspiration and its components li et al 2013 qin et al 2018 4 2 evaluation of model performance in estimating λet λtrc and λes model performance in terms of λet λt rc and λe s was compared between the sw model and the swim model at both the bm and dm sites in general both swim and sw models captured the seasonal dynamics of λet λt rc and λe s figs 2 4 comparisons of model performance during different growth stages in both bm and dm sites were shown in table 2 over the entire growing season the swim model exhibited higher accuracy and better agreement with the measured λet λt rc and λe s compared with the sw model table 2 for λet estimation compared with the sw model the swim model decreased rmse by 29 15 w m 2 and 28 28 w m 2 over the entire growing season at the bm and dm sites respectively decreased nrmse by 0 09 and 0 07 and increased r2 by 0 23 and 0 16 respectively for λt rc estimation the swim model decreased rmse by 23 02 w m 2 and 4 66 w m 2 at the bm and dm sites respectively decreased nrmse by 0 02 and 0 03 and increased r2 by 0 23 and 0 03 respectively for λe s estimation compared with the sw model the swim model decreased rmse by 39 73 w m 2 and 46 31 w m 2 at the bm and dm sites respectively decreased nrmse by 0 11 and 0 21 and increased r2 by 0 33 and 0 21 respectively a closer examination of the results reveal that the better performance of the swim model was most noticeable during the growing period with sparse canopy table 1 during the period of sparse canopy the swim model decreased nrmse values by 0 18 and 0 33 for λet in the bm and dm sites respectively by 0 25 and 0 20 for λt rc and by 0 26 and 0 49 for λe s respectively however during the dense canopy growth period the swim model decreased nrmse by only 0 10 and 0 06 for λet respectively by 0 02 and 0 03 for λt rc and by 0 01 and 0 16 for λe s respectively during the sparse canopy period the mixed canopy heterogeneity was significant due to the large differences in physical characteristics of the intercropped canopies and a model that assumes uniform distribution of energy in intercropped canopies will inevitably result in large errors the swim model considers the effects of neighboring species and surface heterogeneity on energy distribution and incorporated the strengths of the erin model in that it estimates neighboring species separately therefore it can more accurately characterizing the inhomogeneous energy distribution found in multi species canopies compared with the sw model wallace 1997 chen et al 2022 light competition among different crops in intercropped situations is likely the primary competition for aboveground resources bedoussac et al 2015 yin et al 2020 yuan et al 2022 and accurate energy partitioning between the intercropped crops is essential for estimating field transpiration in interplanted croplands additionally slight differences between estimated λet and measurements during the late crop growth period have been detected table 1 these differences may be due to uncertainty in specifying the canopy resistance because of the effects of canopy space overlap and not accurately accounting for effects of different canopy growth on λet jiang et al 2016 4 3 performance of the swim model in estimating individual intercropped crop transpiration female and male maize plants have different growth periods as mentioned in section 3 and therefore both species have different plant transpiration rates during the entire growing season fig 5 because the swim model considers the effects of intercropping it is able to further estimate individual crop transpiration rates e g female plant transpiration λt rcf and male plant transpiration λt rcm in the field fig 5 and table 3 show that the swim model has good estimation accuracy and agreement in estimating individual intercropped plant transpiration with averaged rmse during the entire growth period of 23 94 w m 2 and 20 95 w m 2 for λt rcf for bm and dm respectively nrmse of 0 13 and 0 11 r 2 of 0 81 and 0 88 and both slope of 0 97 respectively similar results were obtained for λt rcm see table 3 besides slightly better performance for the swim model in estimating individual intercropped plant transpiration was obtained during the dense canopy period than the sparse period during the dense canopy period nrmse were lower by 0 11 and 0 09 for λt rcf for bm and dm respectively and by 0 12 and 0 11 for λt rcm respectively the sw model was proposed based on the pm model that assumes that the crop canopy is uniformly distributed shuttleworth and wallace 1985 this assumption may limit the sw model s applicability such that it is not applicable to underlying surfaces composed of mixed canopies jiang et al 2019 both the sw model and the swim model estimated field transpiration more accurately during the dense canopy growth period than the sparse period table 3 and this is in line with previously reported performance of the sw model or its modified versions in estimating field transpiration li et al 2013 gong et al 2019 chen et al 2022 two reasons may explain this the first reason is that the crop canopy during the dense period is relatively uniform and fractional light interception for intercropped crops is better estimated li et al 2013 chen et al 2022 the second reason is that the sw model calculates λet by using surface resistances to regulate heat and mass transfer from plant and soil surfaces and by using aerodynamic resistances to regulate fluxes to the atmosphere octavio lagos et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 and the canopy surface resistance and the aerodynamic resistance estimated under uniform canopy conditions will be closer to the actual observations li et al 2013 4 4 performance of the swim model in estimating soil evaporation sub components in partially mulched croplands both λe sbs and λe sms are important components of λe s the swim model estimates these soil evaporation sub components by introducing the film mulching ratio and mulched soil resistance into the model over the entire growing season the swim model captured the seasonal dynamics of λe sbs and λe sms fig 6 with rmse of 33 77 w m 2 and 22 82 w m 2 for λe sbs for bm and dm respectively nrmse of 0 20 and 0 15 r 2 of 0 43 and 0 59 and slope of 1 00 and 0 96 respectively and with rmse of 7 02 w m 2 and 3 84 w m 2 for λe sms for bm and dm respectively nrmse of 0 21 and 0 18 r 2 of 0 24 and 0 50 and both slope of 0 94 respectively these results indicate that the model can accurately estimate of bare soil evaporation and mulched soil evaporation the swim model showed better performance in estimating soil evaporation sub components λe sbs and λe sms during the spare canopy period than dense period average nrmse values during the sparse canopy period were 0 04 and 0 02 smaller for λe sbs and 0 02 and 0 05 smaller for λe sms than during the dense period for bm and dm sites respectively table 3 this is different from the model performance for estimating plant transpiration compared with model performance in λe sms estimation the swim model has better performance in estimating λe sbs during entire growth period especially during the sparse canopy period during the sparse growth period nrmse for λe sbs were lower by 0 06 and 0 04 for bm and dm sites respectively while during the dense period these values were only lower by 0 01 for both bm and dm sites respectively and the difference in model performance between λe sbs and λe sms decreased as canopy developed the reasons are attributable to the fact that the plastic mulch suppressed the turbulence transfer above the soil surface which induced the underestimation of soil surface aerodynamic resistance and further resulted in overestimation of λe sms the dual effect of both plastic mulch and the dense canopy increased the uncertainty of λe sms estimation as the canopy developed both the sw and swim models provided better λe s estimates during the sparse canopy period than the dense period tables 2 and 3 the reasons mainly lie in the estimation of the soil surface aerodynamic resistance during the sparse canopy period plants were smaller and had lower canopy coverage therefore the effect of canopy on the wind profile could be ignored and the wind speed over the ground surface can be approximated by the logarithmic profile resulting in accurate estimates of the soil surface aerodynamic resistance in contrast during the dense canopy growth period the greater canopy coverage significantly influenced the wind profiles above the ground and caused large differences between the actual and estimated wind speed at the ground higher values of estimated wind speed over the ground surface produced an underestimation of soil surface aerodynamic resistance resulting in overestimation of λe s another possible reason for overestimation in soil evaporation is estimation of the soil surface resistance studies have shown that the sw model overestimated soil evaporation due to underestimation of the soil surface resistance zhang et al 2008 hu et al 2009 bao et al 2021 soil evaporation was significantly reduced by mulch as reported in previous studies villagarcía et al 2007 qin et al 2018 wang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 however some evaporation can still occur from the mulched soil surfaces because some water vapor beneath the plastic mulch can escape from the planting holes wu et al 2017 qin et al 2018 λesms could account for as much as 46 63 of λesbs under the conditions of high mulch ratio and high soil moisture qin et al 2018 the accuracy of the sw model was lower because the hinder effect of the plastic mulch on the latent heat flux was neglected in the model chen et al 2022 considering the effect of a partial mulch on the ground surface significantly improved the accuracy of the multi source swim model in estimating soil evaporation in both the sparse and dense canopy periods similar results have been reported in previous studies li et al 2013 tian et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study a multi source model swim that considered the effect of intercropping and partial plastic mulch cover was proposed based on the sw model to estimate field λet λt rc and its sub components λt rci λe s and its sub components λe sbs and λe sms in the partially mulched interplanted croplands the performance of the model was evaluated with measurements from eddy covariance systems sap flux systems and micro lysimeters from two partial mulched intercropped seed maize experiment sites e g bm site and dm sites the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed swim model well captured the dynamics of λet and its components and outperformed the sw model in estimating field λet λt rc and λe s during the entire growing season especially significantly improved λet λt rc and λe s estimations during the sparse canopy growth period 2 considering the effect of light interception between intercropped crop species in the swim model enabled us to obtain accurate individual λt rci e g λt rcf and λt rcm and good model performance was demonstrated for estimating transpiration during the dense canopy growth period 3 λe sms in a cropland with higher mulched soil moisture and higher film mulching ratio cannot simply be ignored taking effect of plastic mulch into consideration by introducing a mulched soil surface resistance and a film mulching ratio in the swim model enabled us to accurately obtain partially mulched field soil evaporation and its components swim model had better performance in estimating both λe sbs and λe sms during the sparse canopy growth period than during the dense canopy growth period and especially better estimated λe sbs than λe sms during the sparse canopy growth period understanding variations in partially mulched cropland evapotranspiration and its components helps provide more accurate estimation of underlying surface energy distribution over the soil mulch plant atmosphere system the results

9147,developing an alternative water fertilizer saving management practice for winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the north china plain ncp is urgent to address severe water scarcity and adverse environmental impacts a four year field experiment in split plot design was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplemental drip irrigation on grain yield water use efficiency wue nitrogen use efficiency nue nitrogen n loss and economic benefits keeping three supplemental drip irrigation times di0 no irrigation after emergence di3 irrigation once at wheat jointing once at maize seedling and once at maize jointing di5 irrigation once at wheat jointing once at wheat anthesis once at maize seedling once at maize jointing and once at maize tasseling in the main plots and three n fertilizer rates n0 no n fertilizer n60 60 of the local recommended n fertilizer rate 272 kg n ha 1 yr 1 n100 100 of the local recommended n fertilizer rate 453 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in the sub plots the traditional surface irrigation regime was also conducted as control ck under local recommended n fertilizer at 453 kg n ha 1 yr 1 the results showed that di5n60 achieved the highest wue in wheat 1 93 kg m 3 and maize 3 00 kg m 3 on average which was 3 0 and 25 3 higher compared to ck respectively the highest partial factor productivity from applied n pepn in wheat and maize were also observed in di5n60 56 8 kg kg 1 and 56 3 kg kg 1 respectively on average which was 54 0 and 74 0 higher compared to ck respectively for winter wheat summer maize double cropping system di5n60 can generally achieve similar crop yield and net income but reduce irrigation and n fertilizer use and n loss compared to ck therefore di5n60 was considered as an alternative water fertilizer saving management practice for winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the ncp moreover the optimized combination of irrigation amount and n fertilizer rate corresponding simultaneously to higher crop yield wue and net income were determined by using the response surface methodology based on binary quadratic regression analysis and the optimal irrigation amount were 165 mm and 90 mm optimal n rates were 186 kg n ha 1 and 185 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively keywords supplemental drip irrigation drip fertigation water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency net income optimized irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer inputs data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the north china plain ncp which produces 60 and 31 of nation s wheat and maize respectively nbsc 2021 is one of the most important grain production regions in china and winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the main cropping system in this region winter wheat production relies mainly on supplemental irrigation by exploiting groundwater in the ncp because only 20 30 of the annual rainfall concentrates in the winter wheat growing season which is far from meeting the growth needs of winter wheat zhang et al 2003 fang et al 2010 jha et al 2019 although summer maize is grown in the rainy season with high temperatures unevenly distributed rainfall caused short term droughts often occur in summer maize so supplemental irrigation is also required during the critical growth stages of summer maize yan et al 2017 to achieve high crop yields excessive irrigation up to 667 mm yr 1 shi et al 2013 and over nitrogen n fertilization 550 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 ju et al 2009 tan et al 2017 have been adopted as the crucial farming practices since the 1980s however long term overexploitation of groundwater has led to the groundwater table declining by about 1 m annually over the last 20 years igsnrr 2016 which negatively affects the sustainable agricultural development in the ncp niu et al 2019 in addition the traditional n fertilizer rate is substantially higher than the crop requirement liu et al 2003 which inevitably leads to large n losses such as greenhouse gas emissions ammonia volatilization and other forms of n pollution tan et al 2017 to address these challenges it is vitally important to develop an alternative water fertilizer saving management practice for sustainable production in the ncp applying water and fertilizer at critical growth stages of the crop could improve photosynthesis and biomass production and ultimately increase yield water use efficiency wue and n use efficiency nue many previous studies demonstrated that jointing and anthesis are the critical stages of wheat for grain yield for example xu et al 2018 recommended two irrigations at jointing and anthesis of wheat with 150 mm irrigation amount lv et al 2011 proposed a single application of 60 70 mm at jointing whereas zhang et al 2012 recommended one irrigation application during recovery to the jointing stage with 70 90 mm previous studies also examined the effects of supplemental irrigation at tasseling on wue and maize yield igbadun et al 2007 li and sun 2016 however all the above recommendations were based on the traditional surface irrigation method to gain further benefit supplemental irrigation with effective water saving technology consideration of precipitation soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration needs to be developed urgently man et al 2014 drip fertigation can provide appropriate irrigation amount and n rate in crop root zone by more precise and timely manner than traditional surface irrigation which has been confirmed to be an efficient irrigation and fertilization technology abalos et al 2014 farneselli et al 2015 yan et al 2020 we hypothesized that under supplemental drip fertigation with optimal n rate at the critical growth stage of crop wue nue and economic benefit could be further improved and n loss could be reduced we conducted a field experiment to study the effects of different supplemental drip irrigation times with different n fertilizer rates on crop yield wue nue n loss and economic benefit the aims of this study were 1 to study crop yield crop evapotranspiration wue nue and n loss responses to different irrigation and fertilization management 2 to analyze the economic benefits of winter wheat summer maize double cropping system under different irrigation and fertilization management 3 to optimize the combination of irrigation amount and n rate to reach optimal yield wue and net income values simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment on winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l double cropping

rate fits the binary quadratic regression equations with highly significant table 7 when the crop yield wue and net income achieved their maxima the amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer needed for each were similar but the values needed to maximize the pfpn were significantly different figs 3 and 4 therefore it was difficult to identify the overlap between pepn and crop yield wue and net income due to the opposing trends of pfpn without regard to pepn when the irrigation was approximate 165 mm and the n fertilizer was approximate 186 kg n ha 1 for wheat 70 60 and 70 of the maximum yield wue and net income were overlapped which were considered as producing optimal yield wue and net income simultaneously fig 5a likewise when irrigation was approximate 90 mm and the n fertilizer was approximate 185 kg n ha 1 for maize 90 80 and 80 of the maximum yield wue and net income were overlapped reaching their optimal values simultaneously fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield wue and nue responses grain yields of both wheat and maize were significantly affected by supplemental drip irrigation time table 3 which is consistent with findings showing yield advantages of irrigation conditions compared to no irrigation under sprinkling and surface irrigation methods wang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the significant increases in grain yields of wheat and maize under irrigation conditions in comparison to no irrigation were attributed to increase in yield components such as spike number and kernels per spike in wheat and ear number kernels per ear and 1000 kernel weight in maize table 3 the similar result was also concluded by wang et al 2013 who reported that the effects of supplemental irrigation on grain yield were through the coordination of yield components it is rather remarkable that there were no significant differences in spike number or kernel numbers per spike in wheat between di3 and di5 but di5 resulted in significantly higher 1000 grain weight of 4 4 compared to di3 table 3 this result revealed that irrigation at anthesis stage might be beneficial to the rate and duration of the grain filling further improve wheat grain yield and this is consistent with the previous findings conducted in the ncp wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the further reason for increasing yield in di5 might be due to providing favorable soil moisture in jointing and anthesis stage is conducive to coordinating the pre and post anthesis water consumption optimize the canopy structure and ensure wheat physiological water demand post anthesis oweis et al 2000 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the significant increase in grain yield with the n fertigated conditions over no n control in both the crops was due to better supply of n at the critical growth periods in the mainly root system distribution zone which was beneficial to increase grain yield li et al 2019a notably wheat the spike number was significantly increased with increasing n rate table 3 indicating supply appropriate n can ensure the more tillers and spikes the grain yield of wheat under di5 fertilized treatments showed no significant decrease compared to ck irrespective of n fertilizer rate only about 20 significant lower in 2018 2019 supplementary fig s1 unlike wheat both di3 and di5 fertilized treatments obtained similar even higher yield in maize compared to ck supplementary fig s1 these results indicated that supplemental irrigation is more important for wheat than maize due to the limited water supply conditions meanwhile our results showed that under drip fertigation 40 reduction of n recommended rate did not influence the grain yield of both wheat and maize table 3 these similar results were also concluded by li et al 2019a and bai et al 2020 the reason for these results is that drip fertigation can simultaneously transport n fertilizer and water to the vicinity of active roots which improve nue consequently apply less n fertilizer to ensure the grain yield silber et al 2002 abd el wahed and ali 2013 in addition the great yield variation in these seasons might be due to the differences in sowing time harvesting time and weather conditions for winter wheat the sowing date in 2017 was late 22th october due to the rainfall pre sowing and the tillers was fewer caused by insufficient accumulated temperature eventually resulting in the significant lower spikes at maturity the early sowing date in 2018 8th october may cause the spike differentiation in advance which is easier to suffer freezing damage due to the continuous low temperature in the middle and late december 2018 the lowest temperature reached 9 c for summer maize early harvesting in 2018 may result in a foreshortened grain filling period which had a negative effect on grain yield the relative lower yield of maize in 2019 might be due to the abundant precipitation in tasseling stage counteracted for the beneficial of fertigation the increase in wue is the resultant of both increase in yield and decrease in crop evapotranspiration our results showed that the higher wues in wheat and maize were observed in drip irrigation as compared to the surface irrigation irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times supplementary table s1 which is in accordance with the previous studies jha et al 2019 the reason for these results was mainly due to reduction in irrigation percolation by apply water directly to the root zone but ensuring the similar yield under drip irrigation the improvement in pepn of wheat and maize in n60 irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times in comparison to ck supplementary table s1 was attributed to increase in yield and decrease in n fertilizer rate a similar trend was observed in n loss that is n60 significantly reduced n loss irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times compared to ck however no significant decrease was observed in n100 compared to ck irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times fig 2 which was inconsistent with wu et al 2019 who concluded that under the same n application rate drip fertigation reduced n loss at greater extent than conventional treatments the reason for the different results might be due to the supplemental drip irrigation only at wheat jointing and anthesis stage is insufficient to affecting the n balance during the whole growing season it is noteworthy that the n loss in di0n100 was significant higher compared to other treatments fig 2 the reason might be due to non irrigation reduced plant n uptake availability the negative n in the n0 treatment may be attributed to biological n2 fixation n deposition mineralization of soil organic n and possibly other processes chen et al 2021 and the source of n in n0 may come from free living endophytic biological n2 fixation n deposition etc xu et al 2015 ladha et al 2016 all these above results indicated that reducing n fertilizer rate is pivotal for sustainable agriculture the similar result was also concluded by bai et al 2020 who reported that 30 n reduction with drip fertigation was suggested in the ncp to achieve a relatively high grain yield high fertilization use efficiency and minimize risk of environment pollution the benefit of drip fertigation in winter wheat summer maize system was also proved by the previous studies conducted in the other parts of the world such as north western india sandhu et al 2019 and iran afzalinia and dehghanian 2021 4 2 evaluation of optimal irrigation and n fertilizer inputs crop yield alone is not enough to determine the optimal irrigation and fertilization amount wue nue and the economic profit must be considered from a long term point of view in recent years many researchers have established binary quadratic regression equations of crop yield wue nue and economic profit with irrigation and fertilization in spring maize and cotton in northwest china wang et al 2018 zou et al 2020 yan et al 2021 rarely studied on wheat and maize in the ncp the relationship of yield wue pepn and net income with irrigation and n fertilizer amount of winter wheat and summer maize were established in this study our results showed that the optimal irrigation amount were 165 mm and 90 mm and n rates were 186 kg n ha 1 and 185 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively fig 5 this result was consistent with lu et al 2021 who suggested that the n application rates were 165 211 kg n ha 1 and 187 250 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively in northwest china similar n fertilizer amount were also reported by wang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 who also suggested that the optimal n fertilizer rate for high grain yield of winter wheat in the ncp were 180 240 kg n ha 1 liu et al 2003 suggested that the suitable n application for high grain yield of summer maize in the ncp was about 180 kg ha 1 li et al 2021a also reported that 180 kg n ha 1 applied by drip fertigation at the seven leaf stage ten leaf stage and silking stage could increase the yield and reduce the environmental burden those previous studies can support our results that 186 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 185 kg n ha 1 for summer maize can obtain the similar annual grain yield compared to high local n recommended rate 228 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 225 kg n ha 1 for summer maize without significant difference there similar results were not only proved by other experimental studies but also proved by model simulation zhao et al 2015 combined field data with scenario modeling to optimize irrigation and n fertilizer input and concluded that 225 mm irrigation water and 330 kg n ha 1 150 for wheat and 180 for maize n fertilizer can obtain 18 t ha 1 grain yield with the minimum impact on the environment in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the ncp li et al 2019b also showed that when the n fertilizer rate of winter wheat and summer maize exceeded 216 kg n ha 1 and 206 kg n ha 1 respectively increasing n inputs had little effect on crop yields which were consistent with our results however li et al 2021b suggested that the optimal irrigation amounts under drip fertigation for wheat and maize were 188 and 132 mm respectively and the optimal n fertilizer rates under drip fertigation for wheat and maize were 138 kg n ha 1 and 162 kg n ha 1 respectively by using meta analysis in china the inconsistency with our results may be due to the crop varieties studied in li et al 2021b including spring wheat and spring maize which the n and water demand are different 5 conclusions this study showed that supplemental drip fertigation is highly effective in terms of saving water and n fertilizer inputs increasing wue and nue and decreasing n loss over the traditional surface irrigation regime ck in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the ncp supplemental drip irrigation at wheat jointing wheat anthesis maize seedling maize jointing and maize tasseling di5 with 40 reduction of local recommended n rate n60 is beneficial to achieve stable grain yield improve wue nue and net income and decrease n loss the optimal irrigation amount and n

kg m 3 and maize 3 00 kg m 3 on average which was 3 0 and 25 3 higher compared to ck respectively the highest partial factor productivity from applied n pepn in wheat and maize were also observed in di5n60 56 8 kg kg 1 and 56 3 kg kg 1 respectively on average which was 54 0 and 74 0 higher compared to ck respectively for winter wheat summer maize double cropping system di5n60 can generally achieve similar crop yield and net income but reduce irrigation and n fertilizer use and n loss compared to ck therefore di5n60 was considered as an alternative water fertilizer saving management practice for winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the ncp moreover the optimized combination of irrigation amount and n fertilizer rate corresponding simultaneously to higher crop yield wue and net income were determined by using the response surface methodology based on binary quadratic regression analysis and the optimal irrigation amount were 165 mm and 90 mm optimal n rates were 186 kg n ha 1 and 185 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively keywords supplemental drip irrigation drip fertigation water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency net income optimized irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer inputs data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the north china plain ncp which produces 60 and 31 of nation s wheat and maize respectively nbsc 2021 is one of the most important grain production regions in china and winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is the main cropping system in this region winter wheat production relies mainly on supplemental irrigation by exploiting groundwater in the ncp because only 20 30 of the annual rainfall concentrates in the winter wheat growing season which is far from meeting the growth needs of winter wheat zhang et al 2003 fang et al 2010 jha et al 2019 although summer maize is grown in the rainy season with high temperatures unevenly distributed rainfall caused short term droughts often occur in summer maize so supplemental irrigation is also required during the critical growth stages of summer maize yan et al 2017 to achieve high crop yields excessive irrigation up to 667 mm yr 1 shi et al 2013 and over nitrogen n fertilization 550 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 ju et al 2009 tan et al 2017 have been adopted as the crucial farming practices since the 1980s however long term overexploitation of groundwater has led to the groundwater table declining by about 1 m annually over the last 20 years igsnrr 2016 which negatively affects the sustainable agricultural development in the ncp niu et al 2019 in addition the traditional n fertilizer rate is substantially higher than the crop requirement liu et al 2003 which inevitably leads to large n losses such as greenhouse gas emissions ammonia volatilization and other forms of n pollution tan et al 2017 to address these challenges it is vitally important to develop an alternative water fertilizer saving management practice for sustainable production in the ncp applying water and fertilizer at critical growth stages of the crop could improve photosynthesis and biomass production and ultimately increase yield water use efficiency wue and n use efficiency nue many previous studies demonstrated that jointing and anthesis are the critical stages of wheat for grain yield for example xu et al 2018 recommended two irrigations at jointing and anthesis of wheat with 150 mm irrigation amount lv et al 2011 proposed a single application of 60 70 mm at jointing whereas zhang et al 2012 recommended one irrigation application during recovery to the jointing stage with 70 90 mm previous studies also examined the effects of supplemental irrigation at tasseling on wue and maize yield igbadun et al 2007 li and sun 2016 however all the above recommendations were based on the traditional surface irrigation method to gain further benefit supplemental irrigation with effective water saving technology consideration of precipitation soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration needs to be developed urgently man et al 2014 drip fertigation can provide appropriate irrigation amount and n rate in crop root zone by more precise and timely manner than traditional surface irrigation which has been confirmed to be an efficient irrigation and fertilization technology abalos et al 2014 farneselli et al 2015 yan et al 2020 we hypothesized that under supplemental drip fertigation with optimal n rate at the critical growth stage of crop wue nue and economic benefit could be further improved and n loss could be reduced we conducted a field experiment to study the effects of different supplemental drip irrigation times with different n fertilizer rates on crop yield wue nue n loss and economic benefit the aims of this study were 1 to study crop yield crop evapotranspiration wue nue and n loss responses to different irrigation and fertilization management 2 to analyze the economic benefits of winter wheat summer maize double cropping system under different irrigation and fertilization management 3 to optimize the combination of irrigation amount and n rate to reach optimal yield wue and net income values simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment on winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l double cropping

recommended n rate referred as n0 n60 and n100 respectively in 2015 2016 140 of local recommended n rate referred as n140 was conducted to evaluate the effects of over fertilization on the crop yields wue and partial factor productivity from applied n pepn which showed that the crop yields and wue in n140 was no significant difference but pepn in n140 was significantly lower compared to n60 and

rate fits the binary quadratic regression equations with highly significant table 7 when the crop yield wue and net income achieved their maxima the amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer needed for each were similar but the values needed to maximize the pfpn were significantly different figs 3 and 4 therefore it was difficult to identify the overlap between pepn and crop yield wue and net income due to the opposing trends of pfpn without regard to pepn when the irrigation was approximate 165 mm and the n fertilizer was approximate 186 kg n ha 1 for wheat 70 60 and 70 of the maximum yield wue and net income were overlapped which were considered as producing optimal yield wue and net income simultaneously fig 5a likewise when irrigation was approximate 90 mm and the n fertilizer was approximate 185 kg n ha 1 for maize 90 80 and 80 of the maximum yield wue and net income were overlapped reaching their optimal values simultaneously fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield wue and nue responses grain yields of both wheat and maize were significantly affected by supplemental drip irrigation time table 3 which is consistent with findings showing yield advantages of irrigation conditions compared to no irrigation under sprinkling and surface irrigation methods wang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the significant increases in grain yields of wheat and maize under irrigation conditions in comparison to no irrigation were attributed to increase in yield components such as spike number and kernels per spike in wheat and ear number kernels per ear and 1000 kernel weight in maize table 3 the similar result was also concluded by wang et al 2013 who reported that the effects of supplemental irrigation on grain yield were through the coordination of yield components it is rather remarkable that there were no significant differences in spike number or kernel numbers per spike in wheat between di3 and di5 but di5 resulted in significantly higher 1000 grain weight of 4 4 compared to di3 table 3 this result revealed that irrigation at anthesis stage might be beneficial to the rate and duration of the grain filling further improve wheat grain yield and this is consistent with the previous findings conducted in the ncp wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the further reason for increasing yield in di5 might be due to providing favorable soil moisture in jointing and anthesis stage is conducive to coordinating the pre and post anthesis water consumption optimize the canopy structure and ensure wheat physiological water demand post anthesis oweis et al 2000 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the significant increase in grain yield with the n fertigated conditions over no n control in both the crops was due to better supply of n at the critical growth periods in the mainly root system distribution zone which was beneficial to increase grain yield li et al 2019a notably wheat the spike number was significantly increased with increasing n rate table 3 indicating supply appropriate n can ensure the more tillers and spikes the grain yield of wheat under di5 fertilized treatments showed no significant decrease compared to ck irrespective of n fertilizer rate only about 20 significant lower in 2018 2019 supplementary fig s1 unlike wheat both di3 and di5 fertilized treatments obtained similar even higher yield in maize compared to ck supplementary fig s1 these results indicated that supplemental irrigation is more important for wheat than maize due to the limited water supply conditions meanwhile our results showed that under drip fertigation 40 reduction of n recommended rate did not influence the grain yield of both wheat and maize table 3 these similar results were also concluded by li et al 2019a and bai et al 2020 the reason for these results is that drip fertigation can simultaneously transport n fertilizer and water to the vicinity of active roots which improve nue consequently apply less n fertilizer to ensure the grain yield silber et al 2002 abd el wahed and ali 2013 in addition the great yield variation in these seasons might be due to the differences in sowing time harvesting time and weather conditions for winter wheat the sowing date in 2017 was late 22th october due to the rainfall pre sowing and the tillers was fewer caused by insufficient accumulated temperature eventually resulting in the significant lower spikes at maturity the early sowing date in 2018 8th october may cause the spike differentiation in advance which is easier to suffer freezing damage due to the continuous low temperature in the middle and late december 2018 the lowest temperature reached 9 c for summer maize early harvesting in 2018 may result in a foreshortened grain filling period which had a negative effect on grain yield the relative lower yield of maize in 2019 might be due to the abundant precipitation in tasseling stage counteracted for the beneficial of fertigation the increase in wue is the resultant of both increase in yield and decrease in crop evapotranspiration our results showed that the higher wues in wheat and maize were observed in drip irrigation as compared to the surface irrigation irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times supplementary table s1 which is in accordance with the previous studies jha et al 2019 the reason for these results was mainly due to reduction in irrigation percolation by apply water directly to the root zone but ensuring the similar yield under drip irrigation the improvement in pepn of wheat and maize in n60 irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times in comparison to ck supplementary table s1 was attributed to increase in yield and decrease in n fertilizer rate a similar trend was observed in n loss that is n60 significantly reduced n loss irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times compared to ck however no significant decrease was observed in n100 compared to ck irrespective of supplemental drip irrigation times fig 2 which was inconsistent with wu et al 2019 who concluded that under the same n application rate drip fertigation reduced n loss at greater extent than conventional treatments the reason for the different results might be due to the supplemental drip irrigation only at wheat jointing and anthesis stage is insufficient to affecting the n balance during the whole growing season it is noteworthy that the n loss in di0n100 was significant higher compared to other treatments fig 2 the reason might be due to non irrigation reduced plant n uptake availability the negative n in the n0 treatment may be attributed to biological n2 fixation n deposition mineralization of soil organic n and possibly other processes chen et al 2021 and the source of n in n0 may come from free living endophytic biological n2 fixation n deposition etc xu et al 2015 ladha et al 2016 all these above results indicated that reducing n fertilizer rate is pivotal for sustainable agriculture the similar result was also concluded by bai et al 2020 who reported that 30 n reduction with drip fertigation was suggested in the ncp to achieve a relatively high grain yield high fertilization use efficiency and minimize risk of environment pollution the benefit of drip fertigation in winter wheat summer maize system was also proved by the previous studies conducted in the other parts of the world such as north western india sandhu et al 2019 and iran afzalinia and dehghanian 2021 4 2 evaluation of optimal irrigation and n fertilizer inputs crop yield alone is not enough to determine the optimal irrigation and fertilization amount wue nue and the economic profit must be considered from a long term point of view in recent years many researchers have established binary quadratic regression equations of crop yield wue nue and economic profit with irrigation and fertilization in spring maize and cotton in northwest china wang et al 2018 zou et al 2020 yan et al 2021 rarely studied on wheat and maize in the ncp the relationship of yield wue pepn and net income with irrigation and n fertilizer amount of winter wheat and summer maize were established in this study our results showed that the optimal irrigation amount were 165 mm and 90 mm and n rates were 186 kg n ha 1 and 185 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively fig 5 this result was consistent with lu et al 2021 who suggested that the n application rates were 165 211 kg n ha 1 and 187 250 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively in northwest china similar n fertilizer amount were also reported by wang et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 who also suggested that the optimal n fertilizer rate for high grain yield of winter wheat in the ncp were 180 240 kg n ha 1 liu et al 2003 suggested that the suitable n application for high grain yield of summer maize in the ncp was about 180 kg ha 1 li et al 2021a also reported that 180 kg n ha 1 applied by drip fertigation at the seven leaf stage ten leaf stage and silking stage could increase the yield and reduce the environmental burden those previous studies can support our results that 186 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 185 kg n ha 1 for summer maize can obtain the similar annual grain yield compared to high local n recommended rate 228 kg n ha 1 for winter wheat and 225 kg n ha 1 for summer maize without significant difference there similar results were not only proved by other experimental studies but also proved by model simulation zhao et al 2015 combined field data with scenario modeling to optimize irrigation and n fertilizer input and concluded that 225 mm irrigation water and 330 kg n ha 1 150 for wheat and 180 for maize n fertilizer can obtain 18 t ha 1 grain yield with the minimum impact on the environment in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in the ncp li et al 2019b also showed that when the n fertilizer rate of winter wheat and summer maize exceeded 216 kg n ha 1 and 206 kg n ha 1 respectively increasing n inputs had little effect on crop yields which were consistent with our results however li et al 2021b suggested that the optimal irrigation amounts under drip fertigation for wheat and maize were 188 and 132 mm respectively and the optimal n fertilizer rates under drip fertigation for wheat and maize were 138 kg n ha 1 and 162 kg n ha 1 respectively by using meta analysis in china the inconsistency with our results may be due to the crop varieties studied in li et al 2021b including spring wheat and spring maize which the n and water demand are different 5 conclusions this study showed that supplemental drip fertigation is highly effective in terms of saving water and n fertilizer inputs increasing wue and nue and decreasing n loss over the

9148,appropriate plant density is essential for crop production in rainfed areas however it is quite difficult to obtain the optimal plant density under plastic film mulch in different hydrological years through field experiments due to its limited treatments and time and labor costs therefore mathematical models are generally used for searching the optimal alternatives in this paper the agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator ahc was adopted to model soil water dynamics rainfed maize growth and yield under plastic film mulch and various plant density conditions in northeast china for different hydrological years the results showed that the ahc model can simulate rainfed maize water use and growth under plastic film mulch and various plant density conditions i e 60 000 d1 67 500 d2 75 000 d3 82 5000 d4 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d5 the average maize yields of all treatments in the severely dry sd moderately dry md normal n moderately wet mw and severely wet sw years were 11440 3 13685 4 13821 5 14704 8 and 14014 3 kg ha 1 respectively compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient by 0 08 0 11 and decreased the soil evaporation coefficient by 0 26 0 32 from sd and sw years respectively thus plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration by 46 2 76 8 mm while reduced evaporation by 163 5 186 8 mm across the simulated years ultimately the maize yield under plastic film mulch was 5 9 17 4 higher than that without mulch from d1 to d5 treatments the decrease of soil evaporation coefficient was within 0 02 under plastic film mulch and was over 0 05 without mulch under plastic film mulch the relations between plant density and net profit could be well described by the parabolic curves and the recommended optimal plant densities of maize in the study area were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 in the sd ms n mw and sw years respectively our findings provide management implications for maize cultivation in the rainfed areas of northeast china keywords crop yield evapotranspiration net profit soil water stress aboveground biomass data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the northeast china is a typical sub humid area with precipitation as the primary water resources for crop growth this region is also the largest rainfed maize production area in china in this region maize growth and yield are often limited by scarce rainfall and low soil temperature in april and may chen et al 2019 therefore it is important to develop appropriate agricultural practices for improving maize yield and precipitation use efficiency among those agricultural practices plastic film mulch and high plant density cultivations are considered as the promising ways to improve the precipitation use soil temperature and thus promoting the maize production in recent years many studies showed that maize yield has been increased continuously due to planting in high density duvick 2005 ren et al 2016 sun et al 2019b plant with high density can improve maize yield mainly because increase of plant density can improve maize ears in unit area and augment crop leaf area index duvick 2005 jia et al 2018 however trachsel et al 2016 reported that over high density planting augmented the individual competition for soil water nutrients and radiation and thus increased variability among plants and more barrenness which resulted in the reduction of the maize yield therefore an optimal plant density is very important to obtain the highest maize yield especially in the rainfed area previous studies demonstrated that optimal maize plant density varied with precipitation for instance zhang et al 2014 reported that in normal and wet years the optimal plant density of maize was 75 000 plants ha 1 in shanxi province the optimal maize plant densities in different hydrological years were explored by ren et al 2016 who simulated maize yield and rainfall use efficiency under different planting densities without plastic film mulch in different hydrological years the results indicated that on average the highest yield and water productivity were observed at 52 500 plants ha 1 in dry years 67 500 plants ha 1 in normal and moderately wet years and 82 500 plants ha 1 in extremely wet years respectively however these optimal maize plant densities were recommended for non mulch condition the optimal plant density under plastic film condition is still not well documented numerous studies had demonstrated that plastic film mulch can alter the agricultural hydrological processes i e increasing crop transpiration soil temperature and soil water content and decreasing evaporation bu et al 2013 chen et al 2019 ding et al 2021 changes in soil water and heat conditions can lead to alleviate soil water stress caused by high plant density planting therefore under plastic film mulch the optimal maize plant density should be increased in comparison with non mulch ben et al 2016 yan et al 2016 for instance ren et al 2017 investigated the optimal maize plant density under plastic film mulch and they found that compared with the treatments without mulch treatments with plastic film mulch increased maize optimal plant density our previous study also showed that soil water stress was severe in the fields without mulch compared with those with plastic mulch and thus the optimal plant density under plastic film mulch was higher than that without mulch chen et al 2019 however those studies were only conducted in a single type of hydrological year for field cultivation management people are interested in the practices in typical hydrological years however the optimal maize plant density may vary due to the variations of weather conditions i e precipitation air temperature solar radiation and distribution of precipitation in different hydrological years especially because of the significant variation in precipitation during the maize growth period in northeast china it seems impossible to obtain the optimal plant density in different hydrological years only by field experiments therefore using the agroecosystem simulation models might be a good choice to search the best alternative for crop cultivation in the study area among the models the ahc model a recently physical model based on the swap and epic model was initially developed by xu et al 2018 the ahc model was used in simulating wheat and maize growth and the fate of nitrogen in a wheat maize rotation system the modeling values confirmed that the ahc model could precisely modeling the growth of wheat and maize salt dynamics and the fate of nitrogen xu et al 2018 huang et al 2019 also used the ahc model for simulating the peanut growth and water consumption under mulched drip irrigation in northwestern liaoning china the result revealed that the ahc model had excellent performance in modeling peanut growth and soil water dynamics however the ahc model was not applied to evaluate soil water dynamics and maize growth under different plant density and plastic film mulch conditions in different hydrological years above all little is known about whether the ahc model can simulate soil water dynamics and maize growth under different plant density and plastic film mulch conditions and what is the optimal plant density in different hydrological years for maize planting thus the aims of present research are then 1 to assess the accuracy of the recently developed ahc model in simulating maize growth water consumption and yield under plastic film mulch and various plant density conditions 2 to study the effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water use maize growth and yield in different hydrological years and 3 to explore the appropriate maize plant density under plastic film mulch for different hydrological years in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in 2017 and 2018 the field experiments were

three replications was adopted each treatment plot had an area of 21 6 m2 3 6 m 6 m which had three ridges and two furrows and the width of ridge and furrow were 0 8 and 0 4 m respectively during the maize growing period runoff occurred in the moderately and severely wet years but runoff rarely occurred in the normal and moderately and severely dry years different plant spaces were designed to classify the plant densities plant spaces for each plant density is shown in table 2 the details of planting method are illustrated in fig 1 only base fertilizer including 243 kg n ha 1 135 kg p ha 1 and 117 kg k ha 1 was applied during the maize growth season maize liangyu 99 was sowed on may 3rd in 2017 and may 5th in 2018 and harvested on september 23rd in 2017 and september 19th in 2018 respectively to facilitate the grow of maize holes were made in the plastic film where maize emerged 2 2 sampling and measurements soil water content was measured every 10 cm from 0 to 100 cm soil layer with three replications using a time domain reflectometer tdr sensor system at 10 day intervals three evenly growing plants in the middle of each plot were randomly selected for the measurement of lai every 15 days specifically all leaves of the maize plant were cut down and the length and width of those leaves were measured and then the leaf area index was calculated using eq 1 chen et al

dried to a constant weight at 85 for measuring the aboveground biomass maize plants from a 10 m2 area in each plot were harvested for measuring the yield the water productivity was calculated as following function ren et al 2016 2 wp y 10 e t where wp is the water productivity kg m 3 et is the maize water consumption mm and y is the maize yield kg ha 1 in the ahc model et is the sum of actual

respectively s is about 1050 1180 1310 1440 and 1580 cny ha 1 for 60 000 d1 67 500 d2 75 000 d3 82 5000 d4 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d5 respectively 2 3 classification of drought and wet year in this study the hydrological years were classified in terms of the standard precipitation index spi hu et al 2015 based on the precipitation from may to september maize growing period spi can be calculated as follows 4 spi t a b t c t 2 1 d t e t 2 f t 3 t ln 1 f x k 2 0 f x 0 5 t a b t c t 2 1 d t e t 2 f t 3 t ln 1 1 f x k 2 0 5 f x 1 5 where spi is the standard precipitation index f x p 1 p g x g x 0

the spi values during the period 1961 2018 are presented in fig s3 however the spi values during the period of 1967 1979 were not obtained due to the lack of relative humidity data in addition the spi values were not acquired in 2002 2003 2005 and 2007 because of missing the rainfall data according to hu et al 2015 the years would be defined as the following types a severely wet year sw with its spi value larger than 1 5 a moderately wet year mw with its spi value in a range of 1 5 1 0 a normal year n with its spi value between 1 0 and 1 0 a moderately dry year md with its spi value ranged from 1 5 to 1 0 and a severely dry year sd with its spi value smaller than 1 5 respectively in this study the total of 39 years were selected for the simulation of maize water consumption and growth using the ahc model as a result there were 3 4 23 3 and 6 years in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in addition the spi value of 2017 and 2018 was 2 2 and 0 26 making that 2017 and 2018 were a severely dry and normal year respectively 2 4 the ahc model xu et al 2018 gave the details of the ahc model in this study the soil water flow module and crop growth module in the ahc model were introduced in detail the soil water flow module inherited from the swap model in which the soil water dynamics were described by 1 d richards equation vertical flow in the soil water flow module the implicit finite difference scheme was adopted to solve the 1 d richards equation xu et al 2013 2018 the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model xu et al 2018 in this study the bottom boundary was set as free drainage of the soil profile and the top boundary was set according to the rate of actual evaporation e a and actual transpiration t a precipitation and interception jiang et al 2015 to obtain e a and t a the penman monteith equation was adopted to calculate the potential evapotranspiration et p monteith 1965 then the et p was split into potential soil evaporation e p and potential crop transpiration t p by lai xu et al 2013 2019 the e p and t p were calculated using the following functions xu et al 2019 5 e p e p 0 e k g r l a i 6 t p 1 0 w f r a c e t p e p 7 k r m u l 1 c f m u l f m m where k gr is the extinction coefficient for global solar radiation e p0 is computed using penman monteith equation with a crop resistance 0 s m 1 and a

and van dam 2003 xu et al 2019 for e a we firstly calculated the maximum evaporation rate e max using darcy s law van dam et al 1997 and the limit of actual evaporation e alim xu et al 2018 then the ahc determined e a by taking the minimum value of e p e max and e alim finally e a was modified by multiplying k r mul for t a firstly t p was calculated using eq 6 then the actual transpiration t a was determined according to potential transpiration rooting depth and root distribution and a possible reduction due to water and salt stress more details description can be found in xu et al 2018 the crop growth module was developed based on the epic model in the crop growth module the stress of water salt and temperature on crop light interception lai aboveground biomass and yield were respectively described by different functions that can be found in williams et al 1989 in this study the calculation processes of four main indexes of maize growth including biomass lai plant height and yield were given the biomass was estimated as follows williams et al 1989 jiang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 8 δ b a r u e δ b p r u e p a r d a y r e g where δb a and δb p are respectively the daily

intercepted photosynthetic active radiation estimated by following function in ahc model reg is the minimum crop stress factors i e the stress of water salt nitrogen and temperature more details can be found in xu et al 2018 9 p a r d a y 0 5 r a d a y 1 exp k l l a i where par day is the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation on a given day mj m 2 ra day and 0 5ra day are respectively the

conditions the harvest index increases from 0 at planting to hi at maturity and its value on each day of growing season is simulated using the heat unit index the more details were showed in the study of xu et al 2018 2 5 adjustment of the parameters in ahc the effect of plastic film mulch on maize water consumption and growth was mainly reflected in two parameters of eq 7 i e cf mul and f mm in this study under plastic film condition the cf mul and f mm were adjusted in detail the parameter of f mm was 1 0 for all treatments with plastic film mulch the parameter of cf mul was calculated by a function as follow allen et al 1998 14 c f m u l 1 a f a h a where cf mul is the fraction of soil surface covered by mulch a f a h and a are the area of furrow the area of vent hole in the plastic film and the total area of plot m2 respectively in this study the cf mul value was 0 71 0 71 0 70 0 70 and 0 69 for d1 to d5 treatments with plastic film mulch considering that the plant density had a significant influence on maize lai allen et al 1998 radiation use efficiency rue andrade et al 2002 lindquist et al 2005 and on harvest index sarlangue et al 2007 the rue maximum lai and harvest index were calibrated in this study for reflecting the effects of plant density on maize water consumption and growth the values of those parameters are listed in table 3 in addition the parameter of a h in eq 14 also reflected the effects of plant density on maize water consumption 2 6 model performance and assessment and statistical analysis the performance of all models was assessed by the normalized relative root mean error nrmse and coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute percentage error mape which were calculated by the following equations 15 nrmse 100 o a v g i n p i o i 2 n 16 r 2 i 1 n o i o a v g p i p a v g i 1 n o i o a v g i 1 n p i p a v g 17 mape 100 n i 1 n o i p i o i where p i and p avg are the predicted and average predicated value respectively and o i and o avg are the observed and average observed value respectively in this study the nrmse and mape within 20 and r2 above 0 5 means that the ahc model performed well the two way analysis of variance was adopted to test whether the treatments had a significant influence p 0 05 on independent variables using r software multiple comparisons were used to test the differences among the means of the treatments using the least significant difference method 3 results 3 1 the performance of the ahc model the parameters of the ahc model were trained by the dataset with ten treatments taken in 2017 and then were tested by the dataset with six treatments taken in 2018 the values of soil hydraulic and maize growth parameters are shown in tables 2 to 5 the performances of the ahc model for estimating soil water content maize height lai aboveground biomass and yield of treatments are illustrated in figs s4 to s8 in the calibration period the r2 nrmse and mape values for soil water storage in 0 100 cm modeling were 0 61 0 91 3 3 6 1 and 2 8 5 1 respectively fig s4 and those values were 0 78 0 95 5 9 9 3 and 3 8 7 5 in the validation period fig 2 respectively making that the ahc model obtained high accuracy in estimating soil water content in addition the r2 values of plant height lai and aboveground biomass were all higher than 0 90 in both calibration and validation periods indicating that the ahc model fitted the maize growth processes well the nrmse and mape values of plant height lai and aboveground biomass were all within 20 figs s5 s8 these results confirmed that the ahc model achieved good performance in estimating maize growth in both 2017 and 2018 for maize yield the r2 nrmse and mape values were 0 88 3 7 and 3 0 respectively in the calibration period and 0 84 7 1 and 5 1 respectively in the validation period fig 3 this result indicated that the ahc model has an excellent performance in modeling maize yield in both calibration and validation periods in addition 2017 and 2018 were the severely dry and normal year respectively therefore the ahc model obtained good performance in modeling soil water dynamics maize growth and yield and thus the ahc model can be used to estimate maize growth in different hydrological years to increase the accuracy of the model in this study we thus applied linear regression model to fit the relation between plant densities and rue and maximum lai the results showed that there were significant relations between plant densities and those two parameters with the r2 values ranging from 0 82 to 0 99 fig s9 3 2 evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration maize transpiration evaporation and evapotranspiration for plant density and plastic film mulch in different hydrological years are illustrated in fig 4 compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased plant transpiration by 72 8 60 5 56 3 48 8 and 46 2 mm in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively whereas considerably decreased soil evaporation by 163 5 165 6 168 2 164 4 and 186 8 mm in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively the decreased evaporation was much higher than the increased transpiration thus et under plastic film mulch was 90 7 105 1 112 0 115 6 and 140 7 mm lower than that of non mulch treatment in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively fig 4a e shows that compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment obviously increased the average transpiration by 25 9 33 9 31 0 36 3 and 33 4 mm and significantly declined the average evaporation by 20 4 23 9 19 6 21 3 and 19 1 mm in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in addition from low density d1 to high density d5 the evaporation declined by 7 3 8 5 mm under plastic film mulch and 30 8 39 6 mm without mulch across the simulated years indicating that the evaporation decreased values under plastic film mulch were significantly lower than those without mulch 3 3 basal crop coefficient soil evaporation coefficient and soil water stress to further study the influence of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water consumption the maize basal crop coefficient soil evaporation coefficient and soil water stress coefficient were considered in this study fig 5 fig 5 illustrates that the highest average basal crop coefficients under plastic film much and without mulch were observed in the mw year with values of 0 619 and 0 539 respectively the highest average soil evaporation coefficients under plastic film much and without mulch were both founded in the sw year with values of 0 146 and 0 471 respectively additionally across all treatments the average soil stress value in the sd md n mw and sw years was 0 75 0 85 0 87 0 92 and 0 92 respectively indicating that soil water stress of maize growth alleviated as the increase of precipitation fig 5a e shows that the maize basal crop coefficient under plastic film mulch was 0 11 0 09 0 09 0 08 and 0 08 obviously higher than that without mulch in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively compared with the treatment without mulch the treatment with plastic film mulch significantly decreased the soil evaporation coefficient by 0 26 0 30 0 27 0 27 and 0 32 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively moreover the soil water stress coefficient in the treatment with plastic film mulch was 0 10 0 08 0 07 0 06 and 0 03 higher than those in the treatment without mulch in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively above all compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient reduced the soil evaporation coefficient and alleviated soil water stress for maize growth in all hydrological years compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment increased the maize basal crop coefficient by 0 04 0 05 0 05 0 06 and 0 06 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively on the other hand with the increase in plant density the soil evaporation coefficient showed a decreasing trend under non mulch conditions from low density d1 to high density d5 the reduced values of soil evaporation coefficient under the non mulch conditions were all over 0 05 whereas under the plastic film mulch conditions the difference in soil evaporation coefficient among different plant densities was scarcely noticeable for soil water stress coefficient fig 5k o illustrates that increasing plant density decreased the soil water stress coefficient indicating that increasing plant density caused more severe soil water stress for maize growth for instance compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment declined soil water stress coefficient by 0 02 in the sd years and 0 01 in the md n mw and sw years 3 4 aboveground biomass yield water productivity and net profit maize aboveground biomass yield and water productivity for plant density and plastic film mulch treatments across the simulated years are presented in fig 6 it can be found that compared with non mulch plastic film mulch significantly improved maize aboveground biomass by 6142 4 5181 8 4553 1 4216 7 and 4073 1 kg ha 1 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in addition plastic film mulch increased maize yield by 17 4 10 1 7 8 5 7 and 5 9 respectively from the sd year to the sw year fig 6f j the maize water productivity response to plastic film mulch was consistent with maize yield on average plastic film mulch augmented the water productivity by 0 87 0 93 0 76 0 81 and 1 02 kg m 3 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively as compared with the non mulch fig 6k o the aboveground biomass increased significantly as the increase of plant density in all hydrological years the aboveground biomass of the d5 treatment was 4897 9 6170 6 5863 8 6553 3 and 6160 7 kg ha 1 higher than that of the d1 treatment in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively fig 6a e fig 6f j shows that for non mulch treatment the highest maize yields in the sd and md years were both obtained in the d3 treatment in the n mw and sw years the d4 treatment achieved the highest maize yield for mulch treatment the highest yield in the sd year was obtained in the d4 treatment and in the md and n years the yields of the d4 and d5 treatments were the same with a value of 15 8 t ha 1 in the wet years mw and sw the d5 treatment obtained the highest yields with values of 16 8 and 16 0 t ha 1 respectively for water productivity plant density had a significant effect on water productivity in all hydrological years in the sd md n mw and sw years under plastic film mulch condition compared with the d1 treatment the d4 treatment significantly improved water productivity by 0 68 0 80 0 67 0 78 and 0 81 kg m 3 respectively in addition the average maize yields in the sd md n mw and sw years were 11440 3 13685 4 13821 5 14704 8 and 14014 3 kg ha 1 respectively indicating that maize yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of precipitation and the highest yield was observed in the mw year instead of the sw year we explored the impacts of weather conditions on maize yield fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the maximum temperature tmax precipitation and the coefficient of variation of precipitation cvp explained 15 0 12 9 and 11 2 variance of maize yield respectively showing that tmax had the highest impacts on maize yield furthermore we explored the impacts of tmax precipitation and cvp on maize growth and yield fig s10 fig s10 shows that the parabolic relation could fit the relations between those three weather indices and maize lai and yield well according to fig s10 the case with precipitation of 780 mm and tmax of 26 was the optimal weather condition for maize growth above all maize growth and yield were not only dominated by precipitation but also were significantly impacted by air temperate and the distribution of precipitation considering that the economic returns are what farmers care most about the net profits of different treatments were analyzed in this study fig 8 as shown in fig 8 from the sd to sw years the net profit increased first and then decreased the average income was the lowest in the sd year and the highest in the mw year which were 13 0 and 17 9 thousand chinese yuan cny ha 1 respectively fig 8 also shows that the plastic film mulch did not always improve the net profit for instance in the sd year compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased the net profit by 0 3 1 4 0 9 2 6 and 2 6 thousand cny ha 1 in the d1 to d5 treatments respectively however in the mw and sw years only the d4 and d5 treatments with plastic film mulch increased the net profit in the sd md and n years the net profits of the d4 treatment under plastic film mulch were the highest which were 15 6 18 9 and 18 8 thousand cny ha 1 respectively whereas in the mw and sw years the net profit of the d5 treatment under plastic film mulch were the highest fig 8 also shows that the r2 of the linear models in different hydrological years were all higher than 0 97 and that the relationships between plant density and net profit could be well described with parabolic curves according to the linear models the optimal plant densities under plastic film mulch were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 for the sd ms n mw and sw years respectively 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the ahc model although previous studies showed that the ahc model achieved excellent performance in modeling crop growth and water use the performance of the ahc model in modeling maize growth and water consumption under different plant densities with plastic film mulch was not known yet in this study the ahc model was first adopted to simulate soil water dynamics and maize growth under plastic film mulch and plant density treatments the results showed that the ahc model with low nrmse and mape and high r2 can accurately estimate soil water dynamics maize height lai aboveground biomass and yield this result confirmed that the ahc could excellently model maize growth and water consumption under different plant densities and plastic film mulch conditions through modifying parameters including plant radiation use efficiency maximum crop height maximum lai and harvest index table 4 additionally in this study the ahc model was calibrated in 2017 a severely dry year and was validated in 2018 a normal year the ahc model gave a good performance in both severely dry year and normal year probably making it be capable of simulating maize water use and growth under plastic film mulch and various plant densities in different hydrological years in this study the crop module epic in the ahc model was a process based model pbm compared with the pbm the architectural plant models apm can simulate the architecture of crop plants and light competition which is suitable to assess the effects of plant density on maize water productivity however the data about the architecture indexes of crop plants were not easy to obtain moreover the difference in the architecture of a single plant is large above all it is difficult to calibrate the apm correctly on the other hand the pbm based on the physical process of crop growth can easily simulate crop growth via lai and plant height additionally measuring the lai value of a plot is more straightforward than measuring architecture indexes of crop plants making that the pbm is generally more often used than the apm 4 2 effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water consumption compared with the non mulch treatment plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration by 46 2 72 8 mm while reduced evaporation by 163 5 186 8 mm across the simulated years the reason for these results is probably that plastic film mulch alleviates soil water stress and augments soil temperature and then promotes maize growth i e increasing maize plant height and lai filipović et al 2016 fan et al 2017 in the ahc model soil evaporation and plant transpiration were partitioned using lai eqs 5 6 in which soil evaporation decreased with the increase of lai in contrast plant transpiration increased with the increase of lai in this study compared with the non mulch the plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient by 0 11 0 09 0 09 0 08 and 0 08 and decreased the soil evaporation coefficient by 0 26 0 30 0 27 0 27 and 0 32 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively for the effect of plant density on maize evapotranspiration barbieri et al 2012 found that plant density did not significantly impact maize evapotranspiration in contrast jiang et al 2016 found that maize evapotranspiration was significantly increased by increasing maize plant density these different results can be explained by that whether plant density increases evapotranspiration depends on the difference in the reduction of soil evaporation and the increase of transpiration chen et al 2019 in this study the effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration were not significant under the non mulch conditions in all hydrological years except in the n years however under the plastic film mulch conditions the effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration in different hydrological years were largely unclear in previous studies under the plastic film mulch conditions our study showed that plant density had a significant influence on evapotranspiration in all hydrological years except in the sd years in detail under the plastic film mulch conditions compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment significantly increased maize evapotranspiration by 21 3 22 2 28 1 and 26 8 mm in md n mw and sw years respectively in addition increasing plant density from 60 000 plant ha 1 to 90 000 plant ha 1 reduced average evaporation by 7 3 8 5 mm under plastic film mulch conditions and 30 8 39 6 mm without mulch across the simulated years indicating that the decreased value of evaporation from 60 000 plant ha 1 to 90 000 plant ha 1 under plastic film mulch was significantly lower than that without mulch the reason for reducing soil evaporation in higher plant density treatment was that higher plant density resulted in higher plant height and lai which caused more shadow on the soil surface and then decreased soil evaporation additionally compared with non mulch plastic film mulch reduced the exposed soil surface area causing less soil evaporation and thus leading to a smaller decrease of soil evaporation with the increase of plant density higher soil water stress coefficient values were observed in the mw and sw years indicating that maize suffered less water stress in the mw and sw years it is reasonable that more rainfall could alleviate the soil water stress for crop growth in addition compared with non mulch plastic film mulch significantly increased the average soil water stress coefficient by 0 10 0 08 0 07 0 06 and 0 03 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in this study this result was reasonable because plastic film mulch reduced soil invalid evaporation and augmented the soil water storage and then relieved the soil water stress zhu et al 2015 chen et al 2019 additionally the soil water stress coefficient value decreased with the increase in plant density indicating that higher plant density may result in more soil water stress the reason for this was probably that increasing planting density augmented the individual competition of maize plants for soil water trachsel et al 2016 4 3 effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize yield water productivity and net profit the year types had a significant influence on maize yield and maize water productivity in general maize yield increased first and then decreased with the increase in precipitation and the highest yield was observed in the mw year instead of the sw year this result confirmed that more precipitation did not always cause high yields ren et al 2016 other weather variables such as the distribution of precipitation and air temperature may also influence maize yield and water productivity to further study the influence of weather variables on maize yield in this study the multiple linear regression model was established to calculate the explained variance of yield by weather variables fig 8 the results showed that the top three weather variables which explained more than 10 of the variance of maize yield were the maximum temperature the rainfall and the distribution of precipitation respectively we further explored the relationship between precipitation maximum air temperature and coefficient of variation of precipitation and maize growth i e maximum lai and yield fig s10 the result also showed the air temperature and coefficient of variation of precipitation also had significant impacts on maize growth additionally the parabolic relationships between precipitation maximum air temperature and distribution of precipitation and maize growth were found fig s10 indicating that as the increase in precipitation maximum air temperature and coefficient of variation of precipitation the maize growth and yield increased first and then decreased therefore the reason that the highest yield in the mw year was probably that the maximum temperature and distribution of rainfall in the mw year were lower than those in the sw year fig s2 the maize yield and water productivity under plastic film mulch were 5 9 17 4 and 32 1 43 2 higher than those without mulch respectively dang et al 2016 and sun et al 2019a also reported that plastic film mulch significantly increased maize yield and water use efficiency the reason for this result is probably that plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration improved aboveground biomass and alleviated soil water stress liu et al 2014 although compared with non mulch plastic film mulch improved maize yield in all hydrological years in wet years e g the mw and sw years the increased value of maize yield by plastic film mulch was significantly lower than that in normal and dry years the reason may be that in wet years crops can obtain sufficient water for growth even without plastic film mulch this result indicated that the benefits of plastic film mulch in wet years might be lower than those in normal and dry years in addition another important reason for higher maize yield in treatment with plastic film mulch was that it augmented soil temperature significantly sun et al 2018 although in this study the soil temperature was not simulated our previous field experimental studies showed that the plastic film mulch just had a significant influence on soil temperature at the seeding and jointing stage in which the average soil temperature in 0 30 cm was improved by 1 3 and 0 2 respectively the reason for increasing soil temperature by plastic film mulching was that the plastic film mulch reduces the exchange of sensible heat between soil and air zhang et al 2005 and that higher air moisture under film mulching resulted in the greenhouse effect bu et al 2013 many previous studies have demonstrated that increased plant density could significantly improve maize yield and water productivity han et al 2015 however the optimal plant density of maize varied depending on regions and hydrological years in northeast china the optimal plant density in different hydrological years was scarcely explored by previous studies in this study the recently developed model ahc was used to explore the optimal plant density for maize cultivation in different hydrological years and the result showed that under the non mulch conditions the highest yield was obtained in the 75 000 plants ha 1 in the sd and md years and the 825 000 plants ha 1 treatment in the n mw and sw years under the non mulch conditions the maize populations with the highest yield in this study were higher than those in the study of ren et al 2016 who reported that in the loess plateau of china for a cultivar of zhengdan 958 the optimal maize plant population was 32 500 plants ha 1 in the sd years 52 500 plants ha 1 in the md years and 67 500 plants ha 1 in the n mw and sw years the differences in weather conditions and maize cultivars in those two regions were the main reasons for that the higher optimal maize population in our study was higher than that in the study of ren et al 2016 moreover the optimal maize plant density under plastic film conditions in different hydrological years was scarcely evaluated in the previous studies ren et al 2019 in this study under the plastic film mulch the highest maize yield was observed in the 82 500 plants ha 1 treatment in the sd md and n years and in the 90 000 plants ha 1 treatment in the mw and sw years it is worth noting that in the dry years the sd and md years and the wet years the sw and mw years the plant densities with the highest yield under the plastic film mulch conditions were higher than those under the non mulch conditions fig 6f j the reason is probably that plastic film mulch can reduce soil invalid evaporation and then increase soil water storage and alleviate the limitations of high density planting antonietta et al 2014 mansfield and mumm 2014 this agreed with liu et al 2014 who found that plastic film mulch with high plant density can augment maize yield in a semiarid region the effect of plant densities and plastic film mulch on maize economic return was scarcely evaluated in different hydrological years in this study the net profit of plant densities and plastic film mulch were calculated and found that plastic film did not constantly improve maize net profit in the n mw and sw years when the maize population was lower than 75 000 plants ha 1 the net profit of plastic film mulch treatments was lower than those of non mulch treatments the main reason for this result was that the increased net profit from plastic film mulch did not offset the cost of the plastic film when the maize population was low however in all hydrological years the treatment with the highest net profit was observed under plastic film mulch conditions in addition according to the relation between plant density and net profit the optimal plant densities with the highest net profit were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 in the sd ms n mw and sw years respectively fig 8 5 conclusion this research adopted the ahc model to simulate soil water dynamics maize height lai aboveground biomass and yield under various plastic film mulch and plant density conditions in different hydrological years the coupling effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water consumption aboveground biomass yield water productivity and net profit were further analyzed the results showed that the ahc model could model maize water consumption and maize growth under plastic film mulch and high plant density conditions the average maize yields in the severely dry moderately dry normal moderately wet and severely wet years were 11440 3 13685 4 13821 5 14704 8 and 14014 3 kg ha 1 respectively compared with non mulch treatments plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient and decreased the soil evaporation coefficient thus plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration and reduced soil evaporation across the simulated years compared with non mulch treatments ultimately the maize yield under plastic film mulch was 5 9 17 4 significantly higher than that without mulch under plastic film mulch there were significant parabolic relations between plant density and net profit according to those parabolic relations the optimal plant densities with the highest net profit were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 respectively for the sd ms n mw and sw years under plastic film mulch declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9148,appropriate plant density is essential for crop production in rainfed areas however it is quite difficult to obtain the optimal plant density under plastic film mulch in different hydrological years through field experiments due to its limited treatments and time and labor costs therefore mathematical models are generally used for searching the optimal alternatives in this paper the agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator ahc was adopted to model soil water dynamics rainfed maize growth and yield under plastic film mulch and various plant density conditions in northeast china for different hydrological years the results showed that the ahc model can simulate rainfed maize water use and growth under plastic film mulch and various plant density conditions i e 60 000 d1 67 500 d2 75 000 d3 82 5000 d4 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d5 the average maize yields of all treatments in the severely dry sd moderately dry md normal n moderately wet mw and severely wet sw years were 11440 3 13685 4 13821 5 14704 8 and 14014 3 kg ha 1 respectively compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient by 0 08 0 11 and decreased the soil evaporation coefficient by 0 26 0 32 from sd and sw years respectively thus plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration by 46 2 76 8 mm while reduced evaporation by 163 5 186 8 mm across the simulated years ultimately the maize yield under plastic film mulch was 5 9 17 4 higher than that without mulch from d1 to d5 treatments the decrease of soil evaporation coefficient was within 0 02 under plastic film mulch and was over 0 05 without mulch under plastic film mulch the relations between plant density and net profit could be well described by the parabolic curves and the recommended optimal plant densities of maize in the study area were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 in the sd ms n mw and sw years respectively our findings provide management implications for maize cultivation in the rainfed areas of northeast china keywords crop yield evapotranspiration net profit soil water stress aboveground biomass data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the northeast china is a typical sub humid area with precipitation as the primary water resources for crop growth this region is also the largest rainfed maize production area in china in this region maize growth and yield are often limited by scarce rainfall and low soil temperature in april and may chen et al 2019 therefore it is important to develop appropriate agricultural practices for improving maize yield and precipitation use efficiency among those agricultural practices plastic film mulch and high plant density cultivations are considered as the promising ways to improve the precipitation use soil temperature and thus promoting the maize production in recent years many studies showed that maize yield has been increased continuously due to planting in high density duvick 2005 ren et al 2016 sun et al 2019b plant with high density can improve maize yield mainly because increase of plant density can improve maize ears in unit area and augment crop leaf area index duvick 2005 jia et al 2018 however trachsel et al 2016 reported that over high density planting augmented the individual competition for soil water nutrients and radiation and thus increased variability among plants and more barrenness which resulted in the reduction of the maize yield therefore an optimal plant density is very important to obtain the highest maize yield especially in the rainfed area previous studies demonstrated that optimal maize plant density varied with precipitation for instance zhang et al 2014 reported that in normal and wet years the optimal plant density of maize was 75 000 plants ha 1 in shanxi province the optimal maize plant densities in different hydrological years were explored by ren et al 2016 who simulated maize yield and rainfall use efficiency under different planting densities without plastic film mulch in different hydrological years the results indicated that on average the highest yield and water productivity were observed at 52 500 plants ha 1 in dry years 67 500 plants ha 1 in normal and moderately wet years and 82 500 plants ha 1 in extremely wet years respectively however these optimal maize plant densities were recommended for non mulch condition the optimal plant density under plastic film condition is still not well documented numerous studies had demonstrated that plastic film mulch can alter the agricultural hydrological processes i e increasing crop transpiration soil temperature and soil water content and decreasing evaporation bu et al 2013 chen et al 2019 ding et al 2021 changes in soil water and heat conditions can lead to alleviate soil water stress caused by high plant density planting therefore under plastic film mulch the optimal maize plant density should be increased in comparison with non mulch ben et al 2016 yan et al 2016 for instance ren et al 2017 investigated the optimal maize plant density under plastic film mulch and they found that compared with the treatments without mulch treatments with plastic film mulch increased maize optimal plant density our previous study also showed that soil water stress was severe in the fields without mulch compared with those with plastic mulch and thus the optimal plant density under plastic film mulch was higher than that without mulch chen et al 2019 however those studies were only conducted in a single type of hydrological year for field cultivation management people are interested in the practices in typical hydrological years however the optimal maize plant density may vary due to the variations of weather conditions i e precipitation air temperature solar radiation and distribution of precipitation in different hydrological years especially because of the significant variation in precipitation during the maize growth period in northeast china it seems impossible to obtain the optimal plant density in different hydrological years only by field experiments therefore using the agroecosystem simulation models might be a good choice to search the best alternative for crop cultivation in the study area among the models the ahc model a recently physical model based on the swap and epic model was initially developed by xu et al 2018 the ahc model was used in simulating wheat and maize growth and the fate of nitrogen in a wheat maize rotation system the modeling values confirmed that the ahc model could precisely modeling the growth of wheat and maize salt dynamics and the fate of nitrogen xu et al 2018 huang et al 2019 also used the ahc model for simulating the peanut growth and water consumption under mulched drip irrigation in northwestern liaoning china the result revealed that the ahc model had excellent performance in modeling peanut growth and soil water dynamics however the ahc model was not applied to evaluate soil water dynamics and maize growth under different plant density and plastic film mulch conditions in different hydrological years above all little is known about whether the ahc model can simulate soil water dynamics and maize growth under different plant density and plastic film mulch conditions and what is the optimal plant density in different hydrological years for maize planting thus the aims of present research are then 1 to assess the accuracy of the recently developed ahc model in simulating maize growth water consumption and yield under plastic film mulch and various plant density conditions 2 to study the effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water use maize growth and yield in different hydrological years and 3 to explore the appropriate maize plant density under plastic film mulch for different hydrological years in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in 2017 and 2018 the field experiments were conducted at shenyang agricultural university experimental station 41 44 n 123 27 e 44 7 ma s l shenyang city liaoning province china from 1961 2018 the mean temperature in growing season from may to september was 21 2 and mean annual precipitation of 700 0 mm with which 77 6 occurred in growing season in the experimental site the soil texture is silt loam in 0 60 soil depth and silt clay loam in 60 300 cm soil depth basic physical properties are summarized in table 1 in 2017 and 2018 the groundwater table depth varied from 3 9 to 4 9 m during crop growth season with average value of 4 4 m the detail meteorological factors including rainfall and daily maximum and minimum temperature from may to september in 2017 and 2018 are presented in fig s1 the historically meteorological features are illustrated in fig s2 in the field experiments ten treatments were designed with considering two mulch situations i e non mulch m0 and mulch with black plastic film m1 and five plant densities i e 60 000 d1 67 500 d2 75 000 d3 82 5000 d4 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d5 in 2017 in 2018 two mulch situations m0 and m1 and three plant densities d1 d3 and d5 were conducted table 2 a split block design with three replications was adopted each treatment plot had an area of 21 6 m2 3 6 m 6 m which had three ridges and two furrows and the width of ridge and furrow were 0 8 and 0 4 m respectively during the maize growing period runoff occurred in the moderately and severely wet years but runoff rarely occurred in the normal and moderately and severely dry years different plant spaces were designed to classify the plant densities plant spaces for each plant density is shown in table 2 the details of planting method are illustrated in fig 1 only base fertilizer including 243 kg n ha 1 135 kg p ha 1 and 117 kg k ha 1 was applied during the maize growth season maize liangyu 99 was sowed on may 3rd in 2017 and may 5th in 2018 and harvested on september 23rd in 2017 and september 19th in 2018 respectively to facilitate the grow of maize holes were made in the plastic film where maize emerged 2 2 sampling and measurements soil water content was measured every 10 cm from 0 to 100 cm soil layer with three replications using a time domain reflectometer tdr sensor system at 10 day intervals three evenly growing plants in the middle of each plot were randomly selected for the measurement of lai every 15 days specifically all leaves of the maize plant were cut down and the length and width of those leaves were measured and then the leaf area index was calculated using eq 1 chen et al 2019 1 lai 0 75 n i 1 m w l n a where lai is the leaf area index n is the number of plants per plot a is the area of plot m2 l is the length of maize leaf m n is the number of plants n 3 in this study m is the total number of leaves of three plants and d is the width of maize leaf m after the measurement of lai the plants were cut into segments and dried to de enzyme for 30 min at 105 and then dried to a constant weight at 85 for measuring the aboveground biomass maize plants from a 10 m2 area in each plot were harvested for measuring the yield the water productivity was calculated as following function ren et al 2016 2 wp y 10 e t where wp is the water productivity kg m 3 et is the maize water consumption mm and y is the maize yield kg ha 1 in the ahc model et is the sum of actual evaporation and transpiration the detail descriptions of actual evaporation and transpiration are shown in section 2 4 the net profit was calculated using eq 3 3 b 1 5 y m f s where b is the net profit cny ha 1 y is the maize yield kg ha 1 the price of maize is 1 5 cny kg 1 m f and s are the prices of plastic film fertilizer and seeds cny ha 1 in this study m and f are 1200 and 2250 cny ha 1 respectively s is about 1050 1180 1310 1440 and 1580 cny ha 1 for 60 000 d1 67 500 d2 75 000 d3 82 5000 d4 and 90 000 plants ha 1 d5 respectively 2 3 classification of drought and wet year in this study the hydrological years were classified in terms of the standard precipitation index spi hu et al 2015 based on the precipitation from may to september maize growing period spi can be calculated as follows 4 spi t a b t c t 2 1 d t e t 2 f t 3 t ln 1 f x k 2 0 f x 0 5 t a b t c t 2 1 d t e t 2 f t 3 t ln 1 1 f x k 2 0 5 f x 1 5 where spi is the standard precipitation index f x p 1 p g x g x 0

the spi values during the period 1961 2018 are presented in fig s3 however the spi values during the period of 1967 1979 were not obtained due to the lack of relative humidity data in addition the spi values were not acquired in 2002 2003 2005 and 2007 because of missing the rainfall data according to hu et al 2015 the years would be defined as the following types a severely wet year sw with its spi value larger than 1 5 a moderately wet year mw with its spi value in a range of 1 5 1 0 a normal year n with its spi value between 1 0 and 1 0 a moderately dry year md with its spi value ranged from 1 5 to 1 0 and a severely dry year sd with its spi value smaller than 1 5 respectively in this study the total of 39 years were selected for the simulation of maize water consumption and growth using the ahc model as a result there were 3 4 23 3 and 6 years in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in addition the spi value of 2017 and 2018 was 2 2 and 0 26 making that 2017 and 2018 were a severely dry and normal year respectively 2 4 the ahc model xu et al 2018 gave the details of the ahc model in this study the soil water flow module and crop growth module in the ahc model were introduced in detail the soil water flow module inherited from the swap model in which the soil water dynamics were described by 1 d richards equation vertical flow in the soil water flow module the implicit finite difference scheme was adopted to solve the 1 d richards equation xu et al 2013 2018 the soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model xu et al 2018 in this study the bottom boundary was set as free drainage of the soil profile and the top boundary was set according to the rate of actual evaporation e a and actual transpiration t a precipitation and interception jiang et al 2015 to obtain e a and t a the penman monteith equation was adopted to calculate the potential evapotranspiration et p monteith 1965 then the et p was split into potential soil evaporation e p and potential crop transpiration t p by lai xu et al 2013 2019 the e p and t p were calculated using the following functions xu et al 2019 5 e p e p 0 e k g r l a i 6 t p 1 0 w f

and van dam 2003 xu et al 2019 for e a we firstly calculated the maximum evaporation rate e max using darcy s law van dam et al 1997 and the limit of actual evaporation e alim xu et al 2018 then the ahc determined e a by taking the minimum value of e p e max and e alim finally e a was modified by multiplying k r mul for t a firstly t p was calculated using eq 6 then the actual transpiration t a was determined according to potential transpiration rooting depth and root distribution and a possible reduction due to water and salt stress more details description can be found in xu et al 2018 the crop growth module was developed based on the epic model in the crop growth module the stress of water salt and temperature on crop light interception lai aboveground biomass and yield were respectively described by different functions that can be found in williams et al 1989 in this study the calculation processes of four main indexes of maize growth including biomass lai plant height and yield were given the biomass was estimated as follows williams et al 1989 jiang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 8 δ b a r u e δ b p r u e p a r d a y r e g where δb a and δb p are respectively the daily

the harvest index concept 13 y a h i b a where y a is the amount of the crop removed from the field kg ha 1 hi is the harvest index and b a is the actual aboveground biomass kg ha 1 for non stressed conditions the harvest index increases from 0 at planting to hi at maturity and its value on each day of growing season is simulated using the heat unit index the more details were showed in the study of xu et al 2018 2 5 adjustment of the parameters in ahc the effect of plastic film mulch on maize water consumption and growth was mainly reflected in two parameters of eq 7 i e cf mul and f mm in this study under plastic film condition the cf mul and f mm were adjusted in detail the parameter of f mm was 1 0 for all treatments with plastic film mulch the parameter of cf mul was calculated by a function as follow allen et al 1998 14 c f m u l 1 a f a h a where cf mul is the fraction of soil surface covered by mulch a f a h and a are the area of furrow the area of vent hole in the plastic film and the total area of plot m2 respectively in this study the cf mul value was 0 71 0 71 0 70 0 70 and 0 69 for d1 to d5 treatments with plastic film mulch considering that the plant density had a significant influence on maize lai allen et al 1998 radiation use efficiency rue andrade et al 2002 lindquist et al 2005 and on harvest index sarlangue et al 2007 the rue maximum lai and harvest index were calibrated in this study for reflecting the effects of plant density on maize water consumption and growth the values of those parameters are listed in table 3 in addition the parameter of a h in eq 14 also reflected the effects of plant density on maize water consumption 2 6 model performance and assessment and statistical analysis the performance of all models was assessed by the normalized relative root mean error nrmse and coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute percentage error mape which were calculated by the following equations 15 nrmse 100 o a v g i n p i o i 2 n 16 r 2 i 1 n o i o a v g p i p a v g i 1 n o i o a v g i 1 n p i p a v g 17 mape 100 n i 1 n o i p i o i where p i and p avg are the predicted and average predicated value respectively and o i and o avg are the observed and average observed value respectively in this study the nrmse and mape within 20 and r2 above 0 5 means that the ahc model performed well the two way analysis of variance was adopted to test whether the treatments had a significant influence p 0 05 on independent variables using r software multiple comparisons were used to test the differences among the means of the treatments using the least significant difference method 3 results 3 1 the performance of the ahc model the parameters of the ahc model were trained by the dataset with ten treatments taken in 2017 and then were tested by the dataset with six treatments taken in 2018 the values of soil hydraulic and maize growth parameters are shown in tables 2 to 5 the performances of the ahc model for estimating soil water content maize height lai aboveground biomass and yield of treatments are illustrated in figs s4 to s8 in the calibration period the r2 nrmse and mape values for soil water storage in 0 100 cm modeling were 0 61 0 91 3 3 6 1 and 2 8 5 1 respectively fig s4 and those values were 0 78 0 95 5 9 9 3 and 3 8 7 5 in the validation period fig 2 respectively making that the ahc model obtained high accuracy in estimating soil water content in addition the r2 values of plant height lai and aboveground biomass were all higher than 0 90 in both calibration and validation periods indicating that the ahc model fitted the maize growth processes well the nrmse and mape values of plant height lai and aboveground biomass were all within 20 figs s5 s8 these results confirmed that the ahc model achieved good performance in estimating maize growth in both 2017 and 2018 for maize yield the r2 nrmse and mape values were 0 88 3 7 and 3 0 respectively in the calibration period and 0 84 7 1 and 5 1 respectively in the validation period fig 3 this result indicated that the ahc model has an excellent performance in modeling maize yield in both calibration and validation periods in addition 2017 and 2018 were the severely dry and normal year respectively therefore the ahc model obtained good performance in modeling soil water dynamics maize growth and yield and thus the ahc model can be used to estimate maize growth in different hydrological years to increase the accuracy of the model in this study we thus applied linear regression model to fit the relation between plant densities and rue and maximum lai the results showed that there were significant relations between plant densities and those two parameters with the r2 values ranging from 0 82 to 0 99 fig s9 3 2 evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration maize transpiration evaporation and evapotranspiration for plant density and plastic film mulch in different hydrological years are illustrated in fig 4 compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased plant transpiration by 72 8 60 5 56 3 48 8 and 46 2 mm in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively whereas considerably decreased soil evaporation by 163 5 165 6 168 2 164 4 and 186 8 mm in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively the decreased evaporation was much higher than the increased transpiration thus et under plastic film mulch was 90 7 105 1 112 0 115 6 and 140 7 mm lower than that of non mulch treatment in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively fig 4a e shows that compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment obviously increased the average transpiration by 25 9 33 9 31 0 36 3 and 33 4 mm and significantly declined the average evaporation by 20 4 23 9 19 6 21 3 and 19 1 mm in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in addition from low density d1 to high density d5 the evaporation declined by 7 3 8 5 mm under plastic film mulch and 30 8 39 6 mm without mulch across the simulated years indicating that the evaporation decreased values under plastic film mulch were significantly lower than those without mulch 3 3 basal crop coefficient soil evaporation coefficient and soil water stress to further study the influence of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water consumption the maize basal crop coefficient soil evaporation coefficient and soil water stress coefficient were considered in this study fig 5 fig 5 illustrates that the highest average basal crop coefficients under plastic film much and without mulch were observed in the mw year with values of 0 619 and 0 539 respectively the highest average soil evaporation coefficients under plastic film much and without mulch were both founded in the sw year with values of 0 146 and 0 471 respectively additionally across all treatments the average soil stress value in the sd md n mw and sw years was 0 75 0 85 0 87 0 92 and 0 92 respectively indicating that soil water stress of maize growth alleviated as the increase of precipitation fig 5a e shows that the maize basal crop coefficient under plastic film mulch was 0 11 0 09 0 09 0 08 and 0 08 obviously higher than that without mulch in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively compared with the treatment without mulch the treatment with plastic film mulch significantly decreased the soil evaporation coefficient by 0 26 0 30 0 27 0 27 and 0 32 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively moreover the soil water stress coefficient in the treatment with plastic film mulch was 0 10 0 08 0 07 0 06 and 0 03 higher than those in the treatment without mulch in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively above all compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient reduced the soil evaporation coefficient and alleviated soil water stress for maize growth in all hydrological years compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment increased the maize basal crop coefficient by 0 04 0 05 0 05 0 06 and 0 06 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively on the other hand with the increase in plant density the soil evaporation coefficient showed a decreasing trend under non mulch conditions from low density d1 to high density d5 the reduced values of soil evaporation coefficient under the non mulch conditions were all over 0 05 whereas under the plastic film mulch conditions the difference in soil evaporation coefficient among different plant densities was scarcely noticeable for soil water stress coefficient fig 5k o illustrates that increasing plant density decreased the soil water stress coefficient indicating that increasing plant density caused more severe soil water stress for maize growth for instance compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment declined soil water stress coefficient by 0 02 in the sd years and 0 01 in the md n mw and sw years 3 4 aboveground biomass yield water productivity and net profit maize aboveground biomass yield and water productivity for plant density and plastic film mulch treatments across the simulated years are presented in fig 6 it can be found that compared with non mulch plastic film mulch significantly improved maize aboveground biomass by 6142 4 5181 8 4553 1 4216 7 and 4073 1 kg ha 1 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in addition plastic film mulch increased maize yield by 17 4 10 1 7 8 5 7 and 5 9 respectively from the sd year to the sw year fig 6f j the maize water productivity response to plastic film mulch was consistent with maize yield on average plastic film mulch augmented the water productivity by 0 87 0 93 0 76 0 81 and 1 02 kg m 3 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively as compared with the non mulch fig 6k o the aboveground biomass increased significantly as the increase of plant density in all hydrological years the aboveground biomass of the d5 treatment was 4897 9 6170 6 5863 8 6553 3 and 6160 7 kg ha 1 higher than that of the d1 treatment in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively fig 6a e fig 6f j shows that for non mulch treatment the highest maize yields in the sd and md years were both obtained in the d3 treatment in the n mw and sw years the d4 treatment achieved the highest maize yield for mulch treatment the highest yield in the sd year was obtained in the d4 treatment and in the md and n years the yields of the d4 and d5 treatments were the same with a value of 15 8 t ha 1 in the wet years mw and sw the d5 treatment obtained the highest yields with values of 16 8 and 16 0 t ha 1 respectively for water productivity plant density had a significant effect on water productivity in all hydrological years in the sd md n mw and sw years under plastic film mulch condition compared with the d1 treatment the d4 treatment significantly improved water productivity by 0 68 0 80 0 67 0 78 and 0 81 kg m 3 respectively in addition the average maize yields in the sd md n mw and sw years were 11440 3 13685 4 13821 5 14704 8 and 14014 3 kg ha 1 respectively indicating that maize yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of precipitation and the highest yield was observed in the mw year instead of the sw year we explored the impacts of weather conditions on maize yield fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the maximum temperature tmax precipitation and the coefficient of variation of precipitation cvp explained 15 0 12 9 and 11 2 variance of maize yield respectively showing that tmax had the highest impacts on maize yield furthermore we explored the impacts of tmax precipitation and cvp on maize growth and yield fig s10 fig s10 shows that the parabolic relation could fit the relations between those three weather indices and maize lai and yield well according to fig s10 the case with precipitation of 780 mm and tmax of 26 was the optimal weather condition for maize growth above all maize growth and yield were not only dominated by precipitation but also were significantly impacted by air temperate and the distribution of precipitation considering that the economic returns are what farmers care most about the net profits of different treatments were analyzed in this study fig 8 as shown in fig 8 from the sd to sw years the net profit increased first and then decreased the average income was the lowest in the sd year and the highest in the mw year which were 13 0 and 17 9 thousand chinese yuan cny ha 1 respectively fig 8 also shows that the plastic film mulch did not always improve the net profit for instance in the sd year compared with non mulch plastic film mulch increased the net profit by 0 3 1 4 0 9 2 6 and 2 6 thousand cny ha 1 in the d1 to d5 treatments respectively however in the mw and sw years only the d4 and d5 treatments with plastic film mulch increased the net profit in the sd md and n years the net profits of the d4 treatment under plastic film mulch were the highest which were 15 6 18 9 and 18 8 thousand cny ha 1 respectively whereas in the mw and sw years the net profit of the d5 treatment under plastic film mulch were the highest fig 8 also shows that the r2 of the linear models in different hydrological years were all higher than 0 97 and that the relationships between plant density and net profit could be well described with parabolic curves according to the linear models the optimal plant densities under plastic film mulch were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 for the sd ms n mw and sw years respectively 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the ahc model although previous studies showed that the ahc model achieved excellent performance in modeling crop growth and water use the performance of the ahc model in modeling maize growth and water consumption under different plant densities with plastic film mulch was not known yet in this study the ahc model was first adopted to simulate soil water dynamics and maize growth under plastic film mulch and plant density treatments the results showed that the ahc model with low nrmse and mape and high r2 can accurately estimate soil water dynamics maize height lai aboveground biomass and yield this result confirmed that the ahc could excellently model maize growth and water consumption under different plant densities and plastic film mulch conditions through modifying parameters including plant radiation use efficiency maximum crop height maximum lai and harvest index table 4 additionally in this study the ahc model was calibrated in 2017 a severely dry year and was validated in 2018 a normal year the ahc model gave a good performance in both severely dry year and normal year probably making it be capable of simulating maize water use and growth under plastic film mulch and various plant densities in different hydrological years in this study the crop module epic in the ahc model was a process based model pbm compared with the pbm the architectural plant models apm can simulate the architecture of crop plants and light competition which is suitable to assess the effects of plant density on maize water productivity however the data about the architecture indexes of crop plants were not easy to obtain moreover the difference in the architecture of a single plant is large above all it is difficult to calibrate the apm correctly on the other hand the pbm based on the physical process of crop growth can easily simulate crop growth via lai and plant height additionally measuring the lai value of a plot is more straightforward than measuring architecture indexes of crop plants making that the pbm is generally more often used than the apm 4 2 effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water consumption compared with the non mulch treatment plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration by 46 2 72 8 mm while reduced evaporation by 163 5 186 8 mm across the simulated years the reason for these results is probably that plastic film mulch alleviates soil water stress and augments soil temperature and then promotes maize growth i e increasing maize plant height and lai filipović et al 2016 fan et al 2017 in the ahc model soil evaporation and plant transpiration were partitioned using lai eqs 5 6 in which soil evaporation decreased with the increase of lai in contrast plant transpiration increased with the increase of lai in this study compared with the non mulch the plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient by 0 11 0 09 0 09 0 08 and 0 08 and decreased the soil evaporation coefficient by 0 26 0 30 0 27 0 27 and 0 32 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively for the effect of plant density on maize evapotranspiration barbieri et al 2012 found that plant density did not significantly impact maize evapotranspiration in contrast jiang et al 2016 found that maize evapotranspiration was significantly increased by increasing maize plant density these different results can be explained by that whether plant density increases evapotranspiration depends on the difference in the reduction of soil evaporation and the increase of transpiration chen et al 2019 in this study the effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration were not significant under the non mulch conditions in all hydrological years except in the n years however under the plastic film mulch conditions the effects of plant density on maize evapotranspiration in different hydrological years were largely unclear in previous studies under the plastic film mulch conditions our study showed that plant density had a significant influence on evapotranspiration in all hydrological years except in the sd years in detail under the plastic film mulch conditions compared with the d1 treatment the d5 treatment significantly increased maize evapotranspiration by 21 3 22 2 28 1 and 26 8 mm in md n mw and sw years respectively in addition increasing plant density from 60 000 plant ha 1 to 90 000 plant ha 1 reduced average evaporation by 7 3 8 5 mm under plastic film mulch conditions and 30 8 39 6 mm without mulch across the simulated years indicating that the decreased value of evaporation from 60 000 plant ha 1 to 90 000 plant ha 1 under plastic film mulch was significantly lower than that without mulch the reason for reducing soil evaporation in higher plant density treatment was that higher plant density resulted in higher plant height and lai which caused more shadow on the soil surface and then decreased soil evaporation additionally compared with non mulch plastic film mulch reduced the exposed soil surface area causing less soil evaporation and thus leading to a smaller decrease of soil evaporation with the increase of plant density higher soil water stress coefficient values were observed in the mw and sw years indicating that maize suffered less water stress in the mw and sw years it is reasonable that more rainfall could alleviate the soil water stress for crop growth in addition compared with non mulch plastic film mulch significantly increased the average soil water stress coefficient by 0 10 0 08 0 07 0 06 and 0 03 in the sd md n mw and sw years respectively in this study this result was reasonable because plastic film mulch reduced soil invalid evaporation and augmented the soil water storage and then relieved the soil water stress zhu et al 2015 chen et al 2019 additionally the soil water stress coefficient value decreased with the increase in plant density indicating that higher plant density may result in more soil water stress the reason for this was probably that increasing planting density augmented the individual competition of maize plants for soil water trachsel et al 2016 4 3 effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize yield water productivity and net profit the year types had a significant influence on maize yield and maize water productivity in general maize yield increased first and then decreased with the increase in precipitation and the highest yield was observed in the mw year instead of the sw year this result confirmed that more precipitation did not always cause high yields ren et al 2016 other weather variables such as the distribution of precipitation and air temperature may also influence maize yield and water productivity to further study the influence of weather variables on maize yield in this study the multiple linear regression model was established to calculate the explained variance of yield by weather variables fig 8 the results showed that the top three weather variables which explained more than 10 of the variance of maize yield were the maximum temperature the rainfall and the distribution of precipitation respectively we further explored the relationship between precipitation maximum air temperature and coefficient of variation of precipitation and maize growth i e maximum lai and yield fig s10 the result also showed the air temperature and coefficient of variation of precipitation also had significant impacts on maize growth additionally the parabolic relationships between precipitation maximum air temperature and distribution of precipitation and maize growth were found fig s10 indicating that as the increase in precipitation maximum air temperature and coefficient of variation of precipitation the maize growth and yield increased first and then decreased therefore the reason that the highest yield in the mw year was probably that the maximum temperature and distribution of rainfall in the mw year were lower than those in the sw year fig s2 the maize yield and water productivity under plastic film mulch were 5 9 17 4 and 32 1 43 2 higher than those without mulch respectively dang et al 2016 and sun et al 2019a also reported that plastic film mulch significantly increased maize yield and water use efficiency the reason for this result is probably that plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration improved aboveground biomass and alleviated soil water stress liu et al 2014 although compared with non mulch plastic film mulch improved maize yield in all hydrological years in wet years e g the mw and sw years the increased value of maize yield by plastic film mulch was significantly lower than that in normal and dry years the reason may be that in wet years crops can obtain sufficient water for growth even without plastic film mulch this result indicated that the benefits of plastic film mulch in wet years might be lower than those in normal and dry years in addition another important reason for higher maize yield in treatment with plastic film mulch was that it augmented soil temperature significantly sun et al 2018 although in this study the soil temperature was not simulated our previous field experimental studies showed that the plastic film mulch just had a significant influence on soil temperature at the seeding and jointing stage in which the average soil temperature in 0 30 cm was improved by 1 3 and 0 2 respectively the reason for increasing soil temperature by plastic film mulching was that the plastic film mulch reduces the exchange of sensible heat between soil and air zhang et al 2005 and that higher air moisture under film mulching resulted in the greenhouse effect bu et al 2013 many previous studies have demonstrated that increased plant density could significantly improve maize yield and water productivity han et al 2015 however the optimal plant density of maize varied depending on regions and hydrological years in northeast china the optimal plant density in different hydrological years was scarcely explored by previous studies in this study the recently developed model ahc was used to explore the optimal plant density for maize cultivation in different hydrological years and the result showed that under the non mulch conditions the highest yield was obtained in the 75 000 plants ha 1 in the sd and md years and the 825 000 plants ha 1 treatment in the n mw and sw years under the non mulch conditions the maize populations with the highest yield in this study were higher than those in the study of ren et al 2016 who reported that in the loess plateau of china for a cultivar of zhengdan 958 the optimal maize plant population was 32 500 plants ha 1 in the sd years 52 500 plants ha 1 in the md years and 67 500 plants ha 1 in the n mw and sw years the differences in weather conditions and maize cultivars in those two regions were the main reasons for that the higher optimal maize population in our study was higher than that in the study of ren et al 2016 moreover the optimal maize plant density under plastic film conditions in different hydrological years was scarcely evaluated in the previous studies ren et al 2019 in this study under the plastic film mulch the highest maize yield was observed in the 82 500 plants ha 1 treatment in the sd md and n years and in the 90 000 plants ha 1 treatment in the mw and sw years it is worth noting that in the dry years the sd and md years and the wet years the sw and mw years the plant densities with the highest yield under the plastic film mulch conditions were higher than those under the non mulch conditions fig 6f j the reason is probably that plastic film mulch can reduce soil invalid evaporation and then increase soil water storage and alleviate the limitations of high density planting antonietta et al 2014 mansfield and mumm 2014 this agreed with liu et al 2014 who found that plastic film mulch with high plant density can augment maize yield in a semiarid region the effect of plant densities and plastic film mulch on maize economic return was scarcely evaluated in different hydrological years in this study the net profit of plant densities and plastic film mulch were calculated and found that plastic film did not constantly improve maize net profit in the n mw and sw years when the maize population was lower than 75 000 plants ha 1 the net profit of plastic film mulch treatments was lower than those of non mulch treatments the main reason for this result was that the increased net profit from plastic film mulch did not offset the cost of the plastic film when the maize population was low however in all hydrological years the treatment with the highest net profit was observed under plastic film mulch conditions in addition according to the relation between plant density and net profit the optimal plant densities with the highest net profit were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 in the sd ms n mw and sw years respectively fig 8 5 conclusion this research adopted the ahc model to simulate soil water dynamics maize height lai aboveground biomass and yield under various plastic film mulch and plant density conditions in different hydrological years the coupling effects of plastic film mulch and plant density on maize water consumption aboveground biomass yield water productivity and net profit were further analyzed the results showed that the ahc model could model maize water consumption and maize growth under plastic film mulch and high plant density conditions the average maize yields in the severely dry moderately dry normal moderately wet and severely wet years were 11440 3 13685 4 13821 5 14704 8 and 14014 3 kg ha 1 respectively compared with non mulch treatments plastic film mulch increased the maize basal crop coefficient and decreased the soil evaporation coefficient thus plastic film mulch augmented maize transpiration and reduced soil evaporation across the simulated years compared with non mulch treatments ultimately the maize yield under plastic film mulch was 5 9 17 4 significantly higher than that without mulch under plastic film mulch there were significant parabolic relations between plant density and net profit according to those parabolic relations the optimal plant densities with the highest net profit were 91 101 101 105 and 101 thousand plants ha 1 respectively for the sd ms n mw and sw years under plastic film mulch declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9149,water scarcity has been a critical constraint limiting china s food security and sustainable development previous research mostly focused on water consumption and neglected the water quality constraints on water usability this study conducts a life cycle assessment based water availability footprint analysis and footprint transfer evaluation of typical agricultural products i e grains in china during 2019 2020 from the perspective of consumption pollution integration a summary of the normalized water availability footprint result of china s annual grain production in 2019 was 1 28 based on the chinese regional benchmark the resource health and ecosystem damages accounted for 42 61 36 52 and 20 87 of the total normalized results direct irrigation water consumption played a significant role in footprint result nearly 90 pollution caused by mercury emissions contributed 9 15 to the footprint result the high footprint results were concentrated in the main grain production regions e g shandong and henan and arid region i e xinjiang furthermore the water availability footprint transfer of china s interprovincial grain trade was 0 32 during 2019 2020 heilongjiang and inner mongolia provinces were the largest footprint exporters whereas shandong and guangdong provinces were the largest importers meanwhile a negative footprint benefit was generated at the national level an increase of 3 88 10 2 in footprint result was noted and this was mainly ascribed to the grain exportation of xinjiang province conversely heilongjiang was the largest footprint benefit exporting province it is necessary to simultaneously evaluate the adverse water availability impacts caused by combined water consumption and pollutants it is important to scientifically recognize the key influencing factors based on the consistent normalization benchmark keywords water availability footprint grain china pollution normalization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is a critical environmental issue worldwide it hinders the achievement of sustainable development goals rosa et al 2020 un 2015 currently 1 42 billion people with 450 million children are threatened by high or extremely high water vulnerability unicef 2021 in the coming decades water scarcity will be exacerbated in many regions of the world because of socio economic development and climate change greve et al 2018 which indicates that the alleviation of this problem is urgent particularly in china the mismatch between available water resources and water demand intensifies regional water scarcity which threatens sustainable regional development cai et al 2019 agriculture the most water intensive industry in which grain accounts for the highest proportion could be a strong lever to alleviate china s water scarcity dilemma li et al 2021a nbs 2020 in addition to the increase in water demand water quality degradation is observed particularly in northern china wang et al 2017 inadequate water quality further aggravates china s water scarcity ma et al 2020 meanwhile water consumption and various pollutant emissions are inseparably linked with grain products during their entire life cycle zhai et al 2021b thus integrated assessments that consider both water quantity and quality from a life cycle perspective are crucial for proposing targeted policy interventions to address water scarcity in a regional to the global context water footprint is a comprehensive and multidimensional indicator that helps with visualizing hidden water use and is instrumental in addressing issues of freshwater scarcity and pollution hoekstra et al 2011 most of the previous studies on grain production were conducted at the inventory level by adopting blue green and gray water footprint indicators characterizing irrigation water consumption precipitation consumption and direct emissions from fertilizer application respectively wang et al 2019a luan et al 2018 cao et al 2021 mao et al 2021 in terms of water scarcity analysis zhang et al 2018b applied the water stress index proposed by pfister et al 2009 to quantify the water scarcity footprint derived from blue water consumption of crop production in lake dianchi basin china on the basis of the blue water scarcity index defined by hoekstra et al 2012 zhuo et al 2016 reported that the yellow river basin china experienced moderate to severe blue water scarcity from january to july due to crop production cao et al 2017 defined the agricultural water stress index as the ratio of the total water footprint including blue green and gray to agricultural water resource availability they adopted this index in the evaluation of china s crop production the abovementioned research only concerns the direct process by contrast zhai et al 2019 first incorporated direct and indirect water consumption into water scarcity accounting of grain production in accordance with iso standard iso 2014 iso 14046 recommends water footprint accounting via life cycle assessment approach and proposed the use of a water availability footprint indicator dedicated to the potential environmental impact evaluations related to water availability iso 2014 unlike the water scarcity footprint which only focuses on water quantity iso 2014 indicates that water quantity and quality should be simultaneously considered in the water availability footprint despite the recognition of the implications of pollution on water scarcity few studies quantified the pollution related water scarcity impact by linking the life cycle pollutant emissions with water quality requirements zhai et al 2022 this study remains at the national level and the impact of inadequate water quality derived from grain production on water scarcity in specific regions within china remains unclear addressing water scarcity related to grain products requires attention to water efficiency efforts from a production perspective and flow pattern optimization from a trade perspective academically virtual water flow has been studied by many scholars from different perspectives such as flow pattern analysis dalin et al 2014 fu et al 2018 driving factor exploration song et al 2020 sun et al 2022 li et al 2021b benefit estimation wang et al 2019b sun et al 2019 and the improvement of optimization simulation wang et al 2019c an et al 2021 qian et al 2020 to our best knowledge no study has performed an integrated flow analysis of water quantity and quality from the environmental perspective which would offer more comprehensive insights into the performance of china s interprovincial grain trade normalization is suggested to compare several impact categories of water availability footprint on the same scale iso 2006 2014 this step can facilitate communication with stakeholders and support decision making crenna et al 2019 however most life cycle assessment related studies in china adopted normalization references around the world due to the lack of regional values bai et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 leading to a less accurate decision process several studies adopted the chinese normalization references reported by yang and nielsen 2001 who established this benchmark based on national environmental emissions in 1990 nevertheless the abovementioned normalization references were not applicable to china s status quo thus boundary consistent time efficient and site specific normalization value sets are urgently required for systematically and scientifically identifying important impact categories and solving the tradeoff between results this study aimed to improve the water availability footprint analysis framework by extending the ranges i e water quantity and quality and perspectives i e direct and indirect through the normalization procedure this study aimed to identify the key factors of water availability footprint results of china s grain products explore the critical transfer routes from an environmental perspective and propose precise agricultural management suggestions and differentiated decision making 2 methodology 2 1 system boundary and functional unit fig 1 shows the system boundary of this study which included the cradle to gate unit processes of grain production irrigation water consumption agricultural material including fertilizer pesticide and agricultural film

production e g straw treatment were excluded from the system boundary annual main grain i e wheat maize and rice yield was identified as the functional unit which served as a quantified benchmark for all inputs and outputs of the studied system 2 2 inventory and data sources the life cycle water consumption and the pollution during grain production were involved in this study to realize entire life cycle traceability the water consumption included the consumption of direct and indirect water direct water i e irrigation water consumption was calculated on the basis of the chinese meteorological data cma 2022 and crop parameters e g grain yield planting area and effective irrigation area nbs 2020 by using the usda method smith et al 1992 and the penman monteith model allen et al 1998 indirect water consumption was derived from the upstream processes of grain production and calculated using eq 1 1 i w k 1 n p k k 1 n r 1 n m 1 n p k r m where iw means the amount of indirect

involved r to m means the upstream processes of p k which were determined from the chinese regional life cycle inventory database zhang et al 2016 in terms of pollution this study considered the life cycle pollutant emissions during grain production the fertilizer and pesticide losses were calculated on the basis of the emission coefficients from cfpc 2009a 2009b pollutant emission data from upstream processes of grain production were provided by the chinese regional life cycle inventory database zhang et al 2016 on the basis of the life cycle pollutant data the dilution water was calculated using eq 2 2 d w max m s f f s w a t e r c s max c s n a t where dw is the amount of dilution water m3 m s refers to the life cycle emission of pollutant s kg ff s water c s max and c s nat represent the fate factor maximum acceptable concentration kg m3 and natural concentration kg m3 of pollutant s in water respectively china s geography and environmental situations e g wind speed soil type and temperature were considered in the calculation of the fate factors of pollutants zhang et al 2016 the national water availability footprint inventory of grain production based on the functional unit and system boundary and the calculated indirect and dilution water data are shown in table s1 2 3 2 3 water availability footprint evaluation an impact oriented water availability footprint evaluation via the life cycle assessment method could contribute to comparative analysis and accurately explore major contributors pfister et al 2017 and it is recommended by the international organization for standardization iso 2014 the steps for water availability footprint analysis included characterization and normalization the characterization phase was performed at two dimensions namely midpoint and endpoint levels the water scarcity category was adopted to represent the water quantity and quality related water availability at the midpoint level eq 3 3 w s i w c i t c f i t where ws refers to the water scarcity impact m3 deprived wc is the water consumption m3 cf is the characterization factor m3 deprived m3 which was based on the china s regional water resource situation e g freshwater withdrawals and evaporation zhai et al 2021b and the wave model berger et al 2018 i and t are the region and water type i e direct indirect and dilution water respectively three protection targets i e human health ecosystem quality and resources were considered at the endpoint level the human health and ecosystem quality categories were deduced by the water scarcity category on the basis of the recipe 2016 model huijbregts et al 2017 and china s regional information i e human development index and agricultural water use fractions zhai et al 2021a damage on resources was assessed on the basis of water resource fee and computed as follows 4 r e i i r i p i i w i d w i p a v e i r i p i i w i d w i p i q i q i where re i refers to the resources impact of province i ir i iw i and dw i represent the amount of irrigation water indirect water and dilution water for grain production of province i respectively m3 p i and p ave are the provincial and average water resource fees m3 respectively which were acquired from the standard released by the chinese government ndrc 2013 q i is the provincial water resource endowment m3 from the water resources bulletin mwr 2018 to allow comparison across multi categories the normalization procedure was conducted in this study as follows 5 n f c w a f c o b j w a f c c h i n a where nf c refers to the normalization value of category c waf c obj and waf c china are the water availability footprint results of category c for the research objective and chinese regional inventory respectively the chinese regional inventory of water including agricultural industrial livelihood and ecological water consumption and emissions originating from energy consumption industrial production agricultural production and waste disposal is shown in supplementary material s2 2 4 water availability footprint transfer analysis on the basis of the interprovincial flow of grain trade and the normalized water availability footprint results of exporting regions the water availability footprint transfer embodied in the grain trade was calculated as follows 6 a 0 x 12 x 1 j x 2 1 0 x 2 j x i 1 x i 2 x i j b w a f 1 w a f 2 w a f i t a b 0 x 1 2 w a f 1 x 1 j w a f 1 w a f 1 j 1 n x 1 j x 2 1 w a f 2 0 x 2 j w a f 2 w a f 2 j 1 n x 2 j x i 1 w a f i x i 2 w a f i x i j w a f i w a f i j 1 n x i j i 1 m x i

footprint matrix respectively x i j represents the grain quantity shipped from province i to j ton which was derived from zhai et al 2021a waf i means the normalized water availability footprint of unit grain production in exporting region i in consideration of the regional disparity of water availability footprint results quantification of the related benefits of the grain trade from a comparative perspective was imperative the benefits of water availability footprint of the grain trade were calculated by subtracting the footprint value of the exporting area from that of the importing area multiplied by the trade volume as follows 7 b e i j w a f j w a f i x i j where be i j means the water availability footprint benefit caused by grain trade from province i to j the meanings of waf and x i j are similar to those in eq 6 a value of 0 implies environmental benefits whereas a value of 0 indicates the increase of environmental impacts compared with the no trade scenario further information related to the quantification procedures for water availability footprint and transfer analysis is provided in the technology roadmap in fig s2 3 results 3 1 water availability footprint evaluation the potential impact for annual grain production in 2019 was 7 61 1010 m3 deprived on the water scarcity midpoint for the endpoint the values of human health ecosystem quality and resources were 1 63 105 daly 0 65 species yr and 8 70 109 respectively combined with the footprint results of chinese regional inventory i e human health 3 48 105 daly ecosystem quality 2 43 species yr resources 1 59 1010 the summary of normalized water availability footprint results was 1 28 3 1 1 key factor analysis to trace the source of water availability footprint results the influences of key factors i e categories substances and processes are shown in fig 2 for categories the resources human health and ecosystem quality contributed 42 61 36 52 and 20 87 to the total normalized footprint results respectively in terms of substances irrigation water comprised the largest proportion 89 81 the contributions of irrigation water to the resources human health and ecosystem quality damages were 93 56 88 60 and 84 29 respectively approximately 98 of irrigation water consumption originated from the direct process and the proportion for seed production stage was 2 dilution water closely associated with mercury emissions was the secondary substance that affected resources human health and ecosystem quality damages with proportions of 5 55 10 84 and 13 54 respectively for dilution water consumption potash fertilizer production accounted for the largest proportion 80 88 followed by productions of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers indirect water also provided 1 04 of the total damage of which the contribution of phosphate fertilizer production was dominant 3 1 2 spatial variations fig 3 displays the spatial distribution of grain production and water availability footprint results in 2019 at the provincial level in terms of grain production fig 3a heilongjiang 66 24 mt henan 65 02 mt and shandong 51 90 mt provinces were the top three contributors and responsible for 10 97 10 76 and 8 59 of the national total respectively the relative lower values of grain production were observed in shanghai qinghai beijing and tibet provinces the spatial patterns of water availability footprint differed significantly among the three endpoint categories fig 3b shandong province was in the forefront of all provinces in terms of three endpoint categories excluding shandong province xinjiang and hebei provinces were the hotspots of human health damage while the areas with high ecosystem quality damage were clustered in the north china plain which included henan shandong anhui jiangsu and hebei provinces the high level regions of resources damage were the henan and shandong provinces as shown in fig 3c the normalized water availability footprint results were obtained from shandong henan xinjiang and hebei provinces the higher rankings for shandong henan and hebei provinces were due to multiple factors e g higher yield and scarce water resources while the serious water deficiency during the grain growth period was responsible for the considerable irrigation demand and higher footprint result in xinjiang province low water availability footprint results were concentrated in the developed regions e g beijing and shanghai because of the dominance of service industries and in western areas e g tibet and qinghai due to lower grain yields affected by water resource endowment xinjiang and sichuan provinces indicated a remarkable inconsistency in spatial variations between grain production and the related footprint results figs 3a and 3c 3 2 water availability footprint transfer the total water availability footprint transfer of the grain trade was 0 32 which accounted for approximately 25 of the total normalized footprint result of grain production meanwhile approximately 3 88 10 2 of the environmental burden was added by the current pattern of china s interprovincial grain trade in comparison with the no grain trade scenario 3 2 1 key transfer route analysis fig 4 presents the main direction of china s interprovincial grain trade and embodied water availability footprint transfer as shown in fig 4a heilongjiang province to guangdong province had the largest grain trade at a volume of 3 36 mt followed by heilongjiang province to shandong province jilin and inner mongolia provinces were also principal grain exporters and mainly transferred to shandong and guangdong provinces the largest grain importers were guangdong and shandong provinces which obtained support from heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia henan xinjiang yunnan liaoning and shanxi provinces the flow from heilongjiang province to guangxi zhejiang and fujian provinces from jilin province to jiangsu province and from jiangxi province to zhejiang province also contributed to the interprovincial grain trade pattern regarding water availability footprint transfer fig 4b the flow from xinjiang province to shandong province was the highest accounting for 5 80 of the total transfer value followed by xinjiang province to guangdong province 4 50 the grain exportation from inner mongolia province to shandong and guangdong provinces played a significant role in water availability footprint transfer xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces were also major sources of water availability footprint inflows into jiangsu jiangxi guangxi hunan and hubei provinces similar to the grain trade shandong and guangdong provinces had the largest inflow of water availability footprint and outsourced their external footprint to xinjiang inner mongolia shanxi henan hebei and gansu provinces moreover the flow of shandong province to shanxi and beijing provinces from henan province to hunan province and from jiangsu province to zhejiang province also contributed slightly to the total water availability footprint transfer the obvious discrepancies in grain trade and water availability footprint transfer were observed from the perspective of outflow fig 4a and 4b heilongjiang province was the primary grain exporting province xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces were the regions with the largest values of footprint outflow which were mainly ascribed to higher footprint results and maize exportation respectively in terms of inflow areas shandong and guangdong provinces had the largest proportion in both grain import and water availability footprint inflow because of considerable maize demand ngoic 2020 3 2 2 benefit analysis analysis results on water availability footprint benefits at the provincial level from the perspective of grain exportation are shown in fig 5 eleven provinces showed environmental benefits at a total value of 7 69 10 2 which was mainly ascribed to the exportation of grain from heilongjiang province with about 26 contribution the exportation of grain from jilin hubei anhui and jiangxi provinces presented obvious benefits on water availability footprint with 11 28 18 60 of the total benefits exporting grain from other six provinces e g hunan and qinghai additionally contributed to water availability footprint benefits the exportation of 12 provinces contributed to the increase of environmental impact approximately 46 of which was attributed to the exporting grain from xinjiang province the exporting grain from inner mongolia shanxi and henan provinces exhibited substantial contributions to the environmental deterioration the exporting grain from other eight provinces e g hebei and tibet caused slight increases in water availability footprint the detailed information is shown in supplementary material s3 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis results of implementing a 5 reduction in substances i e irrigation water dilution water and indirect water on national water availability footprint results and benefits are presented in fig 6 the irrigation water had the greatest sensitivity to water availability footprint fig 6a controlling irrigation water consumption of shandong and henan provinces exhibited remarkable benefits to the footprint results a 5 decrease in the irrigation water in the above mentioned provinces brought 0 71 and 0 67 reductions in water availability footprints respectively xinjiang and hebei provinces played decisive roles in the reduction of national footprint results followed by jiangsu inner mongolia anhui heilongjiang shanxi and hunan provinces the variation in irrigation water of the remaining provinces resulted in relatively small benefits 0 1 to footprint results in terms of dilution water optimizing agricultural material production showed a slight sensitivity to the water availability footprint reduction especially for henan shandong heilongjiang and anhui provinces by contrast indirect water had a minimal contribution to the reduction of the overall footprint results as shown in fig 6b maize trade was the most sensitive to changes in water availability footprint benefits of the grain trade xinjiang province exhibited the greatest sensitivity in which 7 87 of the potential environmental impact could be avoided by reducing 5 of the irrigation water consumption in maize production in this province a similar remarkable variation was observed in the control of irrigation water of maize production in inner mongolia province the reduction of irrigation water in maize production of shanxi and henan provinces played effective roles in improving the water availability footprint benefits improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water of wheat production of shandong province showed additional sensitivity in the improvement of the environmental benefits optimizing irrigation water from the remaining provinces only had a slight influence the highest variation of dilution water on footprint benefits was observed in the maize production of heilongjiang province whereas indirect water exhibited the lowest variation for the decrease of the overall footprint benefits therefore shandong henan xinjiang hebei inner mongolia and shanxi provinces were the core regions where the consumption of irrigation water and dilution water can be controlled to improve the performance of national water availability footprint 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous research obvious differences in system boundary inventory calculation method and footprint evaluation content were observed in this study in comparison with previous studies the national irrigation water value currently shown is lower than the value reported by cao et al 2021 and this difference is related to the system boundary in this study three main grains i e wheat maize and rice in china were involved while cao et al 2021 considered beans and tubers in addition to the three main grains for the calculation of dilution water most previous studies only focused on direct water pollution e g fertilizer leaching cai et al 2022 li et al 2020b whereas this study evaluated the water pollution from a life cycle perspective and considered the cross media transfer of pollutants thus nitrogen was closely associated with gray water in the previous water footprint research on agriculture cai et al 2022 li et al 2020b whereas the dilution water in this study was ascribed to mercury emission in water availability footprint analysis huang et al 2014 only considered the water scarcity impact caused by water consumption whereas this study improved the methodology framework by integrating water consumption and pollution in accordance with the iso standard iso 2014 moreover in contrast to the multi indicators adopted in previous impact oriented footprint evaluation studies borsato et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the normalized value was obtained in this study through normalization procedure effectively coping with the trade off among different indicators in footprint analysis 4 2 sustainable irrigation water management transformation pathway toward more sustainable irrigation water management is a priority because of the significant contribution of irrigation water to water availability footprint results fig 2 the chinese government focused on the promotion of water saving irrigation technology to reduce water loss including leakage and evaporation from water source to final crop use state council 2012 moa 2021 more than 54 of the irrigated land of china has adopted sprinkler micro low pressure pipe irrigation and other high efficiency water saving technologies nbs 2020 among those technologies micro irrigation could more effectively reduce irrigation water consumption by limiting soil evaporation wang et al 2019a and its water saving efficiency was about 60 70 followed by sprinkler 50 and pipe irrigation 20 30 he et al 2021 in 2020 sprinkler and micro irrigation area reached approximately 11 82 million ha accounting for 31 of the national total value of china mwr 2021 which was still far lower than that of the united states spain and israel he et al 2021 the chinese government needs to further promote water saving irrigation and prioritize the micro irrigation projects according to local conditions for provinces in which the groundwater is overexploited such as shandong henan and hebei promoting micro sprinkling irrigation is a feasible measure for increasing water use efficiency and grain yield li et al 2019 rainfall scarce regions e g xinjiang should facilitate the development of drip irrigation under the plastic film to reduce water evaporation zong et al 2021 to promote the widespread use of water saving irrigation technologies enhancing water conservancy infrastructure is also important the operation mechanism with the government as a dominant investor with society as a supplementary investor and with the active participation of farmers and other stakeholders should be vigorously promoted to ensure the high quality development of water conservancy infrastructure zhang et al 2018a furthermore the construction of infrastructure was the focus and few concerns about management thereby impeding the long term stable operation of the project mwr 2022 thus establishing a fund integrated water resource fee income operation income and financial subsidies is suggested for the management and maintenance of water conservancy infrastructure 4 3 effective reductions in dilution water the results demonstrated that dilution water i e mercury emissions originating from potash fertilizer production had an effective influence on water availability footprint result fig 2 coal based power as the dominant source of atmospheric mercury emissions was adopted in potash fertilizer production process considering its predominance in china s power grid chen et al 2018 china s large stocks of cheap coal and power plants indicate that coal based power will still dominate electricity generation for a long time guo et al 2020 shan et al 2018 and plays increasingly important roles in mercury emissions under this circumstance ultra low emission retrofit was identified as the most effective mercury emission abatement measure in china li et al 2020a ultra low emission of coal fired power plant plan was issued by the chinese government in 2015 to control emission concentrations of particulates sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides mee 2015 this policy has been demonstrated to generate synergetic benefits for mercury emission abatement wu et al 2016 in addition the emission limit is a significant index for the supervision and inspection of emission control the current standard of mercury emission for the coal fired power plant in china has a limit of 30 μg m3 which was higher than those in canada and the united states wu et al 2018 with the accomplishment of ultra low emission retrofit it is urgent to research the mercury emission level of china s coal fired power plants and formulate a new emission standard referring to advanced standards of developed countries in summary ultra low emission retrofit and strict emission limit standards for power plants are suggested 4 4 optimization of water availability footprint transfer from a trade perspective the current water availability footprint transfer pattern is adverse to the environment on the national level however exporting grain from parts of provinces shows environment friendliness to the water availability footprint fig 5 although the grain exportation from heilongjiang province was the largest fig 4a the footprint result per unit of grain production was relatively low fig s3 so it contributed greatly to the footprint benefits in the country fig 5 these substantial benefits were mainly ascribed to the maize and rice trade link from heilongjiang provinces to north china plain fig s4 previous research also demonstrated the superiority of heilongjiang province in rice and maize production in terms of returns to scale wang et al 2018 heilongjiang province needs to further strengthen the grain production capacity in the superior areas and implement various water saving irrigation measures to exert advantages and enhance the benefits meanwhile accelerating the centralized development of factors of production such as land labor capital and equipment in the superior areas needs to be done hppg 2017 in contrast exporting maize from xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces generates a substantial burden figs 5 and 6 which was due to the mismatch of maize production and consumption and high unit water availability footprint values in these regions hence optimizing the regional planting structure i e the appropriate decrease of the maize area and strengthening the popularization of water saving technologies are the key paths to ensuring the sustainable development of grain for xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces in terms of grain importation guangdong province which has abundant water resources still imports plenty of water intensive products nbs 2020 the reason for this phenomenon is that arable land plays a more decisive role in grain production than water wang et al 2019b thus high tech agriculture should be vigorously developed in this region to overcome the arable land limitation song et al 2020 moreover regional balance and sustainable development cannot be ignored the water availability footprint transfers from less developed to more developed regions under the current trade pattern fig 4 which generates a serious negative externality problem the establishment of an interprovincial financial compensation mechanism is an effective policy tool to solve this problem meanwhile such compensation should be implemented with environmental considerations such as water scarcity in mind 4 5 mitigation uncertainty in the normalization procedure normalization is an optional step within the life cycle assessment that could help interpret the life cycle impact assessment results it was introduced in this study to solve the tradeoffs among water availability footprint results notably calculations of the normalization benchmark show large uncertainty which is caused by a combination of uncertainties in normalization inventory and modeling pizzol et al 2017 sleeswijk et al 2008 in terms of normalization inventory this study developed a normalization inventory of emissions and water consumption at a country level i e china which included critical industrial activities supplementary material s2 compared with previous normalization references reported by yang and nielsen 2001 the completeness of the national normalization inventory has been greatly improved in this study the expansion of emission registration by government policy should be promoted to further reduce uncertainty of normalization inventory apart from inventory modeling approach is also a source of uncertainty of normalization sleeswijk et al 2008 the consistency of modeling is more important than the completeness of the normalization inventory for normalization purpose hélias and servien 2021 if an integrated water availability and degradation footprint model was applied to the characterization of the normalization inventory built in this study table s2 then resources category dominates the total normalized footprint results 0 81 with 67 39 contribution followed by human health damage the influence of ecosystem quality was nearly negligible supplementary material s7 these analyses highlighted the necessity of ensuring the consistency of modelling e g boundaries and hypotheses to diminish uncertainty 4 6 limitations and future work the current analysis still has certain limitations first limited by data availability this study quantified the fertilizer and pesticide loss on the basis of the first national pollution source survey future research should enhance the temporal accuracy of the dataset second in terms of water availability footprint methodology the chinese regional inventory applied in the normalization procedure needs to be improved to enhance the accuracy and reliability of results in future work third this study only covered 1 year data and did not capture the annual variability in water availability footprint results and transfers of grain products the impact of annual variations in agricultural production meteorological conditions and trade patterns on footprint results requires further evaluation 5 conclusions this study explored the regional disparity of water availability footprint results and transfers of china s grain products from the integrated perspective of water consumption and pollution this research revealed the following findings the normalized water availability footprint of china s grain production in 2019 was 1 28 the prominent contribution of direct irrigation water about 90 reflected the urgency of promoting the implementation of water saving technologies and enhancing water conservancy infrastructure mercury emission responsible for life cycle dilution water consumption contributed 9 15 to the footprint results mercury control strategies such as ultralow emission retrofit and strict emission limit standards for electricity generation are highly recommended the spatial distribution showed the relative consistency of footprint results and grain production for most of the provinces except xinjiang and sichuan the water availability footprint transfer of china s interprovincial grain trade during 2019 2020 was 0 32 the environmental burden increased by 3 88 10 2 on a national scale compared with the no grain trade scenario the footprint benefits and burdens were mainly ascribed to the grain trade from heilongjiang province 26 and xinjiang province 46 respectively strengthening the production capacity of preponderant provinces e g heilongjiang adjusting the planting scale of non superior regions e g xinjiang and inner mongolia and promoting the development of high tech agriculture in arable land limited regions e g guangdong were suggested for the amelioration of the negative externality problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9149,water scarcity has been a critical constraint limiting china s food security and sustainable development previous research mostly focused on water consumption and neglected the water quality constraints on water usability this study conducts a life cycle assessment based water availability footprint analysis and footprint transfer evaluation of typical agricultural products i e grains in china during 2019 2020 from the perspective of consumption pollution integration a summary of the normalized water availability footprint result of china s annual grain production in 2019 was 1 28 based on the chinese regional benchmark the resource health and ecosystem damages accounted for 42 61 36 52 and 20 87 of the total normalized results direct irrigation water consumption played a significant role in footprint result nearly 90 pollution caused by mercury emissions contributed 9 15 to the footprint result the high footprint results were concentrated in the main grain production regions e g shandong and henan and arid region i e xinjiang furthermore the water availability footprint transfer of china s interprovincial grain trade was 0 32 during 2019 2020 heilongjiang and inner mongolia provinces were the largest footprint exporters whereas shandong and guangdong provinces were the largest importers meanwhile a negative footprint benefit was generated at the national level an increase of 3 88 10 2 in footprint result was noted and this was mainly ascribed to the grain exportation of xinjiang province conversely heilongjiang was the largest footprint benefit exporting province it is necessary to simultaneously evaluate the adverse water availability impacts caused by combined water consumption and pollutants it is important to scientifically recognize the key influencing factors based on the consistent normalization benchmark keywords water availability footprint grain china pollution normalization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity is a critical environmental issue worldwide it hinders the achievement of sustainable development goals rosa et al 2020 un 2015 currently 1 42 billion people with 450 million children are threatened by high or extremely high water vulnerability unicef 2021 in the coming decades water scarcity will be exacerbated in many regions of the world because of socio economic development and climate change greve et al 2018 which indicates that the alleviation of this problem is urgent particularly in china the mismatch between available water resources and water demand intensifies regional water scarcity which threatens sustainable regional development cai et al 2019 agriculture the most water intensive industry in which grain accounts for the highest proportion could be a strong lever to alleviate china s water scarcity dilemma li et al 2021a nbs 2020 in addition to the increase in water demand water quality degradation is observed particularly in northern china wang et al 2017 inadequate water quality further aggravates china s water scarcity ma et al 2020 meanwhile water consumption and various pollutant emissions are inseparably linked with grain products during their entire life cycle zhai et al 2021b thus integrated assessments that consider both water quantity and quality from a life cycle perspective are crucial for proposing targeted policy interventions to address water scarcity in a regional to the global context water footprint is a comprehensive and multidimensional indicator that helps with visualizing hidden water use and is instrumental in addressing issues of freshwater scarcity and pollution hoekstra et al 2011 most of the previous studies on grain production were conducted at the inventory level by adopting blue green and gray water footprint indicators characterizing irrigation water consumption precipitation consumption and direct emissions from fertilizer application respectively wang et al 2019a luan et al 2018 cao et al 2021 mao et al 2021 in terms of water scarcity analysis zhang et al 2018b applied the water stress index proposed by pfister et al 2009 to quantify the water scarcity footprint derived from blue water consumption of crop production in lake dianchi basin china on the basis of the blue water scarcity index defined by hoekstra et al 2012 zhuo et al 2016 reported that the yellow river basin china experienced moderate to severe blue water scarcity from january to july due to crop production cao et al 2017 defined the agricultural water stress index as the ratio of the total water footprint including blue green and gray to agricultural water resource availability they adopted this index in the evaluation of china s crop production the abovementioned research only concerns the direct process by contrast zhai et al 2019 first incorporated direct and indirect water consumption into water scarcity accounting of grain production in accordance with iso standard iso 2014 iso 14046 recommends water footprint accounting via life cycle assessment approach and proposed the use of a water availability footprint indicator dedicated to the potential environmental impact evaluations related to water availability iso 2014 unlike the water scarcity footprint which only focuses on water quantity iso 2014 indicates that water quantity and quality should be simultaneously considered in the water availability footprint despite the recognition of the implications of pollution on water scarcity few studies quantified the pollution related water scarcity impact by linking the life cycle pollutant emissions with water quality requirements zhai et al 2022 this study remains at the national level and the impact of inadequate water quality derived from grain production on water scarcity in specific regions within china remains unclear addressing water scarcity related to grain products requires attention to water efficiency efforts from a production perspective and flow pattern optimization from a trade perspective academically virtual water flow has been studied by many scholars from different perspectives such as flow pattern analysis dalin et al 2014 fu et al 2018 driving factor exploration song et al 2020 sun et al 2022 li et al 2021b benefit estimation wang et al 2019b sun et al 2019 and the improvement of optimization simulation wang et al 2019c an et al 2021 qian et al 2020 to our best knowledge no study has performed an integrated flow analysis of water quantity and quality from the environmental perspective which would offer more comprehensive insights into the performance of china s interprovincial grain trade normalization is suggested to compare several impact categories of water availability footprint on the same scale iso 2006 2014 this step can facilitate communication with stakeholders and support decision making crenna et al 2019 however most life cycle assessment related studies in china adopted normalization references around the world due to the lack of regional values bai et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 leading to a less accurate decision process several studies adopted the chinese normalization references reported by yang and nielsen 2001 who established this benchmark based on national environmental emissions in 1990 nevertheless the abovementioned normalization references were not applicable to china s status quo thus boundary consistent time efficient and site specific normalization value sets are urgently required for systematically and scientifically identifying important impact categories and solving the tradeoff between results this study aimed to improve the water availability footprint analysis framework by extending the ranges i e water quantity and quality and perspectives i e direct and indirect through the normalization procedure this study aimed to identify the key factors of water availability footprint results of china s grain products explore the critical transfer routes from an environmental perspective and propose precise agricultural management suggestions and differentiated decision making 2 methodology 2 1 system boundary and functional unit fig 1 shows the system

involved r to m means the upstream processes of p k which were determined from the chinese regional life cycle inventory database zhang et al 2016 in terms of pollution this study considered the life cycle pollutant emissions during grain production the fertilizer and pesticide losses were calculated on the basis of the emission coefficients from cfpc 2009a 2009b pollutant emission data from upstream processes of grain production were provided by the chinese regional life cycle inventory database zhang et al 2016 on the basis of the life cycle pollutant data the dilution water was calculated using eq 2 2 d w max m s f f s w a t e r c s max c s n a t where dw is the amount of dilution water m3 m s refers to the life cycle emission of pollutant s kg ff s water c s max and c s nat represent the fate factor maximum acceptable concentration kg m3 and natural concentration kg m3 of pollutant s in water respectively china s geography and environmental situations e g wind speed soil type and temperature were considered in the calculation of the fate factors of pollutants zhang et al 2016 the national water availability footprint inventory of grain production based on the functional unit and system boundary and the calculated indirect and dilution water data are shown in table s1 2 3 2 3 water availability footprint evaluation an impact oriented water availability footprint evaluation via the life cycle assessment method could contribute to comparative analysis and accurately explore major contributors pfister et al 2017 and it is recommended by the international organization for standardization iso 2014 the steps for water availability footprint analysis included characterization and normalization the characterization phase was performed at two dimensions namely midpoint and endpoint levels the water scarcity category was adopted to represent the water quantity and quality related water availability at the midpoint level eq 3 3 w s i w c i t c f i t where ws refers to the water scarcity impact m3 deprived wc is the water consumption m3 cf is the characterization factor m3 deprived m3 which was based on the china s regional water resource situation e g freshwater withdrawals and evaporation zhai et al 2021b and the wave model berger et al 2018 i and t are the region and water type i e direct indirect and dilution water respectively three protection targets i e human health ecosystem quality and resources were considered at the endpoint level the human health and ecosystem quality categories were deduced by the water scarcity category on the basis of the recipe 2016 model huijbregts et al 2017 and china s regional information i e human development index and agricultural water use fractions zhai et al 2021a damage on resources was assessed on the basis of water resource fee and computed as follows 4 r e i i r i p i i w i d w i p a v e i r i p i i w i d w i p i q i q i where re i refers to the resources impact of province i ir i iw i and dw i represent the amount of irrigation water indirect water and dilution water for grain production of province i respectively m3 p i and p ave are the provincial and average water resource fees m3 respectively which were acquired from the standard released by the chinese government ndrc 2013 q i is the provincial water resource endowment m3 from the water resources bulletin mwr 2018 to allow comparison across multi categories the normalization procedure was conducted in this study as follows 5 n f c w a f c o b j w a f c c h i n a where nf c refers to the normalization value of category c waf c obj and waf c china are the water availability footprint results of category c for the research objective and chinese regional inventory respectively the chinese regional inventory of water including agricultural industrial livelihood and ecological water consumption and emissions originating from energy consumption industrial production agricultural production and waste disposal is shown in supplementary material s2 2 4 water availability footprint transfer analysis on the basis of the interprovincial flow of grain trade and the normalized water availability footprint results of exporting regions the water availability footprint transfer embodied in the grain trade was calculated as follows 6 a 0 x 12 x 1 j x 2 1 0 x 2 j x i 1 x i 2 x i j b w a f 1 w a f 2 w a f i t a b 0 x 1 2 w a f 1 x 1 j w a f 1 w a f 1 j 1 n x 1 j x 2 1 w a f 2 0 x 2 j w a f 2 w a f 2 j 1 n x 2 j x i 1 w a f i x i 2 w a f i x i j w a f i w a f i j 1 n x i j i 1 m x i

footprint matrix respectively x i j represents the grain quantity shipped from province i to j ton which was derived from zhai et al 2021a waf i means the normalized water availability footprint of unit grain production in exporting region i in consideration of the regional disparity of water availability footprint results quantification of the related benefits of the grain trade from a comparative perspective was imperative the benefits of water availability footprint of the grain trade were calculated by subtracting the footprint value of the exporting area from that of the importing area multiplied by the trade volume as follows 7 b e i j w a f j w a f i x i j where be i j means the water availability footprint benefit caused by grain trade from province i to j the meanings of waf and x i j are similar to those in eq 6 a value of 0 implies environmental benefits whereas a value of 0 indicates the increase of environmental impacts compared with the no trade scenario further information related to the quantification procedures for water availability footprint and transfer analysis is provided in the technology roadmap in fig s2 3 results 3 1 water availability footprint evaluation the potential impact for annual grain production in 2019 was 7 61 1010 m3 deprived on the water scarcity midpoint for the endpoint the values of human health ecosystem quality and resources were 1 63 105 daly 0 65 species yr and 8 70 109 respectively combined with the footprint results of chinese regional inventory i e human health 3 48 105 daly ecosystem quality 2 43 species yr resources 1 59 1010 the summary of normalized water availability footprint results was 1 28 3 1 1 key factor analysis to trace the source of water availability footprint results the influences of key factors i e categories substances and processes are shown in fig 2 for categories the resources human health and ecosystem quality contributed 42 61 36 52 and 20 87 to the total normalized footprint results respectively in terms of substances irrigation water comprised the largest proportion 89 81 the contributions of irrigation water to the resources human health and ecosystem quality damages were 93 56 88 60 and 84 29 respectively approximately 98 of irrigation water consumption originated from the direct process and the proportion for seed production stage was 2 dilution water closely associated with mercury emissions was the secondary substance that affected resources human health and ecosystem quality damages with proportions of 5 55 10 84 and 13 54 respectively for dilution water consumption potash fertilizer production accounted for the largest proportion 80 88 followed by productions of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizers indirect water also provided 1 04 of the total damage of which the contribution of phosphate fertilizer production was dominant 3 1 2 spatial variations fig 3 displays the spatial distribution of grain production and water availability footprint results in 2019 at the provincial level in terms of grain production fig 3a heilongjiang 66 24 mt henan 65 02 mt and shandong 51 90 mt provinces were the top three contributors and responsible for 10 97 10 76 and 8 59 of the national total respectively the relative lower values of grain production were observed in shanghai qinghai beijing and tibet provinces the spatial patterns of water availability footprint differed significantly among the three endpoint categories fig 3b shandong province was in the forefront of all provinces in terms of three endpoint categories excluding shandong province xinjiang and hebei provinces were the hotspots of human health damage while the areas with high ecosystem quality damage were clustered in the north china plain which included henan shandong anhui jiangsu and hebei provinces the high level regions of resources damage were the henan and shandong provinces as shown in fig 3c the normalized water availability footprint results were obtained from shandong henan xinjiang and hebei provinces the higher rankings for shandong henan and hebei provinces were due to multiple factors e g higher yield and scarce water resources while the serious water deficiency during the grain growth period was responsible for the considerable irrigation demand and higher footprint result in xinjiang province low water availability footprint results were concentrated in the developed regions e g beijing and shanghai because of the dominance of service industries and in western areas e g tibet and qinghai due to lower grain yields affected by water resource endowment xinjiang and sichuan provinces indicated a remarkable inconsistency in spatial variations between grain production and the related footprint results figs 3a and 3c 3 2 water availability footprint transfer the total water availability footprint transfer of the grain trade was 0 32 which accounted for approximately 25 of the total normalized footprint result of grain production meanwhile approximately 3 88 10 2 of the environmental burden was added by the current pattern of china s interprovincial grain trade in comparison with the no grain trade scenario 3 2 1 key transfer route analysis fig 4 presents the main direction of china s interprovincial grain trade and embodied water availability footprint transfer as shown in fig 4a heilongjiang province to guangdong province had the largest grain trade at a volume of 3 36 mt followed by heilongjiang province to shandong province jilin and inner mongolia provinces were also principal grain exporters and mainly transferred to shandong and guangdong provinces the largest grain importers were guangdong and shandong provinces which obtained support from heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia henan xinjiang yunnan liaoning and shanxi provinces the flow from heilongjiang province to guangxi zhejiang and fujian provinces from jilin province to jiangsu province and from jiangxi province to zhejiang province also contributed to the interprovincial grain trade pattern regarding water availability footprint transfer fig 4b the flow from xinjiang province to shandong province was the highest accounting for 5 80 of the total transfer value followed by xinjiang province to guangdong province 4 50 the grain exportation from inner mongolia province to shandong and guangdong provinces played a significant role in water availability footprint transfer xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces were also major sources of water availability footprint inflows into jiangsu jiangxi guangxi hunan and hubei provinces similar to the grain trade shandong and guangdong provinces had the largest inflow of water availability footprint and outsourced their external footprint to xinjiang inner mongolia shanxi henan hebei and gansu provinces moreover the flow of shandong province to shanxi and beijing provinces from henan province to hunan province and from jiangsu province to zhejiang province also contributed slightly to the total water availability footprint transfer the obvious discrepancies in grain trade and water availability footprint transfer were observed from the perspective of outflow fig 4a and 4b heilongjiang province was the primary grain exporting province xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces were the regions with the largest values of footprint outflow which were mainly ascribed to higher footprint results and maize exportation respectively in terms of inflow areas shandong and guangdong provinces had the largest proportion in both grain import and water availability footprint inflow because of considerable maize demand ngoic 2020 3 2 2 benefit analysis analysis results on water availability footprint benefits at the provincial level from the perspective of grain exportation are shown in fig 5 eleven provinces showed environmental benefits at a total value of 7 69 10 2 which was mainly ascribed to the exportation of grain from heilongjiang province with about 26 contribution the exportation of grain from jilin hubei anhui and jiangxi provinces presented obvious benefits on water availability footprint with 11 28 18 60 of the total benefits exporting grain from other six provinces e g hunan and qinghai additionally contributed to water availability footprint benefits the exportation of 12 provinces contributed to the increase of environmental impact approximately 46 of which was attributed to the exporting grain from xinjiang province the exporting grain from inner mongolia shanxi and henan provinces exhibited substantial contributions to the environmental deterioration the exporting grain from other eight provinces e g hebei and tibet caused slight increases in water availability footprint the detailed information is shown in supplementary material s3 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis results of implementing a 5 reduction in substances i e irrigation water dilution water and indirect water on national water availability footprint results and benefits are presented in fig 6 the irrigation water had the greatest sensitivity to water availability footprint fig 6a controlling irrigation water consumption of shandong and henan provinces exhibited remarkable benefits to the footprint results a 5 decrease in the irrigation water in the above mentioned provinces brought 0 71 and 0 67 reductions in water availability footprints respectively xinjiang and hebei provinces played decisive roles in the reduction of national footprint results followed by jiangsu inner mongolia anhui heilongjiang shanxi and hunan provinces the variation in irrigation water of the remaining provinces resulted in relatively small benefits 0 1 to footprint results in terms of dilution water optimizing agricultural material production showed a slight sensitivity to the water availability footprint reduction especially for henan shandong heilongjiang and anhui provinces by contrast indirect water had a minimal contribution to the reduction of the overall footprint results as shown in fig 6b maize trade was the most sensitive to changes in water availability footprint benefits of the grain trade xinjiang province exhibited the greatest sensitivity in which 7 87 of the potential environmental impact could be avoided by reducing 5 of the irrigation water consumption in maize production in this province a similar remarkable variation was observed in the control of irrigation water of maize production in inner mongolia province the reduction of irrigation water in maize production of shanxi and henan provinces played effective roles in improving the water availability footprint benefits improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water of wheat production of shandong province showed additional sensitivity in the improvement of the environmental benefits optimizing irrigation water from the remaining provinces only had a slight influence the highest variation of dilution water on footprint benefits was observed in the maize production of heilongjiang province whereas indirect water exhibited the lowest variation for the decrease of the overall footprint benefits therefore shandong henan xinjiang hebei inner mongolia and shanxi provinces were the core regions where the consumption of irrigation water and dilution water can be controlled to improve the performance of national water availability footprint 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous research obvious differences in system boundary inventory calculation method and footprint evaluation content were observed in this study in comparison with previous studies the national irrigation water value currently shown is lower than the value reported by cao et al 2021 and this difference is related to the system boundary in this study three main grains i e wheat maize and rice in china were involved while cao et al 2021 considered beans and tubers in addition to the three main grains for the calculation of dilution water most previous studies only focused on direct water pollution e g fertilizer leaching cai et al 2022 li et al 2020b whereas this study evaluated the water pollution from a life cycle perspective and considered the cross media transfer of pollutants thus nitrogen was closely associated with gray water in the previous water footprint research on agriculture cai et al 2022 li et al 2020b whereas the dilution water in this study was ascribed to mercury emission in water availability footprint analysis huang et al 2014 only considered the water scarcity impact caused by water consumption whereas this study improved the methodology framework by integrating water consumption and pollution in accordance with the iso standard iso 2014 moreover in contrast to the multi indicators adopted in previous impact oriented footprint evaluation studies borsato et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the normalized value was obtained in this study through normalization procedure effectively coping with the trade off among different indicators in footprint analysis 4 2 sustainable irrigation water management transformation pathway toward more sustainable irrigation water management is a priority because of the significant contribution of irrigation water to water availability footprint results fig 2 the chinese government focused on the promotion of water saving irrigation technology to reduce water loss including leakage and evaporation from water source to final crop use state council 2012 moa 2021 more than 54 of the irrigated land of china has adopted sprinkler micro low pressure pipe irrigation and other high efficiency water saving technologies nbs 2020 among those technologies micro irrigation could more effectively reduce irrigation water consumption by limiting soil evaporation wang et al 2019a and its water saving efficiency was about 60 70 followed by sprinkler 50 and pipe irrigation 20 30 he et al 2021 in 2020 sprinkler and micro irrigation area reached approximately 11 82 million ha accounting for 31 of the national total value of china mwr 2021 which was still far lower than that of the united states spain and israel he et al 2021 the chinese government needs to further promote water saving irrigation and prioritize the micro irrigation projects according to local conditions for provinces in which the groundwater is overexploited such as shandong henan and hebei promoting micro sprinkling irrigation is a feasible measure for increasing water use efficiency and grain yield li et al 2019 rainfall scarce regions e g xinjiang should facilitate the development of drip irrigation under the plastic film to reduce water evaporation zong et al 2021 to promote the widespread use of water saving irrigation technologies enhancing water conservancy infrastructure is also important the operation mechanism with the government as a dominant investor with society as a supplementary investor and with the active participation of farmers and other stakeholders should be vigorously promoted to ensure the high quality development of water conservancy infrastructure zhang et al 2018a furthermore the construction of infrastructure was the focus and few concerns about management thereby impeding the long term stable operation of the project mwr 2022 thus establishing a fund integrated water resource fee income operation income and financial subsidies is suggested for the management and maintenance of water conservancy infrastructure 4 3 effective reductions in dilution water the results demonstrated that dilution water i e mercury emissions originating from potash fertilizer production had an effective influence on water availability footprint result fig 2 coal based power as the dominant source of atmospheric mercury emissions was adopted in potash fertilizer production process considering its predominance in china s power grid chen et al 2018 china s large stocks of cheap coal and power plants indicate that coal based power will still dominate electricity generation for a long time guo et al 2020 shan et al 2018 and plays increasingly important roles in mercury emissions under this circumstance ultra low emission retrofit was identified as the most effective mercury emission abatement measure in china li et al 2020a ultra low emission of coal fired power plant plan was issued by the chinese government in 2015 to control emission concentrations of particulates sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides mee 2015 this policy has been demonstrated to generate synergetic benefits for mercury emission abatement wu et al 2016 in addition the emission limit is a significant index for the supervision and inspection of emission control the current standard of mercury emission for the coal fired power plant in china has a limit of 30 μg m3 which was higher than those in canada and the united states wu et al 2018 with the accomplishment of ultra low emission retrofit it is urgent to research the mercury emission level of china s coal fired power plants and formulate a new emission standard referring to advanced standards of developed countries in summary ultra low emission retrofit and strict emission limit standards for power plants are suggested 4 4 optimization of water availability footprint transfer from a trade perspective the current water availability footprint transfer pattern is adverse to the environment on the national level however exporting grain from parts of provinces shows environment friendliness to the water availability footprint fig 5 although the grain exportation from heilongjiang province was the largest fig 4a the footprint result per unit of grain production was relatively low fig s3 so it contributed greatly to the footprint benefits in the country fig 5 these substantial benefits were mainly ascribed to the maize and rice trade link from heilongjiang provinces to north china plain fig s4 previous research also demonstrated the superiority of heilongjiang province in rice and maize production in terms of returns to scale wang et al 2018 heilongjiang province needs to further strengthen the grain production capacity in the superior areas and implement various water saving irrigation measures to exert advantages and enhance the benefits meanwhile accelerating the centralized development of factors of production such as land labor capital and equipment in the superior areas needs to be done hppg 2017 in contrast exporting maize from xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces generates a substantial burden figs 5 and 6 which was due to the mismatch of maize production and consumption and high unit water availability footprint values in these regions hence optimizing the regional planting structure i e the appropriate decrease of the maize area and strengthening the popularization of water saving technologies are the key paths to ensuring the sustainable development of grain for xinjiang and inner mongolia provinces in terms of grain importation guangdong province which has abundant water resources still imports plenty of water intensive products nbs 2020 the reason for this phenomenon is that arable land plays a more decisive role in grain production than water wang et al 2019b thus high tech agriculture should be vigorously developed in this region to overcome the arable land limitation song et al 2020 moreover regional balance and sustainable development cannot be ignored the water availability footprint transfers from less developed to more developed regions under the current trade pattern fig 4 which generates a serious negative externality problem the establishment of an interprovincial financial compensation mechanism is an effective policy tool to solve this problem meanwhile such compensation should be implemented with environmental considerations such as water scarcity in mind 4 5 mitigation uncertainty in the normalization procedure normalization is an optional step within the life cycle assessment that could help interpret the life cycle impact assessment results it was introduced in this study to solve the tradeoffs among water availability footprint results notably calculations of the normalization benchmark show large uncertainty which is caused by a combination of uncertainties in normalization inventory and modeling pizzol et al 2017 sleeswijk et al 2008 in terms of normalization inventory this study developed a normalization inventory of emissions and water consumption at a country level i e china which included critical industrial activities supplementary material s2 compared with previous normalization references reported by yang and nielsen 2001 the completeness of the national normalization inventory has been greatly improved in this study the expansion of emission registration by government policy should be promoted to further reduce uncertainty of normalization inventory apart from inventory modeling approach is also a source of uncertainty of normalization sleeswijk et al 2008 the consistency of modeling is more important than the completeness of the normalization inventory for normalization purpose hélias and servien 2021 if an integrated water availability and degradation footprint model was applied to the characterization of the normalization inventory built in this study table s2 then resources category dominates the total normalized footprint results 0 81 with 67 39 contribution followed by human health damage the influence of ecosystem quality was nearly negligible supplementary material s7 these analyses highlighted the necessity of ensuring the consistency of modelling e g boundaries and hypotheses to diminish uncertainty 4 6 limitations and future work the current analysis still has certain limitations first limited by data availability this study quantified the fertilizer and pesticide loss on the basis of the first national pollution source survey future research should enhance the temporal accuracy of the dataset second in terms of water availability footprint methodology the chinese regional inventory applied in the normalization procedure needs to be improved to enhance the accuracy and reliability of results in future work third this study only covered 1 year data and did not capture the annual variability in water availability footprint results and transfers of grain products the impact of annual variations in agricultural production meteorological conditions and trade patterns on footprint results requires further evaluation 5 conclusions this study explored the regional disparity of water availability footprint results and transfers of china s grain products from the integrated perspective of water consumption and pollution this research revealed the following findings the normalized water availability footprint of china s grain production in 2019 was 1 28 the prominent contribution of direct irrigation water about 90 reflected the urgency of promoting the implementation of water saving technologies and enhancing water conservancy infrastructure mercury emission responsible for life cycle dilution water consumption contributed 9 15 to the footprint results mercury control strategies such as ultralow emission retrofit and strict emission limit standards for electricity generation are highly recommended the spatial distribution showed the relative consistency of footprint results and grain production for most of the provinces except xinjiang and sichuan the water availability footprint transfer of china s interprovincial grain trade during 2019 2020 was 0 32 the environmental burden increased by 3 88 10 2 on a national scale compared with the no grain trade scenario the footprint benefits and burdens were mainly ascribed to the grain trade from heilongjiang province 26 and xinjiang province 46 respectively strengthening the production capacity of preponderant provinces e g heilongjiang adjusting the planting scale of non superior regions e g xinjiang and inner mongolia and promoting the development of high tech agriculture in arable land limited regions e g guangdong were suggested for the amelioration of the negative externality problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
