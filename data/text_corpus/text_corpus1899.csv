9495,preferential flow in soil has a potential impact on the maintenance of the agricultural ecosystem the aim of this study was to quantify and evaluate the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields in xinjiang we applied the dye tracer method addressed the variability in stained images collected soil samples in the excavated soil profile and calculated the fractal parameters in four key growth stages of cotton in 2021 according to the dyeing mode the dyed area ratio tended to keep decreasing from the soil surface a down movement of points which drastically dropped to zero appeared at pace with the growth of the cotton from 10 cm to 30 cm statistics obtained from the staining images showed that the preferential flow degree was highest at the boll opening stage no significant difference in non uniformity emerged from different treatments at the same growing stage p 0 05 conversely the fractal feature parameters in the active region model probed that the preferential flow degree was developed at the flowering bolling stage in treatments with opaque oxidation biodegradable film mulching b w and at boll opening stage with plastic film mulching p during the same growth period a significant difference p 0 05 existed between different groups in comparison the fractal feature parameter was found more adequate and effective in evaluating the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields this research will provide practical information for the local department to adjust some agronomic measures to reduce the risk of low irrigation water utilization efficiency keywords preferential flow drip irrigation variability of dyed image active region model fractal characteristic parameter 1 introduction the soil functioning crucially as buffering and filtering systems on earth clothier et al 2008 are deemed the breeding and growing base for natural flora and fauna and are also known as fundamental parts of the terrestrial ecosystem allaire et al 2009 recently there has been renewed interest in environmental issues thus a primary concern of soil eco environment with higher standards is raised along with the development of modernization and the economy alouai et al 2015 the soil structure has strong spatial heterogeneity at different scales regarding a porous medium through which the mechanism of water movement and solute migration is very sophisticated beven and germann 2013 commonly the process of infiltration in the soil is nonequilibrium referring to the preferential flow which is a general term presented for defining a phenomenon when water flow is allowed to move following favored paths while bypassing most parts of the medium soil matrix nimmo 2012 the presence of preferential flow reduces the residence duration of the solutes resulting in transient contact with the soil matrix and giving rise to the potential risk of direct passage of chemicals from the surface to the groundwater guo and lin 2019 kohler and abbaspour 2005 therefore in agricultural production the possible existence of preferential transport will affect the hydraulic activities in fields thus negatively having an effect on the water fertilization utilization efficiency of the crop and without studying preferential flow it is impossible to gain insight into the causes of reduced crop water use efficiency wang and zhang 2006 typically the soil preferential flow in agricultural systems is induced by several drivers one of which is the alteration of soil fabric caused by individual elongated pores such as the crop root path soil animals holes and surface fissures leading to an unusual and rapid downward movement of the water flow sen and giroux 1988 moreover the preferential flow is associated with the size geometry distribution and continuity of soil pores bundt et al 2001a bundt et al 2001b lukas et al 2021 kalkhajeh and huang 2021 additionally even if there s devoid of preferential fractures the soil s water repellency will prevent the soil from being moisture gjettermann and nielsen 1997 and restrict the influence by capillarity of soil conduit thus forcing the flow selecting the zone with higher water conductivity unstably dekker and ritsema 1993 furthermore the irrigation infiltration responds quickly to higher irrigation rate and intensity of precipitation starting up a quick migration of irrigation water and fertilization rooij et al 2000 characterizing the preferential flow as being highly dynamic in time and space brings about the challenges of determining proper quantifying techniques among which the dye tracer imaging approach has been prevailingly applied to observe and assess the soil preferential flow the brilliant blue fcf for its easy visibility and non toxicity has been extensively selected as the dye tracer whose flowing characteristics are monitored and evaluated by obtaining and analyzing the dyed images along excavated soil profiles flurry et al 1995 forrer and papritz 2000 morris and mooney 2004 investigations utilizing this method have presented some precious research findings quantifying the soil s preferential mobility for example the preferential paths in soil contributing significantly to the subsurface leaching of dissolved reactive phosphorus are considered biological hot spots with higher microbial biomass as well as diverse microbial community architectures than the soil matrix part whilst the broad application of dye tracing imaging methods most work has been done to study the occurrence mechanism and controlling factors of preferential flow without accurate verification which could bias the representativeness of the results the identification of the nonequilibrium processes thus requires various methods for better quantification qi et al 2013 wu et al 2015 filipović et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 hence researchers have introduced fractal theory into the description of the non uniform flowing process in soil liu et al 2005 the fractal theory is universally adopted in soil science to study soil particle size distribution soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil aggregate structure etc mandelbrot 1982 bartoli et al 1991 rasiah et al 1995 tyler et al 1992 meanwhile past evidence suggests that the non uniform flow process in the soil also has fractal characteristics flurry et al 1995 sheng et al 2009a in this scenario the active region model arm which combined the fractal theory with the continuity model was proposed the relationship between the channel area of the non uniform flow field and soil water saturation was established to well rounded represent the heterogeneous characteristics of soil water flow this model can not only solve practical problems on large scale but also capture details of soil water flow at a small scale liu et al 2005 sheng et al 2011a sheng et al 2011b sheng et al 2014 li et al 2008 constructed constitutive relation of active region model in which the fractal parameters were considered to be vital roles to quantify the preferential flow since the elemental work of the research on the arm is to determine the flowing patterns of non uniform flow active region the dye tracer can exactly and directly provide this flowing pattern without influencing the initial soil properties sheng et al 2009b thus it is feasible to apply the dye tracing imaging method to explore this model although previous studies of the preferential infiltration have been carried out they have paid little attention to quantifying the preferential flow of mulched drip irrigation cotton fields in arid regions like xinjiang with vast territory and various natural resources xinjiang has suffered from scarce precipitation and large evaporation because of its deep inland location despite this agriculture is still known as the economic pillar industry of xinjiang with cotton the major economic crop in addition irrigation plays a critical role in maintaining the oasis agriculture in this region danierhan et al 2013 in the early 1990 s drip irrigation was brought in and combined with film by the corps 8th division government this brand new integrated technology was soon practiced by local farmers due to its precise irrigation and fertilization rao et al 2018 beyond that this technology can function by promoting the growth of the roots increasing yield improving the quality of crops preserving the soil temperature moisture and resisting the drought zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 jia et al 2021 geng et al 2021 by the end of 2020 the planting area of cotton with film mulched drip irrigation has amounted to 2 50 106 ha which accounts for approximately 78 9 of the nation s cotton planting area data from xinjiang statistical yearbook 2020 in this context the dye tracing imaging approach and the active region model fractal parameters were carried out to quantify the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields with different films mulched and to validate and ascertain which method is suitable to evaluate the developing degree of preferential flow in mulched drip irrigation cotton field in xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field trial was conducted in 2021 at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of the xinjiang production and construction corps at shihezi university in xinjiang china the study site is located in the south of the jung gar basin the middle section of the northern face of the tianshan mountains 85 59 e 44 19 n whose average altitude is 412 m and the average ground slope is 6 the region experiences a typical arid desert climate with 170 days of lasting frost free period an average annual sunshine duration of 2865 h an average annual air temperature of 7 2 c average annual precipitation of 207 mm and average annual evaporation of 1660 mm before the experiment in 2021 cotton had been planted consecutively since 2008 in the test plot the field was cultivated with ploughing depth of 30 40 cm once a year and fallowed in the winter from the soil surface to the40 cm layer where the cotton roots will mainly distribute the dry soil bulk density was 1 60 g cm 3 the field capacity was 18 41 v v 1 the ph 1 1 h2o was7 72 the saturated water conductivity was 0 00247 cm min and the wilting point was 6 8 the soil texture of the tillage layer is loam with physical clay content particle size 0 01 mm greater than 20 the groundwater with a depth of 8 m was utilized as irrigation water the initial salt content of which was 2 03 g kg 1 2 2 field experimental design of cotton planting according to the local climate conditions and cotton planting patterns we applied an orthogonal field test with three films 2 had degradable performance the other had nothing with degradation function and two irrigation quotas there were six treatments with each treatment conducted in triplicate 18 field plots each of which was 15 m in length and 3 m in width the two degradable membranes were black opaque oxidation biodegradable film b and white opaque oxidation biodegradable film w they all had a length of 2 05 m and a thickness of 0 010 mm with the induction period the period when the film begins decomposing 100 days a standard transparent polyethene plastic membrane was set for comparative control p with a length of 2 05 mm and a thickness of 0 008 mm two irrigation quotas were set up as 450 mm w1 550 mm w2 in line with the local production practice other field management decisions were made on account of this practice the irrigation schedule is shown in table 1 we installed mechanical water gauges and ball valves at the inlet of each experimental plot to regulate the water volume six rows of cotton were sown under each 205 cm wide strip of plastic film with 20 cm of bare soil between each strip fig 1 the rows were paired 3 pairs with 10 cm between the paired rows narrow row and 66 cm between the non paired rows wide row we applied a single wing labyrinth drip tape with 0 3 m space of adjacent emitters and 2 6 l h of flow discharge the ratio of nitrogen phosphorus pentoxide kali equal to 2 1 2 was adopted as fertilizer mode the total amount of fertilization was 700 kg hm 2 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 dye tracer imaging approach four pivotal growth periods of cotton seeding stage squaring stage flowering and bolling stage and boll opening stage were selected to capture and evaluate the characteristics of the preferential flow a square stainless frame 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 4 m restraining the flow range and a water pump 300w providing the power were available in advance the colourant for tracking the flowing patterns was a water soluble food additive brilliant blue fcf c37h34n2na2o9s3 the central part of the second film in each treatment where the cotton was in consistent growth condition was selected as the excavation site we planned to conduct the dye tracing experiment 24 h after a date from the irrigation schedule table 1 in each growth period prior to dyeing the frames were embedded into the soil at a depth of 0 2 m surface soils from both sides of the frame walls were compacted to prevent side infiltration the cotton was removed and the previous film above the soil surface was replaced by a new film with equal area in addition we saved the drip irrigation tubes beneath the films at the same time we prepared the brilliant blue solution at a concentration of 2 g l and kept the infiltration amount the same as the irrigation quota each time 45 mm 55 mm which was 11 l and 14 l accordingly then in the frame one side of the tube was connected to the water pump we put the pump in the bucket containing the dyeing solution and simulated the process of mulched drip irrigation the soil should keep its original structure as possible during the whole procedure follow up work was to take off the frame slowly clear the film and tube carefully and create an entire soil body 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m fig 2 by excavating the dyeing area the vertical cross section images of the soil body were got by a digital camera nikon d5300 each image was obtained by excavating longitudinally at 10 cm intervals and we got five images in one treatment once in total 120 images were taken during the four crucial growth periods to provide accurate illustrations of the characteristics of preferential flow in 4 different growing phases of cotton we successively excavated the central part of the second film from back to front with the seeding stage the most back and the boll opening stage the foremost fig 3 the images of soil profiles may be subjected to geometric distortion in homogeneous illuminations and color differences wu et al 2015 the adobe photoshop 2018 adobe systems was adopted to give the images geometric correction then we carried on with the brightness as well as color correction by adjusting grayscale and threshold value the tested images can be transferred to binary images with the dyed area being black rgb 0 and the non dyed area being white rgb 255 these binary images were all saved as bmp or tiff finally we applied imageproplus 6 0 to lower the noise of the binary pictures the processed images can be analyzed by clicking on the count order of this software 2 3 2 calculation of dyed image variability the binary images were applied to calculate a series of indexes to appraise about the variability of the dyed images ① dyed area ratio dc flury et al 1994 the percentage of the dyed area of a certain soil depth profile to the total area of the depth the calculation formula is as follows 1 d c d d n d 100 d is the dyed area cm2 and nd is the non dyed area cm2 ② matrix flow depth unifr van et al 2009 when the dyeing area ratio is greater than 80 the dyeing area is used as the matrix flow area and the maximum depth that it can reach is the matrix flow depth ③ preferential flow ratio pf fr van et al 2009 the percentage of preferential dyeing area to the total dyeing area can be obtained by the equation 2 p f fr 1 u nifr w t 100 where unifr refers to the matrix depth cm w is for soil profile width cm and t represents the total area of the stained soil profile ④ coefficient of variation of soil staining profile cv indicates the degree of difference in the stained soil profile and the calculation formula is as follows 3 c v 1 n 1 i 1 n d ci d c 2 1 n i 1 n d ci where dci gives the average value of dyed area ratio at soil layer per unit 2 3 3 calculation of fractal characteristics parameter the constitutive representation of the active region model arm can be expressed by the equation liu et al 2005 sheng et al 2009 4 f s e γ in this equation ƒ is the proportion of the active region to the whole flowing field which refers to the stained area of the vertical soil profile γ is the fractal characteristics parameter se is the effective saturation in the active region based on the definition of the active region proportion there is 5 f v a v t v a v t v af v tf v aw s a v tf s e s a in eq 5 va is the volume of the active region cm3 while vt is the volume of the total region cm3 is the effective porosity in the soil excluding the volume of the remaining soil water vaf is the volume of pores in the active region cm3 including air filled pores and water filled pores but excluding the volume of the remaining soil water sa is the effective soil water saturation in the active region which can be calculated by the following equation 6 s a θ a θ r θ s θ r in eq 6 θa is the average volumetric water content of the active region cm3 cm3 θs and θr are the saturated volumetric water content and the remaining volumetric water content of the soil respectively 2 3 4 degradation characteristics of films one 2 05 m 2 05 m region was chosen stochastically in each treatment then we carefully tailored the film with the same size and buried it 10 cm under the soil in this region for weighting the degradation features and mass variation of the degradable films were documented every ten days after the film mulching the degradation process will be divided into six levels induction period cracking period rupture period disintegration period survival period and no membrane period the induction period refers to the stage when the films began cracking the cracking period appertains to the appearance of natural cracks or holes which have lengths or diameters less than 2 cm the rupture period means the lengths or diameters of natural cracks or holes are over 2 cm but less than 20 cm the disintegration period stands for the length of natural fissure being over 20 cm the survival period is when there remain pieces of residual film whose area is less than 16 cm2 the no membrane period gets at the phase where no film appears in this area 2 3 5 soil sampling the soil samples in the stained and unstained areas were collected to determine the fractal characteristics parameters in each area five sampling points were selected randomly in the stained area an aluminum box was used and we adopted the oven to dry the soil specimens and recorded the mass changes before and after being dried which can decide the gravimetric water content g g 1 in the end we can calculate the volumetric water content by multiplying the gravimetric water content with the soil bulk density in an un stained area the ringknife was applied to calculate soil porosity as well as the soil bulk density to obtain the saturated volumetric water content the remaining volumetric water content can be decided by the experience data 2 4 data analysis we performed statistical analysis applying spss 20 0 ibm spss statistics usa the frequency distributions of the dependent and independent variables p 0 05 were determined by a kolmogorov smirnov test we analyzed the experimental data by using two way anova moreover the differences among mean values gained from each treatment were decided using the least significant difference tests at a significance level of α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of preferential flow by dyed images variability the dyeing mode of flowing water in vertical sections of soil was characterized in which the dyeing area ratio in four growing seasons generally decreased by soil infiltration depths fig 4 all six treatments showed a similar changing trend in the seeding stage fig 4 a there has been a steep drop from the soil surface to the shallow soil layer 0 10 cm then a gradual decline was observed from 10 cm to 30 cm and we found a very sharp fall straight to 0 value from around 30 cm to deeper soil layers however the variation from the soil surface to shallow soil layer was not very steep in the squaring stage fig 4 b and the staining pattern was replaced by a steady decline from 0 cm to a certain depth which has slightly moved up compared to the seeding stage 25 30 cm at this stage the bw1 was not consistent with the other five treatments whose dyed area ratio dramatically decreased at the depth of around 20 cm in the flowering and bolling stage fig 4 c the dyed area ratio had high variability with different and uneven flowing distribution in each treatment at partial depths in bw1 the percentage showed an unusual increasing trend in addition the sudden falling points of the six groups were not at the same depth in the boll opening stage fig 4 d the dyeing mode was still not monotonically decreasing with the increase of the soil depths but the changes between treatments were not as drastic as in the flowering and bolling stage by additionally addressing the coefficient of variation in soil staining profiles cv the matrix flow depth cm and the preferential flow ratio information regarding quantifying the preferential flowing behavior in soil was further described overall they all ranged significantly p 0 05 between growth stages in the same treatment fig 5 fig 6 table 2 the cv as variation statistics referring to the binary images reported highest at the boll opening stage than other growth periods in each treatment moreover we observed a continual growth of cv from the seeding stage no great difference between the six groups was observed p 0 05 at the same growth stage fig 5 the matrix flow on the contrary showed a declining trend from the seeding stage which reached the lowest value in the boll opening stage in each group the matrix flow in the seeding stage and squaring stage all had a trend of increasing first and then falling from pw1 to bw2 with the peak at ww2 p 0 05 nonetheless the matrix flow at the flowering bolling stage and boll opening stage in each group appeared to be unaffected and kept at the same standard fig 6 the preferential flow ratio in all treatments all had an up level from the seeding stage and reached a maximum value at the boll opening stage same trend as the cv apart from that the added preferential flow ratio had a trend from the pw1 group 15 56 which was growing to ww2 group 30 73 and decreasing followingly however during the same growth period we found no obvious variation between groups p 0 05 table 2 fig 7 previous studies adopted spraying sprinkling or pouring the dye solution into the iron frame and observed the dyeing patterns in this study we selected drip irrigation as an infiltration way by which the irrigation water can flow towards the root zone at a slow and uniform velocity without surface runoff or deep seepage on the other hand the covering mulch can block the direct continuity between soil moisture body and the atmosphere leading to less evaporation loss therefore the infiltration mainly happened vertically and there was less chance that lateral dispersion would appear beyond that the maximum diameter of the wetting front was maintained at the shallow soil layer under drip irrigation jia et al 2021 thus compared to the results from wu et al 2015 and sheng et al 2009 the dyeing mode in this study showed a more consistent tendency of keeping decreasing from the soil surface in another regard the water movement under drip irrigation is tightly connected to initial soil moisture or 1995 wu et al 2000 in the seeding stage every treatment was applied the emergence water only once the initial water content was not high fig 8 a since low initial water content limitedly influenced the flowing behaviors in soil the non uniform characteristics of the infiltration were not evident xu et al 2012 at the study site the soil water affected by the matrix potential gradient flew from the higher water content region soil surface to the lower water content region since the discharge of the emitter was constant and slow the rapidly downward movement only occurred at the shallow soil layer and then the soil water reached the maximum infiltration depth therefore the dyed area ratio will not change drastically from the soil surface downward and gradually had a difference since the squaring stage predominantly the variability reflected from the binary images is governed by soil properties and cotton s growth whose share of impact differs in different growing stages at the beginning phase of cotton planting when the root system is not mature enough to influence the soil structure the finger shaped flow appears in abundance the factor that makes the finger flow notable is the hydrophobicity of the loam in the field which triggers the generation mechanism of the finger shape preferential paths dekker et al 1994 with steady input as the drip irrigation provides the fingers determined by the saturated hydraulic conductivity are inclined to develop at a constant speed clothier et al 1992 at the same time the water repellency confines the gravitational potential gradient driving the soil water flow to wetted conductive zone rye et al 2017 water flowing through the favored finger paths continues to widen for remaining the lateral matric potential the sustaining depletion of water inhibits the existing finger formation within some certain distances nearby thus permitting another shape being produced dicarlo et al 1999 dicarlo et al 2013 however the macropore was perceivable in the last two growing stages of cotton with the ongoing growth of cotton the developing root systems affect the infiltration by altering the soil fabric in the field instead the fissures generated by dry wet circulation because of the high irrigation frequency required also have an impact on the infiltrating process jarvis et al 2007 the primacy of continuity created by the cotton roots is noted which is distinguished as preferential flow paths bouma et al 1981 therefore in the field the effective hydraulic activities are associated with root based macropore flow lange et al 2009 at the boll opening stage although the cotton s root systems function not as actively as in the flowering bolling stage the stretching paths caused by the mature roots are widened and elongated inducing more degree of non uniformity of the soil water van et al 1989 the evaluation indexes gained from the dyed images cv matrix flow depth preferential flow ratio unveiled that the non uniformity of soil water movement was highest at the boll opening stage in all groups but no sharp difference between groups at the same growth period although we set two infiltration amounts each time the dye tracer imaging experiment was implemented the actual infiltration amounts according to the irrigation quota were not in considerable differentiation 11 l 14 l each time respectively in addition drip irrigation uniformly changed the infiltration process in soil thereby we cannot discover much difference however the cumulative irrigation amount was firmly associated with the wet distance in soil as zhang 2013 stated under the stable number of irrigation times throughout the whole growth periods of cotton the total amount will have an impact on the water movement in the soil accordingly we found the preferential flow extent distinguished between different growing stages in the boll opening stage the cumulative irrigation amount reached the greatest which enlarged the wetting body in soil the existence of the covering film hindered the water beneath the drip from expanding outside the film causing the soil in the film more moisture consequently the degree of non uniformity as well as preferential flow ratio of which were presented highest at this stage although the dyed staining images can determine the preferential flow the results were not accurate if only analyzing the patterns and variations of these images not to mention one of the issues when doing the dyed experiment was limited infiltration amount gradients thus quantification of flow behavior is further explored below 3 2 identification of preferential flow by fractal characteristic parameter the fractal characteristics parameter γ is a critical factor in the active region model which can provide macroscopic inhomogeneous features of water movement in the soil when γ 0 the flowing mode in the soil can be uniform otherwise when 0 γ 1 the soil water presents an un uniform state from eqs 4 6 we can calculate the effective soil water saturation find the dyed area and eventually determine the fractal characteristic parameter by fitting the above values sheng 2009 indicated that the soil below the maximum infiltration should not be dyed due to lateral infiltration as well as flowing hence the description of the non uniformity of water flow in the soil might not be comprehensive enough however we used drip irrigation as the infiltration way in this experiment and there was little probability that the lateral infiltration might appear because of less discharge and a more uniform distribution of soil water therefore it is proper to apply the whole dyed region to describe the non uniform characteristics out of prudence the results of measured values and fitted values are shown in fig 9 and table 3 in which the determination coefficient r2 was high and the fitted outcome was good indicating that the active region model can capture the overall non uniform characteristics of preferential flow in soil under drip irrigation generally the differences of fractal parameters in each group at four growth stages were highlighted showing a complicated flowing mode in soil furthermore in the treatments with degradation film mulched treatments b w the fractal parameters had a trend rising from the seeding stage then pinnacled at the flowering bolling stage and fell again at the boll opening stage however in the treatments covering common plastic film treatment p the steady increase of the fractal feature parameter value was revealed along with the four growth periods according to the results the degree of preferential flow was highest at the flowering bolling stage in ww and bw treatment and at the boll opening stage in pw treatment meanwhile during the same growth period the values of the fractal feature parameter had non negligible differences moreover when implementing the higher the irrigation quota the fractal value was higher interestingly the fractal dimension changed in a similar trend consistent with the fractal feature parameters the irrigation frequency of the flowering bolling stage was higher than in the other three stages table 1 the infiltration situation under the drip irrigation is a combinative effect of point source and line source with the increase of the irrigation times the velocity of soil infiltration will be gradually less than the vertical and lateral mobile velocity of the emitters on the tape thus bringing about an around expansion and intersection of the wetting body in soil li 2006 therefore the initial soil water saturation was high which impacted the non uniform characteristic of soil water movement on the other hand the irrigation quota before each dyeing experiment should also affect the redistribution of the soil water hence influencing the fractal parameters when the irrigation amount increased the dripping time was extended during this process the propulsion rate in the vertical direction of the wetting front became close to that in the horizontal direction the relative importance of the soil matrix potential gradient was weakened due to the unstable flowing behavior the local preferential movement region was more developed than the matrix flow region causing the soil to saturate at a deeper layer as a consequence the γ presented a rising trend with higher irrigation amounts wang and zhang 2006 sheng et al 2009 also the partial degradation process of the black opaque oxidation biodegradable film b and white opaque oxidation biodegradable film w mainly happened in the flowering stage fig 10 at which time the air temperature was high and the light intensity was sufficient with the disintegration of the black and white film the evaporation body s upper boundary had been changed the soil moisture began reshaping compared to the degradative film the common plastic film had more stable soil moisture conservation as a result even in the boll opening stage the soil water saturation was a little higher than in the other three periods nevertheless when the black and white films began rupturing at the boll opening stage the air temperature changed drastically and was lower under such circumstances the preservative function of soil moisture was blocked without film mulched which could cause a decrease in the water saturation and the non uniformity of the water movement in soil bu et al 2013 the mulching film increases the soil moisture in the root zone which effectively regulates soil water transfer under drip irrigation thus expanding the wetting region to the middle position of the film with the increasing irrigation amount qi et al 2018 moreover the soil water dynamics and hydrological process with film mulched are evaluated in different seasons in which the comparatively humid season summer also as the irrigation period will increase the soil water by changing the boundary conditions of the vapor migration between the soil and the atmosphere liu et al 2016 additionally some simulation of the soil water flow under the film mulched differentiates the soil water flow according to the duration of irrigation quickly after irrigation the soil water in the soil surface decreases rapidly to maintain the aeration space for the crops beyond that the soil water keeps moving downward the second and the third days after the irrigation zhang et al 2018 furthermore by improving the soil water content and temperature the film mulching affects the thermal effect of the soil beneath the film resulting in soil wet dry alteration which is more obvious in the soil profile from 20 to 120 cm zhang et al 2019 collectively the application of the film will not influence the soil directly however drivers closely related to the soil such as the evaporation and the processes of vaporization indirectly determine the soil water movement wu et al 2017 if we compare the results obtained from the dye tracer imaging approach and the method of applying fractal feature parameters the extent of preferential flow will be illustrated differently the variability of the images reflected that the degree of the preferential flow was highest in the boll opening stage nevertheless the non uniform characteristic was most evident at the flowering bolling stage in ww and bw treatment and the boll opening stage in pw treatment through analyzing the fractal feature parameters it is also noted that the influence of the degradation film on the soil water movement was not closely related to the analysis of the images which will bring questions in real situation even if the statistics from the staining images did provide a more direct expression of the flowing mode in soil they can t achieve precise and sufficient quantification in contrast the fractal features parameter was a superior method for describing the water flowing behavior in soil and differentiating the non uniformity between groups at the same growth period however the two methods were connected somehow the dye tracer experiment was crucial and was supposed to be used by both in this regard how to properly utilize the data to quantify the un uniformity of the water movement under drip irrigation was our objective however it was still not comprehensive enough to evaluate the degree of soil water movement under drip irrigation the most important limitation lies in the fact that the process of soil water movement in field trials may be much more sophisticated thus we can concentrate on combining the real time analysis of the dyed images and the active region model to fine tune the description of this issue 4 conclusion this investigation was undertaken to design a dye tracer experiment in four growth periods of cotton evaluating the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields with different films mulched by four critical growing periods in xinjiang by addressing the variability of the dyed images and calculating the fractal characteristics parameters from soil samples we compared and found that two quantifying methods presented different results the dyed area ratio reflected a dyeing mode of keeping decreasing from soil surface the points that drop to the zero value gradually moved downward along with the growing seasons from soil shallow layer 10 cm 0 cm to the deeper layer 25 30 cm the evaluation indexes extracted from the staining images further illustrated that the preferential flow degree was highest at the boll opening stage all over 80 however no significant difference of non uniformity emerged from different treatments at the same growing stage p 0 05 instead the parameters of the fractal feature in the active region model identified that the preferential flow degree was developed at the flowering bolling stage in treatment with degradation film mulched and the boll opening stage in treatment with plastic film mulched there existed significant differences between different groups during the same growth period p 0 05 by comparison the application of fractal feature parameter captured more drivers influencing the water movement such as the mulched film and irrigation frequency the adoption of this method is more realistic to appraise the water movement concerning the agricultural production under drip irrigation this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of preferential flow in arid areas like xinjiang however further research is also essential to comprehensively determine the real time analysis of the dyed images and the active region model to assess the preferential flow degree comprehensively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement we thank to the college of water resources

9495,preferential flow in soil has a potential impact on the maintenance of the agricultural ecosystem the aim of this study was to quantify and evaluate the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields in xinjiang we applied the dye tracer method addressed the variability in stained images collected soil samples in the excavated soil profile and calculated the fractal parameters in four key growth stages of cotton in 2021 according to the dyeing mode the dyed area ratio tended to keep decreasing from the soil surface a down movement of points which drastically dropped to zero appeared at pace with the growth of the cotton from 10 cm to 30 cm statistics obtained from the staining images showed that the preferential flow degree was highest at the boll opening stage no significant difference in non uniformity emerged from different treatments at the same growing stage p 0 05 conversely the fractal feature parameters in the active region model probed that the preferential flow degree was developed at the flowering bolling stage in treatments with opaque oxidation biodegradable film mulching b w and at boll opening stage with plastic film mulching p during the same growth period a significant difference p 0 05 existed between different groups in comparison the fractal feature parameter was found more adequate and effective in evaluating the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields this research will provide practical information for the local department to adjust some agronomic measures to reduce the risk of low irrigation water utilization efficiency keywords preferential flow drip irrigation variability of dyed image active region model fractal characteristic parameter 1 introduction the soil functioning crucially as buffering and filtering systems on earth clothier et al 2008 are deemed the breeding and growing base for natural flora and fauna and are also known as fundamental parts of the terrestrial ecosystem allaire et al 2009 recently there has been renewed interest in environmental issues thus a primary concern of soil eco environment with higher standards is raised along with the development of modernization and the economy alouai et al 2015 the soil structure has strong spatial heterogeneity at different scales regarding a porous medium through which the mechanism of water movement and solute migration is very sophisticated beven and germann 2013 commonly the process of infiltration in the soil is nonequilibrium referring to the preferential flow which is a general term presented for defining a phenomenon when water flow is allowed to move following favored paths while bypassing most parts of the medium soil matrix nimmo 2012 the presence of preferential flow reduces the residence duration of the solutes resulting in transient contact with the soil matrix and giving rise to the potential risk of direct passage of chemicals from the surface to the groundwater guo and lin 2019 kohler and abbaspour 2005 therefore in agricultural production the possible existence of preferential transport will affect the hydraulic activities in fields thus negatively having an effect on the water fertilization utilization efficiency of the crop and without studying preferential flow it is impossible to gain insight into the causes of reduced crop water use efficiency wang and zhang 2006 typically the soil preferential flow in agricultural systems is induced by several drivers one of which is the alteration of soil fabric caused by individual elongated pores such as the crop root path soil animals holes and surface fissures leading to an unusual and rapid downward movement of the water flow sen and giroux 1988 moreover the preferential flow is associated with the size geometry distribution and continuity of soil pores bundt et al 2001a bundt et al 2001b lukas et al 2021 kalkhajeh and huang 2021 additionally even if there s devoid of preferential fractures the soil s water repellency will prevent the soil from being moisture gjettermann and nielsen 1997 and restrict the influence by capillarity of soil conduit thus forcing the flow selecting the zone with higher water conductivity unstably dekker and ritsema 1993 furthermore the irrigation infiltration responds quickly to higher irrigation rate and intensity of precipitation starting up a quick migration of irrigation water and fertilization rooij et al 2000 characterizing the preferential flow as being highly dynamic in time and space brings about the challenges of determining proper quantifying techniques among which the dye tracer imaging approach has been prevailingly applied to observe and assess the soil preferential flow the brilliant blue fcf for its easy visibility and non toxicity has been extensively selected as the dye tracer whose flowing characteristics are monitored and evaluated by obtaining and analyzing the dyed images along excavated soil profiles flurry et al 1995 forrer and papritz 2000 morris and mooney 2004 investigations utilizing this method have presented some precious research findings quantifying the soil s preferential mobility for example the preferential paths in soil contributing significantly to the subsurface leaching of dissolved reactive phosphorus are considered biological hot spots with higher microbial biomass as well as diverse microbial community architectures than the soil matrix part whilst the broad application of dye tracing imaging methods most work has been done to study the occurrence mechanism and controlling factors of preferential flow without accurate verification which could bias the representativeness of the results the identification of the nonequilibrium processes thus requires various methods for better quantification qi et al 2013 wu et al 2015 filipović et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 hence researchers have introduced fractal theory into the description of the non uniform flowing process in soil liu et al 2005 the fractal theory is universally adopted in soil science to study soil particle size distribution soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil aggregate structure etc mandelbrot 1982 bartoli et al 1991 rasiah et al 1995 tyler et al 1992 meanwhile past evidence suggests that the non uniform flow process in the soil also has fractal characteristics flurry et al 1995 sheng et al 2009a in this scenario the active region model arm which combined the fractal theory with the continuity model was proposed the relationship between the channel area of the non uniform flow field and soil water saturation was established to well rounded represent the heterogeneous characteristics of soil water flow this model can not only solve practical problems on large scale but also capture details of soil water flow at a small scale liu et al 2005 sheng et al 2011a sheng et al 2011b sheng et al 2014 li et al 2008 constructed constitutive relation of active region model in which the fractal parameters were considered to be vital roles to quantify the preferential flow since the elemental work of the research on the arm is to determine the flowing patterns of non uniform flow active region the dye tracer can exactly and directly provide this flowing pattern without influencing the initial soil properties sheng et al 2009b thus it is feasible to apply the dye tracing imaging method to explore this model although previous studies of the preferential infiltration have been carried out they have paid little attention to quantifying the preferential flow of mulched drip irrigation cotton fields in arid regions like xinjiang with vast territory and various natural resources xinjiang has suffered from scarce precipitation and large evaporation because of its deep inland location despite this agriculture is still known as the economic pillar industry of xinjiang with cotton the major economic crop in addition irrigation plays a critical role in maintaining the oasis agriculture in this region danierhan et al 2013 in the early 1990 s drip irrigation was brought in and combined with film by the corps 8th division government this brand new integrated technology was soon practiced by local farmers due to its precise irrigation and fertilization rao et al 2018 beyond that this technology can function by promoting the growth of the roots increasing yield improving the quality of crops preserving the soil temperature moisture and resisting the drought zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 jia et al 2021 geng et al 2021 by the end of 2020 the planting area of cotton with film mulched drip irrigation has amounted to 2 50 106 ha which accounts for approximately 78 9 of the nation s cotton planting area data from xinjiang statistical yearbook 2020 in this context the dye tracing imaging approach and the active region model fractal parameters were carried out to quantify the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields with different films mulched and to validate and ascertain which method is suitable to evaluate the developing degree of preferential flow in mulched drip irrigation cotton field in xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field trial was conducted in 2021 at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of the xinjiang production and construction corps at shihezi university in xinjiang china the study site is located in the south of the jung gar basin the middle section of the northern face of the tianshan mountains 85 59 e 44 19 n whose average altitude is 412 m and the average ground slope is 6 the region experiences a typical arid desert climate with 170 days of lasting frost free period an average annual sunshine duration of 2865 h an average annual air temperature of 7 2 c average annual precipitation of 207 mm and average annual evaporation of 1660 mm before the experiment in 2021 cotton had been planted consecutively since 2008 in the test plot the field was cultivated with ploughing depth of 30 40 cm once a year and fallowed in the winter from the soil surface to the40 cm layer where the cotton roots will mainly distribute the dry soil bulk density was 1 60 g cm 3 the field capacity was 18 41 v v 1 the ph 1 1 h2o was7 72 the saturated water conductivity was 0 00247 cm min and the wilting point was 6 8 the soil texture of the tillage layer is loam with physical clay content particle size 0 01 mm greater than 20 the groundwater with a depth of 8 m was utilized as irrigation water the initial salt content of which was 2 03 g kg 1 2 2 field experimental design of cotton planting according to the local climate conditions and cotton planting patterns we applied an orthogonal field test with three films 2 had degradable performance the other had nothing with degradation function and two irrigation quotas there were six treatments with each treatment conducted in triplicate 18 field plots each of which was 15 m in length and 3 m in width the two degradable membranes were black opaque oxidation biodegradable film b and white opaque oxidation biodegradable film w they all had a length of 2 05 m and a thickness of 0 010 mm with the induction period the period when the film begins decomposing 100 days a standard transparent polyethene plastic membrane was set for comparative control p with a length of 2 05 mm and a thickness of 0 008 mm two irrigation quotas were set up as 450 mm w1 550 mm w2 in line with the local production practice other field management decisions were made on account of this practice the irrigation schedule is shown in table 1 we installed mechanical water gauges and ball valves at the inlet of each experimental plot to regulate the water volume six rows of cotton were sown under each 205 cm wide strip of plastic film with 20 cm of bare soil between each strip fig 1 the rows were paired 3 pairs with 10 cm between the paired rows narrow row and 66 cm between the non paired rows wide row we applied a single wing labyrinth drip tape with 0 3 m space of adjacent emitters and 2 6 l h of flow discharge the ratio of nitrogen phosphorus pentoxide kali equal to 2 1 2 was adopted as fertilizer mode the total amount of fertilization was 700 kg hm 2 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 dye tracer imaging approach four pivotal growth periods of cotton seeding stage squaring stage flowering and bolling stage and boll opening stage were selected to capture and evaluate the characteristics of the preferential flow a square stainless frame 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 4 m restraining the flow range and a water pump 300w providing the power were available in advance the colourant for tracking the flowing patterns was a water soluble food additive brilliant blue fcf c37h34n2na2o9s3 the central part of the second film in each treatment where the cotton was in consistent growth condition was selected as the excavation site we planned to conduct the dye tracing experiment 24 h after a date from the irrigation schedule table 1 in each growth period prior to dyeing the frames were embedded into the soil at a depth of 0 2 m surface soils from both sides of the frame walls were compacted to prevent side infiltration the cotton was removed and the previous film above the soil surface was replaced by a new film with equal area in addition we saved the drip irrigation tubes beneath the films at the same time we prepared the brilliant blue solution at a concentration of 2 g l and kept the infiltration amount the same as the irrigation quota each time 45 mm 55 mm which was 11 l and 14 l accordingly then in the frame one side of the tube was connected to the water pump we put the pump in the bucket containing the dyeing solution and simulated the process of mulched drip irrigation the soil should keep its original structure as possible during the whole procedure follow up work was to take off the frame slowly clear the film and tube carefully and create an entire soil body 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m fig 2 by excavating the dyeing area the vertical cross section images of the soil body were got by a digital camera nikon d5300 each image was obtained by excavating longitudinally at 10 cm intervals and we got five images in one treatment once in total 120 images were taken during the four crucial growth periods to provide accurate illustrations of the characteristics of preferential flow in 4 different growing phases of cotton we successively excavated the central part of the second film from back to front with the seeding stage the most back and the boll opening stage the foremost fig 3 the images of soil profiles may be subjected to geometric distortion in homogeneous illuminations and color differences wu et al 2015 the adobe photoshop 2018 adobe systems was adopted to give the images geometric correction then we carried on with the brightness as well as color correction by adjusting grayscale and threshold value the tested images can be transferred to binary images with the dyed area being black rgb 0 and the non dyed area being white rgb 255 these binary images were all saved as bmp or tiff finally we applied imageproplus 6 0 to lower the noise of the binary pictures the processed images can be analyzed by clicking on the count order of this software 2 3 2 calculation of dyed image variability the binary images were applied to calculate a series of indexes to appraise about the variability of the dyed images ① dyed area ratio dc flury et al 1994 the percentage of the dyed area of a certain soil depth profile to the total area of the depth the calculation formula is as follows 1 d c d d n d 100 d is the dyed area cm2 and nd is the non dyed area cm2 ② matrix flow depth unifr van et al 2009 when the dyeing area ratio is greater than 80 the dyeing area is used as the matrix flow area and the maximum depth that it can reach is the matrix flow depth ③ preferential flow ratio pf fr van et al 2009 the percentage of preferential dyeing area to the total dyeing area can be obtained by the equation 2 p f fr 1 u nifr w t 100 where unifr refers to the matrix depth cm w is for soil profile width cm and t represents the total area of the stained soil profile ④ coefficient of variation of soil staining profile cv indicates the degree of difference in the stained soil profile and the calculation formula is as follows 3 c v 1 n 1 i 1 n d ci d c 2 1 n i 1 n d ci where dci gives the average value of dyed area ratio at soil layer per unit 2 3 3 calculation of fractal characteristics parameter the constitutive representation of the active region model arm can be expressed by the equation liu et al 2005 sheng et al 2009 4 f s e γ in this equation ƒ is the proportion of the active region to the whole flowing field which refers to the stained area of the vertical soil profile γ is the fractal characteristics parameter se is the effective saturation in the active region based on the definition of the active region proportion there is 5 f v a v t v a v t v af v tf v aw s a v tf s e s a in eq 5 va is the volume of the active region cm3 while vt is the volume of the total region cm3 is the effective porosity in the soil excluding the volume of the remaining soil water vaf is the volume of pores in the active region cm3 including air filled pores and water filled pores but excluding the volume of the remaining soil water sa is the effective soil water saturation in the active region which can be calculated by the following equation 6 s a θ a θ r θ s θ r in eq 6 θa is the average volumetric water content of the active region cm3 cm3 θs and θr are the saturated volumetric water content and the remaining volumetric water content of the soil respectively 2 3 4 degradation characteristics of films one 2 05 m 2 05 m region was chosen stochastically in each treatment then we carefully tailored the film with the same size and buried it 10 cm under the soil in this region for weighting the degradation features and mass variation of the degradable films were documented every ten days after the film mulching the degradation process will be divided into six levels induction period cracking period rupture period disintegration period survival period and no membrane period the induction period refers to the stage when the films began cracking the cracking period appertains to the appearance of natural cracks or holes which have lengths or diameters less than 2 cm the rupture period means the lengths or diameters of natural cracks or holes are over 2 cm but less than 20 cm the disintegration period stands for the length of natural fissure being over 20 cm the survival period is when there remain pieces of residual film whose area is less than 16 cm2 the no membrane period gets at the phase where no film appears in this area 2 3 5 soil sampling the soil samples in the stained and unstained areas were collected to determine the fractal characteristics parameters in each area five sampling points were selected randomly in the stained area an aluminum box was used and we adopted the oven to dry the soil specimens and recorded the mass changes before and after being dried which can decide the gravimetric water content g g 1 in the end we can calculate the volumetric water content by multiplying the gravimetric water content with the soil bulk density in an un stained area the ringknife was applied to calculate soil porosity as well as the soil bulk density to obtain the saturated volumetric water content the remaining volumetric water content can be decided by the experience data 2 4 data analysis we performed statistical analysis applying spss 20 0 ibm spss statistics usa the frequency distributions of the dependent and independent variables p 0 05 were determined by a kolmogorov smirnov test we analyzed the experimental data by using two way anova moreover the differences among mean values gained from each treatment were decided using the least significant difference tests at a significance level of α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of preferential flow by dyed images variability the dyeing mode of flowing water in vertical sections of soil was characterized in which the dyeing area ratio in four growing seasons generally decreased by soil infiltration depths fig 4 all six treatments showed a similar changing trend in the seeding stage fig 4 a there has been a steep drop from the soil surface to the shallow soil layer 0 10 cm then a gradual decline was observed from 10 cm to 30 cm and we found a very sharp fall straight to 0 value from around 30 cm to deeper soil layers however the variation from the soil surface to shallow soil layer was not very steep in the squaring stage fig 4 b and the staining pattern was replaced by a steady decline from 0 cm to a certain depth which has slightly moved up compared to the seeding stage 25 30 cm at this stage the bw1 was not consistent with the other five treatments whose dyed area ratio dramatically decreased at the depth of around 20 cm in the flowering and bolling stage fig 4 c the dyed area ratio had high variability with different and uneven flowing distribution in each treatment at partial depths in bw1 the percentage showed an unusual increasing trend in addition the sudden falling points of the six groups were not at the same depth in the boll opening stage fig 4 d the dyeing mode was still not monotonically decreasing with the increase of the soil depths but the changes between treatments were not as drastic as in the flowering and bolling stage by additionally addressing the coefficient of variation in soil staining profiles cv the matrix flow depth cm and the preferential flow ratio information regarding quantifying the preferential flowing behavior in soil was further described overall they all ranged significantly p 0 05 between growth stages in the same treatment fig 5 fig 6 table 2 the cv as variation statistics referring to the binary images reported highest at the boll opening stage than other growth periods in each treatment moreover we observed a continual growth of cv from the seeding stage no great difference between the six groups was observed p 0 05 at the same growth stage fig 5 the matrix flow on the contrary showed a declining trend from the seeding stage which reached the lowest value in the boll opening stage in each group the matrix flow in the seeding stage and squaring stage all had a trend of increasing first and then falling from pw1 to bw2 with the peak at ww2 p 0 05 nonetheless the matrix flow at the flowering bolling stage and boll opening stage in each group appeared to be unaffected and kept at the same standard fig 6 the preferential flow ratio in all treatments all had an up level from the seeding stage and reached a maximum value at the boll opening stage same trend as the cv apart from that the added preferential flow ratio had a trend from the pw1 group 15 56 which was growing to ww2 group 30 73 and decreasing followingly however during the same growth period we found no obvious variation between groups p 0 05 table 2 fig 7 previous studies adopted spraying sprinkling or pouring the dye solution into the iron frame and observed the dyeing patterns in this study we selected drip irrigation as an infiltration way by which the irrigation water can flow towards the root zone at a slow and uniform velocity without surface runoff or deep seepage on the other hand the covering mulch can block the direct continuity between soil moisture body and the atmosphere leading to less evaporation loss therefore the infiltration mainly happened vertically and there was less chance that lateral dispersion would appear beyond that the maximum diameter of the wetting front was maintained at the shallow soil layer under drip irrigation jia et al 2021 thus compared to the results from wu et al 2015 and sheng et al 2009 the dyeing mode in this study showed a more consistent tendency of keeping decreasing from the soil surface in another regard the water movement under drip irrigation is tightly connected to initial soil moisture or 1995 wu et al 2000 in the seeding stage every treatment was applied the emergence water only once the initial water content was not high fig 8 a since low initial water content limitedly influenced the flowing behaviors in soil the non uniform characteristics of the infiltration were not evident xu et al 2012 at the study site the soil water affected by the matrix potential gradient flew from the higher water content region soil surface to the lower water content region since the discharge of the emitter was constant and slow the rapidly downward movement only occurred at the shallow soil layer and then the soil water reached the maximum infiltration depth therefore the dyed area ratio will not change drastically from the soil surface downward and gradually had a difference since the squaring stage predominantly the variability reflected from the binary images is governed by soil properties and cotton s growth whose share of impact differs in different growing stages at the beginning phase of cotton planting when the root system is not mature enough to influence the soil structure the finger shaped flow appears in abundance the factor that makes the finger flow notable is the hydrophobicity of the loam in the field which triggers the generation mechanism of the finger shape preferential paths dekker et al 1994 with steady input as the drip irrigation provides the fingers determined by the saturated hydraulic conductivity are inclined to develop at a constant speed clothier et al 1992 at the same time the water repellency confines the gravitational potential gradient driving the soil water flow to wetted conductive zone rye et al 2017 water flowing through the favored finger paths continues to widen for remaining the lateral matric potential the sustaining depletion of water inhibits the existing finger formation within some certain distances nearby thus permitting another shape being produced dicarlo et al 1999 dicarlo et al 2013 however the macropore was perceivable in the last two growing stages of cotton with the ongoing growth of cotton the developing root systems affect the infiltration by altering the soil fabric in the field instead the fissures generated by dry wet circulation because of the high irrigation frequency required also have an impact on the infiltrating process jarvis et al 2007 the primacy of continuity created by the cotton roots is noted which is distinguished as preferential flow paths bouma et al 1981 therefore in the field the effective hydraulic activities are associated with root based macropore flow lange et al 2009 at the boll opening stage although the cotton s root systems function not as actively as in the flowering bolling stage the stretching paths caused by the mature roots are widened and elongated inducing more degree of non uniformity of the soil water van et al 1989 the evaluation indexes gained from the dyed images cv matrix flow depth preferential flow ratio unveiled that the non uniformity of soil water movement was highest at the boll opening stage in all groups but no sharp difference between groups at the same growth period although we set two infiltration amounts each time the dye tracer imaging experiment was implemented the actual infiltration amounts according to the irrigation quota were not in considerable differentiation 11 l 14 l each time respectively in addition drip irrigation uniformly changed the infiltration process in soil thereby we cannot discover much difference however the cumulative irrigation amount was firmly associated with the wet distance in soil as zhang 2013 stated under the stable number of irrigation times throughout the whole growth periods of cotton the total amount will have an impact on the water movement in the soil accordingly we found the preferential flow extent distinguished between different growing stages in the boll opening stage the cumulative irrigation amount reached the greatest which enlarged the wetting body in soil the existence of the covering film hindered the water beneath the drip from expanding outside the film causing the soil in the film more moisture consequently the degree of non uniformity as well as preferential flow ratio of which were presented highest at this stage although the dyed staining images can determine the preferential flow the results were not accurate if only analyzing the patterns and variations of these images not to mention one of the issues when doing the dyed experiment was limited infiltration amount gradients thus quantification of flow behavior is further explored below 3 2 identification of preferential flow by fractal characteristic parameter the fractal characteristics parameter γ is a critical factor in the active region model which can provide macroscopic inhomogeneous features of water movement in the soil when γ 0 the flowing mode in the soil can be uniform otherwise when 0 γ 1 the soil water presents an un uniform state from eqs 4 6 we can calculate the effective soil water saturation find the dyed area and eventually determine the fractal characteristic parameter by fitting the above values sheng 2009 indicated that the soil below the maximum infiltration should not be dyed due to lateral infiltration as well as flowing hence the description of the non uniformity of water flow in the soil might not be comprehensive enough however we used drip irrigation as the infiltration way in this experiment and there was little probability that the lateral infiltration might appear because of less discharge and a more uniform distribution of soil water therefore it is proper to apply the whole dyed region to describe the non uniform characteristics out of prudence the results of measured values and fitted values are shown in fig 9 and table 3 in which the determination coefficient r2 was high and the fitted outcome was good indicating that the active region model can capture the overall non uniform characteristics of preferential flow in soil under drip irrigation generally the differences of fractal parameters in each group at four growth stages were highlighted showing a complicated flowing mode in soil furthermore in the treatments with degradation film mulched treatments b w the fractal parameters had a trend rising from the seeding stage then pinnacled at the flowering bolling stage and fell again at the boll opening stage however in the treatments covering common plastic film treatment p the steady increase of the fractal feature parameter value was revealed along with the four growth periods according to the results the degree of preferential flow was highest at the flowering bolling stage in ww and bw treatment and at the boll opening stage in pw treatment meanwhile during the same growth period the values of the fractal feature parameter had non negligible differences moreover when implementing the higher the irrigation quota the fractal value was higher interestingly the fractal dimension changed in a similar trend consistent with the fractal feature parameters the irrigation frequency of the flowering bolling stage was higher than in the other three stages table 1 the infiltration situation under the drip irrigation is a combinative effect of point source and line source with the increase of the irrigation times the velocity of soil infiltration will be gradually less than the vertical and lateral mobile velocity of the emitters on the tape thus bringing about an around expansion and intersection of the wetting body in soil li 2006 therefore the initial soil water saturation was high which impacted the non uniform characteristic of soil water movement on the other hand the irrigation quota before each dyeing experiment should also affect the redistribution of the soil water hence influencing the fractal parameters when the irrigation amount increased the dripping time was extended during this process the propulsion rate in the vertical direction of the wetting front became close to that in the horizontal direction the relative importance of the soil matrix potential gradient was weakened due to the unstable flowing behavior the local preferential movement region was more developed than the matrix flow region causing the soil to saturate at a deeper layer as a consequence the γ presented a rising trend with higher irrigation amounts wang and zhang 2006 sheng et al 2009 also the partial degradation process of the black opaque oxidation biodegradable film b and white opaque oxidation biodegradable film w mainly happened in the flowering stage fig 10 at which time the air temperature was high and the light intensity was sufficient with the disintegration of the black and white film the evaporation body s upper boundary had been changed the soil moisture began reshaping compared to the degradative film the common plastic film had more stable soil moisture conservation as a result even in the boll opening stage the soil water saturation was a little higher than in the other three periods nevertheless when the black and white films began rupturing at the boll opening stage the air temperature changed drastically and was lower under such circumstances the preservative function of soil moisture was blocked without film mulched which could cause a decrease in the water saturation and the non uniformity of the water movement in soil bu et al 2013 the mulching film increases the soil moisture in the root zone which effectively regulates soil water transfer under drip irrigation thus expanding the wetting region to the middle position of the film with the increasing irrigation amount qi et al 2018 moreover the soil water dynamics and hydrological process with film mulched are evaluated in different seasons in which the comparatively humid season summer also as the irrigation period will increase the soil water by changing the boundary conditions of the vapor migration between the soil and the atmosphere liu et al 2016 additionally some simulation of the soil water flow under the film mulched differentiates the soil water flow according to the duration of irrigation quickly after irrigation the soil water in the soil surface decreases rapidly to maintain the aeration space for the crops beyond that the soil water keeps moving downward the second and the third days after the irrigation zhang et al 2018 furthermore by improving the soil water content and temperature the film mulching affects the thermal effect of the soil beneath the film resulting in soil wet dry alteration which is more obvious in the soil profile from 20 to 120 cm zhang et al 2019 collectively the application of the film will not influence the soil directly however drivers closely related to the soil such as the evaporation and the processes of vaporization indirectly determine the soil water movement wu et al 2017 if we compare the results obtained from the dye tracer imaging approach and the method of applying fractal feature parameters the extent of preferential flow will be illustrated differently the variability of the images reflected that the degree of the preferential flow was highest in the boll opening stage nevertheless the non uniform characteristic was most evident at the flowering bolling stage in ww and bw treatment and the boll opening stage in pw treatment through analyzing the fractal feature parameters it is also noted that the influence of the degradation film on the soil water movement was not closely related to the analysis of the images which will bring questions in real situation even if the statistics from the staining images did provide a more direct expression of the flowing mode in soil they can t achieve precise and sufficient quantification in contrast the fractal features parameter was a superior method for describing the water flowing behavior in soil and differentiating the non uniformity between groups at the same growth period however the two methods were connected somehow the dye tracer experiment was crucial and was supposed to be used by both in this regard how to properly utilize the data to quantify the un uniformity of the water movement under drip irrigation was our objective however it was still not comprehensive enough to evaluate the degree of soil water movement under drip irrigation the most important limitation lies in the fact that the process of soil water movement in field trials may be much more sophisticated thus we can concentrate on combining the real time analysis of the dyed images and the active region model to fine tune the description of this issue 4 conclusion this investigation was undertaken to design a dye tracer experiment in four growth periods of cotton evaluating the characteristics of preferential flow in drip irrigation cotton fields with different films mulched by four critical growing periods in xinjiang by addressing the variability of the dyed images and calculating the fractal characteristics parameters from soil samples we compared and found that two quantifying methods presented different results the dyed area ratio reflected a dyeing mode of keeping decreasing from soil surface the points that drop to the zero value gradually moved downward along with the growing seasons from soil shallow layer 10 cm 0 cm to the deeper layer 25 30 cm the evaluation indexes extracted from the staining images further illustrated that the preferential flow degree was highest at the boll opening stage all over 80 however no significant difference of non uniformity emerged from different treatments at the same growing stage p 0 05 instead the parameters of the fractal feature in the active region model identified that the preferential flow degree was developed at the flowering bolling stage in treatment with degradation film mulched and the boll opening stage in treatment with plastic film mulched there existed significant differences between different groups during the same growth period p 0 05 by comparison the application of fractal feature parameter captured more drivers influencing the water movement such as the mulched film and irrigation frequency the adoption of this method is more realistic to appraise the water movement concerning the agricultural production under drip irrigation this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of preferential flow in arid areas like xinjiang however further research is also essential to comprehensively determine the real time analysis of the dyed images and the active region model to assess the preferential flow degree comprehensively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9496,zebra chip disease zc is caused by the fastidious phloem limited bacterial pathogen candidatus liberibacter solanacearum lso which is transmitted from plant to plant by the potato psyllid bactericera cockerelli sulc understanding how zc impacts potato solanum tuberosum l physiology could help growers in making more informed crop management decisions measurements of instantaneous leaf physiological responses such as photosynthetic co2 uptake and transpiration on the leaf surface can be used not only for fast screening of affected plants in the field but also for optimizing irrigation management over the 2019 and 2020 field seasons we characterized time course photosynthetic physiological responses of potato plants infested by potato psyllids b cockerelli sulc carrying the lso haplotypes a b potato plants were subjected to different variable rate irrigation vri treatments 100 80 and 60 of field capacity of the soil through a center pivot sprinkler system to examine the impact of the disease on key physiological parameters of photosynthesis and transpiration leaf and air temperatures and hyperspectral profiles of the canopy were also measured and compared the measurements were made during midday weekly from 25 to 50 days after plant infestation dai with bacteriliferous psyllids the results showed that many of the measured variables including stomatal conductance photosynthesis rate transpiration rate quantum yields and normalized difference in vegetation index started to decrease beginning approximately 28 35 dai gradually worsening until 50 dai in both 2019 and 2020 as the infection proceeded the decreases in stomatal conductance in infected plants led to decreases in photosynthesis and transpiration in turn reduced transpiration resulted in increased leaf temperature due to decrease in evaporative cooling on the leaf surface higher leaf temperatures under hot and dry conditions with high light intensity during the daytime would further reduce photosynthetic light harvesting which is supported by our data indicating the damage to the photosynthetic pigment formation and machinery these findings support the previous report that increased leaf temperature in infected plants may have been derived from the closure of stomata in hypersensitive reactions to infection these stomatal responses were detected within 28 dai a week

sprinker zebra chip disease stomatal conductance leaf temperature chlorophyll fluorescence water use efficiency 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is produced around the globe as the 4th most important edible crop following corn rice and wheat potato production reached 370 4 mt on 17 4 mha of the harvested area in 2019 fao 2021 the production volume has been gradually increasing over the past two decades and the united states has contributed to this increase as the 5th largest producer in the world with 19 2 mt of potato harvested in 2019 potato is the most important vegetable crop by production area of 458 561 ha in the united states and texas with approximately 9239 ha ranked 12th in the country in 2017 usda nass 2021 potato production takes place across the state of texas from north to south and the vast majority of this production is grown for chips and to a lesser extent fresh market sales rosson 2006 potato processors in texas such as frito lay provide a major market for high quality texas grown potatoes but each year this production is challenged by a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses that can impact crop yield and quality potato is prone to abiotic stressors especially water deficits ramirez et al 2016 in the semi arid texas high plains irrigation is a mandatory agricultural practice that ensures consistent growth and attainable yield for many crops approximately 80 of the irrigation in this region is provided by center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems colaizzi et al 2009 turner et al 2011 these systems can be equipped with variable rate irrigation vri technology to provide site specific irrigation management which has higher irrigation efficiency compared with conventional irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2013 although potato growers with large acreages are currently using center pivot irrigation systems strategies to optimize irrigation scheduling is gaining attention as less water becomes available due to depletion of groundwater from the ogallala aquifer the principal source of irrigation water scanlon et al 2012 thus managing efficient irrigation without imposing plant stress due to water deficit is a major goal in potato production in the texas high plains another threat to potato production in the region is zebra chip disease zc which has cost growers in texas millions of dollars in losses since its discovery in south texas in 2000 rosson 2006 secor and rivera varas 2004 zc is a bacterial disease putatively caused by the fastidious phloem limited bacterium candidatus liberibacter solanacearum lso which is vectored by the potato psyllid bactericera cockerelli sulc rashed et al 2018 rush et al 2015 workneh et al 2018 the disease is currently prevalent in most potato producing regions of the united states including the pacific northwest rush et al 2015 and also in central and south america and new zealand liefting et al 2008 munyaneza 2012 rush et al 2015 rashed et al 2018 the primary disease symptoms include internal discoloration of potato tubers from which the name of the disease originated munyaneza et al 2012 the discoloration on tubers severely reduces the frying and chipping quality of tubers making them unmarketable munyaneza 2012 rush et al 2015 in addition infected plants display a plethora of above ground disease symptoms in the field such as stunting shortened internodes formation of aerial tubers leaf curling leaf chlorosis vine collapse and eventually plant death munyaneza 2012 rush et al 2015 along with the development of the visually identifiable symptoms above other less obvious physiological responses are likely it was reported that zc disease lowered net photosynthesis rates in leaves further reducing sugar contents in tubers gao et al 2016 however the cause of such reduction in photosynthesis was not clear whether it was limited by stomatal closure in general stomatal control can be remarkably affected as a common immune response to a bacterial disease melotto et al 2006 2017 the opening of guard cells and stomatal conductance are known to be decreased and other physiological processes involved with gas exchange and leaf temperature control via evapotranspiration cooling on the leaf surface can also be affected blatt et al 2017 medlyn et al 2011 the closure of stomata then affects overall plant water relations by reducing the transpirational drive required for water uptake by the roots potatoes are isohydric species and as such have sensitive stomatal control during the day topbjerg et al 2015 also potatoes can maintain leaf water potential even under deficit irrigation conditions a typical behavior of an isohytric species huntenburg et al 2021 reports on stomatal movement and its relations to water uptake in potatoes have been published gerhards et al 2016 ramirez et al 2016 but the impact of zc on the sensitive mechanisms of stomatal control has not been explored in particular such stomatal responses caused by zc could be misconstrued as limited water in the soil which also induces the closure of stomata especially under conditions of drought stress or deficit irrigation thus identifying interactions of zc and limited water availability on the closure of stomata could lead to a better understanding of plant disease interactions and aid farmers in optimizing irrigation in the presence of disease furthermore the use of physiological paramenters for early detection of zc would be a novel approach that could benefit growers and ultimately save water physiological descriptors of plant water status have been used for optimal irrigation timing in potato medici et al 2014 but such an approach has never been used to study crop water use of potato exposed to both deficit irrigation and zc for this reason the objectives of this study were 1 to document the physiological responses of the zc infected potato plants under different irrigation regimes 2 to identify thresholds of various physiological parameters that could be utilized further to ensure earlier detection of the disease and 3 to determine the most appropriate physiological indicator to be implemented in automated irrigation management the time course development of readily measurable physiological parameters was observed and the physiological responses with the development of the zc symptoms were characterized 2 materials and methods a 2 year field experiment was conducted at the conservation production research laboratory at bushland texas the united states 35 11 n 102 06 w 1170 m above sea level to investigate the physiological responses of zc affected plants in relation to irrigation efficiency and impacts of the disease on water use 2 1 study site description and experimental design the site is a semi arid climate where the average annual evaporative demand and precipitation are 2600 mm and 460 mm respectively tolk and evett 2012 the plant hardiness zone of the site falls into the 7a classification united states department of agriculture agricultural research service 2012 the soil of this study site mostly consists of pullman clay loam a fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll with the field capacity and the wilting point reported to be 0 33 m3 m 3 and 0 18 m3 m 3 respectively heng et al 2009 schwartz et al 2003 tolk and evett 2012 unger 1996 detailed conditions of the climate and the soil can be found in rho et al 2020 and o shaughnessy et al 2019 the experimental design was a split plot arrangement with an irrigation treatment set as the main factor there were three irrigation treatments with four replications in the 2019 growing season 100 80 and 60 of the evaporative demand of the potato fields manual m100 m80 and m60 four irrigation treatments were included in the 2020 growing season with three replications 100 and 60 with manually set irrigation m100 and m60 vs 100 and 60 with soil water and plant feedback system h100 and h60 in total there were twelve plots in the experimental fields in both the 2019 and 2020 field seasons each irrigation treatment plot contained subplots of control treatment without psyllid infestations and zc plots with psyllid infestations 2 2 weather data collection a weather station deployed within 10 m of the study site provided climate data including incoming solar radiation wind speed air temperature relative humidity at the standard height of 2 m the weather data were used to calculate the evapotranspiration rate of the field further discussed in the section below o shaughnessy et al 2019 describe the instrumentation of the weather station growing degree days gdd of potatoes were calculated using the air temperature data while setting 4 5 c as the base temperature narayan et al 2015 1 gdd t max t min 2 t base where gdd 0 if gdd t base where t max t min and t base are the maximum the minimum and the base temperatures of the day 2 3 irrigation treatments and soil water content measurements the dimensions of the main treatment plots were 3 53 m width length in the center of each plot a neutron probe access tube was installed to a depth of 2 3 m using a field calibrated neutron probe meter 503dr1 5 instrotek campbell pacific nuclear martinez ca usa soil water content profiles were monitored weekly at 0 2 m intervals the weekly soil water content records for the top 1 5 m of the soil were calculated and used to make irrigation treatments of 100 80 and 60 of field capacity by accordingly modifying the irrigation schedule each week for m100 m80 and m60 treatment plots fig s1a for h100 and h60 treatments in 2020 we installed the tdr sensors 315 l acclima inc meridian id usa which automatically measured soil water contents in given plots fig s1b the tdr sensors were installed horizontally in the plant beds at depths of 10 20 30 and 55 cm continuous measurement from the tdr sensors were used to withhold irrigation when soil water depletion was low 10 depletion of plant available water and apply irrigation when soil water depletion was greater than 35 of plant available water the collected soil water content was directly fed through the irrigation scheduler to provide 100 and 60 of the field capacity irrigation 2 4 potato cultivation a mid season chipping potato variety fl1867 obtained from a commercial potato farm was planted on april 3 5 in 2019 and on april 7 9 in 2020 on a 3 span ari center pivot field valley irrigation system valmont industries inc valley ne usa alternating halves of the center pivot field were used over the two years on an area of 2 83 ha each season semi circular beds were raised and spaced 0 76 m in between using a 4 row planter seed potatoes were planted around 0 17 0 30 cm apart with a planting depth of 20 cm crop management procedures including weed control pest control and fertilization during the seasons were based on standard methods practiced by commercial farmers to ensure optimal growth 2 5 zc disease treatments and verification of infection zebra chip disease plots were established 57 and 55 days after planting dap in 2019 and 2020 respectively in both years a total of twelve treatments plots four replications of three irrigation treatments in 2019 and three replications of four irrigation treatments in 2020 were arranged for the zc plot establishment under 7 6 m2 psyllid proof tents mesh cages u s global resources seattle wa usa the tents were erected at the first fluorescence stage on may 30 2019 and may 27 2020 57 and 55 dap and bacteriliferous psyllids carrying the lso haplotype a b were released into the tents the two distintive lso haplotypes a and b have been identified from potatoes in the united states wen et al 2013 reportedly lso b causes severer tuber symptoms compared with lso a and they can be detected individually or together in potato psyllids yao et al 2016 we cultured psyllids to carry both haplotypes for the study each plot conatined approximately seventy two plants and a tube contaiang 6 psyllids were placed under every other plant within each tent control plots were similarly covered with tents but without psyllids ten days after placement of the psyllids a mix of insecticides abamectin agri mek syngenta greensboro nc usa spirotetramat movento bayer research triangle park nc usa and pymetrozine fullfill syngenta greensboro nc usa was applied into the areas contained in the tents to eliminate the psyllids and ensure that no more infections occurred to the plants adjacent to the tents the tents were removed twenty four hours after insecticide application once the visual symptoms were detected fully expanded youngest leaves along with attached stems on the topmost canopy were sampled for qpcr diagnosis to further verify infection by lso dna was extracted from the samples using a modified protocol with dneasy plant mini kit qiagen valencia ca usa and the presence of lso was determined by qpcr as previously described rashed et al 2018 using a base rq relative quantification of zero for uninfected plants vigue et al 2020 2 6 simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements approximately 3 weeks after infestation with psyllids in both years simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were taken for characterizing photosynthetic responses of the potato plants at the leaf level these photosynthetic measurements were taken on 1 2 days after the weekly irrigation under light saturated conditions during the midday from 12 00 pm to 2 00 pm measurements were taken weekly beginning 27 and 22 days after infestation dai and completed 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively this time of the day was chosen to highlight potential excess light and high temperature effects of incoming solar radiation on the leaves which could directly affect leaf temperature and other canopy indices we selected the youngest fully expanded leaves from the topmost canopy for these measurements three individual leaves per plant within the designated plots previously under the psyllid tents were measured totaling 9 12 biological replications of the measurements per irrigation treatment in 2019 using a portable gas exchange system li 6400 li cor bioscience inc lincoln ne usa equipped with a 6 cm2 light source 6400 02 li cor we measured net co2 assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate e air temperature tair leaf temperature tleaf and vapor pressure deficit d of the air at each time point from tair and tleaf the temperature difference tdif between the air and leaf was calculated by subtracting tair from tleaf tdif tleaf tair in 2020 the same survey measurements were performed using a portable gas exchange system li 6800 li cor equipped with a 2 cm2 fluorometer 6800 01 a li cor to measure chlorophyll fluorescence parameters together with the gas exchange parameters these fluorescence parameters included electron transport rate etr the quantum yield of psii electron transfer φpsii the quantum yield of co2 fixation φco2 photochemical quenching qp and non photochemical quenching qn throughout the measurements of these variables the co2 concentration of the leaf chamber was maintained at 400 ppm as a proxy for the ambient air in both years and the light intensity of the leaf chamber was maintained at the saturation level of 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 to prevent the momentary closure of stomata affected by passing clouds on the day of measurement the flow rate of the leaf chamber was set to 500 and 600 µmol mol 1 for 2019 and 2020 respectively considering the sizes of the chamber heads of the instruments block temperature rh and light intensity were kept uncontrolled reproducing the ambient conditions after clamping on the leaf sample under the above chamber settings we waited for up to 2 min until the cvs of the measured variables met the system requirements of stability 2 7 spectrophotometry measurements of plant canopy a handheld spectroradiometer sd 2000 ocean optics dunedin fl usa in 2019 ps 100 apogee instruments inc logan ut usa in 2020 was used to measure the hyperspectral profiles of the potato leaves on the canopy although different instruments were used in 2019 and 2020 the sampling procedure was the same as shown below the spectrophotometry measurement was taken one day after the irrigation event each week between 11 30 am and 1 30 pm from 21 to 48 dai in 2019 and 28 51 dai in 2020 before the measurement for the first sample of the day each time the spectroradiometer console was calibrated using a white reflectance standard rs50 stellarnet inc tampa fl usa following the manufacturer s manual the calibration procedure was carried out on site using direct right angled sunlight at solar noon as the light source two leaves from the top of the canopy in each treatment were selected and scanned using the optical cable placed at the right angle to the surface above approximately at 1 m height the reflectance of the light with a wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 1100 nm was collected and averaged over the replicated samples for each treatment from the spectral profiles the reflectances at 680 and 800 nm 531 and 570 nm and 500 680 and 750 nm were used to calculate normalized difference vegetation index ndvi photochemical reflectance index pri and plant senessence reflectance index psri respectively as described in ollinger 2011 as follows 2 ndvi r 800 r 680 r 800 r 680 3 pri r 531 r 570 r 531 r 570 4 psri r 680 r 500 r 750 where r500 r531 r570 r680 r750 and r800 are the reflectances of the light at the wavelength of 500 531 570 680 750 and 800 nm respectively 2 8 tuber harvests potatoes were sampled biweekly from emergence to harvest to track the growth and development of the plants following the protocol described by al gaadi et al 2016 plants from a 10 m2 area around the neutron access probe were selected for destructive sampling within this space plants were counted and tubers from 10 plants were harvested using pitchforks after harvesting the number of tubers per plant were counted and weighed for fresh weight using the fresh weight of the samples tuber yield yd in the unit of mg ha 1 was extrapolated 2 9 reference evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration and crop water use efficiency calculations the calculations of daily evapotranspiration of a short reference crop et0 seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc and related crop water use efficiency wue were estimated using the weather data the soil water content data and the harvest data after completing the data collections of the seasons in both years the methods for these calculations are the same as rho et al 2020 but brief descriptions follow et0 was calculated using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the daily micrometeorological variables air temperature rh solar irradiance and wind speed collected from the weather station were used in the calculations as follows 5 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is net incoming solar irradiance at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat

efficiency term in economics i e no units but has mass per volume units i e kg m 3 2 10 statistical analysis collected data was compiled and analyzed using r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 since different irrigation treatment arrangements were used over the two years of the study due to our focus on the impacts of zc disease on the physiological responses of the potato plants the year to year variations of the measured variables were dropped and the 2019 and 2020 data were analyzed separately and the results are reported accordingly the mixed effect 3 way anova model was used as the irrigation treatments irg the zc treatments inf and dai were assigned to fixed effects with their interaction effects included in the model the plot number was set to random effects following the split plot design of the experiment after the anova testing of the three main factors a posthoc mean separation on the variables measured at each time point was also conducted using the t test procedure to examine the effects of inf pearson s correlation coefficients pearson s r between the leaf physiology variables were determined and compared between non infested and infested groups to examine the effects of inf on the correlations also a simple linear regression with a slope and an intercept was fitted to the relationships between variables the regression coefficients from this fitting were compared between non infested and infested groups using zou 2007 s method that is based on fisher s z transformation in all analyses α 0 05 was used as a criterion for statistical significance 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the 2019 season had precipitation of nearly three times higher 351 3 mm than the historic average while the 2020 season had slightly higher precipitation 168 9 mm showing the highly erratic characteristic of a semi arid climate table 1 average daily maximum and mean vpd of the growing season were greater in 2020 than in 2019 reaching 3 38 kpa as the maximum drier weather conditions recorded in 2020 were also reflected in higher average daily et0 9 8 mm d 1 compared with 8 6 mm d 1 in 2019 daily wind speed and solar irradiance were similar in both years the year 2020 had greater temperature differences between day and night with an average difference of 21 4 c 6 3 c higher than the year 2019 the lower average daily air temperature during the growing season in 2020 resulted in a lower average daily gdd of 15 0 compared to that of 2019 which was 16 4 3 2 yield component analysis the overall trends show that the infection status was a major determinant of the yield responses as tuber yield was significantly reduced by inf among all different irrigation treatments table 2 the number of tubers was almost the same over the two years with about 8 0 9 0 tubers per plant slight but not significant effect by irg and inf were observed in tuber counts in both 2019 and 2020 the tuber yield in m60 and h60 was numerically lower than m100 and h100 in 2019 and 2020 about 15 but not statistically different tuber yield of non infected plants was 32 6 mg ha in 2019 and 19 6 mg ha in 2020 which was a 40 reduction infected plants had significanly lower yield than non infected plants with 35 and 56 reductions in 2019 and 2020 respectively to fully replenish the soil water in non infected plots it took 313 2 and 334 5 mm of water required in 2019 and 2020 respectively infection by lso however reduced irrigation water in 2019 by 22 and by 1 in 2020 water use was lower in the infected plots in both 2019 and 2020 table 2 etc was observed to be lower in infected plants in 2019 from 673 8 to 600 7 mm which was an 11 reduction in water use however no such reduction was observed in 2020 wue was greater in 2019 than that in 2020 but it was significantly reduced by the infection in both years 27 and 55 in 2019 and 2020 each table 2 3 3 crop physiological responses in both 2019 and 2020 the infection treatment negatively impacted all the physiological parameters throughout the season table 3 in contrast irrigation treatments did not significanly affect the physiological parameters until 4 weeks after the infestation there were no significant differences between non infected and infected plants in all phsysiological measurements however disease symptoms represented by the decreased physiological parameters developed over time were observed starting around 35 dai apparently showing the temporal evolution of the disease 3 4 time course development of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence responses in year to year comparisons a was greater whilst g s and e were lower in 2019 than those in 2020 figs 1 2 and 3 in both 2019 and 2020 g s in both non infected and infected plants decreased over time by 46 and 32 averaged over irrigation treatment by the last measurement made 48 or 51 dai as plants matured fig 1 however except for the first measurement made 27 or 28 dai g s of infected plants was lower than that in non infected plants fig 1 the diffirence was first observed 36 dai in both years while reaching averages of 45 and 32 reductions by the infection 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 each fig 1 similar patterns of declining parameters over time were observed in the other gas exchange responses in both 2019 and 2020 no significant differences between infected and non infected were found in a and e until 36 dai figs 2 and 3 although a fluctuated to some extent at the beginning in 2019 overall it declined in infected plants over time by 13 fig 2 in 2020 it dropped faster compared with the 2019 season in infected plants eventually moving down to a 51 reduction fig 2 e followed the time dependent decreasing patterns shown in g s fig 3 infected plants showed no difference from non infected plants in e at the beginning but showed 43 and 31 decreases by the end of the measurement in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 3 3 5 time course development of leaf temperature responses and its impacts on the photochemistry t dif relates to evaporative cooling on the leaf surface by transpiration fig 4 overall infected plants had higher t dif values both in 2019 and 2020 although seasonal variation was observed in the data in 2019 significant increases in t dif above 0 c were observed quickly 36 dai throughout the season regardless of irrigation treatments t dif of infected plants was higher by 1 c 42 dai in 2020 despite non statistical significance t dif in infected plants was numerically greater by about 0 2 0 5 c than that of non infected plants for φpsii and φco2 declining patterns of the values were observed over time irrespective of infection and irrigation treatments figs 5 and 6 the statistical differences in infection treatments were first observed 36 dai in both parameters the quantum yield of psii electron transfer of infected plants was lower by 32 43 dai compared with non infected controls fig 5 the quantum yield of co2 fixation of infected plants decreased even to negative values 43 dai fig 6 3 6 damage on leaf surfaces detected by hyperspectral profiles signature patterns of the spectral profile illustrated clearly differences in ndvi pri and psri fig 7 ndvi decreased with the infection of zc from 0 746 to 0 459 in 2019 and from 0 753 to 0 619 in 2020 p 0 01 fig 7 and table 3 pri also decreased by zc infection from 0 068 to 0 119 in 2019 and from 0 097 to 0 128 in 2020 whereas psri increased from 0 043 to 0 198 in 2019 and from 0 067 to 0 141 in 2020 p 0 001 fig 7 and table 3 the differences in the hyperspectral profiles were not detected in the beginning data not shown but highly significant differences were observed towards the end dai and dai inf p 0 001 in 2019 for ndvi pri and psri dai inf p 0 01 in 2020 only for ndvi in 2019 ndvi was significantly lower in infected than non infected plants 41 dai in all irrigation treatments by 7 9 and further declined to 32 48 lower 48 dai table 3 similar to the 2019 results in 2020 a decrease in ndvi by zc infection was observed 37 43 dai among irrigation treatments across all irrigation treatments pri was lowered averagely by 38 108 and 18 59 in 2019 and 2020 respectively psri was risen around 4 and 2 folds in infected plants in 2019 and 2020 respectively 3 7 correlation analysis overall the zc infection status did not affect the correlation coefficients of the measured variables in 2019 while some coefficients were lowered by the zc infection in 2020 fig 8 a weak positive correlation between a and g s was found in non infested plants r 0 336 and in infested plants r 0 076 not significant in 2019 fig 8 in 2020 a strong positive correlation was observed in both non infested r 0 804 and infested plants r 0 723 however these reductions in correlation coefficents of a and g s by inf in both seasons were not significant a positive correlation was observed also between a and φ psii r 0 573 in non infested plants in 2020 fig 8 in contrast in infested plants the correlation coeffienct was significantly reduced and the relation broke r 0 089 p 0 05 the correlation between e and t dif was negative in non infested and infested plants in 2019 r 0 512 and 0 209 fig 8 in 2020 the negative correlation of e and t dif was stronger than that in 2019 both in non infested and infested plants r 0 855 and 0 561 the increased r from 0 855 to 0 561 by inf was highly significant p 0 01 the slope of the linear regression of a against g s was not different between non infested and infested plants at the beginning 27 dai in 2019 and 29 dai in 2020 fig 9 but 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively the slope of infested plants was lower than that of non infested although the decrease of the slope was not significant due to a large variation in a and g s of infested plants in 2019 the slope of the linear regression of e against t dif did not change by the zc infection over time in 2019 and 2020 fig 10 infected plants had lower slopes in the linear regression 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively however statistically they were not significant 4 discussion the present study monitored the development of zc symptoms measured by various leaf physiological traits over time results suggested the utility of measuring these traits for identifying zc infected plants under varied irrigation regimes in the field although differed among the measured variables the physiological indicators reached the thresholds level of irreversible damage to the plants at around 5 weeks after zc infections also we found that monitoring stomatal responses or related leaf temperature responses during the midday on sunny days could be useful in disease detection 4 1 zc impacts are found equally throughout the irrigation treatments overall tuber yield in 2019 was greater than that in 2020 likely due to greater seasonal precipitation and fewer temperature fluctuations within a day providing favorable seasonal weather to the potato plants table 1 the different weather conditions affected the physiological responses as well table 3 although there were variations in weather conditions between the two years infection by lso similarly affected the yield in both years which is in agreement with the previous study o shaughnessy et al 2018 irrigation treatments irg did not significantly affect yield but they did affect water use efficiency no interactions between irg with infection treatments inf were observed conversely as disease symptom severity progressed during the season significantly different interactions between inf and the time after infestation dai was clearly documented with the physiological measurements table 3 during the midday when the physiological measurements were performed even 100 irrigation treatment plots m100 and h100 showed the down regulation of photosynthetic gas exchanges which is often also known as midday depression huang et al 2006 thus this time of the day can highlight the differences in leaf temperature on the canopy that may be impacted by either the increased air temperature during the day or due to the impact of zc our results showed further reduction of g s from the midday depression and increases in t dif by zc infection observed at 36 dai in both years the results indicate that the impact of zc on increases in t leaf was greater than those of the increased t air at midday this result could be utilized in strategies to detect disease as infected plants had even lower g s than non infected plants under deficit irrigation regimes in which reduced water availability could also lead to the inhibition of other gas exchange responses a and e usually the temporal decreases in g s a and e by water deficit can be recovered while decreases associated with disease infections will not be recovered by irrigation and will only become worse over time 4 2 decreases in stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration by the lso infection the closure of stomata in response to a pathogenic attack or convoluted threats of biotic or abiotic stressors is a well documented phenomenon in plants melotto et al 2006 2017 it is not surprising to confirm the decreases in g s in our results as the zc proceeded fig 1 table 3 it is noteworthy that the decreases in g s were rather gradual as the symptoms of zc spread throughout the infected plants shown by the significant interactions of inf dai treatment in both years interference in the uptake of co2 for photosynthetic assimilation by lso infection was easily anticipated as similar responses have been documented in other disease systems zhou et al 2004 fig 2 table 3 less co2 uptake and the corresponding decrease in a could be explained by the closed stomata the damaged photosynthetic machinery or both our time course observations illustrate decreases in a began with the closed stomata and later were aggravated with the combined effects of the closed stomata and the reduced capacity of light harvesting decreases in φpsii finally the decreases also were associated with damage to the photosynthetic pigments represented by decreases in ndvi chlorophyll content measured by a handheld chlorophyll meter was also reduced in the 2020 results data not shown in addition the reduced g s led to decreases in e in turn affecting water uptake of the plants fig 3 table 3 thus reductions in water use followed as observed in etc table 2 this also could be identified through the soil water content profiling although the detection of such a response would be detected with a delay o shaughnessy et al 2020 4 3 decreased evaporative cooling on the leaf surface increases in leaf temperatures by the zc infection resulted in a reduction of photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency eventually damaged photosynthetic machinery decreased e caused increased t leaf in infected plants making t dif between the ambient air and the leaf surface greater fig 4 table 3 this behavioral change was also observed in the relationships between e and t dif values although it was not statistically significant due to the large variation among infected samples fig 10 this connects with the decrease in t leaf and potentially crop water stress index cwsi rud et al 2014 although we did not examine cwsi in this study this may indicate the detection of zc by thermospectral approaches could be useful in certain applications based on the condition that the calibration for cwsi is correctly conducted especially in a semi arid climate jones 2004 at the beginning of zc symptom development decreases in a were first detected 36 dai as the disease continued the reductions in the efficiency of photosynthetic light harvesting fig 5 and also photosynthetic co2 fixation fig 6 each represented by φpsii and φco2 could be attributable to the decreases in a the impediment of the light reactions was observed by decreases in φpsii fig 5 table 3 similar to the observations made by zhou et al 2004 reduction in photosynthetic light harvesting decreased overall photosynthetic capacity indicated by the coordination with the light reaction complexes and the carbon reaction efficiency also declined fig 6 table 3 highly correlated relationship between a and φ psii was broken 51 dai by inf fig 8 which also showing the reduction in a at this time point was non stomatal biochemical limitation even some of the infested plants that were dead or extremely wilted did not photosynthesize rather respired instead shown by the negative φco2 the corresponding decreases in ndvi indexes in the following weeks would explain this as well fig 7 table 3 the damage to the photochemical apparatus also can be detected in fv fm index baker 2008 a common response of heat or drought stress that accounts for the increased burden on non photochemical quenching of the excessive light energy over the photochemical capacity as a result the down regulation of the heat dissipation machinery can induce the temperature increase on the leaf surface as shown in our t dif data fig 4 as indicated by the delay of the detectable responses between t dif and ndvi temperature based detection of the water stress was reported to be more efficient than the hyperspectral measurements of the canopy in potato gerhards et al 2016 4 4 water not efficiently used in the current irrigation schedule the earlier zc can be detected the more irrigation water can be conserved our findings suggest that early detection of zc could be facilitated by scouting for psyllids in the field followed by molecular confirmation of the pathogen in the lab within 2 weeks about 4 5 weeks after psyllid infestation one can use a porometer or a leaf temperature measurement system to detect physiological disease symptoms then 6 7 weeks after infection hyperspectral profiles of the canopy or soil water profiles can differentiate between healthy and diseased spots inthe field as the damage to the leaves by infection becomes noticeable with availability of commercially available site specific irrigation technologies early detection of disease symptoms can be coordinated with revised irrigation scheduling to reduce irrigation applications to diseased plants infected plants and drought stressed plants look similar in spectral images due to increased leaf temperature fig s2 however infected plants do not readily respond to increased irrigations since they have reduced capacity to take up water but drought stressed plants readily recover following an irrigation as long as it occurs before plants reach the permanent wilting point the thresholds of water restrictions in potatoes were suggested to be 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 for g s and 5 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 for a respectively ramirez et al 2016 our results also showed that g s and a progressed to lower under these threshold levels which was observed after 36 and 43 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively in infested plants figs 1 and 2 this observation in line with the literature may indicate zc reduced the water uptake capability of the potatoes fastly that cannot be reversible however infection of zc did not affect intrinsic wue at the leaf level a g s the slopes of the regression lines in fig 9 only until at the end of the measurement 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 so detecting the fine line between the impacts of water deficit and zc would be the decisive factor to address the issue and to modify the corresponding irrigation schedule for further enhancement of irrigation wue 5 conclusions in both years zc significantly lowered the yield and wue of potatoes grown under an overhead sprinkler irrigation system as zc developed over time within 28 dai only qpcr based molecular detection was possible while the field detection of infection was difficult due to lack of disease symptoms however around 36 dai the decreases in stomatal conductance were observed during the midday and also the decreases in photosynthetic co2 uptake transpirational water loss and subsequent increase in leaf temperature were noted as a consequence a reduction in water uptake by infected plants was detectable the degree of such decreases was greater with lso infection than the temporal drought stress by higher vpd during the midday when the photosynthetic limitation is the greatest as disease symptoms further developed photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency also was reduced by 42 dai and damage to photosynthetic pigments was indicated by 48 51 dai these results suggest that the earliest detection of zc symptoms by field instruments could best be achieved by measurement of stomatal responses or leaf temperature based detection compared to a hyperspectral profile of the leaves future work is required to implement the temperature based detection of zc symptoms during the midday and to determine how to send this feedback to an automated irrigation system to increase crop and irrigation wue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9496,zebra chip disease zc is caused by the fastidious phloem limited bacterial pathogen candidatus liberibacter solanacearum lso which is transmitted from plant to plant by the potato psyllid bactericera cockerelli sulc understanding how zc impacts potato solanum tuberosum l physiology could help growers in making more informed crop management decisions measurements of instantaneous leaf physiological responses such as photosynthetic co2 uptake and transpiration on the leaf surface can be used not only for fast screening of affected plants in the field but also for optimizing irrigation management over the 2019 and 2020 field seasons we characterized time course photosynthetic physiological responses of potato plants infested by potato psyllids b cockerelli sulc carrying the lso haplotypes a b potato plants were subjected to different variable rate irrigation vri treatments 100 80 and 60 of field capacity of the soil through a center pivot sprinkler system to examine the impact of the disease on key physiological parameters of photosynthesis and transpiration leaf and air temperatures and hyperspectral profiles of the canopy were also measured and compared the measurements were made during midday weekly from 25 to 50 days after plant infestation dai with bacteriliferous psyllids the results showed that many of the measured variables including stomatal conductance photosynthesis rate transpiration rate quantum yields and normalized difference in vegetation index started to decrease beginning approximately 28 35 dai gradually worsening until 50 dai in both 2019 and 2020 as the infection proceeded the decreases in stomatal conductance in infected plants led to decreases in photosynthesis and transpiration in turn reduced transpiration resulted in increased leaf temperature due to decrease in evaporative cooling on the leaf surface higher leaf temperatures under hot and dry conditions with high light intensity during the daytime would further reduce photosynthetic light harvesting which is supported by our data indicating the damage to the photosynthetic pigment formation and machinery these findings support the previous report that increased leaf temperature in infected plants may have been derived from the closure of stomata in hypersensitive reactions to infection these stomatal responses were detected within 28 dai a week earlier than the differences in hyperspectral profiles observed 35 dai and could be implemented in early disease detection strategiesusing measurements of leaf temperature keywords center pivot sprinker zebra chip disease stomatal conductance leaf temperature chlorophyll fluorescence water use efficiency 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is produced around the globe as the 4th most important edible crop following corn rice and wheat potato production reached 370 4 mt on 17 4 mha of the harvested area in 2019 fao 2021 the production volume has been gradually increasing over the past two decades and the united states has contributed to this increase as the 5th largest producer in the world with 19 2 mt of potato harvested in 2019 potato is the most important vegetable crop by production area of 458 561 ha in the united states and texas with approximately 9239 ha ranked 12th in the country in 2017 usda nass 2021 potato production takes place across the state of texas from north to south and the vast majority of this production is grown for chips and to a lesser extent fresh market sales rosson 2006 potato processors in texas such as frito lay provide a major market for high quality texas grown potatoes but each year this production is challenged by a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses that can impact crop yield and quality potato is prone to abiotic stressors especially water deficits ramirez et al 2016 in the semi arid texas high plains irrigation is a mandatory agricultural practice that ensures consistent growth and attainable yield for many crops approximately 80 of the irrigation in this region is provided by center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems colaizzi et al 2009 turner et al 2011 these systems can be equipped with variable rate irrigation vri technology to provide site specific irrigation management which has higher irrigation efficiency compared with conventional irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2013 although potato growers with large acreages are currently using center pivot irrigation systems strategies to optimize irrigation scheduling is gaining attention as less water becomes available due to depletion of groundwater from the ogallala aquifer the principal source of irrigation water scanlon et al 2012 thus managing efficient irrigation without imposing plant stress due to water deficit is a major goal in potato production in the texas high plains another threat to potato production in the region is zebra chip disease zc which has cost growers in texas millions of dollars in losses since its discovery in south texas in 2000 rosson 2006 secor and rivera varas 2004 zc is a bacterial disease putatively caused by the fastidious phloem limited bacterium candidatus liberibacter solanacearum lso which is vectored by the potato psyllid bactericera cockerelli sulc rashed et al 2018 rush et al 2015 workneh et al 2018 the disease is currently prevalent in most potato producing regions of the united states including the pacific northwest rush et al 2015 and also in central and south america and new zealand liefting et al 2008 munyaneza 2012 rush et al 2015 rashed et al 2018 the primary disease symptoms include internal discoloration of potato tubers from which the name of the disease originated munyaneza et al 2012 the discoloration on tubers severely reduces the frying and chipping quality of tubers making them unmarketable munyaneza 2012 rush et al 2015 in addition infected plants display a plethora of above ground disease symptoms in the field such as stunting shortened internodes formation of aerial tubers leaf curling leaf chlorosis vine collapse and eventually plant death munyaneza 2012 rush et al 2015 along with the development of the visually identifiable symptoms above other less obvious physiological responses are likely it was reported that zc disease lowered net photosynthesis rates in leaves further reducing sugar contents in tubers gao et al 2016 however the cause of such reduction in photosynthesis was not clear whether it was limited by stomatal closure in general stomatal control can be remarkably affected as a common immune response to a bacterial disease melotto et al 2006 2017 the opening of guard cells and stomatal conductance are known to be decreased and other physiological processes involved with gas exchange and leaf temperature control via evapotranspiration cooling on the leaf surface can also be affected blatt et al 2017 medlyn et al 2011 the closure of stomata then affects overall plant water relations by reducing the transpirational drive required for water uptake by the roots potatoes are isohydric species and as such have sensitive stomatal control during the day topbjerg et al 2015 also potatoes can maintain leaf water potential even under deficit irrigation conditions a typical behavior of an isohytric species huntenburg et al 2021 reports on stomatal movement and its relations to water uptake in potatoes have been published gerhards et al 2016 ramirez et al 2016 but the impact of zc on the sensitive mechanisms of stomatal control has not been explored in particular such stomatal responses caused by zc could be misconstrued as limited water in the soil which also induces the closure of stomata especially under conditions of drought stress or deficit irrigation thus identifying interactions of zc and limited water availability on the closure of stomata could lead to a better understanding of plant disease interactions and aid farmers in optimizing irrigation in the presence of disease furthermore the use of physiological paramenters for early detection of zc would be a novel approach that could benefit growers and ultimately save water physiological descriptors of plant water status have been used for optimal irrigation timing in potato medici et al 2014 but such an approach has never been used to study crop water use of potato exposed to both deficit irrigation and zc for this reason the objectives of this study were 1 to document the physiological responses of the zc infected potato plants under different irrigation regimes 2 to identify thresholds of various physiological parameters that could be utilized further to ensure earlier detection of the disease and 3 to determine the most appropriate physiological indicator to be implemented in automated irrigation management the time course development of readily measurable physiological parameters was observed and the physiological responses with the development of the zc symptoms were characterized 2 materials and methods a 2 year field experiment was conducted at the conservation production research laboratory at bushland texas the united states 35 11 n 102 06 w 1170 m above sea level to investigate the physiological responses of zc affected plants in relation to irrigation efficiency and impacts of the disease on water use 2 1 study site description and experimental design the site is a semi arid climate where the average annual evaporative demand and precipitation are 2600 mm and 460 mm respectively tolk and evett 2012 the plant hardiness zone of the site falls into the 7a classification united states department of agriculture agricultural research service 2012 the soil of this study site mostly consists of pullman clay loam a fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll with the field capacity and the wilting point reported to be 0 33 m3 m 3 and 0 18 m3 m 3 respectively heng et al 2009 schwartz et al 2003 tolk and evett 2012 unger 1996 detailed conditions of the climate and the soil can be found in rho et al 2020 and o shaughnessy et al 2019 the experimental design was a split plot arrangement with an irrigation treatment set as the main factor there were three irrigation treatments with four replications in the 2019 growing season 100 80 and 60 of the evaporative demand of the potato fields manual m100 m80 and m60 four irrigation treatments were included in the 2020 growing season with three replications 100 and 60 with manually set irrigation m100 and m60 vs 100 and 60 with soil water and plant feedback system h100 and h60 in total there were twelve plots in the experimental fields in both the 2019 and 2020 field seasons each irrigation treatment plot contained subplots of control treatment without psyllid infestations and zc plots with psyllid infestations 2 2 weather data collection a weather station deployed within 10 m of the study site provided climate data including incoming solar radiation wind speed air temperature relative humidity at the standard height of 2 m the weather data were used to calculate the evapotranspiration rate of the field further discussed in the section below o shaughnessy et al 2019 describe the instrumentation of the weather station growing degree days gdd of potatoes were calculated using the air temperature data while setting 4 5 c as the base temperature narayan et al 2015 1 gdd t max t min 2 t base where gdd 0 if gdd t base where t max t min and t base are the maximum the minimum and the base temperatures of the day 2 3 irrigation treatments and soil water content measurements the dimensions of the main treatment plots were 3 53 m width length in the center of each plot a neutron probe access tube was installed to a depth of 2 3 m using a field calibrated neutron probe meter 503dr1 5 instrotek campbell pacific nuclear martinez ca usa soil water content profiles were monitored weekly at 0 2 m intervals the weekly soil water content records for the top 1 5 m of the soil were calculated and used to make irrigation treatments of 100 80 and 60 of field capacity by accordingly modifying the irrigation schedule each week for m100 m80 and m60 treatment plots fig s1a for h100 and h60 treatments in 2020 we installed the tdr sensors 315 l acclima inc meridian id usa which automatically measured soil water contents in given plots fig s1b the tdr sensors were installed horizontally in the plant beds at depths of 10 20 30 and 55 cm continuous measurement from the tdr sensors were used to withhold irrigation when soil water depletion was low 10 depletion of plant available water and apply irrigation when soil water depletion was greater than 35 of plant available water the collected soil water content was directly fed through the irrigation scheduler to provide 100 and 60 of the field capacity irrigation 2 4 potato cultivation a mid season chipping potato variety fl1867 obtained from a commercial potato farm was planted on april 3 5 in 2019 and on april 7 9 in 2020 on a 3 span ari center pivot field valley irrigation system valmont industries inc valley ne usa alternating halves of the center pivot field were used over the two years on an area of 2 83 ha each season semi circular beds were raised and spaced 0 76 m in between using a 4 row planter seed potatoes were planted around 0 17 0 30 cm apart with a planting depth of 20 cm crop management procedures including weed control pest control and fertilization during the seasons were based on standard methods practiced by commercial farmers to ensure optimal growth 2 5 zc disease treatments and verification of infection zebra chip disease plots were established 57 and 55 days after planting dap in 2019 and 2020 respectively in both years a total of twelve treatments plots four replications of three irrigation treatments in 2019 and three replications of four irrigation treatments in 2020 were arranged for the zc plot establishment under 7 6 m2 psyllid proof tents mesh cages u s global resources seattle wa usa the tents were erected at the first fluorescence stage on may 30 2019 and may 27 2020 57 and 55 dap and bacteriliferous psyllids carrying the lso haplotype a b were released into the tents the two distintive lso haplotypes a and b have been identified from potatoes in the united states wen et al 2013 reportedly lso b causes severer tuber symptoms compared with lso a and they can be detected individually or together in potato psyllids yao et al 2016 we cultured psyllids to carry both haplotypes for the study each plot conatined approximately seventy two plants and a tube contaiang 6 psyllids were placed under every other plant within each tent control plots were similarly covered with tents but without psyllids ten days after placement of the psyllids a mix of insecticides abamectin agri mek syngenta greensboro nc usa spirotetramat movento bayer research triangle park nc usa and pymetrozine fullfill syngenta greensboro nc usa was applied into the areas contained in the tents to eliminate the psyllids and ensure that no more infections occurred to the plants adjacent to the tents the tents were removed twenty four hours after insecticide application once the visual symptoms were detected fully expanded youngest leaves along with attached stems on the topmost canopy were sampled for qpcr diagnosis to further verify infection by lso dna was extracted from the samples using a modified protocol with dneasy plant mini kit qiagen valencia ca usa and the presence of lso was determined by qpcr as previously described rashed et al 2018 using a base rq relative quantification of zero for uninfected plants vigue et al 2020 2 6 simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements approximately 3 weeks after infestation with psyllids in both years simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were taken for characterizing photosynthetic responses of the potato plants at the leaf level these photosynthetic measurements were taken on 1 2 days after the weekly irrigation under light saturated conditions during the midday from 12 00 pm to 2 00 pm measurements were taken weekly beginning 27 and 22 days after infestation dai and completed 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively this time of the day was chosen to highlight potential excess light and high temperature effects of incoming solar radiation on the leaves which could directly affect leaf temperature and other canopy indices we selected the youngest fully expanded leaves from the topmost canopy for these measurements three individual leaves per plant within the designated plots previously under the psyllid tents were measured totaling 9 12 biological replications of the measurements per irrigation treatment in 2019 using a portable gas exchange system li 6400 li cor bioscience inc lincoln ne usa equipped with a 6 cm2 light source 6400 02 li cor we measured net co2 assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate e air temperature tair leaf temperature tleaf and vapor pressure deficit d of the air at each time point from tair and tleaf the temperature difference tdif between the air and leaf was calculated by subtracting tair from tleaf tdif tleaf tair in 2020 the same survey measurements were performed using a portable gas exchange system li 6800 li cor equipped with a 2 cm2 fluorometer 6800 01 a li cor to measure chlorophyll fluorescence parameters together with the gas exchange parameters these fluorescence parameters included electron transport rate etr the quantum yield of psii electron transfer φpsii the quantum yield of co2 fixation φco2 photochemical quenching qp and non photochemical quenching qn throughout the measurements of these variables the co2 concentration of the leaf chamber was maintained at 400 ppm as a proxy for the ambient air in both years and the light intensity of the leaf chamber was maintained at the saturation level of 1500 µmol m 2 s 1 to prevent the momentary closure of stomata affected by passing clouds on the day of measurement the flow rate of the leaf chamber was set to 500 and 600 µmol mol 1 for 2019 and 2020 respectively considering the sizes of the chamber heads of the instruments block temperature rh and light intensity were kept uncontrolled reproducing the ambient conditions after clamping on the leaf sample under the above chamber settings we waited for up to 2 min until the cvs of the measured variables met the system requirements of stability 2 7 spectrophotometry measurements of plant canopy a handheld spectroradiometer sd 2000 ocean optics dunedin fl usa in 2019 ps 100 apogee instruments inc logan ut usa in 2020 was used to measure the hyperspectral profiles of the potato leaves on the canopy although different instruments were used in 2019 and 2020 the sampling procedure was the same as shown below the spectrophotometry measurement was taken one day after the irrigation event each week between 11 30 am and 1 30 pm from 21 to 48 dai in 2019 and 28 51 dai in 2020 before the measurement for the first sample of the day each time the spectroradiometer console was calibrated using a white reflectance standard rs50 stellarnet inc tampa fl usa following the manufacturer s manual the calibration procedure was carried out on site using direct right angled sunlight at solar noon as the light source two leaves from the top of the canopy in each treatment were selected and scanned using the optical cable placed at the right angle to the surface above approximately at 1 m height the reflectance of the light with a wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 1100 nm was collected and averaged over the replicated samples for each treatment from the spectral profiles the reflectances at 680 and 800 nm 531 and 570 nm and 500 680 and 750 nm were used to calculate normalized difference vegetation index ndvi photochemical reflectance index pri and plant senessence reflectance index psri respectively as described in ollinger 2011 as follows 2 ndvi r 800 r 680 r 800 r 680 3 pri r 531 r 570 r 531 r 570 4 psri r 680 r 500 r 750 where r500 r531 r570 r680 r750 and r800 are the reflectances of the light at the wavelength of 500 531 570 680 750 and 800 nm respectively 2 8 tuber harvests potatoes were sampled biweekly from emergence to harvest to track the growth and development of the plants following the protocol described by al gaadi et al 2016 plants from a 10 m2 area around the neutron access probe were selected for destructive sampling within this space plants were counted and tubers from 10 plants were harvested using pitchforks after harvesting the number of tubers per plant were counted and weighed for fresh weight using the fresh weight of the samples tuber yield yd in the unit of mg ha 1 was extrapolated 2 9 reference evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration and crop water use efficiency calculations the calculations of daily evapotranspiration of a short reference crop et0 seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc and related crop water use efficiency wue were estimated using the weather data the soil water content data and the harvest data after completing the data collections of the seasons in both years the methods for these calculations are the same as rho et al 2020 but brief descriptions follow et0 was calculated using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the daily micrometeorological variables air temperature rh solar irradiance and wind speed collected from the weather station were used in the calculations as follows 5 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is net incoming solar irradiance at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat

efficiency term in economics i e no units but has mass per volume units i e kg m 3 2 10 statistical analysis collected data was compiled and analyzed using r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 since different irrigation treatment arrangements were used over the two years of the study due to our focus on the impacts of zc disease on the physiological responses of the potato plants the year to year variations of the measured variables were dropped and the 2019 and 2020 data were analyzed separately and the results are reported accordingly the mixed effect 3 way anova model was used as the irrigation treatments irg the zc treatments inf and dai were assigned to fixed effects with their interaction effects included in the model the plot number was set to random effects following the split plot design of the experiment after the anova testing of the three main factors a posthoc mean separation on the variables measured at each time point was also conducted using the t test procedure to examine the effects of inf pearson s correlation coefficients pearson s r between the leaf physiology variables were determined and compared between non infested and infested groups to examine the effects of inf on the correlations also a simple linear regression with a slope and an intercept was fitted to the relationships between variables the regression coefficients from this fitting were compared between non infested and infested groups using zou 2007 s method that is based on fisher s z transformation in all analyses α 0 05 was used as a criterion for statistical significance 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the 2019 season had precipitation of nearly three times higher 351 3 mm than the historic average while the 2020 season had slightly higher precipitation 168 9 mm showing the highly erratic characteristic of a semi arid climate table 1 average daily maximum and mean vpd of the growing season were greater in 2020 than in 2019 reaching 3 38 kpa as the maximum drier weather conditions recorded in 2020 were also reflected in higher average daily et0 9 8 mm d 1 compared with 8 6 mm d 1 in 2019 daily wind speed and solar irradiance were similar in both years the year 2020 had greater temperature differences between day and night with an average difference of 21 4 c 6 3 c higher than the year 2019 the lower average daily air temperature during the growing season in 2020 resulted in a lower average daily gdd of 15 0 compared to that of 2019 which was 16 4 3 2 yield component analysis the overall trends show that the infection status was a major determinant of the yield responses as tuber yield was significantly reduced by inf among all different irrigation treatments table 2 the number of tubers was almost the same over the two years with about 8 0 9 0 tubers per plant slight but not significant effect by irg and inf were observed in tuber counts in both 2019 and 2020 the tuber yield in m60 and h60 was numerically lower than m100 and h100 in 2019 and 2020 about 15 but not statistically different tuber yield of non infected plants was 32 6 mg ha in 2019 and 19 6 mg ha in 2020 which was a 40 reduction infected plants had significanly lower yield than non infected plants with 35 and 56 reductions in 2019 and 2020 respectively to fully replenish the soil water in non infected plots it took 313 2 and 334 5 mm of water required in 2019 and 2020 respectively infection by lso however reduced irrigation water in 2019 by 22 and by 1 in 2020 water use was lower in the infected plots in both 2019 and 2020 table 2 etc was observed to be lower in infected plants in 2019 from 673 8 to 600 7 mm which was an 11 reduction in water use however no such reduction was observed in 2020 wue was greater in 2019 than that in 2020 but it was significantly reduced by the infection in both years 27 and 55 in 2019 and 2020 each table 2 3 3 crop physiological responses in both 2019 and 2020 the infection treatment negatively impacted all the physiological parameters throughout the season table 3 in contrast irrigation treatments did not significanly affect the physiological parameters until 4 weeks after the infestation there were no significant differences between non infected and infected plants in all phsysiological measurements however disease symptoms represented by the decreased physiological parameters developed over time were observed starting around 35 dai apparently showing the temporal evolution of the disease 3 4 time course development of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence responses in year to year comparisons a was greater whilst g s and e were lower in 2019 than those in 2020 figs 1 2 and 3 in both 2019 and 2020 g s in both non infected and infected plants decreased over time by 46 and 32 averaged over irrigation treatment by the last measurement made 48 or 51 dai as plants matured fig 1 however except for the first measurement made 27 or 28 dai g s of infected plants was lower than that in non infected plants fig 1 the diffirence was first observed 36 dai in both years while reaching averages of 45 and 32 reductions by the infection 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 each fig 1 similar patterns of declining parameters over time were observed in the other gas exchange responses in both 2019 and 2020 no significant differences between infected and non infected were found in a and e until 36 dai figs 2 and 3 although a fluctuated to some extent at the beginning in 2019 overall it declined in infected plants over time by 13 fig 2 in 2020 it dropped faster compared with the 2019 season in infected plants eventually moving down to a 51 reduction fig 2 e followed the time dependent decreasing patterns shown in g s fig 3 infected plants showed no difference from non infected plants in e at the beginning but showed 43 and 31 decreases by the end of the measurement in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 3 3 5 time course development of leaf temperature responses and its impacts on the photochemistry t dif relates to evaporative cooling on the leaf surface by transpiration fig 4 overall infected plants had higher t dif values both in 2019 and 2020 although seasonal variation was observed in the data in 2019 significant increases in t dif above 0 c were observed quickly 36 dai throughout the season regardless of irrigation treatments t dif of infected plants was higher by 1 c 42 dai in 2020 despite non statistical significance t dif in infected plants was numerically greater by about 0 2 0 5 c than that of non infected plants for φpsii and φco2 declining patterns of the values were observed over time irrespective of infection and irrigation treatments figs 5 and 6 the statistical differences in infection treatments were first observed 36 dai in both parameters the quantum yield of psii electron transfer of infected plants was lower by 32 43 dai compared with non infected controls fig 5 the quantum yield of co2 fixation of infected plants decreased even to negative values 43 dai fig 6 3 6 damage on leaf surfaces detected by hyperspectral profiles signature patterns of the spectral profile illustrated clearly differences in ndvi pri and psri fig 7 ndvi decreased with the infection of zc from 0 746 to 0 459 in 2019 and from 0 753 to 0 619 in 2020 p 0 01 fig 7 and table 3 pri also decreased by zc infection from 0 068 to 0 119 in 2019 and from 0 097 to 0 128 in 2020 whereas psri increased from 0 043 to 0 198 in 2019 and from 0 067 to 0 141 in 2020 p 0 001 fig 7 and table 3 the differences in the hyperspectral profiles were not detected in the beginning data not shown but highly significant differences were observed towards the end dai and dai inf p 0 001 in 2019 for ndvi pri and psri dai inf p 0 01 in 2020 only for ndvi in 2019 ndvi was significantly lower in infected than non infected plants 41 dai in all irrigation treatments by 7 9 and further declined to 32 48 lower 48 dai table 3 similar to the 2019 results in 2020 a decrease in ndvi by zc infection was observed 37 43 dai among irrigation treatments across all irrigation treatments pri was lowered averagely by 38 108 and 18 59 in 2019 and 2020 respectively psri was risen around 4 and 2 folds in infected plants in 2019 and 2020 respectively 3 7 correlation analysis overall the zc infection status did not affect the correlation coefficients of the measured variables in 2019 while some coefficients were lowered by the zc infection in 2020 fig 8 a weak positive correlation between a and g s was found in non infested plants r 0 336 and in infested plants r 0 076 not significant in 2019 fig 8 in 2020 a strong positive correlation was observed in both non infested r 0 804 and infested plants r 0 723 however these reductions in correlation coefficents of a and g s by inf in both seasons were not significant a positive correlation was observed also between a and φ psii r 0 573 in non infested plants in 2020 fig 8 in contrast in infested plants the correlation coeffienct was significantly reduced and the relation broke r 0 089 p 0 05 the correlation between e and t dif was negative in non infested and infested plants in 2019 r 0 512 and 0 209 fig 8 in 2020 the negative correlation of e and t dif was stronger than that in 2019 both in non infested and infested plants r 0 855 and 0 561 the increased r from 0 855 to 0 561 by inf was highly significant p 0 01 the slope of the linear regression of a against g s was not different between non infested and infested plants at the beginning 27 dai in 2019 and 29 dai in 2020 fig 9 but 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively the slope of infested plants was lower than that of non infested although the decrease of the slope was not significant due to a large variation in a and g s of infested plants in 2019 the slope of the linear regression of e against t dif did not change by the zc infection over time in 2019 and 2020 fig 10 infected plants had lower slopes in the linear regression 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively however statistically they were not significant 4 discussion the present study monitored the development of zc symptoms measured by various leaf physiological traits over time results suggested the utility of measuring these traits for identifying zc infected plants under varied irrigation regimes in the field although differed among the measured variables the physiological indicators reached the thresholds level of irreversible damage to the plants at around 5 weeks after zc infections also we found that monitoring stomatal responses or related leaf temperature responses during the midday on sunny days could be useful in disease detection 4 1 zc impacts are found equally throughout the irrigation treatments overall tuber yield in 2019 was greater than that in 2020 likely due to greater seasonal precipitation and fewer temperature fluctuations within a day providing favorable seasonal weather to the potato plants table 1 the different weather conditions affected the physiological responses as well table 3 although there were variations in weather conditions between the two years infection by lso similarly affected the yield in both years which is in agreement with the previous study o shaughnessy et al 2018 irrigation treatments irg did not significantly affect yield but they did affect water use efficiency no interactions between irg with infection treatments inf were observed conversely as disease symptom severity progressed during the season significantly different interactions between inf and the time after infestation dai was clearly documented with the physiological measurements table 3 during the midday when the physiological measurements were performed even 100 irrigation treatment plots m100 and h100 showed the down regulation of photosynthetic gas exchanges which is often also known as midday depression huang et al 2006 thus this time of the day can highlight the differences in leaf temperature on the canopy that may be impacted by either the increased air temperature during the day or due to the impact of zc our results showed further reduction of g s from the midday depression and increases in t dif by zc infection observed at 36 dai in both years the results indicate that the impact of zc on increases in t leaf was greater than those of the increased t air at midday this result could be utilized in strategies to detect disease as infected plants had even lower g s than non infected plants under deficit irrigation regimes in which reduced water availability could also lead to the inhibition of other gas exchange responses a and e usually the temporal decreases in g s a and e by water deficit can be recovered while decreases associated with disease infections will not be recovered by irrigation and will only become worse over time 4 2 decreases in stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration by the lso infection the closure of stomata in response to a pathogenic attack or convoluted threats of biotic or abiotic stressors is a well documented phenomenon in plants melotto et al 2006 2017 it is not surprising to confirm the decreases in g s in our results as the zc proceeded fig 1 table 3 it is noteworthy that the decreases in g s were rather gradual as the symptoms of zc spread throughout the infected plants shown by the significant interactions of inf dai treatment in both years interference in the uptake of co2 for photosynthetic assimilation by lso infection was easily anticipated as similar responses have been documented in other disease systems zhou et al 2004 fig 2 table 3 less co2 uptake and the corresponding decrease in a could be explained by the closed stomata the damaged photosynthetic machinery or both our time course observations illustrate decreases in a began with the closed stomata and later were aggravated with the combined effects of the closed stomata and the reduced capacity of light harvesting decreases in φpsii finally the decreases also were associated with damage to the photosynthetic pigments represented by decreases in ndvi chlorophyll content measured by a handheld chlorophyll meter was also reduced in the 2020 results data not shown in addition the reduced g s led to decreases in e in turn affecting water uptake of the plants fig 3 table 3 thus reductions in water use followed as observed in etc table 2 this also could be identified through the soil water content profiling although the detection of such a response would be detected with a delay o shaughnessy et al 2020 4 3 decreased evaporative cooling on the leaf surface increases in leaf temperatures by the zc infection resulted in a reduction of photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency eventually damaged photosynthetic machinery decreased e caused increased t leaf in infected plants making t dif between the ambient air and the leaf surface greater fig 4 table 3 this behavioral change was also observed in the relationships between e and t dif values although it was not statistically significant due to the large variation among infected samples fig 10 this connects with the decrease in t leaf and potentially crop water stress index cwsi rud et al 2014 although we did not examine cwsi in this study this may indicate the detection of zc by thermospectral approaches could be useful in certain applications based on the condition that the calibration for cwsi is correctly conducted especially in a semi arid climate jones 2004 at the beginning of zc symptom development decreases in a were first detected 36 dai as the disease continued the reductions in the efficiency of photosynthetic light harvesting fig 5 and also photosynthetic co2 fixation fig 6 each represented by φpsii and φco2 could be attributable to the decreases in a the impediment of the light reactions was observed by decreases in φpsii fig 5 table 3 similar to the observations made by zhou et al 2004 reduction in photosynthetic light harvesting decreased overall photosynthetic capacity indicated by the coordination with the light reaction complexes and the carbon reaction efficiency also declined fig 6 table 3 highly correlated relationship between a and φ psii was broken 51 dai by inf fig 8 which also showing the reduction in a at this time point was non stomatal biochemical limitation even some of the infested plants that were dead or extremely wilted did not photosynthesize rather respired instead shown by the negative φco2 the corresponding decreases in ndvi indexes in the following weeks would explain this as well fig 7 table 3 the damage to the photochemical apparatus also can be detected in fv fm index baker 2008 a common response of heat or drought stress that accounts for the increased burden on non photochemical quenching of the excessive light energy over the photochemical capacity as a result the down regulation of the heat dissipation machinery can induce the temperature increase on the leaf surface as shown in our t dif data fig 4 as indicated by the delay of the detectable responses between t dif and ndvi temperature based detection of the water stress was reported to be more efficient than the hyperspectral measurements of the canopy in potato gerhards et al 2016 4 4 water not efficiently used in the current irrigation schedule the earlier zc can be detected the more irrigation water can be conserved our findings suggest that early detection of zc could be facilitated by scouting for psyllids in the field followed by molecular confirmation of the pathogen in the lab within 2 weeks about 4 5 weeks after psyllid infestation one can use a porometer or a leaf temperature measurement system to detect physiological disease symptoms then 6 7 weeks after infection hyperspectral profiles of the canopy or soil water profiles can differentiate between healthy and diseased spots inthe field as the damage to the leaves by infection becomes noticeable with availability of commercially available site specific irrigation technologies early detection of disease symptoms can be coordinated with revised irrigation scheduling to reduce irrigation applications to diseased plants infected plants and drought stressed plants look similar in spectral images due to increased leaf temperature fig s2 however infected plants do not readily respond to increased irrigations since they have reduced capacity to take up water but drought stressed plants readily recover following an irrigation as long as it occurs before plants reach the permanent wilting point the thresholds of water restrictions in potatoes were suggested to be 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 for g s and 5 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 for a respectively ramirez et al 2016 our results also showed that g s and a progressed to lower under these threshold levels which was observed after 36 and 43 dai in 2019 and 2020 respectively in infested plants figs 1 and 2 this observation in line with the literature may indicate zc reduced the water uptake capability of the potatoes fastly that cannot be reversible however infection of zc did not affect intrinsic wue at the leaf level a g s the slopes of the regression lines in fig 9 only until at the end of the measurement 48 and 50 dai in 2019 and 2020 so detecting the fine line between the impacts of water deficit and zc would be the decisive factor to address the issue and to modify the corresponding irrigation schedule for further enhancement of irrigation wue 5 conclusions in both years zc significantly lowered the yield and wue of potatoes grown under an overhead sprinkler irrigation system as zc developed over time within 28 dai only qpcr based molecular detection was possible while the field detection of infection was difficult due to lack of disease symptoms however around 36 dai the decreases in stomatal conductance were observed during the midday and also the decreases in photosynthetic co2 uptake transpirational water loss and subsequent increase in leaf temperature were noted as a consequence a reduction in water uptake by infected plants was detectable the degree of such decreases was greater with lso infection than the temporal drought stress by higher vpd during the midday when the photosynthetic limitation is the greatest as disease symptoms further developed photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency also was reduced by 42 dai and damage to photosynthetic pigments was indicated by 48 51 dai these results suggest that the earliest detection of zc symptoms by field instruments could best be achieved by measurement of stomatal responses or leaf temperature based detection compared to a hyperspectral profile of the leaves future work is required to implement the temperature based detection of zc symptoms during the midday and to determine how to send this feedback to an automated irrigation system to increase crop and irrigation wue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9497,disentangling the impacts of water deficit and lack of irrigation infrastructure on critical food supplies such as rice in countries like bangladesh remains a challenge in this paper we explore this challenge using north bengal as a case study site over 1979 2018 we characterise crop water surplus deficit with meteorological and soil moisture data and analyse the coherence of these timeseries with rice production in the study region we then examine the trends periodicities and degree of coherence between crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production our results indicate an almost constant water deficit during winter and maximum water deficits in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods critically crop water surplus shows a significantly decreasing trend since 1979 during the monsoon period we find that the correlation between crop water surplus deficit while strongly correlated with meteorological drought weakens over time this is suggestive of the important role that irrigation development has played over this period although the severity and frequency of water deficits have increased during the study period possibly as a result of climate change or variability rice production has decoupled from this trend and is instead positively correlated with irrigation despite this encouraging finding it is unknown if technological progress will continue and whether there will be sufficient extractable groundwater and surface water to meet increasing irrigation demand in the future our finding of a long term increase in water deficit underscores the likely future challenges in these critical rice growing regions for the people of bangladesh should this trend continue the future sufficient rice production in the region will likely rely on the availability of reliable and affordable fuel or electric power to operate irrigation systems and a proactive and vigilant approach to agricultural water security in a variable and changing climate keywords water scarcity agricultural drought monsoon food security irrigation infrastructure climatic and hydrological change data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author 1 introduction water is an essential input for agricultural production there is a strong relationship between water availability and crop yield ali and talukder 2008 kaushika et al 2019 mancosu et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 however agricultural sectors particularly in drying regions but also other parts of the world have suffered more widespread and intense water scarcity it is projected that agricultural and meteorological drought will increase in the future ipcc et al 2021 although hydroclimate projections remain uncertain and regionally diverse jentsch and beierkuhnlein 2008 goodess 2013 the variability in precipitation and surface water supplies in many places are also projected to increase which will in turn affect the agricultural water requirements kang et al 2009 wada et al 2013 for example some studies have projected that the average rice yield will decrease by 33 by 2050 in major rice growing areas in bangladesh due to higher rainfall variability and increasing irrigation water demand by 14 rahman 2017 rahman et al 2012 ghose et al 2021a moreover the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc predicted that by 2050 the country might lose 8 of rice production and 32 of wheat production as a result of projected temperature rises and sea level changes misra 2017 the impact varies amongst crops and the effects of temperature are more prominent than rainfall rahman 2017 although there will be a positive impact of co2 fertilisation on crop growth kirkham 2011 due to climate change and higher water demand agricultural production may experience a 57 median reduction by 2090 elliott et al 2014 critically crop water surplus deficit is one of the prime issues in sustainable water management javed et al 2020 water surplus deficit is dependent on the seasonal and annual variability in precipitation and evapotranspiration which affect the requirement and supply of crop water surplus deficit rahman et al 2018 moreover water scarcity occurs when the water supply is insufficient and the demand for freshwater exceeds the supply due to the high competition among all water using sectors deng and zhao 2015 mancosu et al 2015 taheripour et al 2015 taylor 2009 thus developing irrigation systems and enhancing efficiency improves crop productivity yu et al 2018 reducing dependence on rainfed agriculture dawit et al 2020 to meet the demand for food and ensure food security without further clearing of forest land agriculture that is currently rainfed may require irrigation in the future several studies have proven that identifying the irrigation potential of an area could play a pivotal role in increasing agricultural crop productivity dawit et al 2020 in many cases it is expected that water deficit can be predicted avoided or mitigated moreover it is possible to balance the increasing amount of irrigable area and water use in agriculture with improved irrigation technology bartolini et al 2007 though it is believed that freshwater for agriculture is sufficient to meet the demand by 2050 proper technology investment and management systems are required de fraiture and wichelns 2010 molden et al 2007 in addition unsustainable water withdrawals will create a substantial water deficit and result in the reduction of agricultural production which will further limit the food requirement in many developing countries such as bangladesh atapattu and kodituwakku 2009 grafton et al 2017 levidow et al 2014 ma et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2020 mottaleb et al 2019 playán and mateos 2006 about 41 of the labour force works in the agricultural sector in bangladesh contributing about 14 2 to the gross domestic product gdp finance division 2018 it is projected that a 50 reduction of crop production would increase poverty by a similar percentage thomas et al 2013 notably the barind tract and teesta floodplain regions of north bengal of bangladesh are two of the important agro ecological zones considered as the food bank of the country are vulnerable to drought and seasonal water scarcity mahmud et al 2021 indicate that the monsoonal rainfall is decreasing and rainless days are increasing in north bengal due to which water use sustainability is at great stake in addition due to the declining trend in both rivers and ground water levels especially during the dry season it is predicted that irrigated rice production will face water scarcity salem et al 2017 mahmud et al 2021 it is essential to estimate the crop water surplus deficit to determine the crop water requirement particularly the seasonal amount of water required by a crop to achieve its potential production under given environmental conditions pereira et al 2020 although numerous studies have been conducted mostly on the impacts of climate change only a handful focused on drought severity and intensity most of which are based on models and farmers perception akter and rahman 2012 dash et al 2012 ghose et al 2021b habiba et al 2014 hasan et al 2018 kamruzzaman et al 2018 mondol et al 2016 rafiuddin et al 2011 rahman et al 2018 salam et al 2021a 2021b shahid and behrawan 2008 so far there has been no comprehensive study on the impact of drought and irrigation on agriculture in bangladesh in this paper we analysed spatio temporal variability of crop water surplus and deficit and used it to assess the impacts of drought and irrigation on agriculture more specifically we aimed to a explore the characteristics of crop water surplus cws and crop water deficit cwd on daily seasonal and annual bases in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain regions of north bengal of bangladesh b analyse the spatio temporal variations and trends of crop water surplus deficit and irrigation in the region and c measure the strength of the relationships and periodicity between seasonal crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production the novelty of our paper is that it explores for the first time the crop water surplus and crop water deficit for different rice growing seasons of bangladesh based on climatic and plant soil base data to observe the trend and its spatio temporal variation also we analysed the relationship of crop water surplus deficit and irrigation with rice production and measured the strength of this relationship and if any periodicity exists between them this helps to find out intra annual and decadal variability of crop water surplus or deficit and irrigation moreover we cross compared crop water surplus and deficit results with the effective drought index edi mondol et al 2021 the crop water surplus or deficit and the use of irrigation pumps are related to a country s agricultural production which is further related to global food security therefore the understanding of crop water requirements and potential impacts of climate change is essential in agro meteorology and the methods used and insights into the effectiveness of crop water surplus deficit for drought characterisation and the impact of meteorological drought and irrigation on crop production of this research can be useful for other regions where there is a provision and dependency of using rainwater and where the construction of irrigation infrastructure is growing fast for the purpose of crop water availability especially in south and south east asian regions and similar regions elsewhere 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the barind tract and teesta floodplain regions situated in the northwest region of bangladesh considered as two important agro ecological zones of the country fig 1 this area makes up the majority of the rajshahi and rangpur divisions the topography of the barind tract area is dome shaped with undulatory relief with elevation ranging from 15 to 45 m above the mean sea level shahid et al 2015 while non calcareous alluvium soils occupy extensive areas on the active teesta islam et al 2017 most of the barind tract lands are high to medium highlands whereas most of the teesta floodplain lands are medium high to medium lowlands mondol et al 2021 medium highland and medium lowland are commonly flooded between 90 and 180 cm deep during the flood season while high lands are generally free from normal flood level which is considered as an inundated area not exceeding 21 of the total land of the country bangladesh bureau of statistics 2019 mirza 2002 the study area experiences about 1400 1800 mm rainfall annually in the barind tract regions and a little over 2000 mm in the teesta floodplain regions shahid and khairulmaini 2009 drought and water scarcity are recurrent events in the study area while people living in these areas are directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture paul 1995 shahid et al 2015 historical drought data of bangladesh indicate that north bengal suffer from drought in the year 1979 1982 83 1989 1992 1994 95 2001

bangladesh meteorological department bmd http www bmddataportal com for rangpur dinajpur bogra and rajshahi weather stations fig 1 the data acquired for these stations include daily rainfall daily maximum minimum temperature wind speed and relative humidity the elevation data for each station were collected from bmd we used penman monteith evapotranspiration fao 56 method to calculate the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 prior to analysis a small number of missing data were infilled similar to our previous study by mondol et al 2021 2 2 2 soil property and agricultural data the sand and clay fraction data for the study area were adopted from moslehuddin et al 2005 and shamsuzzoha et al 2003 the percentage of organic matter om data were taken from bhuiya 1987 moslehuddin et al 1997 and hussain et al 2013 which were used to calculate the field capacity and wilting point of the soil these studies were conducted in the same study area the crop coefficient kc and water depletion fraction ρ data were retrieved from allen et al 1998 the crop yield and agricultural data were collected from the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs and the bangladesh agricultural research council barc although people used traditional irrigation methods to cultivate rice before 1979 irrigation data was not well organised people started using modern irrigation e g diesel power pumps in small numbers during the 1980 s thus due to the data constraint and limitations we selected 1979 2018 as the study period 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 crop water surplus or

seasonal water surplus or deficit in the study area we measured the moving ten thirty and ninety day water surplus deficit 2 3 2 relative frequency of crop water deficit we analysed the relative frequency of water deficit for different months and different starting and ending periods mondol et al 2021 for example the water deficit for any supra season six month relative frequency of water deficit was calculated for jan jun feb jul mar aug and dec may etc in the same way for seasonal water deficit frequency the pre monsoon season mar may and monsoon season jun sep a 3 month and 4 month relative frequency of water deficit were computed respectively thus for any starting and ending period between january to december monthly to twelve months the relative frequency of crop water deficit rfcwd was computed as 11 r f c w d o v e r a p e r i o d tndwd tnd 100 where tndwd total number of days with a water deficit in the period tnd the total number of days in the period 2 3 3 irrigation development and its impact on rice production irrigation development was analysed based on the changes in the irrigated area and irrigation methods over time including inter seasonal changes the relationships between irrigated area irrigation methods and rice production were analysed using linear regression with analysis of variance anova 2 3 4 multi phase correlation among crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production the correlation of the crop water surplus deficit and irrigation with rice production were analysed using the pearson correlation coefficient r however the temporal annual and seasonal changes in crop water surplus deficit and irrigation can potentially impose a greater impact on rice production thus in this research we evaluated the impact and periodicity of crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production to understand the variability of rice production and its correlation with crop water surplus deficit and irrigation variations through the cross wavelet transformation xwt and wavelet coherence wtc analysis most traditional methods that are used to analyse periodicities e g fourier analysis are based on the assumption that the underlying processes are stationary over time r li et al 2020 in contrast based on the wavelet transform and cross spectrum analysis the cross wavelet analysis is one of the most effective tools for finding time varying correlations between two time series souza and felix 2018 xwt can effectively examine the linkage between two time series in the time frequency domain r li et al 2020 this method identifies the regions in a time frequency space where two time series show high or low common power covariance peng et al 2018 torrence and compo 1998 it also produces the relative phase angle in the time frequency space between two time series which can be used to get the lag response behaviour between the two time series in contrast to xwt wavelet coherence wtc is the degree of coherence between two wavelet transformations y li et al 2020 it identifies significant coherence correlation or association even with a low common power and indicates confidence levels against noise highlighting locally phase locked patterns peng et al 2018 torrence and compo 1998 since water availability deficit irrigation and agricultural production are highly variable and largely non stationary changes over time understanding the potential driving forces could be gained using the cross wavelet analysis liu et al 2018 the xwt of two time series x x1 x2 xn and y y1 y2 yn was defined as follows grinsted et al 2004 12 w xy w x w y where denotes the complex conjugate and wxy is the cross wavelet power spectrum the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of two time series with background power spectra p k x and p k y is given in torrence and compo 1998 as 13 d w n x s w n x s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with the probability p for a probability density function pdf defined by the square root of the product of two χ2 distributions at the 5 significance level in wavelet transformation the starting and endpoint of any finite length time series have errors in the estimation of the local wavelet power spectrum thus to reduce the edge effects the time series was padded with zeros at the endpoint before conducting wavelet transformation and then zeros were removed however padding with zeros introduces artificial discontinuities at the endpoints of the data the region where zero padding affects the measurement and a discontinuity at the edge drops by a factor of e 2 in the wavelet spectrum is known as cone of influence coi grinsted et al 2004 to find the phase differences between the components of two time series we calculated the mean and confidence interval of the phase differences moreover to quantify the phase relationship we used the circular mean of the phase angels over regions with higher than 5 statistical significance outside the coi grinsted et al 2004 the circular mean of a set of angles a i i 1 n was defined as grinsted et al 2004 14 a m arg x y with x i 1 n cos a i and y i 1 n sin a i since the phase angles are not independent of each other and are difficult to calculate the number of angles used in the calculation can be set arbitrarily high simply by increasing the scale resolution the distribution of angles around the mean which is the circular standard deviation was calculated as grinsted et al 2004 15 s 2 ln r n where r x 2 y 2 the wtc of two time series was defined as grinsted et al 2004 16 r n 2 m m s 1 w n xy s 2 m s 1 w n x s 2 m s 1 w n y s 2 where m is a smoothing operator more details on wtc can be found in torrence and compo 1998 and labat 2010 in this study the code developed by grinsted et al 2004 was used to calculate xwt and wtc 3 results 3 1 crop water surplus or deficit figs 2 3 show the daily crop water surplus deficit based on the sum of different moving days in the study area over 1979 2018 the results indicate that almost persistent water deficits existed from november to mid february less than 15 mm and from mid february to mid april 15 45 mm based on the sum of moving ten days of crop water surplus deficit fig 2 a and fig 3a it is observed that there was more variability in crop water surplus deficit from mid april to the end of may whereas in the first half of the study period 1979 1994 there were more water deficits of more than 45 mm for a few years in the recent decades comparatively lower water deficits were found during march to may 61 152 days than in the other periods fig 2 a and fig 3a the result indicates that during the 1980 s pre monsoon periods had the maximum water deficit for some years e g 1979 1982 and 1989 compared to recent decades in both regions though the monsoon period 152 273 days was mostly free of water deficit fig 2 b c and fig 3 b c many water deficit days were detected during this period based on the sum of moving ten days fig 2a and fig 3a in the analysis based on thirty moving days some water deficit days were also identified during monsoon periods however no water deficit was found based on the sum of ninety moving days in both regions during this season fig 2 b c and fig 3 b c crop water surplus deficit was also variable during the post monsoon period 274 310 days and on average 16 30 mm water deficits existed for ten day periods overall it can be said that the barind tract and the teesta floodplain had short term water deficits during monsoons short to medium term water deficits during pre monsoons and seasonal water scarcity during winter there existed inter annual and inter seasonal variabilities in crop water surplus deficit based on all moving sums of crop water surplus deficit in both regions there were also spatial variations in rain water surplus or deficit fig 4 fig 4 shows the dry periods were also longer in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain fig 5 illustrates the temporal trend of seasonal water surplus deficit of the study area results indicate that there was almost the same amount of water deficit during the winter from 1979 to 2018 the highest amount of water scarcity existed in the pre monsoon time when the variability of water surplus and the deficit was also high fig 5b during the monsoon period there was no water scarcity fig 5c however there was high variability in the water surplus during this time historically recognised drought years had relatively very low water surplus during the monsoon period the post monsoon water surplus and the deficit were also variable most of the time the forty year data of crop water surplus deficit indicate that water surplus decreased significantly in monsoons in both areas fig 5c and on the annual scale in the teesta floodplain fig 5e water surplus increased by a small amount during the pre monsoon period which was not significant however there was less annual water surplus in recent decades than in the earlier decades of the study period 1979 2018 fig 5e 3 2 relative frequency of daily water deficit in different months and seasons fig 6 shows the relative frequencies of water deficit days in different starting and ending months one month to twelve months in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain calculated based on the sum of ten moving days of crop water surplus deficit over the periods of 1979 2018 the results indicate that oct may had the higher percentage of water deficit days while june sep had the lowest percentage water deficit was mainly seasonal mostly lasting for 3 4 months although there was a wet period and water surplus during the monsoon period at least 10 20 of water stress days were observed in the teesta floodplain while the relative frequency was at least 2 more in the barind tract region than in the teesta floodplain area between 1979 and 2018 3 3 trends in irrigated area irrigation methods and rice production over the years the use of modern irrigation equipment such as power pumps increased significantly in the study area due to the electrification and supply of diesel fuel while the traditional irrigation methods using for example the swing basket and doon to obtain water from canals decreased substantially fig 7 a b shows the use of power pumps deep tube wells and shallow tube wells over 1979 2018 there has been a steady increase in the use of power pumps and deep tube wells and rapid growth in the use of shallow tube wells in all areas fig 7 c shows that the total irrigated area rapidly increased in 1979 only 5 12 of the land was irrigated whereas in 2018 it had reached 55 60 fig 7d fig 8 shows the production of different types of rice over the 40 years in the study area it can be seen that aus rice production decreased significantly in the teesta floodplain while in the barind tract aus rice production reached its lowest point in 2003 and then steadily increased the production of aman rice increased significantly in both regions however during the period 1990 1994 the aman rice production was low when a severe drought hit the regions mondol et al 2016 nury and hasan 2016 rafiuddin et al 2011 rahman and lateh 2016 selvaraju and baas 2007 the boro rice production has increased rapidly over the area 3 4 periodicity and correlation between crop water surplus deficit and rice production fig 9 shows that crop water surplus or deficit does not strongly correlate with aus and aman rice production but crop water surplus deficit has a slightly positive correlation with boro rice production this indicates that crop water surplus or deficit measured using climate and soil plant based data cannot predict rice production in the study area this relationship was further explored through the use of xwt and wtc fig 10 and supplementary figure 1 show the xwt and wtc of crop water surplus deficit during boro aman and aus growth seasons with boro aman and aus rice production respectively in barind tract bt and teesta floodplain tf we have used arrows to depict the relative phase relationship between the two time series means in phase positive relationship 0 means anti phase negative relationship 180 means that the crop water surplus deficit time series leading the rice production series by 90 i e a lag of one quarter between changes in crop water surplus deficit and rice production and means that the crop water surplus deficit time series is lagging the rice production series by 90 the black contours appearing as islands indicate the area where the coherence spreads a significance level of α 0 05 relative to a red noise spectrum a red noise spectrum has lag 1 autocorrelation between two successive time series and has a correlation coefficient 0 r 1 matyasovszky 2013 the y axis represents the resonance periods in years the cross hatched area displays the cone of influence in which edge effects degrade the analysis grinsted et al 2004 we found a resonance period of 2 3 years from 1995 to 2005 for crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production in the teesta floodplain region supp fig 3 b whereas we found a resonance period of 1 8 years from 1979 to 1986 in the barind tract region for crop water surplus deficit during boro rice period supp fig 3 c we found two short term cycles of 1 2 years from 1987 to 1990 and 3 4 years from 2010 to 2014 in the barind tract region while found a resonance period of 1 4 years from 1979 to 1991 in the teesta floodplain region for crop water surplus deficit during aus season supp fig 3 e f however we found a significant negative coherence between crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production from 1998 to 2007 and from 2014 to 2018 whereas we found a positive relationship from 1989 to 1997 in the barind tract and a significant positive coherence from 1979 to 1998 in the teesta floodplain fig 10 a b these results indicate that the teesta floodplain and barind tract regions had inter annual variations in crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production before the 1990 s and quasi decadal variations in the 1990 s fig 10 a b the wtc indicates that overall crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production were negatively correlated fig 10 during the boro rice period we found that crop water surplus deficit had a positive relationship with boro rice production for a very short time in the barind tract from 1986 to 1994 while we found significant negative coherence from 1979 to 1995 for a resonance period of 6 8 years fig 10 c however we found no such significant coherence in the teesta floodplain during this time fig 10 d in the teesta floodplain region we found positive coherence during 1979 1985 for a resonance period of 4 6 years and significant negative coherence for a resonance period of 1 2 years from 1998 to 2003 and a resonance period of 4 5 years from 1995 to 2000 fig 10 d these results indicate that during boro rice seasons crop water surplus deficit and rice production had an inter annual relationship the two time series were generally in an anti phase position indicating that crop water surplus deficit had a significant negative correlation with rice production fig 10 c d overall there was a negative relationship between crop water surplus deficit and aus rice production while a positive relationship existed in the recent decades for resonance periods of about 7 5 8 5 years from 2009 to 2018 in the barind tract and a resonance period of 3 4 years from 2010 to 2018 in the teesta floodplain fig 10 e f it should be noted that the significant coherence between crop water surplus deficit and rice production does not necessarily imply a statistically significant fluctuation in the wavelet powers of the series over two periods for instance neither the crop water surplus deficit nor boro rice production time series in the teesta floodplain fig 10 a b had a significant power at a scale of 4 5 years from 1995 to 2000 and a scale of 1 2 years from 1998 to 2003 but they displayed significant coherence during these periods fig 10 c d similar patterns were found in the aman and aus periods the significant coherence between crop water surplus deficit and rice production shows inconsistencies in the two regions 3 5 periodicity and correlation between irrigated area and rice production fig 11 shows the correlation between the irrigated area and the production of different types of rice we found a strong positive correlation between rice production and irrigated area except in the barind tract region during the aus rice period the correlation results were significant for aman and boro rice in all regions fig 12 and supplementary figure 2 show the xwt and wtc of the irrigated area during boro aman and aus seasons with boro aman and aus rice production in the barind tract bt and teesta floodplain tf there was a cycle in the barind tract with a resonance period of 2 3 years from 1997 to 2002 for the irrigated area and aman rice production supp fig 2 a and a resonance period of 1 2 years from 1997 to 2000 for the irrigated area and aus rice production in the teesta floodplain supp fig 2 f however we found strong significant positive correlations between the irrigated area and rice production in all cases except aus rice in the barind tract region fig 12 again there was significant coherence between the irrigated area and rice production however significant coherence between irrigated areas and rice production does not necessarily indicate that those two time series wavelet powers are statistically significant for instance neither the irrigated area time series nor the boro and aman rice production of the teesta floodplain and aus rice production in both regions had a significant common power but displayed significant coherence during those periods fig 12 supp fig 2 a d in addition significant coherence between the irrigated area and rice production series suggests that the two time series were more consistent in both regions than the crop water surplus deficit and rice production time series 4 discussion this paper assessed crop water surplus deficit characteristics in different times and seasons along with the relationship between crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production in two important agro ecological zones of bangladesh our analyses indicated that water surplus deficit patterns varied significantly in both short term and long term periods it was evident that the barind tract and teesta floodplain experienced an almost constant water deficit over the winter period figs 2 5 it was found that the highest water deficit occurred during the pre monsoon period although in recent decades a decreasing trend was observed in the water deficit in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain which was not significant figs 2 5 this result is in line with jahan et al 2010 bangladesh receives two thirds of the annual rainfall during the monsoon shahid and khairulmaini 2009 overall the monsoon had a seasonal water surplus but we found short to medium short term water deficits during this period and the water surplus was significantly decreasing figs 2 3 and 5 other studies have also equally noted this decreasing pattern of the water surplus in north bengal alamgir et al 2015a kamruzzaman et al 2019a 2019b miyan 2015 mohsenipour et al 2018 mondol et al 2017 2016 in these regions winter monsoon and annual rainfall are decreasing while the seasonal and annual temperatures are increasing bari et al 2016 mondol et al 2021 these findings are similar to those from other studies basher et al 2018 mondol et al 2018 mullick et al 2019 nury and hasan 2016 rahman et al 2012 rahman and lateh 2016 syed and al amin 2016 if the current trend of water scarcity continues there will be more frequent dry episodes with varying intensities both in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain fig 5 these results are in line with previous studies e g ahammed et al 2018 habiba et al 2014 islam et al 2021 indicate that there will be more use of groundwater and a shortage of surface water due to increasingly irregular rainfall patterns the number of rainfall days also varied in different seasons supp figs 3 4 in comparison two thirds of the rainfall occur during the monsoon and almost no rain falls in winter the boro rice is grown in winter depending entirely on irrigation rice production currently depends on using modern irrigation equipment to withdraw underground water or using power pumps to irrigate with surface water these kinds of water use and the traditional concept of water scarcity in the study area clearly indicate the potential for technological drought which might be the result of the absence of modern irrigation technology any growing periods that span the two seasons need proper irrigation systems while longer growing seasons starting from or before the monsoon season need more careful water management fig 6 however our study concluded that crop water surplus or deficit caused by climate and soil variability was not positively correlated with rice production while the irrigated area was strongly positively correlated with rice production thus rice production in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain was affected more by irrigation than by climatic and plant soil water based water surplus or deficit fig 7 indicates that over the 40 years of the study areas irrigated using modern methods had been rapidly increasing while traditional methods had been significantly decreasing a study conducted by alam 2015 indicated that better access to electricity and institutional facilities have a greater role in mitigating water scarcity in the barind tract region in addition brammer 2016 considered drought as a minor problem in north bengal of bangladesh and indicated that drought was severe about 30 years ago when irrigation facilities were scarce and agriculture was largely dependent on surface water irrigation using traditional irrigation methods in contrast we found that crop water surplus or deficit had a strong relationship with effective drought index edi mondol et al 2021 supp figs 5 9 our wavelet analysis indicated that crop water surplus or deficit modelled on climatic data could be successfully used to predict meteorological drought supp figs 5 9 however meteorological drought identified with edi and standardized precipitation index spi mondol et al 2021 and crop water surplus deficit based on agroclimatic and plant soil based analysis were unable to predict agricultural production of the area and the relationship was not significantly correlated there was a positive correlation between crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production from 1979 to 1998 when the irrigated area was small and agricultural production relied more on rainfall since 2000 the use of modern irrigation methods has significantly increased which in turn led to an increase in crop production our wtc analysis results indicate a positive relationship between irrigated areas and rice production thus the current argument related to agricultural drought in bangladesh has changed and irrigation availability and unavailability are now the prime factors of crop water surplus deficit over the years people have used different types of adaptive measures to increase agricultural production several studies indicate that there is a tremendous improvement in the installation of shallow tube wells and deep tube wells operated by electricity for irrigation and the use of high yield varieties and fertilisers in north bengal habiba et al 2012 paul 1998 rawlani and sovacool 2011 selvaraju et al 2006 ahmed and chowdhury 2006 bbs 1979 2019 selvaraju 2012 moreover jahan et al 2010 indicated that due to the implementation of the barind integrated area development project in the barind tract region there has been a huge improvement in irrigation using groundwater however the amount of dry season irrigation using groundwater is only one third of the annual rainfall and needs proper water management to maintain the sustainability of water resources csiro et al 2014 moreover as suggested in borrell et al 1997 water use can be reduced without reducing the yield and quality of rice using the saturated soil culture ssc methods which can enhance the rice rotational cropping systems for both irrigated and rainfed systems weak correlation between crop water surplus deficit calculated using agro climatic and soil plant data and rice production in the study area are in line with other studies for example several studies indicate that due to the uncertainties in the simulations and the perspectives of physical and agronomic systems of crop growth and yield it is hard to estimate the impact of water stress and drought asseng et al 2011 elliott et al 2015 folberth et al 2016 leng and hall 2019 li et al 2015 rosenzweig et al 2014 moreover in most cases the drought index cannot explain agricultural production anomalies mondol et al 2021 indicating the need for the integrated assessment of water scarcity risk using more agro climatic and technological data biswas 2004 gain and giupponi 2015 a study conducted in east java by amalo et al 2017 indicates that rice production has increased despite the drought climate anomalies and enso impact due to the increasing use of technology and government initiative a study conducted on small scale rain fed farmers in gaza of mozambique by salite 2019 indicates that farmers do not sufficiently understand climate change and lack scientific data due to the lack of agricultural extension services and the poor use of surface and subsurface water people suffer from water deficits according to personal et al 2007 over the last 10 15 years in east and southeast asia and south asia farmers have adopted new and more productive technologies that enable high production and contribute to impressive economic performance in those countries according to lal 2014 in south africa there exists a wide range of site specific technologies to manage the risks and to reduce water scarcity and also implement some long term adaptive strategies to enhance the resilience of agroecosystems although there is a huge surplus in water during monsoon time in our study area due to the short term dry spell it is not possible to irrigate crops due to the poor management of rain and surface water globally developing and underdeveloped countries lack proper usage of water resources boretti and rosa 2019 thus they cannot use it for agricultural cultivation despite having available water molden et al 2007 this kind of water surplus or deficit cannot account for the area s agricultural production moreover when farmers only depend on rainfall and surface water and use traditional irrigation methods they have to wait for the rain in order to sow the seeds thus climatic and plant soil based crop water surplus deficit cannot be used alone for predicting the agricultural production of an area moreover it is believed that enhancing the green water precipitation supply in the root zone is essential to the sustainability of agriculture and the externalities of blue water withdrawn for irrigation from rivers lakes and aquifers use can be minimised through the uptake of precision irrigation techniques lal 2014 for sustainable use of water resources for agriculture caused by climatic and plant soil based data appropriate regional and national policies proper water management strategies and the identification of the seasonal irrigation water requirement freshwater sources are highly required mancosu et al 2015 mallebrera et al 2010 indicated that although there is crop water available from the segura river basin in southeast spain only one third of the surface water is used for irrigation which further indicates that rainwater or surface water availability does not account for agriculture in an area without the irrigation management barnard et al 2021 indicates that meteorological drought e g standardised precipitation evaporation index can less successfully predict soil moisture availability suggesting more significant data requirements moreover intensified drought damages have enormous negative impacts on agriculture and thus drought assessment plays an essential role in the sustainable use of limited water resources akter and rahman 2012 ruane et al 2013 however using advanced knowledge technology and management timely information can minimise the extent intensity duration and impacts of drought anik et al 2021 iizumi and ramankutty 2015 5 conclusions in this study we measured the crop water surplus and crop water deficit using climatic and plant soil based data of the barind tract and teesta floodplain of bangladesh over 1979 2018 it was found that the barind tract and teesta floodplain suffered short to medium term water scarcity during the monsoon and post monsoon periods and almost persistent seasonal water shortage during winter and the pre monsoon periods a sharp increase in water deficit from the northern to north western regions was found in the study area while the reverse condition existed for water surplus water surplus was found to significantly decrease during the monsoon period with little change in the pre monsoon period the total amount of irrigated area by different modern irrigation methods significantly increased whereas the use of traditional irrigation methods significantly decreased rice production also increased substantially except that the aus rice production decreased in the teesta floodplain crop water surplus or deficit measured based on climatic and plant soil based data can successfully measure the meteorological drought but cannot account for rice production in the area the linkages between irrigation and rice production were time and space dependent dominated by in phase positive relationship the correlation between crop water surplus deficit and rice production was not time and space dependent and their positions were anti phase negative relationship to summarise the severity and frequency of water deficit are increasing whereas rice production is decoupled from this trend and instead positively correlated with irrigation it is unknown whether the technological progress will continue and there will be sufficient extractable groundwater and surface water for irrigation but it is essential to emphasise that the increase in water deficit means there will probably be more challenges if this trend continues in addition these conditions may introduce new dependencies in small scale agricultural production including reliable and affordable irrigation systems and proper agricultural water management therefore it is important to re assess the impacts of crop water surplus and deficit on agricultural production and water resource sustainability using more agro climatic and technological data as well as farmers perceptions and opinions as a further study we intend to examine the prospect of technological drought caused

9497,disentangling the impacts of water deficit and lack of irrigation infrastructure on critical food supplies such as rice in countries like bangladesh remains a challenge in this paper we explore this challenge using north bengal as a case study site over 1979 2018 we characterise crop water surplus deficit with meteorological and soil moisture data and analyse the coherence of these timeseries with rice production in the study region we then examine the trends periodicities and degree of coherence between crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production our results indicate an almost constant water deficit during winter and maximum water deficits in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods critically crop water surplus shows a significantly decreasing trend since 1979 during the monsoon period we find that the correlation between crop water surplus deficit while strongly correlated with meteorological drought weakens over time this is suggestive of the important role that irrigation development has played over this period although the severity and frequency of water deficits have increased during the study period possibly as a result of climate change or variability rice production has decoupled from this trend and is instead positively correlated with irrigation despite this encouraging finding it is unknown if technological progress will continue and whether there will be sufficient extractable groundwater and surface water to meet increasing irrigation demand in the future our finding of a long term increase in water deficit underscores the likely future challenges in these critical rice growing regions for the people of bangladesh should this trend continue the future sufficient rice production in the region will likely rely on the availability of reliable and affordable fuel or electric power to operate irrigation systems and a proactive and vigilant approach to agricultural water security in a variable and changing climate keywords water scarcity agricultural drought monsoon food security irrigation infrastructure climatic and hydrological change data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author 1 introduction water is an essential input for agricultural production there is a strong relationship between water availability and crop yield ali and talukder 2008 kaushika et al 2019 mancosu et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 however agricultural sectors particularly in drying regions but also other parts of the world have suffered more widespread and intense water scarcity it is projected that agricultural and meteorological drought will increase in the future ipcc et al 2021 although hydroclimate projections remain uncertain and regionally diverse jentsch and beierkuhnlein 2008 goodess 2013 the variability in precipitation and surface water supplies in many places are also projected to increase which will in turn affect the agricultural water requirements kang et al 2009 wada et al 2013 for example some studies have projected that the average rice yield will decrease by 33 by 2050 in major rice growing areas in bangladesh due to higher rainfall variability and increasing irrigation water demand by 14 rahman 2017 rahman et al 2012 ghose et al 2021a moreover the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc predicted that by 2050 the country might lose 8 of rice production and 32 of wheat production as a result of projected temperature rises and sea level changes misra 2017 the impact varies amongst crops and the effects of temperature are more prominent than rainfall rahman 2017 although there will be a positive impact of co2 fertilisation on crop growth kirkham 2011 due to climate change and higher water demand agricultural production may experience a 57 median reduction by 2090 elliott et al 2014 critically crop water surplus deficit is one of the prime issues in sustainable water management javed et al 2020 water surplus deficit is dependent on the seasonal and annual variability in precipitation and evapotranspiration which affect the requirement and supply of crop water surplus deficit rahman et al 2018 moreover water scarcity occurs when the water supply is insufficient and the demand for freshwater exceeds the supply due to the high competition among all water using sectors deng and zhao 2015 mancosu et al 2015 taheripour et al 2015 taylor 2009 thus developing irrigation systems and enhancing efficiency improves crop productivity yu et al 2018 reducing dependence on rainfed agriculture dawit et al 2020 to meet the demand for food and ensure food security without further clearing of forest land agriculture that is currently rainfed may require irrigation in the future several studies have proven that identifying the irrigation potential of an area could play a pivotal role in increasing agricultural crop productivity dawit et al 2020 in many cases it is expected that water deficit can be predicted avoided or mitigated moreover it is possible to balance the increasing amount of irrigable area and water use in agriculture with improved irrigation technology bartolini et al 2007 though it is believed that freshwater for agriculture is sufficient to meet the demand by 2050 proper technology investment and management systems are required de fraiture and wichelns 2010 molden et al 2007 in addition unsustainable water withdrawals will create a substantial water deficit and result in the reduction of agricultural production which will further limit the food requirement in many developing countries such as bangladesh atapattu and kodituwakku 2009 grafton et al 2017 levidow et al 2014 ma et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2020

it is projected that a 50 reduction of crop production would increase poverty by a similar percentage thomas et al 2013 notably the barind tract and teesta floodplain regions of north bengal of bangladesh are two of the important agro ecological zones considered as the food bank of the country are vulnerable to drought and seasonal water scarcity mahmud et al 2021 indicate that the monsoonal rainfall is decreasing and rainless days are increasing in north bengal due to which water use sustainability is at great stake in addition due to the declining trend in both rivers and ground water levels especially during the dry season it is predicted that irrigated rice production will face water scarcity salem et al 2017 mahmud et al 2021 it is essential to estimate the crop water surplus deficit to determine the crop water requirement particularly the seasonal amount of water required by a crop to achieve its potential production under given environmental conditions pereira et al 2020 although numerous studies have been conducted mostly on the impacts of climate change only a handful focused on drought severity and intensity most of which are based on models and farmers perception akter and rahman 2012 dash et al 2012 ghose et al 2021b habiba et al 2014 hasan et al 2018 kamruzzaman et al 2018 mondol et al 2016 rafiuddin et al 2011 rahman et al 2018 salam et al 2021a 2021b shahid and behrawan 2008 so far there has been no comprehensive study on the impact of drought and irrigation on agriculture in bangladesh in this paper we analysed spatio temporal variability of crop water surplus and deficit and used it to assess the impacts of drought and irrigation on agriculture more specifically we aimed to a explore the characteristics of crop water surplus cws and crop water deficit cwd on daily seasonal and annual bases in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain regions of north bengal of bangladesh b analyse the spatio temporal variations and trends of crop water surplus deficit and irrigation in the region and c measure the strength of the relationships and periodicity between seasonal crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production the novelty of our paper is that it explores for the first time the crop water surplus and crop water deficit for different rice growing seasons of bangladesh based on climatic and plant soil base data to observe the trend and its spatio temporal variation also we analysed the relationship of crop water surplus deficit and irrigation with rice production and measured the strength of this relationship and if any periodicity exists between them this helps to find out intra annual and decadal variability of crop water surplus or deficit and irrigation moreover we cross compared crop water surplus and deficit results with the effective drought index edi mondol et al 2021 the crop water surplus or deficit and the use of irrigation pumps are related to a country s agricultural production which is further related to global food security therefore the understanding of crop water requirements and potential impacts of climate change is essential in agro meteorology and the methods used and insights into the effectiveness of crop water surplus deficit for drought characterisation and the impact of meteorological drought and irrigation on crop production of this research can be useful for other regions where there is a provision and dependency of using rainwater and where the construction of irrigation infrastructure is growing fast for the purpose of crop water availability especially in south and south east asian regions and similar regions elsewhere 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the barind tract and teesta floodplain regions situated in the northwest region of bangladesh considered as two important agro ecological zones of the country fig 1 this area makes up the majority of the rajshahi and rangpur divisions the topography of the barind tract area is dome shaped with undulatory relief with elevation ranging from 15 to 45 m above the mean sea level shahid et al 2015 while non calcareous alluvium soils occupy extensive areas on the active teesta islam et al 2017 most of the barind tract lands are high to medium highlands whereas most of the teesta floodplain lands are medium high to medium lowlands mondol et al 2021 medium highland and medium lowland are commonly flooded between 90 and 180 cm deep during the flood season while high lands are generally free from normal flood level which is considered as an inundated area not exceeding 21 of the total land of the country bangladesh bureau of statistics 2019 mirza 2002 the study area experiences about 1400 1800 mm rainfall annually in the barind tract regions and a little over 2000 mm in the teesta floodplain regions shahid and khairulmaini 2009 drought and water scarcity are recurrent events in the study area while people living in these areas are directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture paul 1995 shahid et al 2015 historical drought data of bangladesh indicate that north bengal suffer from drought in the year 1979 1982 83 1989 1992 1994 95 2001 2006 2009 10 2013 2014 2016 and 2018 alamgir et al 2015b miyan 2015 mondol et al 2021 rahman 2015 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate data daily weather data over the period 1979 2018 were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd http www bmddataportal com for rangpur dinajpur bogra and rajshahi weather stations fig 1 the data acquired for these stations include daily rainfall daily maximum minimum temperature wind speed and relative humidity the elevation data for each station were collected from bmd we used penman monteith evapotranspiration fao 56 method to calculate the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 prior to analysis a small number of missing data were infilled similar to our previous study by mondol et al 2021 2 2 2 soil property and agricultural data the sand and clay fraction data for the study area were adopted from moslehuddin et al 2005 and shamsuzzoha et al 2003 the percentage of organic matter om data were taken from bhuiya 1987 moslehuddin et al 1997 and hussain et al 2013 which were used to calculate the field capacity and wilting point of the soil these studies were conducted in the same study area the crop coefficient kc and water depletion fraction ρ data were retrieved from allen et al 1998 the crop yield and agricultural data were collected from the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs and the bangladesh agricultural research council barc although people used traditional irrigation methods to cultivate rice before 1979 irrigation data was not well organised people started using modern irrigation e g diesel power pumps in small numbers during the 1980 s thus due to the data constraint and limitations we selected 1979 2018 as the study period 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 crop water surplus or deficit we first calculated the crop water deficit cwd using the water balance after allen et al 1998 and kowalczyk et al 2016 eqs 1 3 then we calculated the crop water surplus cws using eq 4 1 cwd et

crop evapotranspiration in mm kc is the crop coefficient in this research a kc value of 1 05 and a root zone depth of 10 cm were used to analyse for daily seasonal and annual crop water surplus

the psychrometric constant in kpa c 1 e a is the actual vapour pressure in kpa and e s is the saturation vapour pressure in kpa to analyse the short term 10 days medium to short term month and seasonal water surplus or deficit in the study area we measured the moving ten thirty and ninety day water surplus deficit 2 3 2 relative frequency of crop water deficit we analysed the relative frequency of water deficit for different months and different starting and ending periods mondol et al 2021 for example the water deficit for any supra season six month relative frequency of water deficit was calculated for jan jun feb jul mar aug and dec may etc in the same way for seasonal water deficit frequency the pre monsoon season mar may and monsoon season jun sep a 3 month and 4 month relative frequency of water deficit were computed respectively thus for any starting and ending period between january to december monthly to twelve months the relative frequency of crop water deficit rfcwd was computed as 11 r f c w d o v e r a p e r i o d tndwd tnd 100 where tndwd total number of days with a water deficit in the period tnd the total number of days in the period 2 3 3 irrigation development and its impact on rice production irrigation development was analysed based on the changes in the irrigated area and irrigation methods over time including inter seasonal changes the relationships between irrigated area irrigation methods and rice production were analysed using linear regression with analysis of variance anova 2 3 4 multi phase correlation among crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production the correlation of the crop water surplus deficit and irrigation with rice production were analysed using the pearson correlation coefficient r however the temporal annual and seasonal changes in crop water surplus deficit and irrigation can potentially impose a greater impact on rice production thus in this research we evaluated the impact and periodicity of crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production to understand the variability of rice production and its correlation with crop water surplus deficit and irrigation variations through the cross wavelet transformation xwt and wavelet coherence wtc analysis most traditional methods that are used to analyse periodicities e g fourier analysis are based on the assumption that the underlying processes are stationary over time r li et al 2020 in contrast based on the wavelet transform and cross spectrum analysis the cross wavelet analysis is one of the most effective tools for finding time varying correlations between two time series souza and felix 2018 xwt can effectively examine the linkage between two time series in the time frequency domain r li et al 2020 this method identifies the regions in a time frequency space where two time series show high or low common power covariance peng et al 2018 torrence and compo 1998 it also produces the relative phase angle in the time frequency space between two time series which can be used to get the lag response behaviour between the two time series in contrast to xwt wavelet coherence wtc is the degree of coherence between two wavelet transformations y li et al 2020 it identifies significant coherence correlation or association even with a low common power and indicates confidence levels against noise highlighting locally phase locked patterns peng et al 2018 torrence and compo 1998 since water availability deficit irrigation and agricultural production are highly variable and largely non stationary changes over time understanding the potential driving forces could be gained using the cross wavelet analysis liu et al 2018 the xwt of two time series x x1 x2 xn and y y1 y2 yn was defined as follows grinsted et al 2004 12 w xy w x w y where denotes the complex conjugate and wxy is the cross wavelet power spectrum the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of two time series with background power spectra p k x and p k y is given in torrence and compo 1998 as 13 d w n x s w n x s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with the probability p for a probability density function pdf defined by the square root of the product of two χ2 distributions at the 5 significance level in wavelet transformation the starting and endpoint of any finite length time series have errors in the estimation of the local wavelet power spectrum thus to reduce the edge effects the time series was padded with zeros at the endpoint before conducting wavelet transformation and then zeros were removed however padding with zeros introduces artificial discontinuities at the endpoints of the data the region where zero padding affects the measurement and a discontinuity at the edge drops by a factor of e 2 in the wavelet spectrum is known as cone of influence coi grinsted et al 2004 to find the phase differences between the components of two time series we calculated the mean and confidence interval of the phase differences moreover to quantify the phase relationship we used the circular mean of the phase angels over regions with higher than 5 statistical significance outside the coi grinsted et al 2004 the circular mean of a set of angles a i i 1 n was defined as grinsted et al 2004 14 a m arg x y with x i 1 n cos a i and y i 1 n sin a i since the phase angles are not independent of each other and are difficult to calculate the number of angles used in the calculation can be set arbitrarily high simply by increasing the scale resolution the distribution of angles around the mean which is the circular standard deviation was calculated as grinsted et al 2004 15 s 2 ln r n where r x 2 y 2 the wtc of two time series was defined as grinsted et al 2004 16 r n 2 m m s 1 w n xy s 2 m s 1 w n x s 2 m s 1 w n y s 2 where m is a smoothing operator more details on wtc can be found in torrence and compo 1998 and labat 2010 in this study the code developed by grinsted et al 2004 was used to calculate xwt and wtc 3 results 3 1 crop water surplus or deficit figs 2 3 show the daily crop water surplus deficit based on the sum of different moving days in the study area over 1979 2018 the results indicate that almost persistent water deficits existed from november to mid february less than 15 mm and from mid february to mid april 15 45 mm based on the sum of moving ten days of crop water surplus deficit fig 2 a and fig 3a it is observed that there was more variability in crop water surplus deficit from mid april to the end of may whereas in the first half of the study period 1979 1994 there were more water deficits of more than 45 mm for a few years in the recent decades comparatively lower water deficits were found during march to may 61 152 days than in the other periods fig 2 a and fig 3a the result indicates that during the 1980 s pre monsoon periods had the maximum water deficit for some years e g 1979 1982 and 1989 compared to recent decades in both regions though the monsoon period 152 273 days was mostly free of water deficit fig 2 b c and fig 3 b c many water deficit days were detected during this period based on the sum of moving ten days fig 2a and fig 3a in the analysis based on thirty moving days some water deficit days were also identified during monsoon periods however no water deficit was found based on the sum of ninety moving days in both regions during this season fig 2 b c and fig 3 b c crop water surplus deficit was also variable during the post monsoon period 274 310 days and on average 16 30 mm water deficits existed for ten day periods overall it can be said that the barind tract and the teesta floodplain had short term water deficits during monsoons short to medium term water deficits during pre monsoons and seasonal water scarcity during winter there existed inter annual and inter seasonal variabilities in crop water surplus deficit based on all moving sums of crop water surplus deficit in both regions there were also spatial variations in rain water surplus or deficit fig 4 fig 4 shows the dry periods were also longer in the barind tract than in the teesta floodplain fig 5 illustrates the temporal trend of seasonal water surplus deficit of the study area results indicate that there was almost the same amount of water deficit during the winter from 1979 to 2018 the highest amount of water scarcity existed in the pre monsoon time when the variability of water surplus and the deficit was also high fig 5b during the monsoon period there was no water scarcity fig 5c however there was high variability in the water surplus during this time historically recognised drought years had relatively very low water surplus during the monsoon period the post monsoon water surplus and the deficit were also variable most of the time the forty year data of crop water surplus deficit indicate that water surplus decreased significantly in monsoons in both areas fig 5c and on the annual scale in the teesta floodplain fig 5e water surplus increased by a small amount during the pre monsoon period which was not significant however there was less annual water surplus in recent decades than in the earlier decades of the study period 1979 2018 fig 5e 3 2 relative frequency of daily water deficit in different months and seasons fig 6 shows the relative frequencies of water deficit days in different starting and ending months one month to twelve months in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain calculated based on the sum of ten moving days of crop water surplus deficit over the periods of 1979 2018 the results indicate that oct may had the higher percentage of water deficit days while june sep had the lowest percentage water deficit was mainly seasonal mostly lasting for 3 4 months although there was a wet period and water surplus during the monsoon period at least 10 20 of water stress days were observed in the teesta floodplain while the relative frequency was at least 2 more in the barind tract region than in the teesta floodplain area between 1979 and 2018 3 3 trends in irrigated area irrigation methods and rice production over the years the use of modern irrigation equipment such as power pumps increased significantly in the study area due to the electrification and supply of diesel fuel while the traditional irrigation methods using for example the swing basket and doon to obtain water from canals decreased substantially fig 7 a b shows the use of power pumps deep tube wells and shallow tube wells over 1979 2018 there has been a steady increase in the use of power pumps and deep tube wells and rapid growth in the use of shallow tube wells in all areas fig 7 c shows that the total irrigated area rapidly increased in 1979 only 5 12 of the land was irrigated whereas in 2018 it had reached 55 60 fig 7d fig 8 shows the production of different types of rice over the 40 years in the study area it can be seen that aus rice production decreased significantly in the teesta floodplain while in the barind tract aus rice production reached its lowest point in 2003 and then steadily increased the production of aman rice increased significantly in both regions however during the period 1990 1994 the aman rice production was low when a severe drought hit the regions mondol et al 2016 nury and hasan 2016 rafiuddin et al 2011 rahman and lateh 2016 selvaraju and baas 2007 the boro rice production has increased rapidly over the area 3 4 periodicity and correlation between crop water surplus deficit and rice production fig 9 shows that crop water surplus or deficit does not strongly correlate with aus and aman rice production but crop water surplus deficit has a slightly positive correlation with boro rice production this indicates that crop water surplus or deficit measured using climate and soil plant based data cannot predict rice production in the study area this relationship was further explored through the use of xwt and wtc fig 10 and supplementary figure 1 show the xwt and wtc of crop water surplus deficit during boro aman and aus growth seasons with boro aman and aus rice production respectively in barind tract bt and teesta floodplain tf we have used arrows to depict the relative phase relationship between the two time series means in phase positive relationship 0 means anti phase negative relationship 180 means that the crop water surplus deficit time series leading the rice production series by 90 i e a lag of one quarter between changes in crop water surplus deficit and rice production and means that the crop water surplus deficit time series is lagging the rice production series by 90 the black contours appearing as islands indicate the area where the coherence spreads a significance level of α 0 05 relative to a red noise spectrum a red noise spectrum has lag 1 autocorrelation between two successive time series and has a correlation coefficient 0 r 1 matyasovszky 2013 the y axis represents the resonance periods in years the cross hatched area displays the cone of influence in which edge effects degrade the analysis grinsted et al 2004 we found a resonance period of 2 3 years from 1995 to 2005 for crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production in the teesta floodplain region supp fig 3 b whereas we found a resonance period of 1 8 years from 1979 to 1986 in the barind tract region for crop water surplus deficit during boro rice period supp fig 3 c we found two short term cycles of 1 2 years from 1987 to 1990 and 3 4 years from 2010 to 2014 in the barind tract region while found a resonance period of 1 4 years from 1979 to 1991 in the teesta floodplain region for crop water surplus deficit during aus season supp fig 3 e f however we found a significant negative coherence between crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production from 1998 to 2007 and from 2014 to 2018 whereas we found a positive relationship from 1989 to 1997 in the barind tract and a significant positive coherence from 1979 to 1998 in the teesta floodplain fig 10 a b these results indicate that the teesta floodplain and barind tract regions had inter annual variations in crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production before the 1990 s and quasi decadal variations in the 1990 s fig 10 a b the wtc indicates that overall crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production were negatively correlated fig 10 during the boro rice period we found that crop water surplus deficit had a positive relationship with boro rice production for a very short time in the barind tract from 1986 to 1994 while we found significant negative coherence from 1979 to 1995 for a resonance period of 6 8 years fig 10 c however we found no such significant coherence in the teesta floodplain during this time fig 10 d in the teesta floodplain region we found positive coherence during 1979 1985 for a resonance period of 4 6 years and significant negative coherence for a resonance period of 1 2 years from 1998 to 2003 and a resonance period of 4 5 years from 1995 to 2000 fig 10 d these results indicate that during boro rice seasons crop water surplus deficit and rice production had an inter annual relationship the two time series were generally in an anti phase position indicating that crop water surplus deficit had a significant negative correlation with rice production fig 10 c d overall there was a negative relationship between crop water surplus deficit and aus rice production while a positive relationship existed in the recent decades for resonance periods of about 7 5 8 5 years from 2009 to 2018 in the barind tract and a resonance period of 3 4 years from 2010 to 2018 in the teesta floodplain fig 10 e f it should be noted that the significant coherence between crop water surplus deficit and rice production does not necessarily imply a statistically significant fluctuation in the wavelet powers of the series over two periods for instance neither the crop water surplus deficit nor boro rice production time series in the teesta floodplain fig 10 a b had a significant power at a scale of 4 5 years from 1995 to 2000 and a scale of 1 2 years from 1998 to 2003 but they displayed significant coherence during these periods fig 10 c d similar patterns were found in the aman and aus periods the significant coherence between crop water surplus deficit and rice production shows inconsistencies in the two regions 3 5 periodicity and correlation between irrigated area and rice production fig 11 shows the correlation between the irrigated area and the production of different types of rice we found a strong positive correlation between rice production and irrigated area except in the barind tract region during the aus rice period the correlation results were significant for aman and boro rice in all regions fig 12 and supplementary figure 2 show the xwt and wtc of the irrigated area during boro aman and aus seasons with boro aman and aus rice production in the barind tract bt and teesta floodplain tf there was a cycle in the barind tract with a resonance period of 2 3 years from 1997 to 2002 for the irrigated area and aman rice production supp fig 2 a and a resonance period of 1 2 years from 1997 to 2000 for the irrigated area and aus rice production in the teesta floodplain supp fig 2 f however we found strong significant positive correlations between the irrigated area and rice production in all cases except aus rice in the barind tract region fig 12 again there was significant coherence between the irrigated area and rice production however significant coherence between irrigated areas and rice production does not necessarily indicate that those two time series wavelet powers are statistically significant for instance neither the irrigated area time series nor the boro and aman rice production of the teesta floodplain and aus rice production in both regions had a significant common power but displayed significant coherence during those periods fig 12 supp fig 2 a d in addition significant coherence between the irrigated area and rice production series suggests that the two time series were more consistent in both regions than the crop water surplus deficit and rice production time series 4 discussion this paper assessed crop water surplus deficit characteristics in different times and seasons along with the relationship between crop water surplus deficit irrigation and rice production in two important agro ecological zones of bangladesh our analyses indicated that water surplus deficit patterns varied significantly in both short term and long term periods it was evident that the barind tract and teesta floodplain experienced an almost constant water deficit over the winter period figs 2 5 it was found that the highest water deficit occurred during the pre monsoon period although in recent decades a decreasing trend was observed in the water deficit in both the barind tract and the teesta floodplain which was not significant figs 2 5 this result is in line with jahan et al 2010 bangladesh receives two thirds of the annual rainfall during the monsoon shahid and khairulmaini 2009 overall the monsoon had a seasonal water surplus but we found short to medium short term water deficits during this period and the water surplus was significantly decreasing figs 2 3 and 5 other studies have also equally noted this decreasing pattern of the water surplus in north bengal alamgir et al 2015a kamruzzaman et al 2019a 2019b miyan 2015 mohsenipour et al 2018 mondol et al 2017 2016 in these regions winter monsoon and annual rainfall are decreasing while the seasonal and annual temperatures are increasing bari et al 2016 mondol et al 2021 these findings are similar to those from other studies basher et al 2018 mondol et al 2018 mullick et al 2019 nury and hasan 2016 rahman et al 2012 rahman and lateh 2016 syed and al amin 2016 if the current trend of water scarcity continues there will be more frequent dry episodes with varying intensities both in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain fig 5 these results are in line with previous studies e g ahammed et al 2018 habiba et al 2014 islam et al 2021 indicate that there will be more use of groundwater and a shortage of surface water due to increasingly irregular rainfall patterns the number of rainfall days also varied in different seasons supp figs 3 4 in comparison two thirds of the rainfall occur during the monsoon and almost no rain falls in winter the boro rice is grown in winter depending entirely on irrigation rice production currently depends on using modern irrigation equipment to withdraw underground water or using power pumps to irrigate with surface water these kinds of water use and the traditional concept of water scarcity in the study area clearly indicate the potential for technological drought which might be the result of the absence of modern irrigation technology any growing periods that span the two seasons need proper irrigation systems while longer growing seasons starting from or before the monsoon season need more careful water management fig 6 however our study concluded that crop water surplus or deficit caused by climate and soil variability was not positively correlated with rice production while the irrigated area was strongly positively correlated with rice production thus rice production in the barind tract and the teesta floodplain was affected more by irrigation than by climatic and plant soil water based water surplus or deficit fig 7 indicates that over the 40 years of the study areas irrigated using modern methods had been rapidly increasing while traditional methods had been significantly decreasing a study conducted by alam 2015 indicated that better access to electricity and institutional facilities have a greater role in mitigating water scarcity in the barind tract region in addition brammer 2016 considered drought as a minor problem in north bengal of bangladesh and indicated that drought was severe about 30 years ago when irrigation facilities were scarce and agriculture was largely dependent on surface water irrigation using traditional irrigation methods in contrast we found that crop water surplus or deficit had a strong relationship with effective drought index edi mondol et al 2021 supp figs 5 9 our wavelet analysis indicated that crop water surplus or deficit modelled on climatic data could be successfully used to predict meteorological drought supp figs 5 9 however meteorological drought identified with edi and standardized precipitation index spi mondol et al 2021 and crop water surplus deficit based on agroclimatic and plant soil based analysis were unable to predict agricultural production of the area and the relationship was not significantly correlated there was a positive correlation between crop water surplus deficit and aman rice production from 1979 to 1998 when the irrigated area was small and agricultural production relied more on rainfall since 2000 the use of modern irrigation methods has significantly increased which in turn led to an increase in crop production our wtc analysis results indicate a positive relationship between irrigated areas and rice production thus the current argument related to agricultural drought in bangladesh has changed and irrigation availability and unavailability are now the prime factors of crop water surplus deficit over the years people have used different types of adaptive measures to increase agricultural production several studies indicate that there is a tremendous improvement in the installation of shallow tube wells and deep tube wells operated by electricity for irrigation and the use of high yield varieties and fertilisers in north bengal habiba et al 2012 paul 1998 rawlani and sovacool 2011 selvaraju et al 2006 ahmed and chowdhury 2006 bbs 1979 2019 selvaraju 2012 moreover jahan et al 2010 indicated that due to the implementation of the barind integrated area development project in the barind tract region there has been a huge improvement in irrigation using groundwater however the amount of dry season irrigation using groundwater is only one third of the annual rainfall and needs proper water management to maintain the sustainability of water resources csiro et al 2014 moreover as suggested in borrell et al 1997 water use can be reduced without reducing the yield and quality of rice using the saturated soil culture ssc methods which can enhance the rice rotational cropping systems for both irrigated and rainfed systems weak correlation between crop water surplus deficit calculated using agro climatic and soil plant data and rice production in the study area are in line with other studies for example several studies indicate that due to the uncertainties in the simulations and the perspectives of physical and agronomic systems of crop growth and yield it is hard to estimate the impact of water stress and drought asseng et al 2011 elliott et al 2015 folberth et al 2016 leng and hall 2019 li et al 2015 rosenzweig et al 2014 moreover in most cases the drought index cannot explain agricultural production anomalies mondol et al 2021 indicating the need for the integrated assessment of water scarcity risk using more agro climatic and technological data biswas 2004 gain and giupponi 2015 a study conducted in east java by amalo et al 2017 indicates that rice production has increased despite the drought climate anomalies and enso impact due to the increasing use of technology and government initiative a study conducted on small scale rain fed farmers in gaza of mozambique by salite 2019 indicates that farmers do not sufficiently understand climate change and lack scientific data due to the lack of agricultural extension services and the poor use of surface and subsurface water people suffer from water deficits according to personal et al 2007 over the last 10 15 years in east and southeast asia and south asia farmers have adopted new and more productive technologies that enable high production and contribute to impressive economic performance in those countries according to lal 2014 in south africa there exists a wide range of site specific technologies to manage the risks and to reduce water scarcity and also implement some long term adaptive strategies to enhance the resilience of agroecosystems although there is a huge surplus in water during monsoon time in our study area due to the short term dry spell it is not possible to irrigate crops due to the poor management of rain and surface water globally developing and underdeveloped countries lack proper usage of water resources boretti and rosa 2019 thus they cannot use it for agricultural cultivation despite having available water molden et al 2007 this kind of water surplus or deficit cannot account for the area s agricultural production moreover when farmers only depend on rainfall and surface water and use traditional irrigation methods they have to wait for the rain in order to sow the seeds thus climatic and plant soil based crop water surplus deficit cannot be used alone for predicting the agricultural production of an area moreover it is believed that enhancing the green water precipitation supply in the root zone is essential to the sustainability of agriculture and the externalities of blue water withdrawn for irrigation from rivers lakes and aquifers use can be minimised through the uptake of precision irrigation techniques lal 2014 for sustainable use of water resources for agriculture caused by climatic and plant soil based data appropriate regional and national policies proper water management strategies and the identification of the seasonal irrigation water requirement freshwater sources are highly required mancosu et al 2015 mallebrera et al 2010 indicated that although there is crop water available from the segura river basin in southeast spain only one third of the surface water is used for irrigation which further indicates that rainwater or surface water availability does not account for agriculture in an area without the irrigation management barnard et al 2021 indicates that meteorological drought e g standardised precipitation evaporation index can less successfully predict soil moisture availability suggesting more significant data requirements moreover intensified drought damages have enormous negative impacts on agriculture and thus drought assessment plays an essential role in the sustainable use of limited water resources akter and rahman 2012 ruane et al 2013 however using advanced knowledge technology and management timely information can minimise the extent intensity duration and impacts of drought anik et al 2021 iizumi and ramankutty 2015 5 conclusions in this study we measured the crop water surplus and crop water deficit using climatic and plant soil based data of the barind tract and teesta floodplain of bangladesh over 1979 2018 it was found that the barind tract and teesta floodplain suffered short to medium term water scarcity during the monsoon and post monsoon periods and almost persistent seasonal water shortage during winter and the pre monsoon periods a sharp increase in water deficit from the northern to north western regions was found in the study area while the reverse condition existed for water surplus water surplus was found to significantly decrease during the monsoon period with little change in the pre monsoon period the total amount of irrigated area by different modern irrigation methods significantly increased whereas the use of traditional irrigation methods significantly decreased rice production also increased substantially except that the aus rice production decreased in the teesta floodplain crop water surplus or deficit measured based on climatic and plant soil based data can successfully measure the meteorological drought but cannot account for rice production in the area the linkages between irrigation and rice production were time and space dependent dominated by in phase positive relationship the correlation between crop water surplus deficit and rice production was not time and space dependent and their positions were anti phase negative relationship to summarise the severity and frequency of water deficit are increasing whereas rice production is decoupled from this trend and instead positively correlated with irrigation it is unknown whether the technological progress will continue and there will be sufficient extractable groundwater and surface water for irrigation but it is essential to emphasise that the increase in water deficit means there will probably be more challenges if this trend continues in addition these conditions may introduce new dependencies in small scale agricultural production including reliable and affordable irrigation systems and proper agricultural water management therefore it is important to re assess the impacts of crop water surplus and deficit on agricultural production and water resource sustainability using more agro climatic and technological data as well as farmers perceptions and opinions as a further study we intend to examine the prospect of technological drought caused by the potential shortage of fuel or electricity poor management and improper planning of water resource use declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9498,in developing countries using non conventional water for irrigation is a traditional and cost effective tool however its long term use for agriculture and forestry will led to toxic metal bioaccumulation in plants and soil environment copper cu is an essential plant nutrient but its excess accumulation can cause significant issues and risks to human health following food crop consumption the present study was conducted with the aim to assess impact of copper cu in the five wheat varieties seher 2006 faislabad 2008 watan galaxy 2013 punjab 2011 at 7 ecological sites during the two growing seasons 2017 2018 the source of irrigation included the ground water industrial wastewater and sewage water the cu concentrations were subsequently determined via ecological environment water soils and below and above ground plant organs shoots roots and wheat grains and phytostabilization potential assessment using various pollution indices results of this study revealed that mean cu concentration in different wheat varieties and treatments were varied from 1 53 to 1 07 3 22 mg kg 0 58 and 1 94 mg kg 0 43 2 39 mg kg and 0 23 0 78 mg kg in amended soil root shoot and grains respectively wheat cultivar seher 2006 showed highest cu transfer from shoot to grain following irrigation with ground water while lowest after industrial water irrigation high content of cu was obtained in water and toxicity was higher than the maximum permissible limit in case of grain and soil samples the copper contents were present within the safe limits the value of all the indices for cu were found less than 1 except for bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor that were greater than 1 for some samples our results revealed that the studied varieties of wheat crop were safe for consumption but the continuous usage of wastewater for irrigation may pose health risks after many years of consumption because some samples showed the high value for bioaccumulation factor and transfer factor wheat varieties possess desirable traits that are vital for phytoremediation purposes keywords copper health risk index translocation factor wastewater wheat 1 introduction in most part of the country pakistan possess arid climate with scarce freshwater and many farmers use non conventional water resources treated and un treated for agriculture and forestry hassan et al 2013 riaz et al 2022 the city effluent industrial wastewater sewage water and contaminated canal water are an important sources for irrigation that many farmers discovered as a source of water supply and this technique is growing quickly in essentially all communities across the country khan et al 2018 shahid et al 2021 therefore wastewater had become a feasible way to decrease water scarcity heavy metals are known as elements containing metallic properties with density of 5gcm 3 and atomic mass number of 20 from thirty five metals twenty three are heavy metals most common heavy metals are arsenic cadmium chromium mercury and lead heavy metals in soil come from two sources natural and anthropogenic natural sources include soil parent material e g rock mineral volcanic eruption marine aerosols and forest fires while anthropogenic sources originated from human activities such as energy and fuel production e g emission from power stations mining and smelting recycling operations e g scrap melting and agricultural sources like fertilizer pesticide sewage sludge and irrigation water ejaz et al 2022 in plants and animal cells some elements have important functions which are called micronutrients or trace elements this term has been shown for copper cu manganese mn nickel ni zinc zn and cobalt co these are termed as heavy metals only when their internal content becomes exceeds up to the specified threshold limit and they show toxic effects the major route by which toxic metals are transferred to human beings is crop consumption this transfer of toxic heavy metals can cause life threatening diseases lu et al 2015 copper cu is a vital trace element in living beings the level of cu in the human body ranges from 1 4 to 2 1 mg kg of body mass normal cu level as a recommended dietary allowance rda is 0 97 3 0 mg day in a healthy adult cu is absorbed by the gut which aids fe uptake the deficiency of cu can affect the metabolism of glucose and cholesterol anemia like symptoms increased the rate of infections and bone abnormalities the maximum healthful limit of cu in wheat should be 3 mg kg as recommended by ec and fao who hassan et al 2013 however homeostasis for cu is an important factor in order to prevent the toxicity of copper due to an undeveloped biliary excretion system and increased intestinal absorption neonates and infants are more susceptible to copper poisoning collins amd klevay 2011 indian childhood cirrhosis endemic tyrolean infantile cirrhosis and idiopathic copper toxicity all have copper excess coronado et al 2005 cu metabolism problems in humans are caused by mutations in genes involved in cu homeostasis wilson disease wd is the most well known human cu toxicities disorder it is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the atp7b gene which causes improper cu transportation and excretion into the bile the presence of excess free cu causes cirrhosis of the liver the kayser fleischer ring renal tubular failure and brain damage in wd sandahl et al 2020 the health risk index is the ratio of daily metal ingestion from edible plants to the external standard quantity ejaz et al 2022 the bio concentration factor is the ability of heavy metals to move from the soil to the eating section of crops bcf the enrichment factor ef is used to calculate soil contamination and trace metal pollution causes metal poisoning in humans bakshi et al 2021 the bio concentration factor is used to investigate heavy metal concentrations in plants and soil heavy metals in plants have been established in several studies to assess their risks to human health the level of health risk provided by heavy metals is measured using a variety of health indices including daily intake of metals dim transfer factor tf and health risk index hri or health quotient hq are utilised qureshi et al 2016 hussain et al 2021 continuous wastewater application has a negative impact on biological populations in soil ecosystems as well as catastrophic consequences for customers who consume polluted cereal ad food grain crops grown on such soil alghobar and suresha 2016 along with harmful metals sewage water also contains vital nutrients and organic materials jakubus and czekala 2001 however because of the high concentration of hazardous compounds in this wastewater it is not widely employed because it harms both plants and soil the effects of different heavy metals on wheat were studied by athar and ahmad 2002 cd was the metal they discovered to be the most poisonous the decrease in agricultural productivity has resulted in a major problem of food insecurity in developing countries to solve this issue many agricultural management strategies such as proper use of non conventional water organic farming and the employment of microorganisms have been developed and used to raise production increase farmers incomes and improve their livelihoods shahid et al 2021 hussain et al 2020 as part of the integration of the food production system these productivity technologies have largely ignored their underlying relationship and dependency with associated aspects such as climate water and energy raw sewage is a good source of both organic and inorganic nutrients that plants need to develop hamid et al 2022 sewage water is used to irrigate vegetables and fodder crops growing near sewage treatment plants these foods are consumed by both animals and humans it supplies available n p fe k zn mn and cu to soil which explains why it is important for crop irrigation in agriculture around the world it is utilized in agriculture as a low cost source of fertilizer eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers darvishi et al 2010 recent reports suggested that micro and macronutrient concentration was increased in the soil by continuous application of the wastewater zeng et al 2015 at lower concentrations micro nutrients were required by plants for their proper development and metabolic rate but in high concentrations nutrients become toxic numerous micronutrients were toxic at high concentration as well as reported to cause adverse effects on plants industrial discharge metal mining incorrect use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and atmospheric deposition of heavy metals are the main sources of heavy metals in water khan et al 2019 shahid et al 2017 heavy metal accumulation can disrupt enzyme activity resulting in reduced biological growth and metabolism as well as oxidative damage esmaeilzadeh et al 2017 kovačević et al 2020 furthermore heavy metals can biomagnified as they go up the food chain posing a health risk to humans rombel bryzek et al 2017 in the present study copper cu was selected as an important environmental pollutants and toxicant that cause soils contamination and serious environmental issue due to its widespread occurrence and high persistence the aims of this study was to investigate 1 the influence of uptake and dissipation of cu by different wheat varieties 2 how the cu pollution affect soil bioaccumulation wheat growth pollution load and pollutant transfer in root shoot and wheat grains and 3 how wheat regulate and select pollutant oriented soil environment 4 to access the pollution severity of soil and 5 to assess possible contamination risk and health hazards to human beings due to cu by evaluating bioaccumulation translocation and bioconcentration factors with plant uptake 2 material and methods 2 1 environmental sites the research was conducted at 7 districts bhakkar chiniot faisalabad gujranwala gujrat kasur and sargodha of punjab pakistan wheat fields irrigated with three sources of water i e ground water and waste water from sewage and industries were selected from each district the present study was conducted with the aim to assess impact of copper cu in the five wheat varieties seher 2006 faislabad 2008 watan galaxy 2013 punjab 2011 growth and yield as well as on human health risks at 7 ecological sites during the two growing seasons 2017 2018 the 7 sites of experiment located at different districts represent different contaminated environments as the sites were irrigated from ground water industrial wastewater and sewage water this is because the experimental soil of seven sites suffering from scarce freshwater resources thus has been irrigated with above mentioned three different contaminated water sources 2 2 experimental design and sampling procedure the collected samples of soil and wheat parts from all sites and each variety were pooled into a composite sample separately and four replicates for each sample were formulated during the two successive cropping seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 field experiments were conducted in 7 different districts of punjab pakistan for sampling the randomized

waste water iww and water samples 100 ml each were collected in punjab from seven different districts before being transferred to the research center all of the samples were collected in polypropylene bottles that had been pre washed with nitric acid 1 and kept at 4 c until analysis afnor 1997 2 4 soil and plant sampling with a stainless steel drill the targeted spots were penetrated up to a depth of 10 15 cm partially removing all layers of soil before being placed in a forced air oven at 72 c for 47 h the sample was desiccated in the air the gathered samples was placed in polyethylene bags labeled and sealed the samples were stored at 70 c for 5 days in an incubator rhue and kidder 1983 wheat samples shoots roots and grains were cleaned to remove airborne dust particles and then rinsed with deionized water the samples were air dried and kept in forced air oven for 48 h at 72 c after the removal of moisture samples were ground into fine powder by crushing with the help of electrical grinder powdered samples were further macerated and passed by 2 mm sifter aydin et al 2015 2 5 biochemical analysis all types of wastewater samples collected from seven districts were digested according to apha 2005 after adding 10 ml of strong hno3 to 50 ml of water the digestion was carried out at 80 c until the solution became translucent after which it was filtered using 0 22 ml of whatman filters maidstone uk and distill water was added to make the volume 50 ml the soil and crop components samples were digested using a wet digestion technique 1 g of each dehydrated sample was placed in 15 ml of a 1 1 5 solutions of h2so4 hclo4 and hno3 at 80 c until the solution became clear after filtration of the digested solutions the final volume of each sample was raised to 50 ml and stored in bottles 2 6 metal detection analytical method following the completion of the digestion all of the samples were analyzed for cu metal using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and wet digestion to determine the amount of mineral deposits samples were diluted and a flame photometer was used water samples were digested by following the method of apha apha 2012 wet digestion method was employed for digestion of water and soil samples allen et al 1986 atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer aas 5000 was utilized to compute the level of copper 2 7 environmental pollution indices the pollution load index was analyzed by the following formula liu et al 2005 1 pli metal contamination in soil reference value of metal in soil the copper baf and tf were assessed by using the given formula cui et al 2004 li et al 2007 2 baf copper shoot copper soil 3 tf copper shoot copper root the formula given by cui et al 2004 were used to determine the bcf 4 bcf copper in grains copper in soil enrichment factor indicates the influence of the anthropogenic activity on the heavy metal content of soil to detect the probable influence of anthropogenesis on the metal contents in soil the content of heavy metals categorized by low variability of occurrence lv is used as a reference both in examined sample and in the standard content of particular metal in the soil enrichment factor was analyzed by utilizing the under mentioned formula buat menard and chesselet 1979 5 ef m grain m soil samples m grain m soil standard the daily intake of heavy metals dim was determined by examining the metal content in crops and the daily intake of studied food crop singh et al 2010 6 dim heavy metal concentration in wheat grain mg kg daily intake of wheat grain kg person average body weight kg the daily intake of metal by consumption of wheat grain is 0 242 kg person as reported by wang et al 2007 and average body weight of 55 9 kg was used wang et al 2005 health risk index was assessed by the formula given by sajjad et al 2009 7 hri daily intake of metal oral reference dose of metals average percentage for transfer of metal was calculated by dividing the total value of metal in soil by that of root and multiplying the quotient by 100 the average transfer percentage from root shoot and shoot grain was also interpreted using similar method the obtained data was subjected to anova using minitab 16 software to analyze the significant differences among mean values of data tukey s hsd test was applied in tukey s hsd test the means of every treatment are compared with the means of every other treatment and lettering denotes difference among means steel et al 2006 to avoid any infectivity standards were prepared vigilantly dry weight was taken as a basis for measurement of soil and wheat samples triplicate analysis with strict control procedures was performed to ensure accuracy 2 8 statistical analysis all samples were evaluated for analysis of variance anova which found to be best fit for field analysis such as entirely randomized block design using the minitab 16 software the data from every attribute was statistically analyzed to discover significant differences between mean values 3 way anova used in addition to anova the tukey s hsd test was applied in tukey s hsd test the means of every treatment are compared with the means of every other treatment and lettering denotes difference among means steel et al 2006 fig 1 2 9 quality control analysis standards were meticulously prepared to avoid infectivity samples of soil and wheat plant samples were weighed to determine their dry weight to confirm the quality of the results every sample was repeated three times table 1 table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity of copper on ecological indicators 3 1 1 water the present results highlight that water source crop year and their interaction were significantly p 0 05 affected by cu content table 2 data indicated that the cu content in unlike irrigation water sources in year 1 and year 2 ranged from 2 67 to 3 90 mg l fig 2 the maximum cu content in different irrigation waters in year 1 from the industrial water and the lowest in ground water results for the cu content in different irrigation water sources in year 2 were same as for year 1 cu content in all the water samples exceeded the value 0 102 mg l suggested by chaoua et al 2019 all samples contained the higher cu values than the values 1 03 1 29 mg l given by khan et al 2017 in ground and wastewater respectively all the water samples from different sources contain cu contents more than the maximum permissible value 0 20 1 00 mg l as suggested by who fao 2007 and usepa 2010 respectively both environment and agriculture were significantly affected by the toxicity of cu the main sources for contamination of cu are smelting mining and agricultural urban and industrial wastes ang and lee 2005 agricultural and industrial wastes might be the possible reason for higher cu contents in the water samples of present research 3 1 2 soil the statistical analysis indicates that variety water source crop year and interaction of variety and crop year had significant p 0 05 effect over the cu content in soil table 3 mean results for the cu content found in all of the soil samples showed that cu content ranged from 1 07 to 3 22 mg kg fig 3 the topmost amount of cu was present in soil of the variety faislabad 2008 irrigated with sewage source of water in year 1 and the least contents of cu was contained in soil where watan variety was irrigated with water from industrial source in 1st year of cropping the cu content in plant parts on the other hand is linked to the cu concentration in the soil kumar et al 2021 as a result monitoring cu concentration in soil and its transmission to plants and humans is critical roshdy 2018 had reported the higher range 302 310 mg kg of cu in soil samples than all those values given by current findings copper contents 2 08 1 12 mg kg observed by alrawiq et al 2014 in soil samples watered with ground and waste water respectively were in concordance with those of the present study soil exhibit greater quantity of cu and it was much higher than the reported values in the literature kobaissi et al 2014 parameters of physicochemical nature such as soil ph electrical conductivity organic carbon and organic matter were all responsible for the translocation uptake and pollution loading of cu from the soil environment to the plant organs chaoua et al 2019 the transfer factor from soils to vegetation measurements from soil irrigation water and plant samples their daily intake and subsequent health risks assessment also play a vital role in the evaluation of environmental pollution from trace metals kumar et al 2021 3 2 toxicity impact of copper on above and below ground wheat organs 3 2 1 root cu content in root was significantly p 0 05 influenced by variety water source and crop year according to an analysis of variance table 3 cu content varied between 0 58 and 1 94 mg kg with the lowest being found in variety faislabad 2008 which was irrigated with ground water in year 2 and the highest being found in variety galaxy 2013 which was irrigated with industrial water in year 2 fig 4 cu transport from soil to root was between 20 20 and 136 4 fig 7 in the first crop year the maximum soil to root transfer was found higher for variety watan which was irrigated with industrial waste while the lowest transfer was noted in punjab 2011 which was irrigated with fresh ground water in the same crop year copper content in the roots was found higher 5 76 mg kg as revealed by chaoua et al 2019 in comparison with the present research in agricultural soils and plants continuous irrigation through wastewater led to the acceration of heavy metals copper content given by the present research was between the ranges 0 20 4 63 mg kg reported by al othman et al 2013 furthermore cu excess in plants causes oxidative stress by creating harmful reactive oxygen species ros which are scavenged by superoxide dismutase and peroxidase two enzymes that play critical roles in reducing cu toxicity in plants huang et al 2020 amount of cu in roots as suggested by xiao rui et al 2016 and asdeo 2014 was much higher 22 44 14 12 mg kg respectively as compared to its content in all root samples of current research 3 2 2 shoot cu values in wheat plant shoots were unaffected by variety or its relationship with water source and crop year p 0 05 whereas water source and year revealed a significant p 0 05 effect of cu on wheat plant shoots table 3 the average cu content in all types of shoot samples was 0 43 2 39 mg kg fig 5 in cropping year 2 the highest cu concentration was found in seher 2006 shoot samples inundated with industrial waste water while the lowest cu content was found in faislabad 2008 shoot samples irrigated with clean ground water cu transport was determined to be between 57 83 and 164 9 from root to shoot fig 8 highest and lowest cu transfer values was obtained in punjab 2011 following industrial water irrigation in year 2 and watan after ground water irrigation in year 1 respectively copper levels were lower in all of the shoot samples from three different irrigation sources than the value 2 51 mg kg as reported by aydin et al 2015 in wastewater irrigated shoot samples when compared to the results 1 53 mg kg reported by yap et al the cu content in shoots irrigated with ground and sewage water was found to be lower while shoot samples irrigated with industrial water in cropping year 2 had higher cu levels 2009 pulido et al 2013 reported that heavy metals were considered the most dangerous due to their persistency and toxicity in the environment among numerous soil pollutants for plant growth the micronutrients as being vital several heavy metals such as zn cu mo fe and mn have been recognized as micronutrients some other elements that were not vital for plant and have high poisonous effects even in very low concentrations were cd hg cr vi as ni and pb in many industrial products the cu compounds are used which mainly include insecticides fungicides petroleum refining and wood preservation etc that might be the possible reason of high cu content in shoot samples irrigated with industrial water yu et al 2016 in another study higher cu values 0 70 4 96 mg kg was reported in shoot xiao rui et al 2016 3 2 3 grains except for their interaction impacts all of the characteristics had a significant p 0 05 impact on cu in grains table 3 cu content ranged from 0 23 to 0 78 mg kg in different wheat cultivars fig 6 punjab 2011 which was watered with waste water from industries in the second crop year had the highest cu content of all the kinds while both varieties had the lowest cu content in the first cropping year faislabad 2008 was irrigated using ground water and seher 2006 was irrigated with ground water in the second cropping year cu transfer from shoot to grain was found to be 28 27 64 fig 9 seher 2006 irrigated wheat had the highest and lowest cu transfer from shoot to grain high dose metal deposition on land contaminates the soil and food crops grown on these soils which then enter the living organism through their ingestion copper is also important for co2 absorption and atp generation marques et al 2018 it s found in a variety of proteins including photosynthetic plastocyanin and electron transport chain cytochrome oxidase cu concentrations in plants that exceed critical levels have an adverse effect on plant growth induce leaf chlorosis and cause cytotoxicity saleem et al 2020 vegetables absorb heavy metals like cu and store them in excess levels in both edible and non edible sections resulting in health issues in humans and other animals following their consumption maleki and zarasvand 2008 heavy metals in soil such as cu can accumulate in food crops and then be transmitted to other media through the food chain heavy metal bioaccumulation factor bcf in the soil food crops system primarily in the most important staple crops copper values were found below the permitted value rusan et al 2007 present cu level in grains fall within the safe limit which shows that no copper toxicity will occur by the consumption of these grains it has been noticed that the cu transfer from soil to root was lower in contrast to that of root to shoot but it again declines from shoot to grain the high root to shoot transfer value might be the consequence of high content of cu in irrigation water the composition of wastewater which is used for irrigation purpose is directly involved in the accumulation of heavy metals and micronutrients it also has an indirect effect by its chelation property which increasing the solubility of some indigenous soil heavy metals ahmad et al 2018 3 3 environmental indices 3 3 1 pollution load index pli pli value for cu was found between ranges of 0 13 0 41 table 4 for ground water irrigation in year 1 and 2 the highest pli value 0 38 was showed by soil of the variety faislabad 2008 in year 1 and the lowest 0 30 was noticed for soil of watan copper showed highest values of pli 0 41 in the soil profile where galaxy 2013 was cultivated while soil exhibiting watan variety showed lowest cu pollution load 0 13 it was happened during 2nd cropping year in case of galaxy 2013 while pli was observed lower in watan during 1st cropping year cui et al 2004 investigated the metal concentration of soil was higher than the present study in a previous study khan et al 2017 reported distant values of pli 0 23 0 36 while ahmad et al 2018 demonstrated a similar pattern of variation in pli values that in the range of 0 15 0 23 cu had a greater pli in the dry 1 08 mg kg and rainy 1 06 mg kg seasons according to izah et al 2017 pli levels greater than 1 indicate soil contamination while pli values less than 1 indicate safe soil in the current findings the pli value was less than 1 indicating that the soil at the study location is clean 3 3 2 bio accumulation factor of trace element cu the range of bio accumulation factor for cu in the current study was 0 14 1 41 table 4 maximum existed in seher 2006 irrigated with industrial water in year 2 and the minimal baf value for cu was observed in the variety faislabad 2008 irrigated with ground water in both years 1 and 2 baf for cu given by alrawiq et al 2014 0 25 0 59 and alghobar and suresha 2016 0 44 0 76 in the non convention water from the ground physiological and morphological disturbance played an important role in accumulation elimination and translocation of metals rattan et al 2005 the outcomes of this study expose the threat for health of populace of pakistan as they exhibit toxic health consequences 3 3 3 translocation factor of trace element cu the range of tf for cu varied from 0 58 to 1 65 table 4 data from ground water irrigation and levels were maximum 0 88 for cu in punjab 2011 and the lowest 0 58 was noticed in variety watan both results were obtained during cropping 1st year results from waste water and industrial water irrigation indicated the highest tf 1 65 for cu was observed for the variety punjab 2011 irrigated with industrial water in year 2 and the lowest tf 0 58 was observed for variety faislabad 2008 irrigated with sewage water in year 1 in ground water and sewage water samples asdeo 2014 0 43 and chaoua et al 2019 0 1 found lower tfs for cu while rattan et al 2005 reported higher values 2 35 16 7 all the samples showed the tf for cu 1 following soils irrigated with toxic water from the industry and it was specifically during 2nd cropping season the considerable difference in translocation factor might occur among soil plants and metal types hussain and qureshi 2020 however we noted tf for cu 1 for seher 2006 galaxy 2013 and punjab 2011 3 3 4 bio concentration factor bcf the range of bcf was 0 07 0 55 table 4 bio concentration factor varies greatly among the samples the top most bcf was found in variety watan following 2nd cropping season and using toxic industrial water for irrigation bcf lowest in wheat cv faislabad 2008 during 1st cropping season and using ground water for field plot irrigation in contrast to present findings ahmad et al 2018 found higher bcf 0 79 0 76 for cu in their investigation following the use of non conventional water resources ground and wastewater for irrigation bio concentration factor for cu 0 24 reported by asdeo 2014 was in concordance with the current research in present research all the samples showed that the bcf for cu was less than 1 the total cu contents not determined by its toxicity behavior and phyto bioavailability 3 3 5 enrichment factor ef cu enrichment factors in several wheat cultivars were found to be less than one in all of the samples the ef for cu ranged from 0 01 to 0 06 table 4 in both cropping years the enrichment factor was highest for all varieties irrigated with ground water while it was lowest for variety watan irrigated with industrial water in cropping year 2 in contrast to the current study singh et al 2004 1 54 and alghobar and suresha 2016 2 22 found a greater ef for cu in wastewater treated soil in contrast to the values 3 51 4 22 suggested by khan et al 2009 in the ground and wastewater treated samples the ef for all samples was found to be lower the ef of a metal is determined by its bioavailability which is determined by the chemical form of the metal its amount in the soil growth rate which is determined by plant species and variations in absorption capability hussain et al 2021 3 3 6 trace metal copper toxicity in soil plant human continuum and health risk assessment intake of cu for all examples was 1 copper every day intake was in the range of 0 001 0 003 mg kg day table 4 the least daily consumption for cu was noticed for all varieties inundated with ground water in both cropping years highest daily consumption of cu was noticed for varieties seher 2006 faislabad 2008 and punjab 2011 inundated with water from municipal and industries in 2nd year and in watan and galaxy 2013 following using toxic water from industrial source for irrigation water in 2nd year the scope of hri for cu was 0 002 0 004 table 4 the hri for cu was found highest in every one of the five varieties irrigated with ground water in year 2 and for cv faislabad 2008 with ground water in year 1 cu intake was observed to be lower for several types of samples when compared to chaoua et al 2019 findings 0 004 mg kg day in comparison to the values 0 004 0 008 mg kg day given by ahmad et al 2018 in the ground and wastewater irrigated samples all of the samples revealed a lower daily intake value for cu cu intake was found to be greater than that advised by zeng et al 2015 0 006 mg kg day the current daily cu intake values 3 mg kg day were below the fao who recommended maximum acceptable range 2007 chaoua et al 2019 looked into a higher hri value 0 09 than the ones found in this study bhatti et al 2017 discovered cu to have a high health risk score ahmad et al 2018 reported the higher daily intake for cu in ground and wastewater irrigated samples 0 13 0 21 respectively several reported from international monitoring bodies like fao 2007 and who 2007 showed that tolerable limit in wheat grains must be lower than 3 mg kg 4 conclusion it was concluded that the cu amassing in all of the water samples was above the permitted limit but it is below in case of soil and grains daily intake for cu is below than the maximum tolerable limit and hri is also 1 for all types of grain samples this indicated that current wheat varieties irrigated with various water sources were suitable for dietary intake however some samples showed the tf and baf values greater than 1 which represented that continuous usage of waste water from the treatment

9498,in developing countries using non conventional water for irrigation is a traditional and cost effective tool however its long term use for agriculture and forestry will led to toxic metal bioaccumulation in plants and soil environment copper cu is an essential plant nutrient but its excess accumulation can cause significant issues and risks to human health following food crop consumption the present study was conducted with the aim to assess impact of copper cu in the five wheat varieties seher 2006 faislabad 2008 watan galaxy 2013 punjab 2011 at 7 ecological sites during the two growing seasons 2017 2018 the source of irrigation included the ground water industrial wastewater and sewage water the cu concentrations were subsequently determined via ecological environment water soils and below and above ground plant organs shoots roots and wheat grains and phytostabilization potential assessment using various pollution indices results of this study revealed that mean cu concentration in different wheat varieties and treatments were varied from 1 53 to 1 07 3 22 mg kg 0 58 and 1 94 mg kg 0 43 2 39 mg kg and 0 23 0 78 mg kg in amended soil root shoot and grains respectively wheat cultivar seher 2006 showed highest cu transfer from shoot to grain following irrigation with ground water while lowest after industrial water irrigation high content of cu was obtained in water and toxicity was higher than the maximum permissible limit in case of grain and soil samples the copper contents were present within the safe limits the value of all the indices for cu were found less than 1 except for bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor that were greater than 1 for some samples our results revealed that the studied varieties of wheat crop were safe for consumption but the continuous usage of wastewater for irrigation may pose health risks after many years of consumption because some samples showed the high value for bioaccumulation factor and transfer factor wheat varieties possess desirable traits that are vital for phytoremediation purposes keywords copper health risk index translocation factor wastewater wheat 1 introduction in most part of the country pakistan possess arid climate with scarce freshwater and many farmers use non conventional water resources treated and un treated for agriculture and forestry hassan et al 2013 riaz et al 2022 the city effluent industrial wastewater sewage water and contaminated canal water are an important sources for irrigation that many farmers discovered as a source of water supply and this technique is growing quickly in essentially all communities across the country khan et al 2018 shahid et al 2021 therefore wastewater had become a feasible way to decrease water scarcity heavy metals are known as elements containing metallic properties with density of 5gcm 3 and atomic mass number of 20 from thirty five metals twenty three are heavy metals most common heavy metals are arsenic cadmium chromium mercury and lead heavy metals in soil come from two sources natural and anthropogenic natural sources include soil parent material e g rock mineral volcanic eruption marine aerosols and forest fires while anthropogenic sources originated from human activities such as energy and fuel production e g emission from power stations mining and smelting recycling operations e g scrap melting and agricultural sources like fertilizer pesticide sewage sludge and irrigation water ejaz et al 2022 in plants and animal cells some elements have important functions which are called micronutrients or trace elements this term has been shown for copper cu manganese mn nickel ni zinc zn and cobalt co these are termed as heavy metals only when their internal content becomes exceeds up to the specified threshold limit and they show toxic effects the major route by which toxic metals are transferred to human beings is crop consumption this transfer of toxic heavy metals can cause life threatening diseases lu et al 2015 copper cu is a vital trace element in living beings the level of cu in the human body ranges from 1 4 to 2 1 mg kg of body mass normal cu level as a recommended dietary allowance rda is 0 97 3 0 mg day in a healthy adult cu is absorbed by the gut which aids fe uptake the deficiency of cu can affect the metabolism of glucose and cholesterol anemia like symptoms increased the rate of infections and bone abnormalities the maximum healthful limit of cu in wheat should be 3 mg kg as recommended by ec and fao who hassan et al 2013 however homeostasis for cu is an important factor in order to prevent the toxicity of copper due to an undeveloped biliary excretion system and increased intestinal absorption neonates and infants are more susceptible to copper poisoning collins amd klevay 2011 indian childhood cirrhosis endemic tyrolean infantile cirrhosis and idiopathic copper toxicity all have copper excess coronado et al 2005 cu metabolism problems in humans are caused by mutations in genes involved in cu homeostasis wilson disease wd is the most well known human cu toxicities disorder it is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the atp7b gene which causes improper cu transportation and excretion into the bile the presence of excess free cu causes cirrhosis of the liver the kayser fleischer ring renal tubular failure and brain damage in wd sandahl et al 2020 the health risk index is the ratio of daily metal ingestion from edible plants to the external standard quantity ejaz et al 2022 the bio concentration factor is the ability of heavy metals to move from the soil to the eating section of crops bcf the enrichment factor ef is used to calculate soil contamination and trace metal pollution causes metal poisoning in humans bakshi et al 2021 the bio concentration factor is used to investigate heavy metal concentrations in plants and soil heavy metals in plants have been established in several studies to assess their risks to human health the level of health risk provided by heavy metals is measured using a variety of health indices including daily intake of metals dim transfer factor tf and health risk index hri or health quotient hq are utilised qureshi et al 2016 hussain et al 2021 continuous wastewater application has a negative impact on biological populations in soil ecosystems as well as catastrophic consequences for customers who consume polluted cereal ad food grain crops grown on such soil alghobar and suresha 2016 along with harmful metals sewage water also contains vital nutrients and organic materials jakubus and czekala 2001 however because of the high concentration of hazardous compounds in this wastewater it is not widely employed because it harms both plants and soil the effects of different heavy metals on wheat were studied by athar and ahmad 2002 cd was the metal they discovered to be the most poisonous the decrease in agricultural productivity has resulted in a major problem of food insecurity in developing countries to solve this issue many agricultural management strategies such as proper use of non conventional water organic farming and the employment of microorganisms have been developed and used to raise production increase farmers incomes and improve their livelihoods shahid et al 2021 hussain et al 2020 as part of the integration of the food production system these productivity technologies have largely ignored their underlying relationship and dependency with associated aspects such as climate water and energy raw sewage is a good source of both organic and inorganic nutrients that plants need to develop hamid et al 2022 sewage water is used to irrigate vegetables and fodder crops growing near sewage treatment plants these foods are consumed by both animals and humans it supplies available n p fe k zn mn and cu to soil which explains why it is important for crop irrigation in agriculture around the world it is utilized in agriculture as a low cost source of fertilizer eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers darvishi et al 2010 recent reports suggested that micro and macronutrient concentration was increased in the soil by continuous application of the wastewater zeng et al 2015 at lower concentrations micro nutrients were required by plants for their proper development and metabolic rate but in high concentrations nutrients become toxic numerous micronutrients were toxic at high concentration as well as reported to cause adverse effects on plants industrial discharge metal mining incorrect use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and atmospheric deposition of heavy metals are the main sources of heavy metals in water khan et al 2019 shahid et al 2017 heavy metal accumulation can disrupt enzyme activity resulting in reduced biological growth and metabolism as well as oxidative damage esmaeilzadeh et al 2017 kovačević et al 2020 furthermore heavy metals can biomagnified as they go up the food chain posing a health risk to humans rombel bryzek et al 2017 in the present study copper cu was selected as an important environmental pollutants and toxicant that cause soils contamination and serious environmental issue due to its widespread occurrence and high persistence the aims of this study was to investigate 1 the influence of uptake and dissipation of cu by different wheat varieties 2 how the cu pollution affect soil bioaccumulation wheat growth pollution load and pollutant transfer in root shoot and wheat grains and 3 how wheat regulate and select pollutant oriented soil environment 4 to access the pollution severity of soil and 5 to assess possible contamination risk and health hazards to human beings due to cu by evaluating bioaccumulation translocation and bioconcentration factors with plant uptake 2 material and methods 2 1 environmental sites the research was conducted at 7 districts bhakkar chiniot faisalabad gujranwala gujrat kasur and sargodha of punjab pakistan wheat fields irrigated with three sources of water i e ground water and waste water from sewage and industries were selected from each district the present study was conducted with the aim to assess impact of copper cu in the five wheat varieties seher 2006 faislabad 2008 watan galaxy 2013 punjab 2011 growth and yield as well as on human health risks at 7 ecological sites during the two growing seasons 2017 2018 the 7 sites of experiment located at different districts represent different contaminated environments as the sites were irrigated from ground water industrial wastewater and sewage water this is because the experimental soil of seven sites suffering from scarce freshwater resources thus has been irrigated with above mentioned three different contaminated water sources 2 2 experimental design and sampling procedure the collected samples of soil and wheat parts from all sites and each variety were pooled into a composite sample separately and four replicates for each sample were formulated during the two successive cropping seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 field experiments were conducted in 7 different districts of punjab pakistan for sampling the randomized complete block design rcbd was utilized in rcbd one variable is constantly dependent on another one quantity constantly interacts with others crop year with various collection sites illustrating the rcbd in the current study every plot in every region collected soil root shoot and grain samples for every variety irrigated with each treatment water source and blended them into one composite sample for each water resource four replicates of soils grains shoot root samples were prepared for each cultivar samples were taken during the harvest season water samples were collected from each district s resource and put into a single merged study 2 3 irrigation sources and water samples collection from different sources the irrigation source include groundwater gw sewage water sw and industrialized waste water iww and water samples 100 ml each were collected in punjab from seven different districts before being transferred to the research center all of the samples were collected in polypropylene bottles that had been pre washed with nitric acid 1 and kept at 4 c until analysis afnor 1997 2 4 soil and plant sampling with a stainless steel drill the targeted spots were penetrated up to a depth of 10 15 cm partially removing all layers of soil before being placed in a forced air oven at 72 c for 47 h the sample was desiccated in the air the gathered samples was placed in polyethylene bags labeled and sealed the samples were stored at 70 c for 5 days in an incubator rhue and kidder 1983 wheat samples shoots roots and grains were cleaned to remove airborne dust particles and then rinsed with deionized water the samples were air dried and kept in forced air oven for 48 h at 72 c after the removal of moisture samples were ground into fine powder by crushing with the help of electrical grinder powdered samples were further macerated and passed by 2 mm sifter aydin et al 2015 2 5 biochemical analysis all types of wastewater samples collected from seven districts were digested according to apha 2005 after adding 10 ml of strong hno3 to 50 ml of water the digestion was carried out at 80 c until the solution became translucent after which it was filtered using 0 22 ml of whatman filters maidstone uk and distill water was added to make the volume 50 ml the soil and crop components samples were digested using a wet digestion technique 1 g of each dehydrated sample was placed in 15 ml of a 1 1 5 solutions of h2so4 hclo4 and hno3 at 80 c until the solution became clear after filtration of the digested solutions the final volume of each sample was raised to 50 ml and stored in bottles 2 6 metal detection analytical method following the completion of the digestion all of the samples were analyzed for cu metal using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and wet digestion to determine the amount of mineral deposits samples were diluted and a flame photometer was used water samples were digested by following the method of apha apha 2012 wet digestion method was employed for digestion of water and soil samples allen et al 1986 atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer aas 5000 was utilized to compute the level of copper 2 7 environmental pollution indices the pollution load index was analyzed by the following formula liu et al 2005 1 pli metal contamination in soil reference value of metal in soil the copper baf and tf were assessed by using the given formula cui et al 2004 li et al 2007 2 baf copper shoot copper soil 3 tf copper shoot copper root the formula given by cui et al 2004 were used to determine the bcf 4 bcf copper in grains copper in soil enrichment factor indicates the influence of the anthropogenic activity on the heavy metal content of soil to detect the probable influence of anthropogenesis on the metal contents in soil the content of heavy metals categorized by low variability of occurrence lv is used as a reference both in examined sample and in the standard content of particular metal in the soil enrichment factor was analyzed by utilizing the under mentioned formula buat menard and chesselet 1979 5 ef m grain m soil samples m grain m soil standard the daily intake of heavy metals dim was determined by examining the metal content in crops and the daily intake of studied food crop singh et al 2010 6 dim heavy metal concentration in wheat grain mg kg daily intake of wheat grain kg person average body weight kg the daily intake of metal by consumption of wheat grain is 0 242 kg person as reported by wang et al 2007 and average body weight of 55 9 kg was used wang et al 2005 health risk index was assessed by the formula given by sajjad et al 2009 7 hri daily intake of metal oral reference dose of metals average percentage for transfer of metal was calculated by dividing the total value of metal in soil by that of root and multiplying the quotient by 100 the average transfer percentage from root shoot and shoot grain was also interpreted using similar method the obtained data was subjected to anova using minitab 16 software to analyze the significant differences among mean values of data tukey s hsd test was applied in tukey s hsd test the means of every treatment are compared with the means of every other treatment and lettering denotes difference among means steel et al 2006 to avoid any infectivity standards were prepared vigilantly dry weight was taken as a basis for measurement of soil and wheat samples triplicate analysis with strict control procedures was performed to ensure accuracy 2 8 statistical analysis all samples were evaluated for analysis of variance anova which found to be best fit for field analysis such as entirely randomized block design using the minitab 16 software the data from every attribute was statistically analyzed to discover significant differences between mean values 3 way anova used in addition to anova the tukey s hsd test was applied in tukey s hsd test the means of every treatment are compared with the means of every other treatment and lettering denotes difference among means steel et al 2006 fig 1 2 9 quality control analysis standards were meticulously prepared to avoid infectivity samples of soil and wheat plant samples were weighed to determine their dry weight to confirm the quality of the results every sample was repeated three times table 1 table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity of copper on ecological indicators 3 1 1 water the present results highlight that water source crop year and their interaction were significantly p 0 05 affected by cu content table 2 data indicated that the cu content in unlike irrigation water sources in year 1 and year 2 ranged from 2 67 to 3 90 mg l fig 2 the maximum cu content in different irrigation waters in year 1 from the industrial water and the lowest in ground water results for the cu content in different irrigation water sources in year 2 were same as for year 1 cu content in all the water samples exceeded the value 0 102 mg l suggested by chaoua et al 2019 all samples contained the higher cu values than the values 1 03 1 29 mg l given by khan et al 2017 in ground and wastewater respectively all the water samples from different sources contain cu contents more than the maximum permissible value 0 20 1 00 mg l as suggested by who fao 2007 and usepa 2010 respectively both environment and agriculture were significantly affected by the toxicity of cu the main sources for contamination of cu are smelting mining and agricultural urban and industrial wastes ang and lee 2005 agricultural and industrial wastes might be the possible reason for higher cu contents in the water samples of present research 3 1 2 soil the statistical analysis indicates that variety water source crop year and interaction of variety and crop year had significant p 0 05 effect over the cu content in soil table 3 mean results for the cu content found in all of the soil samples showed that cu content ranged from 1 07 to 3 22 mg kg fig 3 the topmost amount of cu was present in soil of the variety faislabad 2008 irrigated with sewage source of water in year 1 and the least contents of cu was contained in soil where watan variety was irrigated with water from industrial source in 1st year of cropping the cu content in plant parts on the other hand is linked to the cu concentration in the soil kumar et al 2021 as a result monitoring cu concentration in soil and its transmission to plants and humans is critical roshdy 2018 had reported the higher range 302 310 mg kg of cu in soil samples than all those values given by current findings copper contents 2 08 1 12 mg kg observed by alrawiq et al 2014 in soil samples watered with ground and waste water respectively were in concordance with those of the present study soil exhibit greater quantity of cu and it was much higher than the reported values in the literature kobaissi et al 2014 parameters of physicochemical nature such as soil ph electrical conductivity organic carbon and organic matter were all responsible for the translocation uptake and pollution loading of cu from the soil environment to the plant organs chaoua et al 2019 the transfer factor from soils to vegetation measurements from soil irrigation water and plant samples their daily intake and subsequent health risks assessment also play a vital role in the evaluation of environmental pollution from trace metals kumar et al 2021 3 2 toxicity impact of copper on above and below ground wheat organs 3 2 1 root cu content in root was significantly p 0 05 influenced by variety water source and crop year according to an analysis of variance table 3 cu content varied between 0 58 and 1 94 mg kg with the lowest being found in variety faislabad 2008 which was irrigated with ground water in year 2 and the highest being found in variety galaxy 2013 which was irrigated with industrial water in year 2 fig 4 cu transport from soil to root was between 20 20 and 136 4 fig 7 in the first crop year the maximum soil to root transfer was found higher for variety watan which was irrigated with industrial waste while the lowest transfer was noted in punjab 2011 which was irrigated with fresh ground water in the same crop year copper content in the roots was found higher 5 76 mg kg as revealed by chaoua et al 2019 in comparison with the present research in agricultural soils and plants continuous irrigation through wastewater led to the acceration of heavy metals copper content given by the present research was between the ranges 0 20 4 63 mg kg reported by al othman et al 2013 furthermore cu excess in plants causes oxidative stress by creating harmful reactive oxygen species ros which are scavenged by superoxide dismutase and peroxidase two enzymes that play critical roles in reducing cu toxicity in plants huang et al 2020 amount of cu in roots as suggested by xiao rui et al 2016 and asdeo 2014 was much higher 22 44 14 12 mg kg respectively as compared to its content in all root samples of current research 3 2 2 shoot cu values in wheat plant shoots were unaffected by variety or its relationship with water source and crop year p 0 05 whereas water source and year revealed a significant p 0 05 effect of cu on wheat plant shoots table 3 the average cu content in all types of shoot samples was 0 43 2 39 mg kg fig 5 in cropping year 2 the highest cu concentration was found in seher 2006 shoot samples inundated with industrial waste water while the lowest cu content was found in faislabad 2008 shoot samples irrigated with clean ground water cu transport was determined to be between 57 83 and 164 9 from root to shoot fig 8 highest and lowest cu transfer values was obtained in punjab 2011 following industrial water irrigation in year 2 and watan after ground water irrigation in year 1 respectively copper levels were lower in all of the shoot samples from three different irrigation sources than the value 2 51 mg kg as reported by aydin et al 2015 in wastewater irrigated shoot samples when compared to the results 1 53 mg kg reported by yap et al the cu content in shoots irrigated with ground and sewage water was found to be lower while shoot samples irrigated with industrial water in cropping year 2 had higher cu levels 2009 pulido et al 2013 reported that heavy metals were considered the most dangerous due to their persistency and toxicity in the environment among numerous soil pollutants for plant growth the micronutrients as being vital several heavy metals such as zn cu mo fe and mn have been recognized as micronutrients some other elements that were not vital for plant and have high poisonous effects even in very low concentrations were cd hg cr vi as ni and pb in many industrial products the cu compounds are used which mainly include insecticides fungicides petroleum refining and wood preservation etc that might be the possible reason of high cu content in shoot samples irrigated with industrial water yu et al 2016 in another study higher cu values 0 70 4 96 mg kg was reported in shoot xiao rui et al 2016 3 2 3 grains except for their interaction impacts all of the characteristics had a significant p 0 05 impact on cu in grains table 3 cu content ranged from 0 23 to 0 78 mg kg in different wheat cultivars fig 6 punjab 2011 which was watered with waste water from industries in the second crop year had the highest cu content of all the kinds while both varieties had the lowest cu content in the first cropping year faislabad 2008 was irrigated using ground water and seher 2006 was irrigated with ground water in the second cropping year cu transfer from shoot to grain was found to be 28 27 64 fig 9 seher 2006 irrigated wheat had the highest and lowest cu transfer from shoot to grain high dose metal deposition on land contaminates the soil and food crops grown on these soils which then enter the living organism through their ingestion copper is also important for co2 absorption and atp generation marques et al 2018 it s found in a variety of proteins including photosynthetic plastocyanin and electron transport chain cytochrome oxidase cu concentrations in plants that exceed critical levels have an adverse effect on plant growth induce leaf chlorosis and cause cytotoxicity saleem et al 2020 vegetables absorb heavy metals like cu and store them in excess levels in both edible and non edible sections resulting in health issues in humans and other animals following their consumption maleki and zarasvand 2008 heavy metals in soil such as cu can accumulate in food crops and then be transmitted to other media through the food chain heavy metal bioaccumulation factor bcf in the soil food crops system primarily in the most important staple crops copper values were found below the permitted value rusan et al 2007 present cu level in grains fall within the safe limit which shows that no copper toxicity will occur by the consumption of these grains it has been noticed that the cu transfer from soil to root was lower in contrast to that of root to shoot but it again declines from shoot to grain the high root to shoot transfer value might be the consequence of high content of cu in irrigation water the composition of wastewater which is used for irrigation purpose is directly involved in the accumulation of heavy metals and micronutrients it also has an indirect effect by its chelation property which increasing the solubility of some indigenous soil heavy metals ahmad et al 2018 3 3 environmental indices 3 3 1 pollution load index pli pli value for cu was found between ranges of 0 13 0 41 table 4 for ground water irrigation in year 1 and 2 the highest pli value 0 38 was showed by soil of the variety faislabad 2008 in year 1 and the lowest 0 30 was noticed for soil of watan copper showed highest values of pli 0 41 in the soil profile where galaxy 2013 was cultivated while soil exhibiting watan variety showed lowest cu pollution load 0 13 it was happened during 2nd cropping year in case of galaxy 2013 while pli was observed lower in watan during 1st cropping year cui et al 2004 investigated the metal concentration of soil was higher than the present study in a previous study khan et al 2017 reported distant values of pli 0 23 0 36 while ahmad et al 2018 demonstrated a similar pattern of variation in pli values that in the range of 0 15 0 23 cu had a greater pli in the dry 1 08 mg kg and rainy 1 06 mg kg seasons according to izah et al 2017 pli levels greater than 1 indicate soil contamination while pli values less than 1 indicate safe soil in the current findings the pli value was less than 1 indicating that the soil at the study location is clean 3 3 2 bio accumulation factor of trace element cu the range of bio accumulation factor for cu in the current study was 0 14 1 41 table 4 maximum existed in seher 2006 irrigated with industrial water in year 2 and the minimal baf value for cu was observed in the variety faislabad 2008 irrigated with ground water in both years 1 and 2 baf for cu given by alrawiq et al 2014 0 25 0 59 and alghobar and suresha 2016 0 44 0 76 in the non convention water from the ground physiological and morphological disturbance played an important role in accumulation elimination and translocation of metals rattan et al 2005 the outcomes of this study expose the threat for health of populace of pakistan as they exhibit toxic health consequences 3 3 3 translocation factor of trace element cu the range of tf for cu varied from 0 58 to 1 65 table 4 data from ground water irrigation and levels were maximum 0 88 for cu in punjab 2011 and the lowest 0 58 was noticed in variety watan both results were obtained during cropping 1st year results from waste water and industrial water irrigation indicated the highest tf 1 65 for cu was observed for the variety punjab 2011 irrigated with industrial water in year 2 and the lowest tf 0 58 was observed for variety faislabad 2008 irrigated with sewage water in year 1 in ground water and sewage water samples asdeo 2014 0 43 and chaoua et al 2019 0 1 found lower tfs for cu while rattan et al 2005 reported higher values 2 35 16 7 all the samples showed the tf for cu 1 following soils irrigated with toxic water from the industry and it was specifically during 2nd cropping season the considerable difference in translocation factor might occur among soil plants and metal types hussain and qureshi 2020 however we noted tf for cu 1 for seher 2006 galaxy 2013 and punjab 2011 3 3 4 bio concentration factor bcf the range of bcf was 0 07 0 55 table 4 bio concentration factor varies greatly among the samples the top most bcf was found in variety watan following 2nd cropping season and using toxic industrial water for irrigation bcf lowest in wheat cv faislabad 2008 during 1st cropping season and using ground water for field plot irrigation in contrast to present findings ahmad et al 2018 found higher bcf 0 79 0 76 for cu in their investigation following the use of non conventional water resources ground and wastewater for irrigation bio concentration factor for cu 0 24 reported by asdeo 2014 was in concordance with the current research in present research all the samples showed that the bcf for cu was less than 1 the total cu contents not determined by its toxicity behavior and phyto bioavailability 3 3 5 enrichment factor ef cu enrichment factors in several wheat cultivars were found to be less than one in all of the samples the ef for cu ranged from 0 01 to 0 06 table 4 in both cropping years the enrichment factor was highest for all varieties irrigated with ground water while it was lowest for variety watan irrigated with industrial water in cropping year 2 in contrast to the current study singh et al 2004 1 54 and alghobar and suresha 2016 2 22 found a greater ef for cu in wastewater treated soil in contrast to the values 3 51 4 22 suggested by khan et al 2009 in the ground and wastewater treated samples the ef for all samples was found to be lower the ef of a metal is determined by its bioavailability which is determined by the chemical form of the metal its amount in the soil growth rate which is determined by plant species and variations in absorption capability hussain et al 2021 3 3 6 trace metal copper toxicity in soil plant human continuum and health risk assessment intake of cu for all examples was 1 copper every day intake was in the range of 0 001 0 003 mg kg day table 4 the least daily consumption for cu was noticed for all varieties inundated with ground water in both cropping years highest daily consumption of cu was noticed for varieties seher 2006 faislabad 2008 and punjab 2011 inundated with water from municipal and industries in 2nd year and in watan and galaxy 2013 following using toxic water from industrial source for irrigation water in 2nd year the scope of hri for cu was 0 002 0 004 table 4 the hri for cu was found highest in every one of the five varieties irrigated with ground water in year 2 and for cv faislabad 2008 with ground water in year 1 cu intake was observed to be lower for several types of samples when compared to chaoua et al 2019 findings 0 004 mg kg day in comparison to the values 0 004 0 008 mg kg day given by ahmad et al 2018 in the ground and wastewater irrigated samples all of the samples revealed a lower daily intake value for cu cu intake was found to be greater than that advised by zeng et al 2015 0 006 mg kg day the current daily cu intake values 3 mg kg day were below the fao who recommended maximum acceptable range 2007 chaoua et al 2019 looked into a higher hri value 0 09 than the ones found in this study bhatti et al 2017 discovered cu to have a high health risk score ahmad et al 2018 reported the higher daily intake for cu in ground and wastewater irrigated samples 0 13 0 21 respectively several reported from international monitoring bodies like fao 2007 and who 2007 showed that tolerable limit in wheat grains must be lower than 3 mg kg 4 conclusion it was concluded that the cu amassing in all of the water samples was above the permitted limit but it is below in case of soil and grains daily intake for cu is below than the maximum tolerable limit and hri is also 1 for all types of grain samples this indicated that current wheat varieties irrigated with various water sources were suitable for dietary intake however some samples showed the tf and baf values greater than 1 which represented that continuous usage of waste water from the treatment

9499,the canopy temperature is a promising methodology for deficit irrigation scheduling this measurement is used to calculate the crop water stress index cwsi which needs the estimation of non water stress baseline nwsb in olive orchards nwsb changed at different times of the day and throughout the season the aim of this work was to evaluate a simplified methodology for estimating nwsb to allow reducing costs and facilitate the cwsi estimation the experiment was performed during two consecutive seasons 2020 and 2021 in a young super intensive density olive orchard olea europaea l cv manzanillo three irrigation treatments were evaluated in a completely randomized design with 6 repetitions control full irrigated regulated deficit irrigation rdi with a period of water stress during pit hardening and rainfed the midday stem water potential and leaf conductance were measured every week during the irrigation season the canopy temperature was measured with a low cost thermal camera attached to a tablet the cwsi was estimated for the same trees used to measure the midday stem water potential and leaf conductance the nwsb was calculated in different ways considering several simplifications firstly nwbs was obtained using previously published equations one or several equations throughout the season secondly climate data were measured in the orchard together with the canopy temperature or using daily values from a weather station nearby cwsi estimations using different equations were closely related r2 0 95 mse 0 008 and one fit was considered successful although the differences in the values from different sources was considerable and significant the cwsi estimation did not present major variations and the use of data from the weather station could be assumed in commercial orchards the cwsi successfully identified water stress in rainfed conditions mainly when the stomata closure was detected however the differentiation between control and rdi was limited keywords nwsb regulated deficit irrigation table olive water potential water relations 1 introduction the water available for agricultural use is decreasing around the world climatic change is causing a reduction of rains and an increase of temperature that in turn raise the water needs and impact reservoirs in addition other social uses also compete for the use of this resource this means that irrigation scheduling should improve the approach taken when a decision is needed and facilitate the adaptation to deficit irrigation conditions regulated deficit irrigation rdi scheduling is typically applied to different crops steduto et al 2012 this approach suggests creating a water stress period whose final effect on yield is small or non existent chalmers and wilson 1978 managing water stress requires tools that provide accurate information about water status but also frequent data to support irrigation decision based on thresholds olive trees olea europaea l are a good example of this this specie is considered one of the most drought resistant cultivated ones with a low reduction in yield after very severe water stress conditions e g ahumada orellana et al 2017 but with extremely sensitive phenological stages such as flowering and fruit set which strongly reduce fruit yield moriana et al 2003 gucci et al 2019 baselines of the different indicators would provide an effective tool as reference for managing irrigation throughout the season e g shackel et al 2021 with water potential but first an experimental effort is needed to publish data as a first step to define baseline and threshold values for different indicators the canopy temperature has been used as a water stress indicator from the 70 s of the last century idso et al 1977 the initial concept of the stress degree day was improved with the inclusion of other factors such as vapor pressure deficit vpd which was finally incorporated into the definition of the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 in recent years this indicator has become very popular because it offers the possibility to obtain remote sensed imagery and apply large scale monitoring using airborne systems berni et al 2009 egea et al 2017 the calculation of cwsi can be done in different ways but the most frequent one due to its simplicity is the empirical cwsi idso et al 1981 cwsi t t ll t ul t ll in eq 1 all δts are the differences between canopy temperatures under different conditions and air temperatures cwsi is the ratio of two differences the first one is the temperature difference between field conditions δt and non water stress conditions lower level δtll the second one is the difference between non transpiring conditions upper level δtul and non water stress conditions lower level δtll both differences δtup and δtll changed with the vpd idso et al 1981 but the first one δtup is typically considered a constant value although cwsi varied between 0 and 1 for all species the relationship between vpd and all δts was different for different species kirkham 2005 olive is a very drought resistant species díaz espejo et al 2018 and very severe water stress levels cause a significant but low reduction in yield ahumada orellana et al 2017 ben gal et al 2021 there are several works about this fruit tree indicating that cwsi could be a water stress indicator when empirical o analytical approaches in different production systems are used intensive ben gal et al 2009 berni et al 2009 super intensive egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 among the eq 1 components δtup is considered a constant value which could change with the vpd kirkham 2005 but in olive trees 5ºc is considered adequate ben gal et al 2009 conversely δtll is based on a relationship between δt and vpd under full irrigated conditions non water stress baseline nwsb in super intensive mature olive orchards egea et al 2017 reported that the nwsb changed depending on the time of the day and throughout the season and suggested three distinctive periods from june to september the main advantage of cwsi is that it offers the possibility of applying remote monitoring to large orchards cwsi has been used in different fruits trees to determine water stress conditions orange garcía tejero et al 2011 peach bellvert et al 2016 almond gonzalez dugo et al 2020 or to calculate crop evapotranspiration almond gonzalez dugo et al 2020 however the frequency of these measurements could be limited by costs this problem is usually associated to the weight smigaj et al 2017 matinez et al 2017 and the cost of the device matinez et al 2017 noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 used in unmanned aerial vehicles uav different low cost devices have been successfully tested in herbaceous matinez et al 2017 and fruit garcía tejero et al 2018 noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 ramírez cuesta et al 2022 crops as well as forest species smigaj et al 2017 one constrain of these low cost methodologies is related to the low resolution which could limit identification of mild water stress smigaj et al 2017 some of these low cost devices were tested in ground measurements garcía tejero et al 2018 noguera et al 2020 that could be affected by the variability of temperature in the upper or lower part of the canopy ramírez cuesta et al 2022 noguera et al 2020 using a low cost device for olive orchards concluded that although the system worked further works would be needed to test different environmental and water status conditions this mainly refers to the estimation of nwsb which would affect to cwsi determinations egea et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2022 the aim of this work was to evaluate a simplified methodology to estimate nwsb in a young super intensive density olive orchard using a low cost device for a wide range of water statuses this simplified approach would verify the nwsb estimations by egea et al 2017 and the use of different sources of climate data in the estimation of the cwsi two consecutive seasons with three different irrigation systems control rdi and rainfed would allow evaluating a wide range of water statuses the low cost device was a commercial thermal camera attached to tablet as in garcia tejero et al 2018 and the data will be compared with water potential measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 site and treatment description the experiment was carried out in an olive orchard in la hampa an experimental farm of the instituto de recursos naturales y agrobología irnas csic in coria del rio near seville spain 37º 17 n 6º 3 w 30 m altitude during the 2020 and 2021 seasons this orchard was 2 years old at the beginning of the experiment and the first yield occurred in 2020 and was around 800 kg ha 1 the trees olea europaea l cv manzanillo were planted in a super intensive system 4 1 5 m apart 1667 tree ha 1 and were trained in a central leader system the soil was a sandy loam with more than 1 m depth climatic data were obtained from the andalusian weather network station la puebla siar 2022 about 7 km away from the experimental plot the climatic conditions of the location are typically mediterranean the potential evapotranspiration eto and rainfall in both years presented the typical seasonal pattern figs 1 and 2 eto was greater than 5 mm day 1 during most of the experimental period in both seasons and more common in 2021 than in 2020 rainfall occurred from mid autumn until early spring with a dry summer in both seasons the volume of rain was low particularly during 2021 492 mm in 2020 and 357 mm in 2021 compared to the average of the zone 539 mm aemet 2022 rains during the experimental period in both years were almost null most of the days when measurements were carried out the weather was clear without radiation constrains figs 1b and 2b only on day of the year doy 274 in 2021 fig 2b there was a clear reduction of radiation at midday the irrigation system consisted of a single line of emitters 2 2 l h 1 which were spaced 0 5 m the water applied was measured with a water meter in each replication and monitored weekly during the irrigation season three irrigation treatments were applied using a completed randomized design with 6 repetitions plot from 2nd of june in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic the irrigation season started before that date and all trees were irrigated with the same amount of water 56 mm until the beginning of june each plot had 5 lines of 13 trees each and the 3 central lines were used as measurement points irrigation scheduling considered four phenological phases a before pit hardening b pit hardening until the last week of august c rehydration period until harvest and d post harvest the beginning of pit hardening was determined by the variation in longitudinal growth of the fruits rapoport et al 2013 the irrigation treatments were control the objective of this treatment was to maximize vegetative growth water application was scheduled based on midday stem water potential swp measurements irrigation was the traditional estimation of fao 66 crop coefficients kc 0 55 reduction coefficient kr 0 7 but the water applied was increased when swp values were lower than 1 mpa until 175 crop evapotranspiration etc the seasonal water applied reached 553 and 772 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 1 regulated deficit irrigation rdi the objective of this treatment was to achieve a mild or moderate water stress throughout the season trees were irrigated with 1 mm per day in all the irrigation season this water applied was increased by 1 2 or 3 mm according to the difference between the measured swp and threshold values the threshold value was as expected according to the baseline of corell et al 2016 for most of the season only from the beginning of pit hardening until the second week of august the threshold swp was reduced down to 2 mpa irrigation scheduling applied 267 and 334 mm respectively in 2020 and 2021 table 1 during the post harvest period the threshold value was constant and equal to 1 2 mpa rainfed during the 2020 season these trees were not irrigated from june until the first week of september just before harvest when they received around 45 mm no irrigation was applied during 2021 2 2 measurements the water relations of the trees were described using the swp and midday leaf conductance swp was determined in one leaf per plot leaves near the main trunk were covered with aluminum foil two hours before the measurement which was made using the pressure chamber technique at midday pms 1000 usa the abaxial leaf conductance was measured with a porometer sc 1 decagon devices usa in a fully expanded sunlit leaf per plot both the swp and leaf conductance were measured in the same tree every 7 10 days canopy temperature tc was measured by thermal imaging per plot at the same time that the swp and leaf conductance these measurements were obtained using a low cost thermal camera flir one flir system usa which was attached to a tablet and the image included three trees the swp and leaf conductance were measured in the central one this camera used a thermal sensor 8 14 µm 80 60 pixels and a digital sensor 1440 1080 pixels and had the capability to overlap two images a false colored one with a digital image the error margin was 5 of the difference between ambient and scene temperature http www flir es flirone ios android according to costa et al 2013 matt emissivity was used ε 0 95 and each pixel corresponded to an actual temperature reading the imaging was obtained at a distance of approximately 2 m from the trees and in the sunlit side at around 11 00 a m gmt images were analyzed with the software flir tools by android each image included 3 4 sunlit areas with only leaves and the tc was the average temperature of these zones the crop water stress index cwsi was calculated empirically according to the expression of idso et al 1981 1 cwsi t t ll t ul t ll where δt is the difference between tc and the air temperature ta δtll is the difference between the canopy temperature and the air temperature in the lower limit canopy transpiring at potential rate for a given vapor pressure deficit vpd and was estimated with a non water stress baseline nwsb δtul is the maximum expected difference between the canopy temperature and the air temperature which correspond to a non transpiring canopy this was assumed constant and equal to 5ºc ben gal et al 2009 the cwsi was estimated using different approaches to evaluate the influence of climatic data measurements and nwsb regarding climatic data two different sources of data were used for ta and relative humidity on one hand these data were obtained from daily records of the weather station la puebla of the andalusian weather network maximum daily air temperature and minimum daily relative humidity siar 2022 this data source hereinafter the station simplifies the estimation process in commercial orchards on the other hand data were obtained using a thermo hygrometer tfa 31 1028 dewpoint pro tfa germany hereinafter the thermohygro located at the orchard when the measurement was made to obtein an instant measurement of these variables regarding the estimation of the nwsb two different approaches were used both according to egea et al 2017 the nwbs is a linear function of vpd that changes in olive trees depending on the time when measurements were made and seasonal time point egea et al 2017 the first approach considered just one time point per day and the general equation estimated by egea et al 2017 for 11 00 gmt was used for the whole season hereinafter daily the second approach considered the time but also the seasonal time point hereinafter seasonal then three different equations were used i until the end of july ii during august iii from september all of them for 11 00 gmt egea et al 2017 2 3 statistical analysis the data were analysed by means of the one way anova and the statistix program sx 8 0 analytical sofware usa data normality was tested using a shapiro wilk test differences in anova were considered significant when the p level 0 05 in both tests the number of samples measured is indicated in the text and figures a linear regression analysis was carried out to explore the relationships between the estimation of cwsi using the different approaches the accuracy of the regressions was described with the residual mean square standard deviation and mean absolute error of each fit differences between regressions and 1 1 line were determined using a t test of the slope and y intercept 3 results different comparisons of the cwsi estimation were obtained using the equations for the nwsb and climatic data when calculating the vpd fig 3 in all relationships considered there were significant fits between the seasonal and daily approach fig 3a table 2 these fits changed significantly according to the season or climatic data source used station or thermohygro however all of them were very similar particularly when the same season is considered table 2 fig 3a when data pool for both seasons were used the total equation suggested that the differences between both approaches seasonal and daily were small table 2 fig 3a the cwsi estimated with a seasonal approach was around 6 greater than those values estimated with the daily approach table 2 on the other hand the cwsi varied more when using the same approach and comparing climatic data sources fig 3b table 2 for both seasons the relationship between the cwsi estimated with different climatic data sources were close to 1 1 fig 3b but th values were significantly different the best fit of the 2020 season tended to be slightly higher than the 1 1 line fig 3b and table 3 this means that for that season the cwsi values estimated using climatic station data were greater than those with based on thermohygro data in 2021 the fit was weaker than in 2020 table 3 and the cwsi estimated with thermohygro data tended to be greater than those based on station data fig 3b table 3 the pattern of cwsi and swp throughout the 2020 season presented significant differences between control and rainfed treatments on most dates fig 4 the cwsi was estimated only with the daily approach using climatic data from the station fig 4a and thermohygro fig 4c most values of the cwsi were in the expected range between 0 and 1 for both climatic data sources only on the last date of measurements for both and on doy 246 only in thermohygro the cwsi was lower than 0 5 the pattern for both cwsi estimations were very similar with a cycle of peaks and falls on the same dates and with the same significant differences between treatments fig 4a and c on five dates values in both cwsis were significantly greater in rainfed than in control but only on the last two it was significantly greater than in rdi the first period of increase and decrease of the cwsi was between doy 177 and 211 in this cycle all treatments presented a similar pattern although rdi and control tended to a lower cwsi than rainfed and this was more significant on doy 183 191 and 211 fig 4a and c the pattern of swp during the same period was very different from the cwsi fig 4b the rainfed swp decreased sharply under severe water stress conditions around 4 mpa while control and rdi were greater than 2 mpa fig 4b in this period rainfed presented the lowest swp values which were coincident with the maximum cwsi however differences in swp between rdi and rainfed were greater than in cwsi which were almost equal from doy 211 rainfed presented again a cycle of increase and decrease in cwsi but this was not observed in control and rdi fig 4 and c this cycle was not identified in the swp data in rainfed as they were almost constant at around 4 mpa until recovery on doy 246 fig 4b on this latter date cwsi was equal to rdi and from here on all treatments showed similar great increases and decreases in cwsi which again were not measured in the swp data the period of measurements was longer during 2021 than in 2020 and then the water status was more variable fig 5 the pattern of cwsi was similar in the two estimations although the cwsi measured with thermohygro tended to greater values than the station estimation fig 5a and c such differences were very important on doy 134 141 176 237 and 246 and occurred in all treatments in both cwsi estimations statistical differences were found on the same date and there were also anomalous values lower than 0 5 doy 134 and 141 until doy 154 the cwsi was low but with significant differences between rainfed and control during this period the water stress was moderate with a swp more positive than 2 mpa from doy 154 the swp decreased sharply in rainfed until reaching a very severe water stress around 5 mpa and slightly in rdi until a reaching moderate water stress around 2 5 mpa between doy 154 and 224 the cwsi in rainfed was greater significantly so on most dates than control but with a decrease between doy 176 and 197 when it reached values around 0 on those latter dates the swp was significantly more negative in rainfed than in the other two treatments the cwsi in rdi and control were very similar from doy 154 to 224 approaching 0 only on doy 204 the cwsi was significantly greater in rdi than in control for both estimations these differences were clearer in the swp than cwsi with significant data from doy 211 to 224 from doy 224 rdi was rehydrated while rainfed was still under severe water stress conditions during this period the cwsi was almost equal for control and rdi and rainfed was significantly greater however these patterns were clearer in the cwsi based on thermohygro data than station data the swp presented also significant differences between rainfed and the other two treatments the pattern of swp in rdi suggested a progressive recovery which was not identified in the cwsi measurements leaf conductance was also significantly affected in both seasons fig 6 during the 2020 season rainfed and control were significantly different from doy 204 246 on 6 dates fig 6a rdi values were in between those two treatments and only on doy 204 it was much lower than control from doy 253 rainfed presented similar values to control and rdi the pattern of leaf conductance until doy 211 was similar to the one shown by the cwsi during the same period figs 4 and 6 the greatest differences in leaf conductance between rainfed and the rest of treatments during the period from doy 232 246 were also coincident with the greatest differences in cwsi in the 2021 season rainfed and control were significantly different on more dates than in the previous season again rdi showed intermediate values and only much lower than control on doy 211 and 224 the last date of measurements presented the minimum value of leaf conductance throughout the season and was coincident with a great decrease of cwsi in all treatments swp and cwsi data included in figs 4 and 5 presented a significant relationship based on station and thermohygro data fig 7 no significant relationship or a very weak one was obtained with leaf conductance data data not shown fig 7 presents all data for both figures but some were not considered for the estimation of the regression equation data omitted were the anomalous negative values lower than 0 5 in cwsi and data in which cwsi was lower than expected these latter values were coincident with a great variability of swp in the rainfed treatments the best fit changed depending on the data source when station data were used for estimating cwsi fig 7a the best relationship was linear although a parabolic equation had the same determination coefficient r2 0 39 conversely the best fit was parabolic when a regression was prepared with cwsi data from the thermohygro estimation fig 7b r2 0 50 parabolic vs 0 27 linear in addition estimation based on thermohygro data fig 7b was better than station fit fig 7a with lower mse standard deviation and high r2 4 discussion irrigation scheduling in commercial conditions requires indicators that can be obtained without a reference and provide an easy and early way to detect water stress the cwsi estimation was considerably affected by the equations used to calculate the nwsb and by the climatic data source fig 3 the variability due to the former was lower than that caused by the latter the current work estimated that the impact of the date was small around 6 of deviation table 2 and that it was possible to use only the impact of the time of the day on the irrigation scheduling for commercial orchards egea et al 2017 suggested that nwsb values in olive trees are affected by the time of the day and the date in the season noguera et al 2020 reported different relationships between swp and cwsi according to the time of measurements however garcía tejero et al 2017 using the same orchard and treatments that the latter work concluded that it is possible to measure the water status considering only the time of the day for herbaceous crops the influence of the season is not typically reported and the impact of the time is reduced to two time points the beginning and the end of the day kirkham 2005 different climatic data sources station or thermohygro clearly affected the cwsi values fig 3 table 3 but these always presented a very similar seasonal pattern figs 4 and 5 both cwsi estimations station and thermohygro did not affect the identification or differentiation of the water stress between treatments moreover the most anomalous values obtained in the current work doy 274 fig 4 and doy 134 fig 5 were present in both data sources therefore other climatic factors could be involved most data were obtained on clear days figs 1 and 2 and only the cwsi on doy 274 during the 2020 season showed very low values fig 4a and c and could be associated with a limited radiation fig 1b which is typically identified as a limitation of this measurement agam et al 2013 jackson et al 1988 the most negative cwsi was estimated on doy 134 during the 2021 season fig 5a and c and this date was a clear day fig 2b there were two days of rain doy 129 5 1 mm and 130 2 5 mm fig 2a before this which could have affected the canopy temperature measurements the radiation limitation on doy 274 affected also the leaf conductance measurement fig 6a but not the decrease on doy 134 included in fig 5 fig 6b although both dates presented an unexpected cwsi value they reflect the water status of the trees cwsi values in the 2020 season fig 4 almost equal to the swp data fig 4b and more negative cwsi values figure5 and therefore less stress in the 2021 season in control and rdi treatments than in rainfed fig 5b the literature shows that cwsi values in olive trees are typically between 0 and 1 but negative values have also been reported egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 although not as negative as the anomalous data found in the current work the comparison of cwsi values obtained in the same orchard in the works of egea et al 2017 and garcía tejero et al 2017 suggests that measurements at ground level garcía tejero et al 2017 could present more anomalous negative values than measurements taken at the vertical view of the trees egea et al 2017 the identification of water stress using control values as reference data was successful on most dates in rainfed but not in rdi figs 4 and 5 the differences between control and rdi were small figs 4 and 5 although the rdi data for all indicators made it an intermediate treatment from a statistical point of view the differences with control in swp were clear on most dates for both seasons figs 4 and 5 those results could limit its use in irrigation scheduling under commercial conditions when no references are available the lack of differences was not completely related to the climatic data source because the pattern for both estimations was very similar during both seasons however swp vs cwsi relationship was better using thermohygro data than station data fig 7 which suggests that the former is better for estimating cwsi than the latter berni et al 2009 suggested that the cwsi estimation in olive trees is very sensitive to the measurement of canopy and air temperature most of cwsi patterns in the current work were near those for leaf conductance particularly at the beginning figs 4 and 5 vs 6 although a significant relationship was not found however they were found with cwsi with quadratic adjustment in olive trees the relationship between the cwsi and the leaf conductance has been reported to be stronger than with the swp ben gal et al 2009 berni et al 2009 egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 most of the works in the literature suggest a linear relationship between the swp and cwsi ben gal et al 2009 berni et al 2009 garcía tejero et al 2017 noguera et al 2020 and only egea et al 2017 reported a curvilinear equation this latter work suggested that the cwsi was very variable between 0 and 0 3 in the range of 1 to 2 mpa of swp which are similar values to those showed in this work figs 4 5 and 7 that confirms the limitations to identify moderate water stress with the current methodology moriana and fereres 2002 reported that gas exchange was less sensitive to the drought cycle than the swp in young olive orchards garcía tejero et al 2017 suggested that a cwsi around 0 2 or 0 5 depending on the measured zone of the trees could be used to identify moderate water stress conditions swp 3 mpa leaf conductance 100 mmol m 2s 1 garcía tejero et al 2017 conversely berni et al 2019 reported values of cwsi around 0 5 with a leaf water potential of around 1 mpa the current data would confirm a cwsi threshold of around 0 2 garcía tejero et al 2017 as the beginning of the stomata closure process and early severe water stress level in other species the cwsi threshold value suggested was around 0 3 for vineyards bellvert et al 2015 smart irrigation will likely include different sources of information to optimize results the lack of differences between rdi and control treatments figs 4 and 5 could be associated to the variability between plots and sensibility of the low cost thermal camera swp presented also a high standard deviation in rdi figs 4 and 5 and the variability between plots could be more important smigaj et al 2017 reported that mild water stress could not be identified due to the lack of accuracy of the methodology used however other works with low cost methodologies considered that accuracy was not limited and climatic conditions were more important noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 ramírez cuesta et al 2022 the current methods could be useful in combination with others such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi determinations caruso et al 2022 reported that yield response to deficit irrigation strategies were partially explained with ndvi measurements that allowed classifying soil conditions data of cwsi and ndvi would enhance the capacity of managing water stress conditions when comparing current data with those in the literature in order to provide information about future thresholds or rdi management it is necessary to consider the orchard s age tree development could be a limitation for two reasons water relations of young trees and identification of leaves in the thermal images in young orchard a low fruit load strongly affected water relations martin vertedor et al 2011 and reduced the differences in water potential pérez lópez et al 2007 these could hinder identifying water stress under such conditions but not the differences between treatments in addition comparison with other works suggested that age of the orchard was not limiting and egea s equation was suitable and cwsi comparable on the other hand measurements in small sized trees could increase the error margin because of the small surface for the image in the current methodology pixel was selected manually and the software provided tools to compare thermal and real images the error source was reduced under these conditions it would also be possible to use the approach suggested by egea et al 2017 to separate vegetation pixels from others 5 conclusions identification of water stress in olive orchards was possible with a low cost simplified methodology the cwsi estimated with a published nwsb which considered only the time of measurements and not the influence of the season would allow for a successful monitoring of the water status although estimations using two different sources of climatic data presented a similar cwsi data from the thermohygro showed a robust relationship with swp therefore these data could improve the irrigation decision more than the ones obtained from a nearby station the methodology could be strongly affected by the radiation constraints at the moment of the measurement and in previous rainfall days an increase of the cwsi from 0 2 will be associated with an early severe swp and the beginning of stomata closure

9499,the canopy temperature is a promising methodology for deficit irrigation scheduling this measurement is used to calculate the crop water stress index cwsi which needs the estimation of non water stress baseline nwsb in olive orchards nwsb changed at different times of the day and throughout the season the aim of this work was to evaluate a simplified methodology for estimating nwsb to allow reducing costs and facilitate the cwsi estimation the experiment was performed during two consecutive seasons 2020 and 2021 in a young super intensive density olive orchard olea europaea l cv manzanillo three irrigation treatments were evaluated in a completely randomized design with 6 repetitions control full irrigated regulated deficit irrigation rdi with a period of water stress during pit hardening and rainfed the midday stem water potential and leaf conductance were measured every week during the irrigation season the canopy temperature was measured with a low cost thermal camera attached to a tablet the cwsi was estimated for the same trees used to measure the midday stem water potential and leaf conductance the nwsb was calculated in different ways considering several simplifications firstly nwbs was obtained using previously published equations one or several equations throughout the season secondly climate data were measured in the orchard together with the canopy temperature or using daily values from a weather station nearby cwsi estimations using different equations were closely related r2 0 95 mse 0 008 and one fit was considered successful although the differences in the values from different sources was considerable and significant the cwsi estimation did not present major variations and the use of data from the weather station could be assumed in commercial orchards the cwsi successfully identified water stress in rainfed conditions mainly when the stomata closure was detected however the differentiation between control and rdi was limited keywords nwsb regulated deficit irrigation table olive water potential water relations 1 introduction the water available for agricultural use is decreasing around the world climatic change is causing a reduction of rains and an increase of temperature that in turn raise the water needs and impact reservoirs in addition other social uses also compete for the use of this resource this means that irrigation scheduling should improve the approach taken when a decision is needed and facilitate the adaptation to deficit irrigation conditions regulated deficit irrigation rdi scheduling is typically applied to different crops steduto et al 2012 this approach suggests creating a water stress period whose final effect on yield is small or non existent chalmers and wilson 1978 managing water stress requires tools that provide accurate information about water status but also frequent data to support irrigation decision based on thresholds olive trees olea europaea l are a good example of this this specie is considered one of the most drought resistant cultivated ones with a low reduction in yield after very severe water stress conditions e g ahumada orellana et al 2017 but with extremely sensitive phenological stages such as flowering and fruit set which strongly reduce fruit yield moriana et al 2003 gucci et al 2019 baselines of the different indicators would provide an effective tool as reference for managing irrigation throughout the season e g shackel et al 2021 with water potential but first an experimental effort is needed to publish data as a first step to define baseline and threshold values for different indicators the canopy temperature has been used as a water stress indicator from the 70 s of the last century idso et al 1977 the initial concept of the stress degree day was improved with the inclusion of other factors such as vapor pressure deficit vpd which was finally incorporated into the definition of the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 in recent years this indicator has become very popular because it offers the possibility to obtain remote sensed imagery and apply large scale monitoring using airborne systems berni et al 2009 egea et al 2017 the calculation of cwsi can be done in different ways but the most frequent one due to its simplicity is the empirical cwsi idso et al 1981 cwsi t t ll t ul t ll in eq 1 all δts are the differences between canopy temperatures under different conditions and air temperatures cwsi is the ratio of two differences the first one is the temperature difference between field conditions δt and non water stress conditions lower level δtll the second one is the difference between non transpiring conditions upper level δtul and non water stress conditions lower level δtll both differences δtup and δtll changed with the vpd idso et al 1981 but the first one δtup is typically considered a constant value although cwsi varied between 0 and 1 for all species the relationship between vpd and all δts was different for different species kirkham 2005 olive is a very drought resistant species díaz espejo et al 2018 and very severe water stress levels cause a significant but low reduction in yield ahumada orellana et al 2017 ben gal et al 2021 there are several works about this fruit tree indicating that cwsi could be a water stress indicator when empirical o analytical approaches in different production systems are used intensive ben gal et al 2009 berni et al 2009 super intensive egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 among the eq 1 components δtup is considered a constant value which could change with the vpd kirkham 2005 but in olive trees 5ºc is considered adequate ben gal et al 2009 conversely δtll is based on a relationship between δt and vpd under full irrigated conditions non water stress baseline nwsb in super intensive mature olive orchards egea et al 2017 reported that the nwsb changed depending on the time of the day and throughout the season and suggested three distinctive periods from june to september the main advantage of cwsi is that it offers the possibility of applying remote monitoring to large orchards cwsi has been used in different fruits trees to determine water stress conditions orange garcía tejero et al 2011 peach bellvert et al 2016 almond gonzalez dugo et al 2020 or to calculate crop evapotranspiration almond gonzalez dugo et al 2020 however the frequency of these measurements could be limited by costs this problem is usually associated to the weight smigaj et al 2017 matinez et al 2017 and the cost of the device matinez et al 2017 noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 used in unmanned aerial vehicles uav different low cost devices have been successfully tested in herbaceous matinez et al 2017 and fruit garcía tejero et al 2018 noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 ramírez cuesta et al 2022 crops as well as forest species smigaj et al 2017 one constrain of these low cost methodologies is related to the low resolution which could limit identification of mild water stress smigaj et al 2017 some of these low cost devices were tested in ground measurements garcía tejero et al 2018 noguera et al 2020 that could be affected by the variability of temperature in the upper or lower part of the canopy ramírez cuesta et al 2022 noguera et al 2020 using a low cost device for olive orchards concluded that although the system worked further works would be needed to test different environmental and water status conditions this mainly refers to the estimation of nwsb which would affect to cwsi determinations egea et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2022 the aim of this work was to evaluate a simplified methodology to estimate nwsb in a young super intensive density olive orchard using a low cost device for a wide range of water statuses this simplified approach would verify the nwsb estimations by egea et al 2017 and the use of different sources of climate data in the estimation of the cwsi two consecutive seasons with three different irrigation systems control rdi and rainfed would allow evaluating a wide range of water statuses the low cost device was a commercial thermal camera attached to tablet as in garcia tejero et al 2018 and the data will be compared with water potential measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 site and treatment description the experiment was carried out in an olive orchard in la hampa an experimental farm of the instituto de recursos naturales y agrobología irnas csic in coria del rio near seville spain 37º 17 n 6º 3 w 30 m altitude during the 2020 and 2021 seasons this orchard was 2 years old at the beginning of the experiment and the first yield occurred in 2020 and was around 800 kg ha 1 the trees olea europaea l cv manzanillo were planted in a super intensive system 4 1 5 m apart 1667 tree ha 1 and were trained in a central leader system the soil was a sandy loam with more than 1 m depth climatic data were obtained from the andalusian weather network station la puebla siar 2022 about 7 km away from the experimental plot the climatic conditions of the location are typically mediterranean the potential evapotranspiration eto and rainfall in both years presented the typical seasonal pattern figs 1 and 2 eto was greater than 5 mm day 1 during most of the experimental period in both seasons and more common in 2021 than in 2020 rainfall occurred from mid autumn until early spring with a dry summer in both seasons the volume of rain was low particularly during 2021 492 mm in 2020 and 357 mm in 2021 compared to the average of the zone 539 mm aemet 2022 rains during the experimental period in both years were almost null most of the days when measurements were carried out the weather was clear without radiation constrains figs 1b and 2b only on day of the year doy 274 in 2021 fig 2b there was a clear reduction of radiation at midday the irrigation system consisted of a single line of emitters 2 2 l h 1 which were spaced 0 5 m the water applied was measured with a water meter in each replication and monitored weekly during the irrigation season three irrigation treatments were applied using a completed randomized design with 6 repetitions plot from 2nd of june in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic the irrigation season started before that date and all trees were irrigated with the same amount of water 56 mm until the beginning of june each plot had 5 lines of 13 trees each and the 3 central lines were used as measurement points irrigation scheduling considered four phenological phases a before pit hardening b pit hardening until the last week of august c rehydration period until harvest and d post harvest the beginning of pit hardening was determined by the variation in longitudinal growth of the fruits rapoport et al 2013 the irrigation treatments were control the objective of this treatment was to maximize vegetative growth water application was scheduled based on midday stem water potential swp measurements irrigation was the traditional estimation of fao 66 crop coefficients kc 0 55 reduction coefficient kr 0 7 but the water applied was increased when swp values were lower than 1 mpa until 175 crop evapotranspiration etc the seasonal water applied reached 553 and 772 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 1 regulated deficit irrigation rdi the objective of this treatment was to achieve a mild or moderate water stress throughout the season trees were irrigated with 1 mm per day in all the irrigation season this water applied was increased by 1 2 or 3 mm according to the difference between the measured swp and threshold values the threshold value was as expected according to the baseline of corell et al 2016 for most of the season only from the beginning of pit hardening until the second week of august the threshold swp was reduced down to 2 mpa irrigation scheduling applied 267 and 334 mm respectively in 2020 and 2021 table 1 during the post harvest period the threshold value was constant and equal to 1 2 mpa rainfed during the 2020 season these trees were not irrigated from june until the first week of september just before harvest when they received around 45 mm no irrigation was applied during 2021 2 2 measurements the water relations of the trees were described using the swp and midday leaf conductance swp was determined in one leaf per plot leaves near the main trunk were covered with aluminum foil two hours before the measurement which was made using the pressure chamber technique at midday pms 1000 usa the abaxial leaf conductance was measured with a porometer sc 1 decagon devices usa in a fully expanded sunlit leaf per plot both the swp and leaf conductance were measured in the same tree every 7 10 days canopy temperature tc was measured by thermal imaging per plot at the same time that the swp and leaf conductance these measurements were obtained using a low cost thermal camera flir one flir system usa which was attached to a tablet and the image included three trees the swp and leaf conductance were measured in the central one this camera used a thermal sensor 8 14 µm 80 60 pixels and a digital sensor 1440 1080 pixels and had the capability to overlap two images a false colored one with a digital image the error margin was 5 of the difference between ambient and scene temperature http www flir es flirone ios android according to costa et al 2013 matt emissivity was used ε 0 95 and each pixel corresponded to an actual temperature reading the imaging was obtained at a distance of approximately 2 m from the trees and in the sunlit side at around 11 00 a m gmt images were analyzed with the software flir tools by android each image included 3 4 sunlit areas with only leaves and the tc was the average temperature of these zones the crop water stress index cwsi was calculated empirically according to the expression of idso et al 1981 1 cwsi t t ll t ul t ll where δt is the difference between tc and the air temperature ta δtll is the difference between the canopy temperature and the air temperature in the lower limit canopy transpiring at potential rate for a given vapor pressure deficit vpd and was estimated with a non water stress baseline nwsb δtul is the maximum expected difference between the canopy temperature and the air temperature which correspond to a non transpiring canopy this was assumed constant and equal to 5ºc ben gal et al 2009 the cwsi was estimated using different approaches to evaluate the influence of climatic data measurements and nwsb regarding climatic data two different sources of data were used for ta and relative humidity on one hand these data were obtained from daily records of the weather station la puebla of the andalusian weather network maximum daily air temperature and minimum daily relative humidity siar 2022 this data source hereinafter the station simplifies the estimation process in commercial orchards on the other hand data were obtained using a thermo hygrometer tfa 31 1028 dewpoint pro tfa germany hereinafter the thermohygro located at the orchard when the measurement was made to obtein an instant measurement of these variables regarding the estimation of the nwsb two different approaches were used both according to egea et al 2017 the nwbs is a linear function of vpd that changes in olive trees depending on the time when measurements were made and seasonal time point egea et al 2017 the first approach considered just one time point per day and the general equation estimated by egea et al 2017 for 11 00 gmt was used for the whole season hereinafter daily the second approach considered the time but also the seasonal time point hereinafter seasonal then three different equations were used i until the end of july ii during august iii from september all of them for 11 00 gmt egea et al 2017 2 3 statistical analysis the data were analysed by means of the one way anova and the statistix program sx 8 0 analytical sofware usa data normality was tested using a shapiro wilk test differences in anova were considered significant when the p level 0 05 in both tests the number of samples measured is indicated in the text and figures a linear regression analysis was carried out to explore the relationships between the estimation of cwsi using the different approaches the accuracy of the regressions was described with the residual mean square standard deviation and mean absolute error of each fit differences between regressions and 1 1 line were determined using a t test of the slope and y intercept 3 results different comparisons of the cwsi estimation were obtained using the equations for the nwsb and climatic data when calculating the vpd fig 3 in all relationships considered there were significant fits between the seasonal and daily approach fig 3a table 2 these fits changed significantly according to the season or climatic data source used station or thermohygro however all of them were very similar particularly when the same season is considered table 2 fig 3a when data pool for both seasons were used the total equation suggested that the differences between both approaches seasonal and daily were small table 2 fig 3a the cwsi estimated with a seasonal approach was around 6 greater than those values estimated with the daily approach table 2 on the other hand the cwsi varied more when using the same approach and comparing climatic data sources fig 3b table 2 for both seasons the relationship between the cwsi estimated with different climatic data sources were close to 1 1 fig 3b but th values were significantly different the best fit of the 2020 season tended to be slightly higher than the 1 1 line fig 3b and table 3 this means that for that season the cwsi values estimated using climatic station data were greater than those with based on thermohygro data in 2021 the fit was weaker than in 2020 table 3 and the cwsi estimated with thermohygro data tended to be greater than those based on station data fig 3b table 3 the pattern of cwsi and swp throughout the 2020 season presented significant differences between control and rainfed treatments on most dates fig 4 the cwsi was estimated only with the daily approach using climatic data from the station fig 4a and thermohygro fig 4c most values of the cwsi were in the expected range between 0 and 1 for both climatic data sources only on the last date of measurements for both and on doy 246 only in thermohygro the cwsi was lower than 0 5 the pattern for both cwsi estimations were very similar with a cycle of peaks and falls on the same dates and with the same significant differences between treatments fig 4a and c on five dates values in both cwsis were significantly greater in rainfed than in control but only on the last two it was significantly greater than in rdi the first period of increase and decrease of the cwsi was between doy 177 and 211 in this cycle all treatments presented a similar pattern although rdi and control tended to a lower cwsi than rainfed and this was more significant on doy 183 191 and 211 fig 4a and c the pattern of swp during the same period was very different from the cwsi fig 4b the rainfed swp decreased sharply under severe water stress conditions around 4 mpa while control and rdi were greater than 2 mpa fig 4b in this period rainfed presented the lowest swp values which were coincident with the maximum cwsi however differences in swp between rdi and rainfed were greater than in cwsi which were almost equal from doy 211 rainfed presented again a cycle of increase and decrease in cwsi but this was not observed in control and rdi fig 4 and c this cycle was not identified in the swp data in rainfed as they were almost constant at around 4 mpa until recovery on doy 246 fig 4b on this latter date cwsi was equal to rdi and from here on all treatments showed similar great increases and decreases in cwsi which again were not measured in the swp data the period of measurements was longer during 2021 than in 2020 and then the water status was more variable fig 5 the pattern of cwsi was similar in the two estimations although the cwsi measured with thermohygro tended to greater values than the station estimation fig 5a and c such differences were very important on doy 134 141 176 237 and 246 and occurred in all treatments in both cwsi estimations statistical differences were found on the same date and there were also anomalous values lower than 0 5 doy 134 and 141 until doy 154 the cwsi was low but with significant differences between rainfed and control during this period the water stress was moderate with a swp more positive than 2 mpa from doy 154 the swp decreased sharply in rainfed until reaching a very severe water stress around 5 mpa and slightly in rdi until a reaching moderate water stress around 2 5 mpa between doy 154 and 224 the cwsi in rainfed was greater significantly so on most dates than control but with a decrease between doy 176 and 197 when it reached values around 0 on those latter dates the swp was significantly more negative in rainfed than in the other two treatments the cwsi in rdi and control were very similar from doy 154 to 224 approaching 0 only on doy 204 the cwsi was significantly greater in rdi than in control for both estimations these differences were clearer in the swp than cwsi with significant data from doy 211 to 224 from doy 224 rdi was rehydrated while rainfed was still under severe water stress conditions during this period the cwsi was almost equal for control and rdi and rainfed was significantly greater however these patterns were clearer in the cwsi based on thermohygro data than station data the swp presented also significant differences between rainfed and the other two treatments the pattern of swp in rdi suggested a progressive recovery which was not identified in the cwsi measurements leaf conductance was also significantly affected in both seasons fig 6 during the 2020 season rainfed and control were significantly different from doy 204 246 on 6 dates fig 6a rdi values were in between those two treatments and only on doy 204 it was much lower than control from doy 253 rainfed presented similar values to control and rdi the pattern of leaf conductance until doy 211 was similar to the one shown by the cwsi during the same period figs 4 and 6 the greatest differences in leaf conductance between rainfed and the rest of treatments during the period from doy 232 246 were also coincident with the greatest differences in cwsi in the 2021 season rainfed and control were significantly different on more dates than in the previous season again rdi showed intermediate values and only much lower than control on doy 211 and 224 the last date of measurements presented the minimum value of leaf conductance throughout the season and was coincident with a great decrease of cwsi in all treatments swp and cwsi data included in figs 4 and 5 presented a significant relationship based on station and thermohygro data fig 7 no significant relationship or a very weak one was obtained with leaf conductance data data not shown fig 7 presents all data for both figures but some were not considered for the estimation of the regression equation data omitted were the anomalous negative values lower than 0 5 in cwsi and data in which cwsi was lower than expected these latter values were coincident with a great variability of swp in the rainfed treatments the best fit changed depending on the data source when station data were used for estimating cwsi fig 7a the best relationship was linear although a parabolic equation had the same determination coefficient r2 0 39 conversely the best fit was parabolic when a regression was prepared with cwsi data from the thermohygro estimation fig 7b r2 0 50 parabolic vs 0 27 linear in addition estimation based on thermohygro data fig 7b was better than station fit fig 7a with lower mse standard deviation and high r2 4 discussion irrigation scheduling in commercial conditions requires indicators that can be obtained without a reference and provide an easy and early way to detect water stress the cwsi estimation was considerably affected by the equations used to calculate the nwsb and by the climatic data source fig 3 the variability due to the former was lower than that caused by the latter the current work estimated that the impact of the date was small around 6 of deviation table 2 and that it was possible to use only the impact of the time of the day on the irrigation scheduling for commercial orchards egea et al 2017 suggested that nwsb values in olive trees are affected by the time of the day and the date in the season noguera et al 2020 reported different relationships between swp and cwsi according to the time of measurements however garcía tejero et al 2017 using the same orchard and treatments that the latter work concluded that it is possible to measure the water status considering only the time of the day for herbaceous crops the influence of the season is not typically reported and the impact of the time is reduced to two time points the beginning and the end of the day kirkham 2005 different climatic data sources station or thermohygro clearly affected the cwsi values fig 3 table 3 but these always presented a very similar seasonal pattern figs 4 and 5 both cwsi estimations station and thermohygro did not affect the identification or differentiation of the water stress between treatments moreover the most anomalous values obtained in the current work doy 274 fig 4 and doy 134 fig 5 were present in both data sources therefore other climatic factors could be involved most data were obtained on clear days figs 1 and 2 and only the cwsi on doy 274 during the 2020 season showed very low values fig 4a and c and could be associated with a limited radiation fig 1b which is typically identified as a limitation of this measurement agam et al 2013 jackson et al 1988 the most negative cwsi was estimated on doy 134 during the 2021 season fig 5a and c and this date was a clear day fig 2b there were two days of rain doy 129 5 1 mm and 130 2 5 mm fig 2a before this which could have affected the canopy temperature measurements the radiation limitation on doy 274 affected also the leaf conductance measurement fig 6a but not the decrease on doy 134 included in fig 5 fig 6b although both dates presented an unexpected cwsi value they reflect the water status of the trees cwsi values in the 2020 season fig 4 almost equal to the swp data fig 4b and more negative cwsi values figure5 and therefore less stress in the 2021 season in control and rdi treatments than in rainfed fig 5b the literature shows that cwsi values in olive trees are typically between 0 and 1 but negative values have also been reported egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 although not as negative as the anomalous data found in the current work the comparison of cwsi values obtained in the same orchard in the works of egea et al 2017 and garcía tejero et al 2017 suggests that measurements at ground level garcía tejero et al 2017 could present more anomalous negative values than measurements taken at the vertical view of the trees egea et al 2017 the identification of water stress using control values as reference data was successful on most dates in rainfed but not in rdi figs 4 and 5 the differences between control and rdi were small figs 4 and 5 although the rdi data for all indicators made it an intermediate treatment from a statistical point of view the differences with control in swp were clear on most dates for both seasons figs 4 and 5 those results could limit its use in irrigation scheduling under commercial conditions when no references are available the lack of differences was not completely related to the climatic data source because the pattern for both estimations was very similar during both seasons however swp vs cwsi relationship was better using thermohygro data than station data fig 7 which suggests that the former is better for estimating cwsi than the latter berni et al 2009 suggested that the cwsi estimation in olive trees is very sensitive to the measurement of canopy and air temperature most of cwsi patterns in the current work were near those for leaf conductance particularly at the beginning figs 4 and 5 vs 6 although a significant relationship was not found however they were found with cwsi with quadratic adjustment in olive trees the relationship between the cwsi and the leaf conductance has been reported to be stronger than with the swp ben gal et al 2009 berni et al 2009 egea et al 2017 garcía tejero et al 2017 most of the works in the literature suggest a linear relationship between the swp and cwsi ben gal et al 2009 berni et al 2009 garcía tejero et al 2017 noguera et al 2020 and only egea et al 2017 reported a curvilinear equation this latter work suggested that the cwsi was very variable between 0 and 0 3 in the range of 1 to 2 mpa of swp which are similar values to those showed in this work figs 4 5 and 7 that confirms the limitations to identify moderate water stress with the current methodology moriana and fereres 2002 reported that gas exchange was less sensitive to the drought cycle than the swp in young olive orchards garcía tejero et al 2017 suggested that a cwsi around 0 2 or 0 5 depending on the measured zone of the trees could be used to identify moderate water stress conditions swp 3 mpa leaf conductance 100 mmol m 2s 1 garcía tejero et al 2017 conversely berni et al 2019 reported values of cwsi around 0 5 with a leaf water potential of around 1 mpa the current data would confirm a cwsi threshold of around 0 2 garcía tejero et al 2017 as the beginning of the stomata closure process and early severe water stress level in other species the cwsi threshold value suggested was around 0 3 for vineyards bellvert et al 2015 smart irrigation will likely include different sources of information to optimize results the lack of differences between rdi and control treatments figs 4 and 5 could be associated to the variability between plots and sensibility of the low cost thermal camera swp presented also a high standard deviation in rdi figs 4 and 5 and the variability between plots could be more important smigaj et al 2017 reported that mild water stress could not be identified due to the lack of accuracy of the methodology used however other works with low cost methodologies considered that accuracy was not limited and climatic conditions were more important noguera et al 2020 giménez gallego et al 2021 ramírez cuesta et al 2022 the current methods could be useful in combination with others such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi determinations caruso et al 2022 reported that yield response to deficit irrigation strategies were partially explained with ndvi measurements that allowed classifying soil conditions data of cwsi and ndvi would enhance the capacity of managing water stress conditions when comparing current data with those in the literature in order to provide information about future thresholds or rdi management it is necessary to consider the orchard s age tree development could be a limitation for two reasons water relations of young trees and identification of leaves in the thermal images in young orchard a low fruit load strongly affected water relations martin vertedor et al 2011 and reduced the differences in water potential pérez lópez et al 2007 these could hinder identifying water stress under such conditions but not the differences between treatments in addition comparison with other works suggested that age of the orchard was not limiting and egea s equation was suitable and cwsi comparable on the other hand measurements in small sized trees could increase the error margin because of the small surface for the image in the current methodology pixel was selected manually and the software provided tools to compare thermal and real images the error source was reduced under these conditions it would also be possible to use the approach suggested by egea et al 2017 to separate vegetation pixels from others 5 conclusions identification of water stress in olive orchards was possible with a low cost simplified methodology the cwsi estimated with a published nwsb which considered only the time of measurements and not the influence of the season would allow for a successful monitoring of the water status although estimations using two different sources of climatic data presented a similar cwsi data from the thermohygro showed a robust relationship with swp therefore these data could improve the irrigation decision more than the ones obtained from a nearby station the methodology could be strongly affected by the radiation constraints at the moment of the measurement and in previous rainfall days an increase of the cwsi from 0 2 will be associated with an early severe swp and the beginning of stomata closure however moderate water stress cannot be identified and other approaches would be necessary declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal
