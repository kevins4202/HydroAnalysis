2021 moeller and görsch 2015 it has been reported that leachate exhibits between 1 8 and 1 2 times the foaming ability and stability of surfactants from the petroleum industry and its foaming problem

to be understood regarding surfactant identification on foaming and its influence mechanism deactivation and invalidity of defoamers are common in ltp and other biomass treatment plants due to a lack of directivity and pertinence lindorfer and demmig 2016 ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms has been widely applied in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of surfactants owing to its strong separation efficiency low sample demand high sensitivity and accurate quantification ability sakai et al 2016 in domestic medical and industrial wastewater uplc ms ms was used to discriminate a dozen surfactants including anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants clara et al 2007 a recent review indicates that the concentration of surfactants is between 0 16 and 4230 mg l and that their distribution is influenced by pollution sources and regional characteristics palmer and hatley 2018 however no relevant studies have been conducted to determine the identity of the surfactant in leachate so far in mass spectrometry anionic and non ionic surfactants have relatively low response values li et al 2018 laundry wastewater with high surfactant concentrations or domestic sewage with low background pollutants can be used for sensitivities and detection limits however samples with complex organic compositions and high background pollutants such as msw leachate are challenging to detect in addition the surfactant s amphiphilic structure allows it to remain in pipelines columns injection needles and other materials in uplc and ms resulting in a reduction in mass spectrum peak tailing and signal to noise ratios additionally it is generally acknowledged that surfactants play an important role in foam generation cantat et al 2013 however few studies have explored the relationship between the identification of surfactants and foaming characteristics studies have proved that even low concentrations 20 mg l of surfactant can significantly stimulate liquid foaming by comparing the foaming capacity before and after adding standard surfactants capodici et al 2015 but the influence mechanism of system surfactants on the foaming properties has not been discussed in this study we identified the key surfactant and the mechanism by which it impacts leachate foaming by investigating the correlation between surfactant composition and foaming characteristics to evaluate the foaming capacity and foam stability of msw leachate a systematic foam characterization device was developed to accommodate complex components high viscosities and frequent scaling characteristics by optimizing the uplc ms ms method qualitative and quantitative analysis of leachate surfactants and their distribution features were achieved in terms of landfill age treatment processes and geographic settings furthermore a correlation analysis between surfactants and general leachate characteristics was developed for the first time to better understand the factors influencing surfactant release the present foaming characterization of leachate and identification of surfactants offers a potential for the development of directional and selective materials and related foam control strategies 2 methods and materials 2 1 leachate sampling this study collected leachate samples from nine typical msw landfills and waste to energy plants during the winter due to the limited frequency of foaming problems in other seasons to address the impact of component variation and avoid sampling specificity the north southwest southeast and northwest regions with varying economic levels and climates were included throughout the country furthermore this study divided all leachate samples into three categories 1 fresh leachate was collected from msw waste to energy plants before any long term storage and treatment 2 mixed leachate was collected from msw landfill plants that have been operating for more than 10 years and continuously landfill fresh msw 3 aged leachate was collected from msw landfill plants that have been closed for more than 10 years it is noteworthy that there are very few intermediate landfills in china compared with intermediate landfills many have been continuously operating for more than 10 years and have continued to landfill fresh msw zhang et al 2021 leachate from each reservoir section was intensively treated after being mixed in the regulating tank therefore this mixed leachate was studied and regarded as an intermediate leachate in this study a description of the characteristics of all leachate samples is provided in table 1 treated leachate from three plants representing each category on site ltps table s1 has also been collected including mbr effluent nf effluent ro effluent nf membrane concentrate nfc and ro membrane concentrate roc all leachate samples have been filtrated with a 0 45 μm membrane and the filtered samples were stored at 4 the relevant characterization and analysis of leachate were completed within one week after sampling three groups of parallel samples were set up for all analyses 2 2 foaming characterization leachate contains organic pollutants that are more complex than traditional surfactant systems the concentration of surfactants in leachate is lower than that of standard surfactant systems the test accuracy of the simulated foaming process is limited by the traditional single glass tube method due to poor stability and uneven gas distribution fig 1 depicts a foam analysis device designed to solve the above problems and systematically determine the foaming characteristics of leachate this device has a foam pipe a gas distribution unit a gas cylinder a thermostatic system and a monitoring system which

near dry under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40 and diluted to 1 ml with methanol prior to uplc ms ms analysis samples obtained from spe were filtered using 0 22 μm organic filters qualitative and quantitative analysis of surfactants was performed on acquity uplc waters usa coupled with a xevo tqd waters united states triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry ms ms separation was achieved on

acetate and 0 5 v v formic acid in water a and methanol b the specific gradient elution conditions are listed in table s2 electrospray ionization esi source and multi reaction monitoring mrm mode were adopted in ms ms in which anionic surfactants adopted negative ion mode and cationic and non ionic surfactant adopts positive ion mode the electric spray voltage is 4500 v the atomization gas nitrogen pressure is 40 psi the ion source temperature is 500 and the collision gas is helium the corresponding mass spectrum conditions of each surfactant are shown in table s3 to further optimize the relatively low signal strength of anionic surfactants in the ms detection method the post column compensation method was applied and optimized to improve the detection limit with 30 μl min of 10 ammonium hydroxide in water fig s2 illustrates the optimization effect of the mrm spectrum with las c12 as an example before and after mobile phase optimization and post column compensation the quantitative method of the external standard curve is adopted for all surfactants the surfactant standard is configured into 9 series of standard solutions with methanol as the solvent the scatter diagram is drawn with the mass concentration of the surfactant to be measured as the abscissa and the area of the quantitative sub ion peak of the substance to be measured as the ordinate linear regression analysis was carried out to obtain the standard curve and correlation coefficient r2 the standard curves and correlation coefficients of seven surfactants including anionic surfactant cationic surfactant and non ionic surfactant are presented in table s4 the target surfactants have an excellent linear relationship within the marking range and r2 ranges from 0 9900 to 0 9999 the quantitative ion peak area of the tested leachate sample was obtained by the above uplc ms ms method and brought into the linear equation of the standard curve to obtain the corresponding mass concentration of surfactants in the leachate samples 2 6 quality control and assurance the proposed uplc ms ms method was tested for its limit of detection lod and limit of quantitation loq by adding low concentration standard surfactants to10 blank samples the standard samples were pretreated and tested according to the same method mentioned above and the signal to noise ratio s n of 7 surfactants was calculated according to the s n results the concentration corresponding to s n of 3 was taken as lod and the concentration corresponding to s n of 10 was taken as loq table s5 the recovery rate of the surfactants in the pretreatment and detection processes was tested by adding 200 μg l and 500 μg l mixed standard surfactants to the blank samples raw leachate samples and nfc samples meanwhile the same samples were tested five times to calculate the relative standard deviation rsd to verify the test s accuracy the results of spiked recovery and rsd are shown in table s6 calculating the slope of the matrix and pure solvent standard curves was used to determine the matrix effect a detailed description of the methods and results is provided in table s4 2 7 correlation analysis in order to further analyze the internal mechanism of the distribution characteristics of leachate surfactants a correlation analysis was carried out on the basic characteristics of the tested leachate and the content of surfactants all correlation analyses were completed using the correlation plot package 3 results and discussion 3 1 leachate foaming characteristics and influencing factors 3 1 1 landfill age the landfill age of leachate is an essential factor affecting its properties it significantly impacts the ph value ammonia nitrogen concentration and organic composition of leachate an evaluation of the foaming characteristics of leachate at different landfill ages can be found in figs 2 a and 2b despite the presence of more organic substances in fresh leachate its foaming capacity and stability were lower than those of mixed and aged leachate the relatively low ph value of fresh leachate 6 65 in this study is likely to be an influential factor in leachate foaming additionally aged and mixed leachate performed similarly in terms of foaming characteristics with similar ph values suggesting that ph is a more critical factor in leachate foaming than organic content in terms of foam morphology the results of the characterization did not reveal any apparent differences in landfill leachates at different ages nevertheless the average diameters of the foams derived from mixed leachate and aged leachate were relatively small and uniformly dispersed resulting in a more stable foam compared to the standard surfactant solution system fig 2c leachate foams formed a thicker liquid film primarily due to their complex organic composition and high viscosity surface characterization revealed that their aqueous system dominated surface tension fig 2d and leachate viscosity fig 2e at various landfill ages the study found the concentration of each individual surfactant in leachate was much lower than its critical micelle concentration cmc generally there was little difference in surface properties and landfill age whereas aged leachate had the lowest surface tension and organic content consistent with the evaluation results of foaming performance compared to aged leachate fresh leachate had a higher viscosity and a cod concentration that was 3 5 times that of aged leachate in addition it is essential to note that the surface tension and viscosity of the mix leachate were not in accordance with the foaming capacity and cod concentration based on several samplings the concentrations of cl and na in the mixed leachate were significantly higher than those in the fresh and aged leachate several studies have demonstrated that inorganic salts significantly affect the surface properties of aqueous systems wilson 2013 another study reported that increasing nacl concentrations can increase the surface tension of an aqueous solution and reduce its viscosity sett et al 2015 consistent with plenty of studies gallen et al 2017 li et al 2018 the above characterization results indicated that there was no linear positive correlation between cod concentration and foaming characteristics it is believed that this phenomenon is caused by the complex compositions of msw landfills as well as the significant differences in topography and climate which result in variations in surfactant release teng et al 2021 moreover regulating tanks are usually set up in landfills and waste to energy plants to treat leachate and the collected leachate comes from all reservoir areas zhang et al 2021 it is almost impossible to independently manage the continuous pollutant discharge within a distinct location thus reducing the correlation between the cod concentration and the release of foam affected surfactants 3 1 2 treatment processes an analysis of phased sampling was conducted to determine the relationship between the treatment processes and the foaming characteristics of each ltp figs 2a and 2b there was no significant difference in the foaming performance of the leachate treated with the same treatment process at different landfill ages the foaming problem in leachate was concentrated in the raw leachate and nfc with the extension of treatment processes the effluent s foaming capacity and foam stability at each stage gradually declined the foaming capacity of mbr effluent is about 1 2 to 1 3 of the raw leachate and the foam stability is only about 1 3 to 1 7 of the raw leachate the effluent from nf ro and roc did not produce stable foam the bubbles in the foam burst within 10 s after the end of aeration in nf ro and roc it indicated that the current mainstream process of leaching has a noticeable effect on the removal of surfactants affecting foaming whereas the nf process can almost intercept most surfactants the surface characterization of leachate at different treatment processes showed a similar trend with foaming characteristics raw leachate and nfc have relatively low surface tensions fig 2d in all leachate categories based on this coordinated variation surface tension appears to be the key factor affecting leachate foaming since the leachates from each category were simultaneously sampled in the same ltps the leachate composition was dominated by the treatment process rather than complex landfill components surface tension could be a significant reference index for foaming characteristics and surfactant concentration surfactants can reduce the surface tension and promote the production of foam in the same solution system as a consequence variations in the foaming performance through treatment processes were probably due to the change in surfactant concentration caused by the removal and interception of the treatment process similarly although there were differences in the range of variations as shown in fig 2e the viscosity of leachate at different landfill ages decreases significantly with the extension of the treatment process from raw leachate to ro effluent the raw leachate exhibited the highest viscosity and the nf and ro concentrates generally indicated higher viscosities than the previous process effluents i e mbr effluent and nf effluent the leachate is a typical newtonian fluid in which the organic molecules form a strong hydrogen bond network with the water molecules increasing its viscosity wilson 2013 a recent study has shown that the solution viscosity can be slightly enhanced as the concentration of solute increases feng et al 2018 compared with leachate sampled from different landfill ages the treated leachate of the same landfill age shown in fig 2 was taken from the same ltp therefore the reduction of effluent viscosity might be related to the removal of total organic concentration generally for a newtonian fluid the increase in viscosity within a certain range leads to the strength of foam stability through a steady liquid film cantat et al 2013 based on the results between viscosity and foaming performance it was found that leachate viscosity was positively correlated with foam stability however it was not the only determining factor 3 1 3 ph value based on the results of the foaming characterization of different landfill ages it appears that ph is an essential indicator of foaming in leachate furthermore the response to the ph value is an indispensable criterion for the type of surfactants ionic surfactants can be divided into anionic surfactants and cationic surfactants according to their hydrophilic functional groups based on acid dissociation constant pk a characteristics hydrophilic functional groups hydrolyze and ionize at different ph values change the solubility of surfactants and then affect their arrangement on the surface of the solution resulting in variations in the surface properties of the solution some non ionic surfactants are less affected by ph values while the intermolecular hydrogen bond influences others the foaming characteristics of leachate under different ph values are investigated and shown in fig 3 with the continuous increase in ph value the foaming capacity of leachate at all landfill ages was significantly improved fig 3a the highest foaming capacity of fresh and aged leachate was achieved when the ph value was 9 in contrast ph 11 was a benefit for mixed leachate at which the foaming capacity of aged and fresh leachate slightly decreased the trend of increasing foam stability fig 3b followed by a slight decline was evident in all categories in an alkaline ph condition the foaming capacity and foam stability of the leachate were significantly improved indicating that leachate foaming is conducive to an alkaline ph condition the study suggests that maintaining the acid ph value of leachate at ltps may be a feasible method to minimize the impacts of foaming problems on treatment the surface tension of leachate showed an increasing trend with the increase in ph value while the highest viscosity was also reached in alkaline ph conditions fig 3f it is worth noting that this growing tendency is generally consistent with foaming performance 3 1 4 temperature in this study treatment temperatures were evaluated at 4 levels including 20 c as a normal condition 40 c as a high temperature in summer and 60 c and 80 c as evaporation processes fig 3c illustrates the significant increase in the foaming capacity of leachate due to increasing system temperature reaching 1 6 at 80 c leachate foam and liquid stabilization decreased significantly with increasing system temperature fig 3d suggesting that surfactant stability in leachate was compromised at 80 c as proved by viscosity in fig 3h based on the results of the study it can be determined that this phenomenon is caused by the thermal expansion of the gas in the leachate foam fig 3e at an elevated temperature the volume of each bubble increased rapidly increasing the height of the overall foam and resulting in moderate foaming and cracking this study s results agreed with the properties of surfactants reported in the previous study wang et al 2017 3 2 foaming characteristics of standard surfactants and influencing factors surfactant concentration might play a decisive role in leachate foaming as discussed in section 3 1 2 a relationship between surfactant concentration and foaming characteristics below cmc has been identified for three standard surfactants typical anionic surfactants las cationic surfactants bac and non ionic surfactants triton x 100 tx100 were selected for comparison and analysis under similar foaming conditions as leachate as shown in figs 4 a and 4b the foaming capacity and foam stability of all three standard surfactants are significantly increased from 10 mg l to 100 mg l it indicated that high surfactant concentrations below cmc were conducive to foaming performance the surface tension and viscosity of standard surfactants with different concentrations figs 4c and 4d further proved that a high level of surfactant concentration could significantly reduce the surface tension of the solution but had little effect on the viscosity the variations in leachate viscosity were most likely related to other macromolecular organic or inorganic components instead of fluctuations in surfactant concentration effects of ph value were also evaluated in standard surfactants fig 4e shows that las and tx100 reach their maximum foaming capacities at ph 9 while bac reaches its maximum foaming capacity at ph 5 in general the foam stability trend of the three standard surfactants fig 4f was consistent with their foaming capacity the foam stability of las was optimally achieved at a ph of 7 while tx100 was optimally achieved at a ph of 9 the foam stability of bac decreases with an increase in ph but liquid stability is best achieved at a ph value of 5 under different ph values the variation tendency for viscosity fig 4h and foam stability of standard surfactants was the same and the ph value at the highest point of viscosity was close to the ph value needed to achieve optimal foaming performance according to the findings presented above viscosity was a key factor affecting foam stability by ph value it is evident that the surface tension of las fig 4g gradually increased up to 77 mn m and was consistent with leachate whereas the surface tension of cationic and non ionic standard surfactants decreased slightly based on the above results surfactant concentration and ph value were two distinct factors influencing surface tension viscosity and respectively foaming performance meanwhile an anionic surfactant s foaming and surface characteristics under different ph values were consistent with leachate there was evidence that the relative prevalence of anionic surfactants compared to other surfactants was notable affecting the leachate foaming 3 3 concentration distribution of surfactants in leachate pollutants in leachate are primarily derived from the release of msw and surfactants are no exception several studies and statistical data indicate that traditional anionic surfactants are still the predominant components of washing products while cationic and non ionic surfactants have increased significantly in skin care products li 2014 therefore 7 typical surfactants were identified in 9 leachate samples by uplc ms ms as described in section 2 5 in order to reduce the possible specificity of areas and periods leachate samples from different cities and sections were selected in each leachate category a surfactant concentration analysis of raw leachate from each category is shown in fig 5 a according to this study anionic surfactants specifically las are the most critical surfactants in leachate and their concentration increases significantly with landfill age fresh leachate contained 5 84 16 84 las mixed leachate contained 51 53 62 87 las and aged leachate comprised 91 77 92 87 las meanwhile the average proportion of anionic surfactants in all 9 samples of leachate was 63 93 which further confirmed the prominent role of anionic surfactants in the composition of leachate chemical surfactants compared with aged leachate and mixed leachate the content of anionic surfactant in fresh leachate was relatively low and the content of anionic surfactant a cationic surfactant and a non ionic surfactant fluctuated significantly accounting for 16 12 49 58 11 39 79 68 and 4 2 39 03 respectively in this study a positive correlation was observed between anionic surfactants and landfill age primarily as a result of the following factors it was repeatedly mentioned in this paper and confirmed by a large number of studies kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 that the ph value of leachate is consistent with landfill age with the extension of the landfill age landfill plants gradually transit from the acid production stage to the methane production stage teng et al 2021 and a large number of organic acids produced in the initial phase are gradually decomposed into stable methane gas carbon dioxide etc until the internal temperature of the landfill rises to about 55 kjeldsen et al 2002 anionic surfactant has a low pk a due to its anionic active functional groups such as sulfonic acid an anionic surfactant is inhibited from ionizing at relatively low ph values resulting in a lower concentration of anionic surfactant in the leachate system furthermore anionic surfactants a product with a long development history the most comprehensive classification and the most considerable output have long been widely used in industrial and civil applications in particular sulfonate anionic surfactants occupy a significant market share palmer and hatley 2018 several studies have shown that long term use of anionic surfactants can cause particular damage to human skin due to strong irritation siyal et al 2020 numerous life source cosmetics toiletries and washing products have gradually introduced new surfactants to replace traditional anionic surfactants regan et al 2013 li et al li 2014 reported that the content of anionic surfactants in cleaning agent products had decreased significantly in recent years alternatively it may indicate that the reduction in anionic surfactant content in fresh leachate results from the removal of original anionic surfactant use in msw meanwhile the influence of landfill age on the content of anionic surfactant was consistent with that of the foaming performance of leachate in section 3 1 a high surfactant concentration was attributed to the relatively high foaming characteristics and low surface tension of aged leachate therefore despite fresh leachate having higher organic contents its surfactant concentrations particularly the anion surfactant concentration were relatively low resulting in relatively poor foaming combined with the results in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the responses of leachate to landfill ages ph value and temperature of the system were generally consistent with those of standard las evidence showed that anionic surfactants especially las were likely the dominant surfactants for leachate foaming fig 5b illustrates the effects of treatment processes on the content of surfactant in leachate mbr process performed efficient degradation and retention capacity for surfactants in leachate the concentration of las in mbr effluent was significantly reduced to less than 1 μg l and the total surfactant concentration quantitatively determined in the study is less than 22 μg l as shown in fig 2 mbr effluent at this concentration hardly generates stable foam however anionic surfactants were significantly concentrated in nfc due to the high efficiency of the nf membrane interception the concentration of anionic surfactants in fresh mixed and aged nfc increased to 3 58 μg l 2 99 μg l and 2 10 μg l since the total surfactant concentration of nfc was not significantly higher than that of mbr effluent it indicated that the nf process could not completely intercept surfactants not only that the significant increase in the concentration of anionic surfactants was consistent with the enhancement in the foaming performance of nfc which further proved that anionic surfactants were the decisive surfactants affecting leachate foaming 3 4 correlations between leachate characteristics and surfactants concentration in order to analyze the internal mechanism of surfactant distribution in leachate a correlation analysis was conducted between the basic characteristics and surfactant concentration of all sampled leachate the t test method and p value 0 05 were used to test the correlation coefficient and describe its significance respectively a correlation coefficient that did not meet this condition was deleted and the corresponding results are shown in fig 6 there was a negative correlation between the ph value and toc of leachate which is related to the influence of landfill age on ph value and organic content meanwhile positive correlations between ph value and three las surfactants were observed which is consistent with the effect of ph value on las concentration and leachate foaming caused by landfill age three las surfactants showed a positive correlation with each other indicating that the release regularity of las in domestic waste was consistent furthermore sds was positively correlated with aeo and np 7 non ionic surfactants indicating that the release regularity of the two non ionic surfactants in msw might be consistent with that of anionic surfactants in addition the results of the correlation analysis confirmed that the system s ph value plays a significant role in the release of surfactants in msw the higher the ph value of the system the greater the release of anionic surfactants from msw into the leachate 4 conclusions based on the results of this study it has been established that anionic surfactant concentration especially las has a significant impact on foaming performance a combination of foaming characterization and surfactant quantitative analysis revealed that stable foams were difficult to generate in process effluents raw leachate and nfc presented prominent foaming capacity and foam stability fresh leachate exhibits relatively poor foaming characteristics compared to mixed and aged leachates due to a low concentration of anionic surfactants las possessing up to 16 84 fresh leachate 62 78 mixed leachate and 92 87 aged leachate were the most significant surfactants in leachate and its content proportion gradually increased with landfill age and ph value this variation tendency was consistent with leachate foaming fluctuation based on surface tension reduction furthermore the impact of ph value temperature and treatment process on las were similar to that of msw leachate in terms of foaming capacity foam stability surface tension and viscosity this confirms that las plays a vital role in the treatment process for msw based on the results of this study maintaining acid ph conditions and maintaining high system temperatures was an effective and convenient method of reducing foaming in ltps due to the fact that las was shown to be a superior indicator of foaming compared to general parameters such as cod nh3 n and tds a more precise foam suppression strategy based on the removal of las could be further proposed in future

of directivity and pertinence lindorfer and demmig 2016 ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms has been widely applied in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of surfactants owing to its strong separation efficiency low sample demand high sensitivity and accurate quantification ability sakai et al 2016 in domestic medical and industrial wastewater uplc ms ms was used to discriminate a dozen surfactants including anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants clara et al 2007 a recent review indicates that the concentration of surfactants is between 0 16 and 4230 mg l and that their distribution is influenced by pollution sources and regional characteristics palmer and hatley 2018 however no relevant studies have been conducted to determine the identity of the surfactant in leachate so far in mass spectrometry anionic and non ionic surfactants have relatively low response values li et al 2018 laundry wastewater with high surfactant concentrations or domestic sewage with low background pollutants can be used for sensitivities and detection limits however samples with complex organic compositions and high background pollutants such as msw leachate are challenging to detect in addition the surfactant s amphiphilic structure allows it to remain in pipelines columns injection needles and other materials in uplc and ms resulting in a reduction in mass spectrum peak tailing and signal to noise ratios additionally it is generally acknowledged that surfactants play an important role in foam generation cantat et al 2013 however few studies have explored the relationship between the identification of surfactants and foaming characteristics studies have proved that even low concentrations 20 mg l of surfactant can significantly stimulate liquid foaming by comparing the foaming capacity before and after adding standard surfactants capodici et al 2015 but the influence mechanism of system surfactants on the foaming properties has not been discussed in this study we identified the key surfactant and the mechanism by which it impacts leachate foaming by investigating the correlation between surfactant composition and foaming characteristics to evaluate the foaming capacity and foam stability of msw leachate a systematic foam characterization device was developed to accommodate complex components high viscosities and frequent scaling characteristics by optimizing the uplc ms ms method qualitative and quantitative analysis of leachate surfactants and their distribution features were achieved in terms of landfill age treatment processes and geographic settings furthermore a correlation analysis between surfactants and general leachate characteristics was developed for the first time to better understand the factors influencing surfactant release the present foaming characterization of leachate and identification of surfactants offers a potential for the development of directional and selective materials and related foam control strategies 2 methods and materials 2 1 leachate sampling this study collected leachate samples from nine typical msw landfills and waste to energy plants during the winter due to the limited frequency of foaming problems in other seasons to address the impact of component variation and avoid sampling specificity the north southwest southeast and northwest regions with varying economic levels and climates were included throughout the country furthermore this study divided all leachate samples into three categories 1 fresh leachate was collected from msw waste to energy plants before any long term storage and treatment 2 mixed leachate was collected from msw landfill plants that have been operating for more than 10 years and continuously landfill fresh msw 3 aged leachate was collected from msw landfill plants that have been closed for more than 10 years it is noteworthy that there are very few intermediate landfills in china compared with intermediate landfills many have been continuously operating for more than 10 years and have continued to landfill fresh msw zhang et al 2021 leachate from each reservoir section was intensively treated after being mixed in the regulating tank therefore this mixed leachate was studied and regarded as an intermediate leachate in this study a description of the characteristics of all leachate samples is provided in table 1 treated leachate from three plants representing each category on site ltps table s1 has also been collected including mbr effluent nf effluent ro effluent nf membrane concentrate nfc and ro membrane concentrate roc all leachate samples have been filtrated with a 0 45 μm membrane and the filtered samples were stored at 4 the relevant characterization and analysis of leachate were completed within one week after sampling three groups of parallel samples were set up for all analyses 2 2 foaming characterization leachate contains organic pollutants that are more complex than traditional surfactant systems the concentration of surfactants in leachate is lower than that of standard surfactant systems the test accuracy of the simulated foaming process is limited by the traditional single glass tube method due to poor stability and uneven gas distribution fig 1 depicts a foam analysis device designed to solve the above

ammonium hydroxide in water fig s2 illustrates the optimization effect of the mrm spectrum with las c12 as an example before and after mobile phase optimization and post column compensation the quantitative method of the external standard curve is adopted for all surfactants the surfactant standard is configured into 9 series of standard solutions with methanol as the solvent the scatter diagram is drawn with the mass concentration of the surfactant to be measured as the abscissa and the area of the quantitative sub ion peak of the substance to be measured as the ordinate linear regression analysis was carried out to obtain the standard curve and correlation coefficient r2 the standard curves and correlation coefficients of seven surfactants including anionic surfactant cationic surfactant and non ionic surfactant are presented in table s4 the target surfactants have an excellent linear relationship within the marking range and r2 ranges from 0 9900 to 0 9999 the quantitative ion peak area of the tested leachate sample was obtained by the above uplc ms ms method and brought into the linear equation of the standard curve to obtain the corresponding mass concentration of surfactants in the leachate samples 2 6 quality control and assurance the proposed uplc ms ms method was tested for its limit of detection lod and limit of quantitation loq by adding low concentration standard surfactants to10 blank samples the standard samples were pretreated and tested according to the same method mentioned above and the signal to noise ratio s n of 7 surfactants was calculated according to the s n results the concentration corresponding to s n of 3 was taken as lod and the concentration corresponding to s n of 10 was taken as loq table s5 the recovery rate of the surfactants in the pretreatment and detection processes was tested by adding 200 μg l and 500 μg l mixed standard surfactants to the blank samples raw leachate samples and nfc samples meanwhile the same samples were tested five times to calculate the relative standard deviation rsd to verify the test s accuracy the results of spiked recovery and rsd are shown in table s6 calculating the slope of the matrix and pure solvent standard curves was used to determine the matrix effect a detailed description of the methods and results is provided in table s4 2 7 correlation analysis in order to further analyze the internal mechanism of the distribution characteristics of leachate surfactants a correlation analysis was carried out on the basic characteristics of the tested leachate and the content of surfactants all correlation analyses were completed using the correlation plot package 3 results and discussion 3 1 leachate foaming characteristics and influencing factors 3 1 1 landfill age the landfill age of leachate is an essential factor affecting its properties it significantly impacts the ph value ammonia nitrogen concentration and organic composition of leachate an evaluation of the foaming characteristics of leachate at different landfill ages can be found in figs 2 a and 2b despite the presence of more organic substances in fresh leachate its foaming capacity and stability were lower than those of mixed and aged leachate the relatively low ph value of fresh leachate 6 65 in this study is likely to be an influential factor in leachate foaming additionally aged and mixed leachate performed similarly in terms of foaming characteristics with similar ph values suggesting that ph is a more critical factor in leachate foaming than organic content in terms of foam morphology the results of the characterization did not reveal any apparent differences in landfill leachates at different ages nevertheless the average diameters of the foams derived from mixed leachate and aged leachate were relatively small and uniformly dispersed resulting in a more stable foam compared to the standard surfactant solution system fig 2c leachate foams formed a thicker liquid film primarily due to their complex organic composition and high viscosity surface characterization revealed that their aqueous system dominated surface tension fig 2d and leachate viscosity fig 2e at various landfill ages the study found the concentration of each individual surfactant in leachate was much lower than its critical micelle concentration cmc generally there was little difference in surface properties and landfill age whereas aged leachate had the lowest surface tension and organic content consistent with the evaluation results of foaming performance compared to aged leachate fresh leachate had a higher viscosity and a cod concentration that was 3 5 times that of aged leachate in addition it is essential to note that the surface tension and viscosity of the mix leachate were not in accordance with the foaming capacity and cod concentration based on several samplings the concentrations of cl and na in the mixed leachate were significantly higher than those in the fresh and aged leachate several studies have demonstrated that inorganic salts significantly affect the surface properties of aqueous systems wilson 2013 another study reported that increasing nacl concentrations can increase the surface tension of an aqueous solution and reduce its viscosity sett et al 2015 consistent with plenty of studies gallen et al 2017 li et al 2018 the above characterization results indicated that there was no linear positive correlation between cod concentration and foaming characteristics it is believed that this phenomenon is caused by the complex compositions of msw landfills as well as the significant differences in topography and climate which result in variations in surfactant release teng et al 2021 moreover regulating tanks are usually set up in landfills and waste to energy plants to treat leachate and the collected leachate comes from all reservoir areas zhang et al 2021 it is almost impossible to independently manage the continuous pollutant discharge within a distinct location thus reducing the correlation between the cod concentration and the release of foam affected surfactants 3 1 2 treatment processes an analysis of phased sampling was conducted to determine the relationship between the treatment processes and the foaming characteristics of each ltp figs 2a and 2b there was no significant difference in the foaming performance of the leachate treated with the same treatment process at different landfill ages the foaming problem in leachate was concentrated in the raw leachate and nfc with the extension of treatment processes the effluent s foaming capacity and foam stability at each stage gradually declined the foaming capacity of mbr effluent is about 1 2 to 1 3 of the raw leachate and the foam stability is only about 1 3 to 1 7 of the raw leachate the effluent from nf ro and roc did not produce stable foam the bubbles in the foam burst within 10 s after the end of aeration in nf ro and roc it indicated that the current mainstream process of leaching has a noticeable effect on the removal of surfactants affecting foaming whereas the nf process can almost intercept most surfactants the surface characterization of leachate at different treatment processes showed a similar trend with foaming characteristics raw leachate and nfc have relatively low surface tensions fig 2d in all leachate categories based on this coordinated variation surface tension appears to be the key factor affecting leachate foaming since the leachates from each category were simultaneously sampled in the same ltps the leachate composition was dominated by the treatment process rather than complex landfill components surface tension could be a significant reference index for foaming characteristics and surfactant concentration surfactants can reduce the surface tension and promote the production of foam in the same solution system as a consequence variations in the foaming performance through treatment processes were probably due to the change in surfactant concentration caused by the removal and interception of the treatment process similarly although there were differences in the range of variations as shown in fig 2e the viscosity of leachate at different landfill ages decreases significantly with the extension of the treatment process from raw leachate to ro effluent the raw leachate exhibited the highest viscosity and the nf and ro concentrates generally indicated higher viscosities than the previous process effluents i e mbr effluent and nf effluent the leachate is a typical newtonian fluid in which the organic molecules form a strong hydrogen bond network with the water molecules increasing its viscosity wilson 2013 a recent study has shown that the solution viscosity can be slightly enhanced as the concentration of solute increases feng et al 2018 compared with leachate sampled from different landfill ages the treated leachate of the same landfill age shown in fig 2 was taken from the same ltp therefore the reduction of effluent viscosity might be related to the removal of total organic concentration generally for a newtonian fluid the increase in viscosity within a certain range leads to the strength of foam stability through a steady liquid film cantat et al 2013 based on the results between viscosity and foaming performance it was found that leachate viscosity was positively correlated with foam stability however it was not the only determining factor 3 1 3 ph value based on the results of the foaming characterization of different landfill ages it appears that ph is an essential indicator of foaming in leachate furthermore the response to the ph value is an indispensable criterion for the type of surfactants ionic surfactants can be divided into anionic surfactants and cationic surfactants according to their hydrophilic functional groups based on acid dissociation constant pk a characteristics hydrophilic functional groups hydrolyze and ionize at different ph values change the solubility of surfactants and then affect their arrangement on the surface of the solution resulting in variations in the surface properties of the solution some non ionic surfactants are less affected by ph values while the intermolecular hydrogen bond influences others the foaming characteristics of leachate under different ph values are investigated and shown in fig 3 with the continuous increase in ph value the foaming capacity of leachate at all landfill ages was significantly improved fig 3a the highest foaming capacity of fresh and aged leachate was achieved when the ph value was 9 in contrast ph 11 was a benefit for mixed leachate at which the foaming capacity of aged and fresh leachate slightly decreased the trend of increasing foam stability fig 3b followed by a slight decline was evident in all categories in an alkaline ph condition the foaming capacity and foam stability of the leachate were significantly improved indicating that leachate foaming is conducive to an alkaline ph condition the study suggests that maintaining the acid ph value of leachate at ltps may be a feasible method to minimize the impacts of foaming problems on treatment the surface tension of leachate showed an increasing trend with the increase in ph value while the highest viscosity was also reached in alkaline ph conditions fig 3f it is worth noting that this growing tendency is generally consistent with foaming performance 3 1 4 temperature in this study treatment temperatures were evaluated at 4 levels including 20 c as a normal condition 40 c as a high temperature in summer and 60 c and 80 c as evaporation processes fig 3c illustrates the significant increase in the foaming capacity of leachate due to increasing system temperature reaching 1 6 at 80 c leachate foam and liquid stabilization decreased significantly with increasing system temperature fig 3d suggesting that surfactant stability in leachate was compromised at 80 c as proved by viscosity in fig 3h based on the results of the study it can be determined that this phenomenon is caused by the thermal expansion of the gas in the leachate foam fig 3e at an elevated temperature the volume of each bubble increased rapidly increasing the height of the overall foam and resulting in moderate foaming and cracking this study s results agreed with the properties of surfactants reported in the previous study wang et al 2017 3 2 foaming characteristics of standard surfactants and influencing factors surfactant concentration might play a decisive role in leachate foaming as discussed in section 3 1 2 a relationship between surfactant concentration and foaming characteristics below cmc has been identified for three standard surfactants typical anionic surfactants las cationic surfactants bac and non ionic surfactants triton x 100 tx100 were selected for comparison and analysis under similar foaming conditions as leachate as shown in figs 4 a and 4b the foaming capacity and foam stability of all three standard surfactants are significantly increased from 10 mg l to 100 mg l it indicated that high surfactant concentrations below cmc were conducive to foaming performance the surface tension and viscosity of standard surfactants with different concentrations figs 4c and 4d further proved that a high level of surfactant concentration could significantly reduce the surface tension of the solution but had little effect on the viscosity the variations in leachate viscosity were most likely related to other macromolecular organic or inorganic components instead of fluctuations in surfactant concentration effects of ph value were also evaluated in standard surfactants fig 4e shows that las and tx100 reach their maximum foaming capacities at ph 9 while bac reaches its maximum foaming capacity at ph 5 in general the foam stability trend of the three standard surfactants fig 4f was consistent with their foaming capacity the foam stability of las was optimally achieved at a ph of 7 while tx100 was optimally achieved at a ph of 9 the foam stability of bac decreases with an increase in ph but liquid stability is best achieved at a ph value of 5 under different ph values the variation tendency for viscosity fig 4h and foam stability of standard surfactants was the same and the ph value at the highest point of viscosity was close to the ph value needed to achieve optimal foaming performance according to the findings presented above viscosity was a key factor affecting foam stability by ph value it is evident that the surface tension of las fig 4g gradually increased up to 77 mn m and was consistent with leachate whereas the surface tension of cationic and non ionic standard surfactants decreased slightly based on the above results surfactant concentration and ph value were two distinct factors influencing surface tension viscosity and respectively foaming performance meanwhile an anionic surfactant s foaming and surface characteristics under different ph values were consistent with leachate there was evidence that the relative prevalence of anionic surfactants compared to other surfactants was notable affecting the leachate foaming 3 3 concentration distribution of surfactants in leachate pollutants in leachate are primarily derived from the release of msw and surfactants are no exception several studies and statistical data indicate that traditional anionic surfactants are still the predominant components of washing products while cationic and non ionic surfactants have increased significantly in skin care products li 2014 therefore 7 typical surfactants were identified in 9 leachate samples by uplc ms ms as described in section 2 5 in order to reduce the possible specificity of areas and periods leachate samples from different cities and sections were selected in each leachate category a surfactant concentration analysis of raw leachate from each category is shown in fig 5 a according to this study anionic surfactants specifically las are the most critical surfactants in leachate and their concentration increases significantly with landfill age fresh leachate contained 5 84 16 84 las mixed leachate contained 51 53 62 87 las and aged leachate comprised 91 77 92 87 las meanwhile the average proportion of anionic surfactants in all 9 samples of leachate was 63 93 which further confirmed the prominent role of anionic surfactants in the composition of leachate chemical surfactants compared with aged leachate and mixed leachate the content of anionic surfactant in fresh leachate was relatively low and the content of anionic surfactant a cationic surfactant and a non ionic surfactant fluctuated significantly accounting for 16 12 49 58 11 39 79 68 and 4 2 39 03 respectively in this study a positive correlation was observed between anionic surfactants and landfill age primarily as a result of the following factors it was repeatedly mentioned in this paper and confirmed by a large number of studies kulikowska and klimiuk 2008 that the ph value of leachate is consistent with landfill age with the extension of the landfill age landfill plants gradually transit from the acid production stage to the methane production stage teng et al 2021 and a large number of organic acids produced in the initial phase are gradually decomposed into stable methane gas carbon dioxide etc until the internal temperature of the landfill rises to about 55 kjeldsen et al 2002 anionic surfactant has a low pk a due to its anionic active functional groups such as sulfonic acid an anionic surfactant is inhibited from ionizing at relatively low ph values resulting in a lower concentration of anionic surfactant in the leachate system furthermore anionic surfactants a product with a long development history the most comprehensive classification and the most considerable output have long been widely used in industrial and civil applications in particular sulfonate anionic surfactants occupy a significant market share palmer and hatley 2018 several studies have shown that long term use of anionic surfactants can cause particular damage to human skin due to strong irritation siyal et al 2020 numerous life source cosmetics toiletries and washing products have gradually introduced new surfactants to replace traditional anionic surfactants regan et al 2013 li et al li 2014 reported that the content of anionic surfactants in cleaning agent products had decreased significantly in recent years alternatively it may indicate that the reduction in anionic surfactant content in fresh leachate results from the removal of original anionic surfactant use in msw meanwhile the influence of landfill age on the content of anionic surfactant was consistent with that of the foaming performance of leachate in section 3 1 a high surfactant concentration was attributed to the relatively high foaming characteristics and low surface tension of aged leachate therefore despite fresh leachate having higher organic contents its surfactant concentrations particularly the anion surfactant concentration were relatively low resulting in relatively poor foaming combined with the results in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the responses of leachate to landfill ages ph value and temperature of the system were generally consistent with those of standard las evidence showed that anionic surfactants especially las were likely the dominant surfactants for leachate foaming fig 5b illustrates the effects of treatment processes on the content of surfactant in leachate mbr process performed efficient degradation and retention capacity for surfactants in leachate the concentration of las in mbr effluent was significantly reduced to less than 1 μg l and the total surfactant concentration quantitatively determined in the study is less than 22 μg l as shown in fig 2 mbr effluent at this concentration hardly generates stable foam however anionic surfactants were significantly concentrated in nfc due to the high efficiency of the nf membrane interception the concentration of anionic surfactants in fresh mixed and aged nfc increased to 3 58 μg l 2 99 μg l and 2 10 μg l since the total surfactant concentration of nfc was not significantly higher than that of mbr effluent it indicated that the nf process could not completely intercept surfactants not only that the significant increase in the concentration of anionic surfactants was consistent with the enhancement in the foaming performance of nfc which further proved that anionic surfactants were the decisive surfactants affecting leachate foaming 3 4 correlations between leachate characteristics and surfactants concentration in order to analyze the internal mechanism of surfactant distribution in leachate a correlation analysis was conducted between the basic characteristics and surfactant concentration of all sampled leachate the t test method and p value 0 05 were used to test the correlation coefficient and describe its significance respectively a correlation coefficient that did not meet this condition was deleted and the corresponding results are shown in fig 6 there was a negative correlation between the ph value and toc of leachate which is related to the influence of landfill age on ph value and organic content meanwhile positive correlations between ph value and three las surfactants were observed which is consistent with the effect of ph value on las concentration and leachate foaming caused by landfill age three las surfactants showed a positive correlation with each other indicating that the release regularity of las in domestic waste was consistent furthermore sds was positively correlated with aeo and np 7 non ionic surfactants indicating that the release regularity of the two non ionic surfactants in msw might be consistent with that of anionic surfactants in addition the results of the correlation analysis confirmed that the system s ph value plays a significant role in the release of surfactants in msw the higher the ph value of the system the greater the release of anionic surfactants from msw into the leachate 4 conclusions based on the results of this study it has been established that anionic surfactant concentration especially las has a significant impact on foaming performance a combination of foaming characterization and surfactant quantitative analysis revealed that stable foams were difficult to generate in process effluents raw leachate and nfc presented prominent foaming capacity and foam stability fresh leachate exhibits relatively poor foaming characteristics compared to mixed and aged leachates due to a low concentration of anionic surfactants las possessing up to 16 84 fresh leachate 62 78 mixed leachate and 92 87 aged leachate were the most significant surfactants in leachate and its content proportion gradually increased with landfill age and ph value this variation tendency was consistent with leachate foaming fluctuation based on surface tension reduction furthermore the impact of ph value temperature and treatment process on las were similar to that of msw leachate in terms of foaming capacity foam stability surface tension and viscosity this confirms that las plays a vital role in the treatment process for msw based on the results of this study maintaining acid ph conditions and maintaining high system temperatures was an effective and convenient method of reducing foaming in ltps due to the fact that las was shown to be a superior indicator of foaming compared to general parameters such as cod nh3 n and tds a more precise foam suppression strategy based on the removal of las could be further proposed in future

this problem we collected bulk sdoms 0 7 μm from 6 respective lakes from upstream to downstream in the yangtze river basin yrb to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize their properties and metal binding behaviors using excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis eem farafac and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy of synchronous fluorescence

binding behavior of dom nutritional status and pollution levels of each lake exhibit certain commonalities and heterogeneities in addition the point that mw structures could impact the metal binding sequence and ability of dom was reported in our previous study of an individual macrophytic lake fan et al 2022 within watershed systems how the mw of dom is distributed and changed and what role it plays are ambiguous in the metal binding behaviors optical properties absorbance and fluorescence and molecular structure are sensitive indicators to characterize the features and biogeochemical processes of dom guo et al 2019 wu et al 2022 xu et al 2019 although excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis eem farafac has been widely used for qualitative and quantitative descriptions of dom and its metal binding behaviors it has become a trend to verify each other through various optical means liu et al 2022 for example the combination of two dimensional correlation spectroscopy of synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 2d sf cos and 2d ftir cos can provide dynamic sequences of fluorophores and corresponding functional groups during dom binding hms zhu et al 2021 based on the above background a comparison and summarization of traits and metal binding processes for dom is imperative for these connected lakes in the watershed system by using multiple spectral methods which is advantageous for the ecological risk assessment and water environment management of individual lakes and even entire watershed systems the yangtze river basin yrb especially in the middle and lower reaches covers 696 lakes larger than 1 km and is considered a representative watershed system environmental problems in lakes along the yangtze river have long been a concern due to the agglomeration of population and the expansion of the chemical industry yan et al 2021 chenghai lake chl and dianchi lake dcl are plateau lakes located in the upstream area ua of the yrb under the double influence of nature i e high altitude strong light little water supply and humans industrial agricultural and aquaculture the two semiclosed lakes are faced with ecological function degradation and cyanobacterial blooms wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 dongting lake dtl and poyang lake pyl distributed in the midstream area ma of the yrb are hubs in water resource regulation and storage for the yrb the excessive nitrogen and phosphorus input and mining industry have caused eutrophication and hm pollution in the two yangtze river connected lakes li et al 2013 2021 shengjin lake sjl and taihu lake thl are located in the downstream area da of the yrb in recent years sjl has suffered from ecological and environmental threats such as shrinking lake areas rising nutrient levels and pollution cheng et al 2020 thl is an important freshwater resource for human and economic development in the yangtze river delta eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms occur frequently yan et al 2022 under the influence of natural and economic differences the aquatic environment of these lakes is worthy of attention and representativeness in this study sediments from 6 representative lakes along the yrb were collected to extract sediment dissolved organic matter sdom for ultrafiltration separation and fluorescence quenching experiments we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and characterized the characteristics of sdom and its metal binding behavior from mw distributions fluorophore types and functional groups by applying eem farafac 2d sf cos and 2d ftir cos then the correlations among lake sdom characteristics nutrient status and pollution levels as well as the role of sdom in lake environments were discussed to provide a reference for water environment protection and the prevention of heavy metal pollution and eutrophication in the yangtze river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample

mainly includes uv vis spectroscopy excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems including synchronous fluorescence spectra sf and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the uv vis and eems of

r2018b detailed information has been analyzed in previous studies yamashita et al 2008 2 5 2 2d cos analysis 2d cos analysis is usually applied to describe the reaction sequence and process of dom and heavy metals hms noda 2016 the 2d cos analysis of sf 2d sf cos indicates the binding process of fluorescent substances to hms the 2d cos analysis of ftir in the functional group regions of 1800 800 cm

25 02 of the features for these variables respectively the sum of the two exceeded 80 and the kmo was 0 639 indicating an acceptable result 3 result 3 1 evaluation of typical heavy metals hms pollution in lake sediments 3 1 1 summary statistics of trophic state and hms pollution in lakes the statistical data of the physical and chemical parameters of the surface water and sediments of the 6 lakes are presented in tables s1 and s2 dcl and thl were moderately eutrophic and the sediments were enriched in nutrients including tn tp and total organic carbon toc the other lakes were mesotrophic to lightly eutrophic table s3 presents statistical data of the content ranges and pollution levels of copper cu2 and cadmium cd2 from 6 lakes the contents of cu2 in 6 lakes were nonpolluting to slightly contaminated indicating a low environmental risk however as an inescapable input for these lakes cu2 pollution may adversely affect animal and human health through enrichment and food chain transmission zhou et al 2018 various levels of cd2 pollution occurred in the 6 lakes and were thl heavily contaminated dcl and dtl moderately to heavily contaminated pyl and sjl moderately contaminated chl uncontaminated to moderately contaminated table s3 according to the investigation of heavy metals hms in the sediment of provinces along the yangtze river basin yrb the pollution levels of hms in sediments decrease from the upstream area ua to the downstream area da table s3 yan et al 2021 thus the pollution and ecological risks of cu2 and cd2 in various lakes need attention 3 1 2 characteristics of the measured hms concentrations and c n ratio in this study higher c and n contents were found in the dcl than in the other lakes anova p 0 000 table s2 the atomic c n ratio of the 6 lakes ranged from 10 70 0 30 to 13 39 1 78 indicating a mixed source of aquatic algae and terrestrial plants of sediment dissolved organic matter sdom fig 2 a zhao et al 2015 the measured values of the concentrations for cu2 and cd2 in the sediments are presented in table s4 the concentrations of cu2 and cd2 were higher in dcl dtl and chl than in the other lakes anova p 0 000 fig 2c the pollution degrees of cu2 and cd2 were evaluated by the index of geo accumulation igeo proposed by muller in 1969 muller 1969 text s5 the igeo values of cu2 in the sediments of the 6 lakes ranged from 0 66 to 1 51 indicating uncontaminated or slightly contaminated states degree ⅰ table s4 in contrast cd2 contamination was widespread igeo ranged from 0 10 to 3 92 and was relatively serious for the lakes in ua which was consistent with previous studies fig 2b yan et al 2021 3 2 spectral characteristics of sdom from lakes in the yangtze river basin the values of sediment dissolved organic carbon sdoc were 46 149 12 77 mg l for chl 82 24 11 81 mg l for dcl in the ua 18 63 5 05 mg l for dtl 24 17 6 62 mg l for pyl in the midstream area ma 20 09 5 52 mg l for sjl and 13 19 0 63 mg l for thl in the da for the yrb fig 2c higher sdoc contents were found in the lakes from the ua than in those from the other two areas anova p 0 000 0 007 the sdoc for high molecular weight hmw 1 kda 0 7 µm parts accounted for 0 42 2 98 of the bulk sdoc meaning that sdoc was basically stored in low molecular weight lmw 1 kda sdom for lakes the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectra of the 6 lakes depicted that the absorbance between 200 nm and 250 nm in dcl and chl was stronger than that in the other lakes fig 3 a the values of a254 are calculated and presented in fig 2c the higher a254 values indicated more aromatic substances in chl and dcl anova p 0 002 0 023 a strong correlation between sdoc and a254 further suggested the contribution of aromatic substances to sdoc p 0 01 the fourier transform infrared spectra ftir showed 9 types of functional groups in the 6 lakes which were phenolic or alcohol hydroxyl o h groups 3420 cm 1 amide i band c o 1640 1600 cm 1 phenolic hydroxyl o h

and table 1 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 the synchronous fluorescence sf spectra of the 6 lakes exhibited four peaks located at 230 280 325 and 370 nm fig 3c the peaks at 230 and 280 nm were tryptophan like fluorescence regions at short wavelengths 200 285 nm and the peaks at 325 and 370 nm were located in the humic like fluorescence region at long wavelengths 285 450 nm the fluorescence intensity of the peaks in the 6 lakes roughly followed the order dcl chl dtl sjl thl pyl as shown in fig 3d the sdom extracted from the 6 lake sediments contained two kinds of fluorescent substances i e tryptophan like substances peak t em ex 340 280 nm and peak s em ex 340 225 nm and humic like matter peak a em ex 450 265 nm and peak c em ex 400 315 nm although the eem spectral profiles of the 6 lakes were similar the fluorescence peak intensities of sdom from chl and dcl were relatively higher than those from the other lakes the coincident results among the uv vis sf and eem spectra highlighted the particularity of lakes in the ua of the yrb which was characterized by a high content of organic matter and strong aromaticity four fluorescence components c1 c4 were resolved from the eem parafac model fig 4 a hereinto c1 ex em 320 400 nm c2 ex em 270 365 460 nm and c4 ex em 240 400 450 nm were classified as humic like fluorophores which were similar to peaks a and c in the eem spectra c1 as a microbial humic like component was released by algae and bacterial leachate li et al 2022a murphy et al 2008 c2 and c4 were related to both terrestrial organic matter and microbial reprocessing representing organic matter with macromolecular structure gueguen et al 2011 huang et al 2019 c3 ex em 280 340 nm corresponded to the tryptophan like peaks t and s which were characterized by simple molecular structures huang et al 2019 sheng et al 2013 fig 4b showed that the fluorescence intensities f max of sdom were dcl chl dtl sjl pyl thl indicating a relatively higher content of sdom in upstream lakes than in downstream lakes independent sample t test t 5 406 p 0 033 the higher f max of humic like substances 0 67 0 06 2 15 0 31 r u vs 0 09 0 02 0 58 0 10 r u indicated its dominant position in lakes along the yrb fig 4b independent sample t test t 5 921 p 0 000 compared with the proportion of 30 12 0 33 38 50 0 09 in these lakes from ma and da the proportions of tryptophan like component c3 in the total f max were lower in the lakes from da only 2 37 0 05 20 27 0 05 fig 4c meanwhile similar distribution regularities for individual fluorescent substances were found in different mw sdom for the lakes fig 4c fig 4d described that the fi values of sdom from the 6 lakes ranged from 1 74 0 10 to 1 93 0 06 which was close to 1 9 suggesting relatively strong endogenous attributes the hix values ranged from 1 36 0 25 to 3 33 0 95 fig 4d the higher values for bix and β α suggested strong activities of biological bacteria in dcl and chl fig 4d 3 3 binding behaviors between fluorophores in sdom and hms based on 2d sf cos the sf spectra after adding cu2 and cd2 reflected that the fluorescence band decreased or increased to different degrees fig s1 more pronounced variations were presented in sdom binding to cu2 sdom cu2 than sdom binding to cd2 sdom cd2 fig s1 2d sf cos was analyzed to obtain metal binding sequences of different fluorophores fig 5 in the process of bulk sdom cu2 for the 6 lakes the wavelengths at 280 nm on the y axis appeared some negative cross peaks located at 300 320 330 360 and 370 280 nm fig 5a f positive cross peaks were found at 280 320 360 210 230 nm fig 5a f the results manifested that the bulk sdom cu2 in the 6 lakes followed a relatively accordant sequence 280 nm 300 370 nm 210 230 nm i e tryptophan like fluorophores the protein like substance at long wavelengths humic like fluorophores tyrosine fluorophores the protein like substance at short wavelengths noda 2016 after mw fractionation the negative or positive cross peaks resembled the counterparts in bulk sdom cu2 and the binding orders were not changed fig 5g r two minus cross peaks were situated at 330 345 280 nm and 280 220 230 nm in the process of sdom cd2 fig 5a1 f1 the complexation orders were 220 230 nm 280 nm 330 345 nm indicating that the protein like fluorophores reacted preferentially with cd2 in these lakes except for pyl noda 2016 compared with the lag of cu2 binding the short wavelength tyrosine substances were more sensitive and first bound to cd2 similar cross peaks and binding trends were exhibited in the process of hmw lmw sdom cd2 fig 5g1 r1 in contrast positive 300 350 280 nm cross peaks occurred in the bulk and lmw sdom cd2 for pyl and lmw sdom cd2 for sjl presenting inconsistent binding behaviors in which humic like substances reacted with cd2 before the protein like substances fig 5d1 p1 and q1 in general protein like substances possessed priority and dominance during sdom cu2 cd2 and the reaction sequence was less affected by the mw separation of sdom 3 4 binding behaviors between functional groups in sdom and hms based on 2d ftir cos the binding information of functional groups in sdom with hms cu2 and cd2 was obtained by 2d cos analysis of ftir 2d ftir cos fig s2 some minus or plus cross peaks appeared in fig 6 and their wavenumber positions were extracted in fig s3 the emergence of new peaks including 1750 1700 1560 1500 1470 1380 1320 1290 1200 1250 and 970 cm 1 remedied the problem of overlapping peaks in the linear ftir spectra table 1 zhu et al 2021 according to the noda rule noda 2016 the prior binding of chl sdom to cu2 or cd2 was aliphatic c oh f1 and crystalline cellulose f2 carboxyl c o f3 and phenolic o h f4 polysaccharides c o f5 and aromatic c h f6 amide ii n h f7 and crystalline cellulose f2 the dcl sdom binding to cu2 or cd2 complied the sequence of f2 f3 and f6 amide i c o f8 and f5 f1 aromatic n o f9 the sequence of f1 f2 f8 and f5 f6 f3 f4 was observed in the binding process of dtl sdom cu2 the sequence of f1 f3 f7 and f2 f5 and f6 f4 and f10 was found in the dtl sdom reacting with cd2 the binding sequence for pyl sdom to cu2 was f1 f5 f4 f6 f2 f3 and f8 the sequence of pyl sdom binding to cd2 was f8 f4 f7 f3 f1 f5 and f2 f6 the binding order of f8 and f2 f1 f3 f5 and f6 f9 appeared in the binding process of sjl sdom cu2 the binding sequence for sjl sdom to cd2 was f4 f1 f5 and f8 f7 f6 and f3 f2 which appeared in the binding process of sjl sdom cd2 the binding sequence of thl sdom cu2 followed f1 f5 f8 f2 f3 and f6 f9 the binding sequence of thl sdom cd2 followed f1 f8 and f5 f3 and f4 f9 and f6 for the binding processes of functional groups in sdom with different mws with cu2 or cd2 the reaction sequences were relatively unchanged the reaction process of sdom derived from the lakes except for dcl with cu2 or cd2 revealed that the aliphatic c oh f1 amide i c o f8 and polysaccharides c o f5 were primary and preferential participants in contrast carboxyl c o f3 and aromatic c h f6 were more sensitive in the process of sdom binding to cu2 or cd2 for dcl which may be associated with abundant humic like matter 3 5 quantitative characterization of hms binding behaviors based on parafac components fig 7 showed the dynamic variations in the f max of the components quenched or enhanced after adding cu2 or cd2 the fluorescence quenching constants logk were evaluated by the modified stern volmer equation to represent the binding abilities of the components table 2 the mean values of logk cu for the components were c1 c4 c2 c3 in chl c1 c4 c2 in dcl c3 c4 c2 c1 in dtl c3 c2 c4 c1 in pyl c4 c3 c1 c2 in sjl and c3 c4 c2 c1 in thl table 2 the humic like ingredients exhibited higher binding abilities with cu2 in chl and dcl in contrast stronger complexing abilities between cu2 and tryptophan like component c3 were found in dtl pyl and thl in the process of sdom cd2 for the 6 lakes only the humic like component c4 was complexed with cd2 furthermore it was clear that c4 displayed stronger binding abilities with cd2 than with cu2 in most of the lakes except for chl and thl some imponderable logk cd values implied relatively weak complexing effects between part of the fluorescent material and cd2 after fractionation of sdom the affinity of the components with cu2 was enhanced except for c3 of thl table 2 the logk cu values of sdom in most hmw factions were higher than those in the bulk and lmw counterparts for the lakes regardless of sdom type except for chl and c4 table 2 differently stronger binding behaviors with cu2 occurred in lmw sdom of chl and humic like component c4 of lmw for dtl sjl and thl in the process of sdom for different mw fractions binding to cd2 the humic like component c4 in hmw sdom possessed higher logk cd values for chl dcl and thl estimable reaction processes of component c2 with cd2 occurred in the hmw fraction for these lakes except for sjl thus the higher cd2 binding capacities of the humic like matter with hmw were found in the upstream lakes and molecular weight separation might promote cd2 complexation with some humic like fluorophores 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between sdom features and environmental state in lakes humic substances are the main component of sedimentary organic matter som in lakes accounting for 60 90 of the total som leeben et al 2014 xiao et al 2020 in this study humic like fluorophores accounted for 61 5 97 6 of sdom from the 6 lakes the significantly positive correlation between sdoc and humic like fractions verified the preponderant contribution of humic like substances in sdom of the yangtze river basin yrb fig 8 a the high linear dependence between humic like fluorophores and optical indicators i e fi bix and β α implied intense microbial bacterial activity p 0 05 which may be the result of the synergistic effect of microorganisms and photochemical degradation fig 8a the 79 7 97 6 humic like fluorophores were enriched in sdom of dcl and chl as plateau lakes they accept stronger light accompanied by elevated lake temperatures in autumn september to october which might lead to more intense photochemical and microbial degradation farias et al 2007 liu et al 2019 mckay et al 2015 yang et al 2021 on the one hand microbial degradation is mostly a process of consuming protein like materials and increasing the amount of humic like materials ren et al 2022 on the other hand cyanobacteria and phytoplankton cells use valid photosynthetic radiation from photosynthesis within the euphotic region to release organic matter and nutrients inducing an increase in doc concentration hansen et al 2016 yang et al 2021 the tryptophan like content of the middle and lower lakes was higher than that of the upper lakes which may be due to different degradation mechanisms compared with the intense photodegradation in the upstream lakes microbial degradation may play a greater role in the middle and lower lakes a similar variation has been reported in river systems mostofa et al 2007 the negative correlation between tryptophan like component c3 and the endogenous index indicated contributions from external inputs fig 8a tryptophan like materials have been considered an indicator of pollution in related studies probably coming from wastewater discharges stedmon et al 2011 sdom is usually consistent with the trophic degrees of lakes leeben et al 2014 wen et al 2022 principal component analysis pca found a corresponding connection between the fluorescence features of sdom and its nutrient level among lakes fig 8b as shown in fig 8c the dcl identified as having a moderate eutrophication grade was governed by humic like components c1 and c2 whose f max proportion reached 61 53 5 27 the f max proportion of c1 c2 ranged from 35 69 8 15 to 46 47 3 04 in pyl sjl and thl which were in light eutrophication chl and dtl whose f max proportions ranged from 34 44 2 60 to 34 62 5 96 were determined to be in the mesotrophic state fig 8c the humic like components c1 and c2 with low molecular weights have been shown to arise from microbially derived compounds from phytoplankton as well as from sun induced compounds released in extracellular polymers shammi et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 lake eutrophication is mainly a problem of phytoplankton blooms and water quality deterioration which further facilitate the generation and accumulation of autochthonous dom in sediment chen et al 2015b thus the quantity of phytoplankton derived humic like materials c1 and c2 in sediment may be considered an indicator to assess the eutrophication status of lakes in addition the relatively light trophic degree of thl might be attributed to the removal of nutrient salts by sediment dredging zhong et al 2021 4 2 exploration of the binding mechanism of sdom in lake sediment and hms although the sdom from 6 lakes was dominated by humic like materials the tryptophan like materials showed stronger affinities in the process of binding to cu2 and cd2 except for pyl in terms of functional groups aliphatic c oh amide i c o and polysaccharides c o possessed stronger attractions with cu2 and cd2 in these lightly eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes fig 9 the oxygen containing functional groups easily complexed with metal cations to form inner sphere complexes for dom from various sources showing strong metal affinities zhu et al 2021 in contrast the carboxyl c o and aromatic c h or c c preferentially bond to cu2 and cd2 in moderately eutrophic dcl fig 9 the higher proportion of humic fluorophores in dcl that might form unique functional group compositions changed the binding path of sdom cu2 cd2 wen et al 2022 a view of the larger proportion of the macromolecular humic like the higher the carboxyl group proportion of aromatic carbon had been reported zhu et al 2022 although 2d sf cos showed that protein like matter preferentially bound to cu2 or cd2 in dcl the binding process was inapplicable for the complexation model implying the occurrence of other binding mechanisms fig 5 and table 2 the π bond in the functional groups carboxyl and aromatic might have undergone a cationic π bonding interaction with the metal cation wu et al 2022 as a nonfluorescent component polysaccharides are widely involved in the response between dom and hms fan et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the binding rules of sdom with different mws and cu2 or cd2 were relatively consistent which meant that physical fractionation had little effect on the chemical structure and reaction this result was also observed in previous studies fan et al 2022 4 3 effects of sdom on the risk of hms pollution in lake sediment in this study higher cu2 binding abilities logk cu were found in the humic like ingredients for chl and dcl from ua and the tryptophan like components in the lakes dtl pyl and thl of ma and da respectively these differences in logk cu might be attributed to the source and concentration of fluorescent components the protein like material derived from wastewater and the autochthonic humic like material showed higher copper binding rates liu et al 2022 meanwhile positive correlations were found between logk cu and f amx of components in most lakes parameter in fig s4 only humic like component c4 complexed with cd2 and its complexation ability was higher than that with cu2 suggesting heterogeneity of sdom binding hms it was recorded that aromatic and hydrophobic materials were responsible for changing the form and biological availability of cd2 huang et al 2022 after the mw fraction the cu2 binding capacity of the components was enhanced the sdom components in the hmw fraction possessed higher complexation abilities in most lakes implying that increased oxygen and polarity functional groups provided more binding sites during fractionation especially in the hmw fraction li et al 2022b xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 in addition a related study reported that humic like components with lmw contributed to high cu2 binding by carbon sources and electron donors corresponding to c4 in this study li et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 there was no regular trend of logk cu cd values between sdom with various nutrient levels and hms and the detoxification of sdom fundamentally depended on its fluorescent components and molecular structure it is certain that the continuous release of sdom from sediment is vital in reducing the ecological risk of ubiquitous cd2 contamination in the yrb 5 conclusion sdom from 6 lakes in the yangtze river basin yrb exhibited certain differences and commonalities in optical properties and chemical structures eem parafac showed that humic like fluorophores were dominant for the sdom of these lakes the total fluorescence intensity f max of sdom from upstream was larger than that from the downstream p 0 033 in addition humic like fractions c1 and c2 exhibited a regular rank change with different trophic level classifications in each lake combined with principal component analysis pca in the process of sdom binding to cu2 or cd2 tryptophan like fluorophores and oxygen containing functional groups including aliphatic c oh amide i c o and polysaccharides c o were preferred higher cu2 binding abilities logk cu were observed in the humic like matter for dcl and chl and tryptophan like matter for the lakes from the midstream and downstream areas of the yrb respectively only humic like substances could complex with cd2 and possessed a higher binding capacity than cu2 the sdom components in the hmw fraction possessed higher complexation abilities in most lakes credit authorship contribution statement tuantuan fan investigation data curation formal analysis

15091,the nature of sediment dissolved organic matter sdom can reflect the environmental background nutritional status and human activities and is an important part of lakes the differences in the binding capacity of heavy metals and organic matter in lake sediments with different trophic states at the catchment scale and the mechanism of the differences in binding are still unclear to solve this problem we collected bulk sdoms 0 7 μm from 6 respective lakes from upstream to downstream in the yangtze river basin yrb to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize their properties and metal binding behaviors using excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis eem farafac and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy of synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 2d sf cos and 2d ftir cos the results showed that sediment dissolved organic carbon sdoc was mainly enriched in low molecular weight lmw 1 kda fractions the total fluorescence intensity f max of sdom from upstream was larger than that from downstream p 0 033 and humic like fluorophores were dominant in these lakes the f max of sediment humic like components c1 c2 was closely related to the trophic levels of the lakes protein like substances and oxygen containing functional groups c oh c o and c o were preferred in the reaction between sdom and copper cu2 or cadmium cd2 while a unique binding path was exhibited in the moderately eutrophic dcl in terms of fluorophore types higher cu2 binding abilities logk cu were observed in the humic like matter for the lakes in the upper reaches and tryptophan like matter for the lakes from the midstream and downstream areas of the yrb although cd2 complexed only with humic like matter logk cd was higher than logk cu in terms of molecular weight mw the logk cu cd of components were enhanced after mw fractionation the hmw 0 7 μm 1 kda components possessed higher logk cu in most lakes

data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as relatively rich and active ingredients in aquatic ecosystems dissolved organic matter dom is an organic heterogeneous mixture consisting of a variety of sources and substances and is capable of various biochemical reactions including biodegradation and photodegradation benner et al 2011 liu et al 2020 typically stubborn components in dom and nondegradable pollutants such as heavy metals hms can be absorbed and stored in lake sediments guillemette et al 2017 sediments with higher concentrations of dom and pollutants than the overlying water play a primary role in determining the state of nutrition and pollution for lakes sokly et al 2018 the nature of sediment dom is closely related to human activities and the environmental background on the one hand the combination of endogenous dom produced by animal and plant decomposition and terrestrial material from human induced input significantly alters the quantity and quality of dom liu et al 2015 ren et al 2022 on the other hand under complex hydrological conditions various physicochemical processes e g degradation flocculation and mineralization are coupled with contributors from different sources resulting in dom properties and a more complex nutritional status for lakes kellerman et al 2014 shang et al 2022 the interaction between dom from rivers lakes groundwater and sediments and various contaminants hms organic pollutants in aquatic systems has been widely explored to clarify the ecological risks of pollutants chen et al 2015a huang et al 2022 xu et al 2017 in the process the properties of dom e g composition and molecular weights mws and types of hms were the main factors of study for example macrophyte dominant sediments were more effective in reducing the toxicity of hms than algal dominant sediments xu et al 2013 high mw hmw 1 kda 0 45 μm dom was favored in binding to copper cu2 and lead pb2 hargreaves et al 2017 xu et al 2019 obvious spatial differences in dom attributes and metal binding behavior were observed in a lake under the influence of various internal and external environments fan et al 2022 lv et al 2020 ren et al 2022 overall a substantial number of studies have centered on dom attributions and its metal binding behaviors from a single lake river or different source perspective to enrich the intuitive understanding of the coexistence law of dom and hms however a large watershed system is often composed of multiple lakes and rivers connected to each other which promotes the dynamic transportation of nutrients pollutants and organic carbon among these lakes meanwhile constrained by environmental conditions such as geographic location altitude hydrology and economic conditions the characteristics and metal binding behavior of dom nutritional status and pollution levels of each lake exhibit certain commonalities and heterogeneities in addition the point that mw structures could impact the metal binding sequence and ability of dom was reported in our previous study of an individual macrophytic lake fan et al 2022 within watershed systems how the mw of dom is distributed and changed and what role it plays are ambiguous in the metal binding behaviors optical properties absorbance and fluorescence and molecular structure are sensitive indicators to characterize the features and biogeochemical processes of dom guo et al 2019 wu et al 2022 xu et al 2019 although excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis eem farafac has been widely used for qualitative and quantitative descriptions of dom and its metal binding behaviors it has become a trend to verify each other through various optical means liu et al 2022 for example the combination of two dimensional correlation spectroscopy of synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 2d sf cos and 2d ftir cos can provide dynamic sequences of fluorophores and corresponding functional groups during dom binding hms zhu et al 2021 based on the above background a comparison and summarization of traits and metal binding processes for dom is imperative for these connected lakes in the watershed system by using multiple spectral methods which is advantageous for the ecological risk assessment and water environment management of individual lakes and even entire watershed systems the yangtze river basin yrb especially in the middle and lower reaches covers 696 lakes larger than 1 km and is considered a representative watershed system environmental problems in lakes along the yangtze river have long been a concern due to the agglomeration of population and the expansion of the chemical industry yan et al 2021 chenghai lake chl and dianchi lake dcl are plateau lakes located in the upstream area ua of the yrb under the double influence of nature i e high altitude strong light little water supply and humans industrial agricultural and aquaculture the two semiclosed lakes are faced with ecological function degradation and cyanobacterial blooms wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 dongting lake dtl and poyang lake pyl distributed in the midstream area ma of the yrb are hubs in water resource regulation and storage for the yrb the excessive nitrogen and phosphorus input and mining industry have caused eutrophication and hm pollution in the two yangtze river connected lakes li et al 2013 2021 shengjin lake sjl and taihu lake thl are located in the downstream area da of the yrb in recent years sjl has suffered from ecological and environmental threats such as shrinking lake areas rising nutrient levels and pollution cheng et al 2020 thl is an important freshwater resource for human and economic development in the yangtze river delta eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms occur frequently yan et al 2022 under the influence of natural and economic differences the aquatic environment of these lakes is worthy of attention and representativeness in this study sediments from 6 representative lakes along the yrb were collected to extract sediment dissolved organic matter sdom for ultrafiltration separation and fluorescence quenching experiments we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and characterized the characteristics of sdom and its metal binding behavior from mw distributions fluorophore types and functional groups by applying eem farafac 2d sf cos and 2d ftir cos then the correlations among lake sdom characteristics nutrient status and pollution levels as well as the role of sdom in lake environments were discussed to provide a reference for water environment protection and the prevention of heavy metal pollution and eutrophication in the yangtze river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample

photophobic bottles containing 10 ml sdom samples meanwhile 100 μl of kcl was added to adjust the ph and achieve valid complexation the final contents of cu2 and cd2 in solution ranged from 0 to 0 24 mg l e g 0 3 78 μm a total of 486 titrated solutions were shaken in the dark at 25 c for 24 h to achieve reaction equilibrium 2 4 measurements of optical properties the optical measurement of sdom mainly includes uv vis spectroscopy excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems including synchronous fluorescence spectra sf and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the uv vis and eems of

parafac analysis to separate different components and the rationality was verified by split half analyses the mathematical statistical process is usually operated by using the dreem toolbox of matlab r2018b detailed information has been analyzed in previous studies yamashita et al 2008 2 5 2 2d cos analysis 2d cos analysis is usually applied to describe the reaction sequence and process of dom and heavy metals hms noda 2016 the 2d cos analysis of sf 2d sf cos indicates the binding process of fluorescent substances to hms the 2d cos analysis of ftir in the functional group regions of 1800 800 cm

25 02 of the features for these variables respectively the sum of the two exceeded 80 and the kmo was 0 639 indicating an acceptable result 3 result 3 1 evaluation of typical heavy metals hms pollution in lake sediments 3 1 1 summary statistics of trophic state and hms pollution in lakes the statistical data of the physical and chemical parameters of the surface water and sediments of the 6 lakes are presented in tables s1 and s2 dcl and thl were moderately eutrophic and the sediments were enriched in nutrients including tn tp and total organic carbon toc the other lakes were mesotrophic to lightly eutrophic table s3 presents statistical data of the content ranges and pollution levels of copper cu2 and cadmium cd2 from 6 lakes the contents of cu2 in 6 lakes were nonpolluting to slightly contaminated indicating a low environmental risk however as an inescapable input for these lakes cu2 pollution may adversely affect animal and human health through enrichment and food chain transmission zhou et al 2018 various levels of cd2 pollution occurred in the 6 lakes and were thl heavily contaminated dcl and dtl moderately to heavily contaminated pyl and sjl moderately contaminated chl uncontaminated to moderately contaminated table s3 according to the investigation of heavy metals hms in the sediment of provinces along the yangtze river basin yrb the pollution levels of hms in sediments decrease from the upstream area ua to the downstream area da table s3 yan et al 2021 thus the pollution and ecological risks of cu2 and cd2 in various lakes need attention 3 1 2 characteristics of the measured hms concentrations and c n ratio in this study higher c and n contents were found in the dcl than in the other lakes anova p 0 000 table s2 the atomic c n ratio of the 6 lakes ranged from 10 70 0 30 to 13 39 1 78 indicating a mixed source of aquatic algae and terrestrial plants of sediment dissolved organic matter sdom fig 2 a zhao et al 2015 the measured values of the concentrations for cu2 and cd2 in the sediments are presented in table s4 the concentrations of cu2 and cd2 were higher in dcl dtl and chl than in the other lakes anova p 0 000 fig 2c the pollution degrees of cu2 and cd2 were evaluated by the index of geo accumulation igeo proposed by muller in 1969 muller 1969 text s5 the igeo values of cu2 in the sediments of the 6 lakes ranged from 0 66 to 1 51 indicating uncontaminated or slightly contaminated states degree ⅰ table s4 in contrast cd2 contamination was widespread igeo ranged from 0 10 to 3 92 and was relatively serious for the lakes in ua which was consistent with previous studies fig 2b yan et al 2021 3 2 spectral characteristics of sdom from lakes in the yangtze river basin the values of sediment dissolved organic carbon sdoc were 46 149 12 77 mg l for chl 82 24 11 81 mg l for dcl in the ua 18 63 5 05 mg l for dtl 24 17 6 62 mg l for pyl in the midstream area ma 20 09 5 52 mg l for sjl and 13 19 0 63 mg l for thl in the da for the yrb fig 2c higher sdoc contents were found in the lakes from the ua than in those from the other two areas anova p 0 000 0 007 the sdoc for high molecular weight hmw 1 kda 0 7 µm parts accounted for 0 42 2 98 of the bulk sdoc meaning that sdoc was basically stored in low molecular weight lmw 1 kda sdom for lakes the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectra of the 6 lakes depicted that the absorbance between 200 nm and 250 nm in dcl and chl was stronger than that in the other lakes fig 3 a the values of a254 are calculated and presented in fig 2c the higher a254 values indicated more aromatic substances in chl and dcl anova p 0 002 0 023 a strong correlation between sdoc and a254 further suggested the contribution of aromatic substances to sdoc p 0 01 the fourier transform infrared spectra ftir showed 9 types of functional groups in the 6 lakes which were phenolic or alcohol hydroxyl o h groups 3420 cm 1 amide i band c o 1640 1600 cm 1 phenolic hydroxyl o h

and table 1 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 the synchronous fluorescence sf spectra of the 6 lakes exhibited four peaks located at 230 280 325 and 370 nm fig 3c the peaks at 230 and 280 nm were tryptophan like fluorescence regions at short wavelengths 200 285 nm and the peaks at 325 and 370 nm were located in the humic like fluorescence region at long wavelengths 285 450 nm the fluorescence intensity of the peaks in the 6 lakes roughly followed the order dcl chl dtl sjl thl pyl as shown in fig 3d the sdom extracted from the 6 lake sediments contained two kinds of fluorescent substances i e tryptophan like substances peak t em ex 340 280 nm and peak s em ex 340 225 nm and humic like matter peak a em ex 450 265 nm and peak c em ex 400 315 nm although the eem spectral profiles of the 6 lakes were similar the fluorescence peak intensities of sdom from chl and dcl were relatively higher than those from the other lakes the coincident results among the uv vis sf and eem spectra highlighted the particularity of lakes in the ua of the yrb which was characterized by a high content of organic matter and strong aromaticity four fluorescence components c1 c4 were resolved from the eem parafac model fig 4 a hereinto c1 ex em 320 400 nm c2 ex em 270 365 460 nm and c4 ex em 240 400 450 nm were classified as humic like fluorophores which were similar to peaks a and c in the eem spectra c1 as a microbial humic like component was released by algae and bacterial leachate li et al 2022a murphy et al 2008 c2 and c4 were related to both terrestrial organic matter and microbial reprocessing representing organic matter with macromolecular structure gueguen et al 2011 huang et al 2019 c3 ex em 280 340 nm corresponded to the tryptophan like peaks t and s which were characterized by simple molecular structures huang et al 2019 sheng et al 2013 fig 4b showed that the fluorescence intensities f max of sdom were dcl chl dtl sjl pyl thl indicating a relatively higher content of sdom in upstream lakes than in downstream lakes independent sample t test t 5 406 p 0 033 the higher f max of humic like substances 0 67 0 06 2 15 0 31 r u vs 0 09 0 02 0 58 0 10 r u indicated its dominant position in lakes along the yrb fig 4b independent sample t test t 5 921 p 0 000 compared with the proportion of 30 12 0 33 38 50 0 09 in these lakes from ma and da the proportions of tryptophan like component c3 in the total f max were lower in the lakes from da only 2 37 0 05 20 27 0 05 fig 4c meanwhile similar distribution regularities for individual fluorescent substances were found in different mw sdom for the lakes fig 4c fig 4d described that the fi values of sdom from the 6 lakes ranged from 1 74 0 10 to 1 93 0 06 which was close to 1 9 suggesting relatively strong endogenous attributes the hix values ranged from 1 36 0 25 to 3 33 0 95 fig 4d the higher values for bix and β α suggested strong activities of biological bacteria in dcl and chl fig 4d 3 3 binding behaviors between fluorophores in sdom and hms based on 2d sf cos the sf spectra after adding cu2 and cd2 reflected that the fluorescence band decreased or increased to different degrees fig s1 more pronounced variations were presented in sdom binding to cu2 sdom cu2 than sdom binding to cd2 sdom cd2 fig s1 2d sf cos was analyzed to obtain metal binding sequences of different fluorophores fig 5 in the process of bulk sdom cu2 for the 6 lakes the wavelengths at 280 nm on the y axis appeared some negative cross peaks located at 300 320 330 360 and 370 280 nm fig 5a f positive cross peaks were found at 280 320 360 210 230 nm fig 5a f the results manifested that the bulk sdom cu2 in the 6 lakes followed a relatively accordant sequence 280 nm 300 370 nm 210 230 nm i e tryptophan like fluorophores the protein like substance at long wavelengths humic like fluorophores tyrosine fluorophores the protein like substance at short wavelengths noda 2016 after mw fractionation the negative or positive cross peaks resembled the counterparts in bulk sdom cu2 and the binding orders were not changed fig 5g r two minus cross peaks were situated at 330 345 280 nm and 280 220 230 nm in the process of sdom cd2 fig 5a1 f1 the complexation orders were 220 230 nm 280 nm 330 345 nm indicating that the protein like fluorophores reacted preferentially with cd2 in these lakes except for pyl noda 2016 compared with the lag of cu2 binding the short wavelength tyrosine substances were more sensitive and first bound to cd2 similar cross peaks and binding trends were exhibited in the process of hmw lmw sdom cd2 fig 5g1 r1 in contrast positive 300 350 280 nm cross peaks occurred in the bulk and lmw sdom cd2 for pyl and lmw sdom cd2 for sjl presenting inconsistent binding behaviors in which humic like substances reacted with cd2 before the protein like substances fig 5d1 p1 and q1 in general protein like substances possessed priority and dominance during sdom cu2 cd2 and the reaction sequence was less affected by the mw separation of sdom 3 4 binding behaviors between functional groups in sdom and hms based on 2d ftir cos the binding information of functional groups in sdom with hms cu2 and cd2 was obtained by 2d cos analysis of ftir 2d ftir cos fig s2 some minus or plus cross peaks appeared in fig 6 and their wavenumber positions were extracted in fig s3 the emergence of new peaks including 1750 1700 1560 1500 1470 1380 1320 1290 1200 1250 and 970 cm 1 remedied the problem of overlapping peaks in the linear ftir spectra table 1 zhu et al 2021 according to the noda rule noda 2016 the prior binding of chl sdom to cu2 or cd2 was aliphatic c oh f1 and crystalline cellulose f2 carboxyl c o f3 and phenolic o h f4 polysaccharides c o f5 and aromatic c h f6 amide ii n h f7 and crystalline cellulose f2 the dcl sdom binding to cu2 or cd2 complied the sequence of f2 f3 and f6 amide i c o f8 and f5 f1 aromatic n o f9 the sequence of f1 f2 f8 and f5 f6 f3 f4 was observed in the binding process of dtl sdom cu2 the sequence of f1 f3 f7 and f2 f5 and f6 f4 and f10 was found in the dtl sdom reacting with cd2 the binding sequence for pyl sdom to cu2 was f1 f5 f4 f6 f2 f3 and f8 the sequence of pyl sdom binding to cd2 was f8 f4 f7 f3 f1 f5 and f2 f6 the binding order of f8 and f2 f1 f3 f5 and f6 f9 appeared in the binding process of sjl sdom cu2 the binding sequence for sjl sdom to cd2 was f4 f1 f5 and f8 f7 f6 and f3 f2 which appeared in the binding process of sjl sdom cd2 the binding sequence of thl sdom cu2 followed f1 f5 f8 f2 f3 and f6 f9 the binding sequence of thl sdom cd2 followed f1 f8 and f5 f3 and f4 f9 and f6 for the binding processes of functional groups in sdom with different mws with cu2 or cd2 the reaction sequences were relatively unchanged the reaction process of sdom derived from the lakes except for dcl with cu2 or cd2 revealed that the aliphatic c oh f1 amide i c o f8 and polysaccharides c o f5 were primary and preferential participants in contrast carboxyl c o f3 and aromatic c h f6 were more sensitive in the process of sdom binding to cu2 or cd2 for dcl which may be associated with abundant humic like matter 3 5 quantitative characterization of hms binding behaviors based on parafac components fig 7 showed the dynamic variations in the f max of the components quenched or enhanced after adding cu2 or cd2 the fluorescence quenching constants logk were evaluated by the modified stern volmer equation to represent the binding abilities of the components table 2 the mean values of logk cu for the components were c1 c4 c2 c3 in chl c1 c4 c2 in dcl c3 c4 c2 c1 in dtl c3 c2 c4 c1 in pyl c4 c3 c1 c2 in sjl and c3 c4 c2 c1 in thl table 2 the humic like ingredients exhibited higher binding abilities with cu2 in chl and dcl in contrast stronger complexing abilities between cu2 and tryptophan like component c3 were found in dtl pyl and thl in the process of sdom cd2 for the 6 lakes only the humic like component c4 was complexed with cd2 furthermore it was clear that c4 displayed stronger binding abilities with cd2 than with cu2 in most of the lakes except for chl and thl some imponderable logk cd values implied relatively weak complexing effects between part of the fluorescent material and cd2 after fractionation of sdom the affinity of the components with cu2 was enhanced except for c3 of thl table 2 the logk cu values of sdom in most hmw factions were higher than those in the bulk and lmw counterparts for the lakes regardless of sdom type except for chl and c4 table 2 differently stronger binding behaviors with cu2 occurred in lmw sdom of chl and humic like component c4 of lmw for dtl sjl and thl in the process of sdom for different mw fractions binding to cd2 the humic like component c4 in hmw sdom possessed higher logk cd values for chl dcl and thl estimable reaction processes of component c2 with cd2 occurred in the hmw fraction for these lakes except for sjl thus the higher cd2 binding capacities of the humic like matter with hmw were found in the upstream lakes and molecular weight separation might promote cd2 complexation with some humic like fluorophores 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between sdom features and environmental state in lakes humic substances are the main component of sedimentary organic matter som in lakes accounting for 60 90 of the total som leeben et al 2014 xiao et al 2020 in this study humic like fluorophores accounted for 61 5 97 6 of sdom from the 6 lakes the significantly positive correlation between sdoc and humic like fractions verified the preponderant contribution of humic like substances in sdom of the yangtze river basin yrb fig 8 a the high linear dependence between humic like fluorophores and optical indicators i e fi bix and β α implied intense microbial bacterial activity p 0 05 which may be the result of the synergistic effect of microorganisms and photochemical degradation fig 8a the 79 7 97 6 humic like fluorophores were enriched in sdom of dcl and chl as plateau lakes they accept stronger light accompanied by elevated lake temperatures in autumn september to october which might lead to more intense photochemical and microbial degradation farias et al 2007 liu et al 2019 mckay et al 2015 yang et al 2021 on the one hand microbial degradation is mostly a process of consuming protein like materials and increasing the amount of humic like materials ren et al 2022 on the other hand cyanobacteria and phytoplankton cells use valid photosynthetic radiation from photosynthesis within the euphotic region to release organic matter and nutrients inducing an increase in doc concentration hansen et al 2016 yang et al 2021 the tryptophan like content of the middle and lower lakes was higher than that of the upper lakes which may be due to different degradation mechanisms compared with the intense photodegradation in the upstream lakes microbial degradation may play a greater role in the middle and lower lakes a similar variation has been reported in river systems mostofa et al 2007 the negative correlation between tryptophan like component c3 and the endogenous index indicated contributions from external inputs fig 8a tryptophan like materials have been considered an indicator of pollution in related studies probably coming from wastewater discharges stedmon et al 2011 sdom is usually consistent with the trophic degrees of lakes leeben et al 2014 wen et al 2022 principal component analysis pca found a corresponding connection between the fluorescence features of sdom and its nutrient level among lakes fig 8b as shown in fig 8c the dcl identified as having a moderate eutrophication grade was governed by humic like components c1 and c2 whose f max proportion reached 61 53 5 27 the f max proportion of c1 c2 ranged from 35 69 8 15 to 46 47 3 04 in pyl sjl and thl which were in light eutrophication chl and dtl whose f max proportions ranged from 34 44 2 60 to 34 62 5 96 were determined to be in the mesotrophic state fig 8c the humic like components c1 and c2 with low molecular weights have been shown to arise from microbially derived compounds from phytoplankton as well as from sun induced compounds released in extracellular polymers shammi et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 lake eutrophication is mainly a problem of phytoplankton blooms and water quality deterioration which further facilitate the generation and accumulation of autochthonous dom in sediment chen et al 2015b thus the quantity of phytoplankton derived humic like materials c1 and c2 in sediment may be considered an indicator to assess the eutrophication status of lakes in addition the relatively light trophic degree of thl might be attributed to the removal of nutrient salts by sediment dredging zhong et al 2021 4 2 exploration of the binding mechanism of sdom in lake sediment and hms although the sdom from 6 lakes was dominated by humic like materials the tryptophan like materials showed stronger affinities in the process of binding to cu2 and cd2 except for pyl in terms of functional groups aliphatic c oh amide i c o and polysaccharides c o possessed stronger attractions with cu2 and cd2 in these lightly eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes fig 9 the oxygen containing functional groups easily complexed with metal cations to form inner sphere complexes for dom from various sources showing strong metal affinities zhu et al 2021 in contrast the carboxyl c o and aromatic c h or c c preferentially bond to cu2 and cd2 in moderately eutrophic dcl fig 9 the higher proportion of humic fluorophores in dcl that might form unique functional group compositions changed the binding path of sdom cu2 cd2 wen et al 2022 a view of the larger proportion of the macromolecular humic like the higher the carboxyl group proportion of aromatic carbon had been reported zhu et al 2022 although 2d sf cos showed that protein like matter preferentially bound to cu2 or cd2 in dcl the binding process was inapplicable for the complexation model implying the occurrence of other binding mechanisms fig 5 and table 2 the π bond in the functional groups carboxyl and aromatic might have undergone a cationic π bonding interaction with the metal cation wu et al 2022 as a nonfluorescent component polysaccharides are widely involved in the response between dom and hms fan et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the binding rules of sdom with different mws and cu2 or cd2 were relatively consistent which meant that physical fractionation had little effect on the chemical structure and reaction this result was also observed in previous studies fan et al 2022 4 3 effects of sdom on the risk of hms pollution in lake sediment in this study higher cu2 binding abilities logk cu were found in the humic like ingredients for chl and dcl from ua and the tryptophan like components in the lakes dtl pyl and thl of ma and da respectively these differences in logk cu might be attributed to the source and concentration of fluorescent components the protein like material derived from wastewater and the autochthonic humic like material showed higher copper binding rates liu et al 2022 meanwhile positive correlations were found between logk cu and f amx of components in most lakes parameter in fig s4 only humic like component c4 complexed with cd2 and its complexation ability was higher than that with cu2 suggesting heterogeneity of sdom binding hms it was recorded that aromatic and hydrophobic materials were responsible for changing the form and biological availability of cd2 huang et al 2022 after the mw fraction the cu2 binding capacity of the components was enhanced the sdom components in the hmw fraction possessed higher complexation abilities in most lakes implying that increased oxygen and polarity functional groups provided more binding sites during fractionation especially in the hmw fraction li et al 2022b xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2022 in addition a related study reported that humic like components with lmw contributed to high cu2 binding by carbon sources and electron donors corresponding to c4 in this study li et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 there was no regular trend of logk cu cd values between sdom with various nutrient levels and hms and the detoxification of sdom fundamentally depended on its fluorescent components and molecular structure it is certain that the continuous release of sdom from sediment is vital in reducing the ecological risk of ubiquitous cd2 contamination in the yrb 5 conclusion sdom from 6 lakes in the yangtze river basin yrb exhibited certain differences and commonalities in optical properties and chemical structures eem parafac showed that humic like fluorophores were dominant for the sdom of these lakes the total fluorescence intensity f max of sdom from upstream was larger than that from the downstream p 0 033 in addition humic like fractions c1 and c2 exhibited a regular rank change with different trophic level classifications in each lake combined with principal component analysis pca in the process of sdom binding to cu2 or cd2 tryptophan like fluorophores and oxygen containing functional groups including aliphatic c oh amide i c o and polysaccharides c o were preferred higher cu2 binding abilities logk cu were observed in the humic like matter for dcl and chl and tryptophan like matter for the lakes from the midstream and downstream areas of the yrb respectively only humic like substances could complex with cd2 and possessed a higher binding capacity

15092,in current ultrafiltration systems limited removal for small sized contaminants and membrane fouling remain longstanding obstacles to overcome herein a novel process by simultaneous coupling powered carbon pc and fluidized granular activated carbon gac with ultrafiltration was proposed aiming to achieve high effluent quality and mitigated membrane fouling this study conducted mechanistic explorations on the performances of different shaped gac particles on fouling control and pc release during fluidization meanwhile comparing the utilizations of powdered activated carbon pac and biochar in terms of their adsorption deposition and interactions with aquatic contaminants during filtration the results showed that the effluent cod of biochar uf was slightly higher than pac uf attributed to lower specific surface area and pore volume present on biochar compared with pac uf the biochar uf without fluidized gac exhibited higher fouling propensity due to more organics attached on membranes via bridging with ca2 released by the biochar concurrently distinct morphologies were found for pac and biochar depositions where pac uniformly dispersed on membranes but biochar tended to agglomerate interestingly fluidized spherical gac rgac with highest particle momentum and least energy consumption appeared highly effective in reducing fouling associated with biochar and the overall fouling rate of rgac biochar uf was even lower than rgac pac uf system more importantly substantial amount of small sized pc was released by two cylindrical shaped gacs which were determined to be around 12 16 mg l in contrast to merely 3 4 mg l produced from rgac consequently the rgac biochar uf system achieved commensurate effluent quality but better permeability than rgac pac uf along with a 20 expenditure saved which might be a promising water treatment system more suitable for large scale applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration granular activated carbon gac biochar powdered activated carbon pac powdered carbon release data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite widely industrial scale applications current ultrafiltration uf process still meets several perennial challenges including limited removal for small molecular contaminants and tenacious fouling issue etc cai et al 2021 gao et al 2022 modified uf process by combining with powdered activated carbon pac adsorption has been proved to be an efficient process to improve water quality nonetheless there are limited full scale applications of such pac uf process especially the integrated pac uf because of severe uf fouling and the more prominent fact that pac unavoidably contacts with the membranes which possibly undermines the performance of filtration stoquart et al 2012 previously considerable efforts suggested that large amount of pac deposited on uf membrane resulting in a greatly increased filtration resistance for instance oh et al investigated the effect of pac addition on hollow fiber ultrafiltration system and found that the daily pac mass loading on membrane surface was estimated to be 117 g m2 d which could not be removed even by backwashing oh et al 2006 besides pac was reported to increase membrane fouling rate in the form of cake layer jiang et al 2020 in this context current pac uf process in practical application is preferentially set as a separated configuration with an individual pac separator which leads to higher capital and operating costs stoquart et al 2012 others would choose coagulation replacing pac but may compromise effluent quality zhang et al 2005 traditional methods for mitigating membrane fouling include water backwashing or chemical cleaning etc both of which cannot continuously control fouling development or pac deposition on membranes more importantly it was reported that backwashing seemed not effective in removing pac attachment or other recalcitrant foulants oh et al 2006 in recent years the method of using liquid solid fluidization means to continuously mitigate membrane fouling has gained increasing attentions mainly due to the advantages of low energy consumption and simple operation in recent few studies a variety of fluidized particles were employed to alleviate membrane fouling in mbr systems among which millimeter sized granular activated carbon gac was generally preferred owing to its low cost suitable particle density around 1500 g m3 and porous structure pradhan et al 2012 siembida et al 2010 up to date fluidized gac particles have been successfully utilized in membrane bioreactor mbr for a long term operation for example yu et al operated a mbr with the assistance of fluidized gac for approximate 70 days and found the addition of gac effectively reduced membrane fouling rate by 57 1 yu et al 2020 similar investigation by shin et al coupled gac fluidization with anaerobic mbr where membrane fouling was well controlled for 485 days without chemical cleaning shin et al 2014 all of these studies verified that using fluidized gac was an effective approach to control membrane fouling in an environmental friendly way thus could be potentially employed in the gac pac uf system where severe pac deposition and uf fouling simultaneously occurred in the proposed gac pac uf system pac is responsible for adsorbing contaminants and improving permeate quality while fluidized gac particles are targeted for mitigating pac deposition and uf fouling previously we have reported the performance of such gac pac uf system achieving a maximum of 45 8 fouling removal and similar effluent quality as compared with pac uf process yu et al 2022 nevertheless such integrated water treatment process still suffers from several challenges firstly the governing fouling control mechanism is attributed to momentum transfer between gac particles and membrane wu et al 2017 which could be significantly influenced by different gac shapes for instance r escudie et al explored the effect of teflon particle shapes on the mixing and segregation of a liquid fluidized bed which was greatly varied attributed to differentiated turbulence enhancement produced during particle fluidization escudié et al 2006 secondly the expenditure of using pac as adsorbent is relatively high undermining the feasibility of employing such gac pac uf process in large scale water treatment process given such situation biochar was reported to have abundant microporous structure and strong adsorption performance leng et al 2021 tan et al 2021 more importantly the cost of biochar is merely half the price of pac campbell et al 2018 providing the opportunities to be applied in such integrated system however biochar and pac are derived from different carbonaceous substances resulting in their discrepant properties and behaviors in adsorption and deposition besides the fouling mechanisms of pac uf and biochar uf processes are complicated where pac biochar adsorbs organics accompanied by depositing on membrane surface in the literature numerous studies have been documented on the mechanism of pac acting on membranes vindicating that pac and organic substances had synergistic effect on fouling formation shao et al 2016 in contrast limited work was devoted to investigating biochar deposition as well as biochar associated fouling characteristics based on the current challenges of such novel gac pac uf process the aim of this study is to fundamentally explore i the performance of different shaped gac particles i e spherical short cylindrical and long cylindrical gac particles on fouling mitigation and their detailed action mechanisms ii the viability of using biochar as an alternative to replace pac with their exhaustive deposition behaviors and interactions with water contaminants unveiled during filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials and preparations surface water in this experiment was collected from north lake of beijing institute of technology liang xiang campus with its detailed characteristics displayed in table s1 the polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membranes were ordered from beijing separate company with the mean molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 kda before experiments the flat sheet membrane was soaked in deionized water for 24 h its permeability was measured by using deionized water at room temperature pac was purchased from cabot corporation usa while biochar made from the wheat straw was ordered from henan xingnuo company china in order to minimize the influence of size effect on pac and biochar performances original pac original biochar p biochar and ground biochar g biochar were used in the study for comparison purpose the g biochar was obtained by grinding p biochar in an agate mortar then manually sieved and collected using 12 µm and 18 µm standard sieves the mean particle size of pac g biochar and p biochar was measured to be 13 46 2 24 µm 15 72 2 10 µm and 92 3 3 20 µm by a mastersizer malvern england respectively gac particles were ordered from huanyu company china to ease the comparison each gac particle with varied shapes was prepared to possess a constant particle volume of around 5 2 mm3 specifically spherical gac rgac particles with the mean diameter of 2 15 mm were sieved by collecting the particles intercepted between 2 00 mm and 2 30 mm sieves short cylindrical particles sgac with the diameter of 4 mm were trimmed to the length of 0 4 mm while the long cylindrical particles lgac with the diameter of 1 5 mm were cut to the length of 3 mm the dimensions of obtained gac particles were further affirmed by a micrometer before experiment gac particles were soaked in lake water until adsorption saturation to refrain from their influences on pac biochar adsorption factually millimeter sized gac particles have limited adsorption on aqueous contaminants due to the large particle size and small specific surface area and cannot replace pac biochar in the integrated water treatment process 2 2 characterization of pac and biochar the specific surface area and pore characteristics of powdered carbon pc i e pac and biochar were tested by automatic surface and porosity analyzer ankersmid belsorp max netherlands the water contact angle of pc was determined by a contact angle analyzer data physics oca 15e through the sessile drop method briefly pac or biochar was adhered onto glass slides with double sided adhesive tape and further compacted into flakes thereafter a water droplet with volume of 2 μl dropped on the pc surface to acquire the static water contact angle the measurement was repeated at five different locations fourier transform infrared spectra ftir of pc were detected by a nicolet is10 spectrometer thermo fisher scientific us with the wavenumber range of 500 4000 cm 1 prior to measurement pc samples were sufficiently dried compacted into flakes and cut into 1 cm 1 cm sheet for testing in addition the zeta potentials of pc were measured by a nanosizer malvern england and each measurement was repeated at least 6 times 2 3 experimental setup and operation conditions the schematic diagram of the experimental setup depicted in fig 1 was a liquid solid fluidization membrane filtration system whereby 100 mg pc was added to 2 l feed water to achieve the pc concentration of 50 mg l and gac particles were filled into membrane cells reaching to 50 of cell volume multiply metal meshes with a diameter of around 0 5 mm were placed on the top and bottom of the cell aiming to allow pc to flow through while prevent the entrainment of gac the uf membrane with effective area of 0 002 m2 was exposed to influent water and fluidized gac particles the rest of which was covered by scotch tapes aiming to avoid the influence of pac entrapment in the edge gaps of membrane cells therefore the tmp changes were merely caused by this exposed part of the membrane a calibrated digital gear pump cole parmer us was employed to provide circulating liquid velocity u l required for gac fluidization in this study different u 1 were required for the different shaped gac particles to achieve a fixed fluidized bed height of 100 mm where the membrane surfaces could be entirely scoured by the fluidized particles during the experiment the setup was operated at a constant flux of 30 l m2 h controlled by a peristaltic pump cole parmer usa and the transmembrane pressure tmp was measured by two pressure transmitters cole parmer us mounted on both the inlet and outlet of the membrane cell with labview software automatically recording the data at a time interval of 10 s each of the filtration tests was operated 300 min and the fouled membrane was autopsied for further analysis 2 4 fouling resistance measurement and fouling observation the resistance in series model was applied to analyze various fouling resistances according to the eqs 1 2 as follows 1 r t δ p μ j 2 r t r m r c r p where r t r m r c r p represent the total resistance m 1 membrane resistance m 1 cake layer resistance m 1 and pore blocking resistance m 1 respectively δ p is the tmp across membrane kpa μ is the viscosity of feed water pa s j is the permeate flux l m2 h briefly r m and r t were determined by directly filtering deionized water through virgin and fouled uf membrane after carefully wiping the pc and other foulants deposited on fouled membrane r m r p could be obtained by filtrating deionized water through the wiped membrane then r c and r p were acquired based on eq 2 the morphology of fouling layer was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra55 germany after thoroughly dried by a freeze dryer beijing boyikang experimental instrument company china the surface pictures of fouled membranes were randomly taken and at least 5 pictures were captured for each observation 2 5 deposited pc amount measurement and extraction of membrane foulants after the operation the deposited pc and other foulants attached on the membrane were collected by a brush then transferred into the vial with 30 ml deionized water thereafter the pc was separated from the suspension by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 20 min and resuspended in 30 ml deionized water the turbidity of the suspension was measured using a turbidity meter sanxin company china to quantify the amount of deposited pc according to the pervious method by shao et al shao et al 2017 fig s1 proved that the adsorbent concentrations and suspension turbidities had good linear relationships with r 2 values of 0 999 thus the mass of pc deposited on the membrane could be obtained by multiplying the pc concentration by the sample volume in addition the supernatant containing soluble foulants obtained by centrifugation was further filtered through 0 45 μm filters for further characterization 2 6 analysis of effluent quality and foulant composition the water qualities of effluents and corresponding foulant samples extracted above were further analyzed specifically chemical oxygen demand codmn was measured in accordance to the standard method tan et al 2021 meanwhile ion contents in terms of ca2 and mg2 were determined by hach spectrophotometer dr1900 hach using hach commercial hardness determination kit then each concentration obtained from test was further converted to the actual ion concentration based on the atomic mass of ca mg the measurements of codmn and ion contents were repeated three times with the mean value represented excitation emission matrix eem spectra of each sample were detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan for analyzing the componential information briefly excitation scans were set from 200 to 500 nm at 10 nm intervals for each excitation wavelength emission wavelengths range were set to 250 550 nm with 2 nm stepping the scanning speed were constantly set at 1200 nm min for all the samples with the excitation and emission slits of 10 nm furthermore the analysis of fluorescence regional integration fri method was conducted to quantitively present the volumetric percentages of each component based on a previous method in the literature cai et al 2016 to provide the accurate data comparison among various water samples all of the eem determinations were performed by the same instrument within one day the first region and second region raleigh scatterings in the spectra were all subtracted from accounting the peak area in each region by using origin 2018b in order to avoid probable effect of raleigh scattering 2 7 hydrodynamic characteristics of fluidized gac particles to further demonstrate the mechanisms of fouling mitigation and possible pc release by gac particles during fluidization the hydrodynamics of fluidized gac particles with regard to particle velocity particle concentration and particle momentum were characterized via the high speed image analysis a high speed camera hua teng vision camera china was employed to capture the videos of fluidized gac particles to fair the comparison all the videos were captured at membrane height of 30 mm during the steady state fluidization each recording lasted for around 10 12 s where the capture frequency was 90 hz i e 1 s recorded 90 images afterwards the captured videos were first decomposed into continuous images via imagej software each of the gac particles in the images identified with their central locations were manually labeled then the coordinates x y of each gac particle could be extracted from the imagej after calibration the fluidized particle velocity v p as well as other parameters i e particle concentration momentum etc could be calculated according to the coordinates the details of hydrodynamic parameter characterization were provided in supplementary information for each video at least 1200 gac particle velocities were achieved wang et al 2016 2 8 energy consumption analysis the energy consumption of gac fluidization per effluent product e p kwh m3 was calculated by eqs 3 4 according to a previous study wang et al 2020 3 e p e r 3600 q p where qp m3 s is the permeate flowrate er kw is the energy requirement approximated obtained by eq 4 4 e r δ p b e d q f where q f m3 s is the circulation flowrate i e 1 50 10 5 1 83 10 5 2 16 10 5 m3 s for rgac sgac and lgac δ p bed kpa is the pressure drop across fluidization bed that can be calculated from eq 5 wang et al 2017 5 δ p bed ρ p ρ 1 ε mf gl where ρ p 1480 kg

ε mf is the bed voidage at minimum fluidization condition that is calculated based on eq 6 wang et al 2017 yang 2003 6 ε m f 0 415 φ 0 483 where φ is particle sphericity that is obtained from the images of different shaped gac particles using the following eq 7 wadell 1933 wang et al 2018 7 φ 2 a π d c m i n where a is the projected area of gac particle d cmin is the diameter of the minimum circumscribed circle around gac particle 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of pc type on fouling formation and water treatment performance 3 1 1 characterization of pac and biochar pac is typically obtained from a variety of carbonaceous substances e g coal wood while biochar is generally originated from straws husks manure etc which leads to remarkable differences in their properties abhishek et al 2022 krahnstöver and wintgens 2018 in the current study pac and biochar we used were made from coal and wheat straw respectively as displayed in table 1 the specific surface area and pore volume of pac were dramatically larger than those of original biochar p biochar and ground biochar g biochar although the mean size of pac and g biochar particles was roughly similar especially the specific surface area of pac which was 931 46 m2 g was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of biochar i e ranging from 74 9 m2 g to 75 99 m2 g the saturation of three adsorbents could be indicated by testing adsorption kinetic curves which were added in fig s2 of supporting information suggesting both pac and biochar reached saturation after 4 h meanwhile the final saturation adsorption capacity of pac p biochar and g biochar for cod was 102 2 56 2 and 59 1 mg cod g respectively regarding surface charge the zeta potentials of the all pcs were negative with pac more negatively charged than p biochar and g biochar as shown in fig 2 a pac surface was hydrophobic with contact angle of 124 2 whereas biochar surface was found to be hydrophilic with the contact angle of around 55 this was probably because the surface of biochar contained numerous hydrophilic groups as witnessed by ftir spectra in fig 2 b the peak intensities of biochar especially the oh appearing at 3420 cm 1 were significantly higher than that of pac indicating more hydroxyl groups present on the biochar surface in addition c o at 1630 cm 1 and co at 1100 cm 1 associated with carboxyl groups zhang et al 2019 were also higher on biochar surfaces contributing to the hydrophilic properties 3 1 2 water treatment effectiveness the effluents collected from various uf associated systems after operation were further analyzed as observed from fig 3a the cod of uf effluents was significantly decreased with pac or biochar addition which was due to their capabilities to adsorb contaminants from surface water comparatively the effluent cod value of biochar uf was slightly higher than that of pac uf which could be explained by the larger specific surface area and pore volume of pac displayed in table 1 hardness is also an important criterion for reflecting water quality it should be mentioned that ca2 was not detected in the permeate which could be explained by the following points i ca2 could cross link with natural organic matter nom and readily deposit on the membrane surface to form serious membrane fouling ahn et al 2008 ii ca2 was easy to precipitate especially when the alkalinity of the feed water was high e g 121 11 mg l as caco3 in this study in contrast mg2 was detectable in all of the effluents and after adding pac biochar the mg2 contents in the effluents decreased fig 3a it was interesting to find that the removal rate of mg2 by p biochar or g biochar was slightly higher than that of pac which could be interpreted by the fact that the surface of biochar contained a large number of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups enhancing the adsorption of mg2 fig 2b in the literature it was also reported that the surface of biochar contained abundant hydroxyl and carbonyl groups which significantly enhanced the adsorption of the ions kamali et al 2021 kołodyńska et al 2018 niazi et al 2018 previous studies also showed that biochar prepared from wheat straw was also rich in co3 2 which could act as additional adsorption sites to form precipitation with ca2 and mg2 thus contributing to increased adsorption with these ions bashir et al 2018 pan et al 2013 to reveal the organic components in effluent the relationship between the fluorescent components and the eem spectra regions was established as follows regions i and ii ex em 200 250 200 380 nm simple aromatic protein like substances region iii ex em 200 250 380 500 nm fulvic acid like materials region iv ex em 250 280 200 380 nm soluble microbial byproduct like substances region v ex em 280 500 380 500 nm humic acid like substances cai et al 2016 fig 3b showed that single uf seemed less effective for removing humic acid like substances with smaller molecular sizes while pac uf or biochar uf processes effectively improved effluent quality mainly attributed to the enhanced adsorption of small sized contaminants in addition according to the literature the saturated adsorbents suspended in feed water could be separated via sedimentation coagulation or filtration by microsieves cloth filters etc krahnstover and wintgens 2018 vu et al 2014 then new regenerated adsorbents were cycled back to feed tank the detailed regeneration methods for pac and biochar included thermal chemical and electrochemical treatments etc okwadha et al 2009 yuan et al 2016 3 1 3 membrane fouling propensity fig 4a depicted the fouling performances of uf filtration coupled with pac biochar the uf alone without pac biochar was conducted as reference where the final tmp reached 25 83 kpa after 300 min operation apparently 50 mg l pac biochar addition accelerated uf fouling development significantly comparatively the minimum tmp rise of 13 4 mpa was observed in the filtration with pac uf and the maximum tmp rise was 26 2 mpa found in the filtration with g biochar uf in addition the tmp increase of p biochar uf was still higher than that of pac uf despite relatively larger size of p biochar uf in contrast to pac as shown in fig 4b pac biochar addition mainly led to an obvious increase of r c rather than r p because the size range of pc i e 13 46 96 3 μm was much larger than pore diameter of uf membrane 3 1 4 pc deposition on membrane surface the amounts of pac biochar attached on the membrane surface were determined fig 5 indicated that the deposition amount of g biochar on the membrane surface reaching to 2 41 g m2 which was significantly higher than that of p biochar i e only 1 57 g m2 in fact based on the characterization results shown in table 1 the primary difference between p biochar and g biochar lied on the particle size which significantly varied from 92 3 µm to 15 72 µm besides the slight difference in their surface charge i e 21 5 mv for p biochar and 18 1 mv for g biochar might affect the deposition amount of biochar where the less charged surface of g biochar weakened the repulsive interactions with negatively charged uf membrane thus contributing to its attachment on membrane surface more importantly the deposited amount of g biochar was still slightly higher than that of pac i e 2 23 g m2 although their particle sizes were similar since the zeta potential of pac surface appeared to be more negatively charged than g biochar table 1 there exhibited much stronger repulsions between pac particles as well as pac membrane during pac deposition resulting in less adherence than g biochar besides it was reported that the adsorption of humic acid like contaminants by pac also contributed to an increase in the repulsion between pacs shao et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 4 p biochar uf process presented higher fouling propensity as compared with pac uf but the deposited amount of p biochar was found to be much lower implying that pc deposition was not the dominant reason responsible for the fouling herein further comparisons regarding fouling morphology and compositions were performed the morphologies of pac biochar fouling layers were further observed by sem both membranes fouled by pac biochar suspensions in real surface water as well as di water were compared it was intriguing that distinct deposition patterns were found for pac and biochar when suspended in di water original pac uniformly dispersed on membranes in contrast p biochar and g biochar were inclined to agglomerate and did not fully cover membrane surface the aggregation of biochar was probably attributed to ca2 released by biochar in fact the presence of a certain amount of calcium compounds on biochar surface had been reported in numerous papers bashir et al 2018 nan et al 2021 in this study the amount of ca2 released by g biochar in di water was determined to be approximately 60 6 4 9 mg g in contrast to merely 5 8 1 2 mg g found for pac the details of which were displayed in table s2 of supplementary materials these released ca2 might bridge biochar particles together by the interacting on with hydroxyl or carbonyl groups on biochar surfaces resulting in the agglomeration of biochar zhang et al 2022 in the scenario of surface water the deposition morphology of pc did not change significantly except for additional attachment of aquatic contaminants observed on membrane surface fig 6 3 1 5 analysis of membrane foulants the foulants on membrane surface after removing the deposited pc were characterized and shown in fig 7 the codmn results indicated that the amount of total contaminants attached on membrane surface was significantly increased for biochar uf systems as compared with uf alone or pac uf this was possibly elucidated by the fact that more ca2 and mg2 released from biochar table s2 which could readily interact with negatively charged contaminants thus facilitating the enlargement of foulant size and the subsequent aggregation on membrane surface kamali et al 2021 nan et al 2021 consistent with this result it was reported that both of sodium alginate and humic acid could cross link with the biochar via ca2 bridging leading to their enhanced depositions on membrane surface zhang et al 2022 fig 7b suggested that the foulants on membrane surface entrained a large amount of ca2 which manifested the previous speculation in section 3 1 2 that most of ca2 was retained by membranes leading to the undetectable content present in effluent for p biochar uf and g biochar uf systems the ca2 contents on the membrane surface reached to 226 6 mg m2 and 211 3 mg m2 respectively which were 19 7 and 11 6 higher than pac uf system 189 3 mg m2 this phenomenon was again owing to the more ca2 release from biochar as described above resulting in more contaminants and ca2 retention on membrane surface additionally the mg2 content on membrane surface did not exhibited much differences and there was no significant variation in the foulant composition between pac uf system and biochar uf system 3 2 effect of gac particle shape on fouling mitigation and water treatment 3 2 1 performance of mitigating membrane fouling and pc deposition as illustrated in fig 4 both pac uf and biochar uf systems caused severe fouling due to the significant depositions of contaminants and pc when treating real surface water herein a novel system by simultaneous coupling fluidized gac particles and pc with uf was proposed in order to effectively control membrane fouling and improve effluent quality fig 8 displayed the performances of three different shaped gac particles i e spherical gac rgac short cylindrical gac sgac and long cylindrical gac lgac on membrane fouling control during 300 min filtration pac uf system presented a sharp tmp increase with calculated fouling rate of 0 046 kpa min while coupling fluidized rgac particles obviously reduced membrane fouling rate by 53 9 in contrast to 43 0 for sgac and 28 2 for lgac similarly p biochar uf combined with fluidized gac also exhibited consistent results but better performance for fouling mitigation as evidenced by 76 4 76 1 and 70 decrease in fouling rate observed for rgac sgac and lgac respectively as a consequence rgac with spherical structure featured the best membrane fouling mitigation effectiveness especially in alleviating biochar associated fouling furthermore coupling with the three shaped gac particles resulted in a significant decrease in r c which was attributed to the strong scouring of fluidized gac exerted on cake layer interestingly rgac and sgac also led to the decreases of r p which might attribute to the occurrence of gac induced liquid turbulence leading to the decreased probability of contaminants entering into membrane pores apparently sgac and lgac had weaker capability on reducing membrane fouling especially lgac which appeared not effective in mitigating pore blockage red circles in fig 8c 8e as a consequence coupling rgac resulted in a membrane fouling rate of 0 021 kpa min for the pac uf while 0 017 kpa min for g biochar uf system further indicating that rgac was more effective in reducing fouling caused by biochar the overall fouling rate of rgac g biochar uf system was even lower than rgac pac uf system although the fouling propensity of pac uf without gac particles was significantly higher than g biochar uf fig 4a these results further implied that biochar causing fouling increase could be successfully compensated via combining with fluidized rgac particles under the scouring of fluidized gac particles the amounts of pac biochar deposited on membrane surface were also dramatically alleviated fig 9 specifically pac with the amount of 2231 9 mg m2 appeared on membrane surface when operated pac uf system while only 396 4 mg m2 507 8 mg m2 and 595 2 mg m2 pac were found when coupled with fluidized rgac sgac and lgac respectively this indicated that fluidized gac particles reduced more than 70 of pac deposition especially rgac whose capability for removing deposited pac reached to 82 2 in agreement with these results combinations with rgac sgac and lgac with biochar uf systems again strikingly reduced the biochar depositions following the order of rgac sgac lgac and highest biochar removal rate of 82 3 occurred in the scenario of rac g biochar uf rgac exhibited higher effectiveness in removing pc than sgac and lgac and consequently resulted in the similar deposition amounts of pac p biochar and g biochar i e ranging from 396 4 to 438 7 mg m2 3 2 2 performance of mitigating membrane foulants the foulants after removing pc were further characterized with the results shown in fig 10 apart from the capability to alleviate pc deposition the fluidized gac particles could assist to reduce other foulants adhered on membrane surface to varying degrees regarding pac uf system the cod amount of attached foulants with fluidized rgac sgac and lgac decreased by 38 7 34 7 and 34 1 respectively comparatively in biochar uf system the performance was more desirable with 42 4 46 2 42 1 and 38 7 of cod decrease obtained for rgac sgac and lgac fig 10c d showed that ca2 was more inclined to adhere on membrane surface than mg2 and coupling with three fluidized gacs was able to alleviate ion attachment especially for ca2 consistent with the results above rgac again exhibited strongest fouling control performance in terms of foulant cod and ions removal additionally fig 10e f showed the componential proportions of membrane foulants obviously after combined with fluidized gacs membrane foulants were still mainly dominated by humic acid like substances which accounted for more than 70 of the total foulants while gac shape had negligible impact on the foulant composition 3 2 3 influences on the water treatment of integrated gac pc uf process fig 11 exhibited the effluent quality in the various systems with and without fluidized gac particles although fig 3 demonstrated that the effluent quality increased after adding pac biochar limited changes were found in the effluent codmn and ion contents after coupling with various shaped gac particles notably the addition of gacs substantially increased proportion of humic acid like substances in the effluents of pac uf fig 11e probably because of less cake layer formed causing the weakened retention for small sized contaminants intriguingly negligible influences of such gac scouring appeared on the effluent composition of biochar uf fig 11f the overall effluent quality for rgac pac uf and rgac biochar uf systems were roughly similar with the total cod values of 13 6 13 9 mg l and mg2 contents of 7 4 7 5 mg l however it should be noted that the effluent quality might change with a long term operation or more complex water matrix due to the substantial variations in the pac and biochar properties table 1 and the applications of this system to treat more complex water wastewater sources during a long term operation will be evaluated in the next stage work 3 2 4 powdered carbon release from fluidized gac during gac fluidization it can be expected that there exists significant frictions and collisions between gac particles potentially triggering the release of powdered carbon during operation recently even though increasing evidences suggested the effectiveness of using fluidized particles on fouling control mostly in mbr it was noteworthy that no relevant studies in the literature explored the pc release issue during gac fluidization presumably the pc released by gac may further adsorb contaminants and improve effluent quality meanwhile adversely deposit on membrane surface besides the deposition of pc released by fluidized gac particles probably has a certain impact on the fouling layer structure fig 12a b showed the size distributions of pc released by fluidized sgac and lgac after 300 min filtration both of which were concentrated within the range of 1 µm to 10 µm close to the mean size of pac i e 13 46 µm in contrast the pc released by rgac was in a broader distribution between 1 µm and 100 µm moreover fig 11d displayed the total amounts of pc released by lgac and sgac were 16 3 mg l and 12 1 mg l respectively as compared to merely 3 4 mg l by rgac considering the fact that original pac biochar content added in feed solution was 50 mg l for this study such high amount of pc release around 12 16 mg l by sgac and lgac should remarkably affect the operation of integrated water treatment system as witnessed by fig 8 more pc deposition and severer fouling were observed for sgac and lgac than rgac implying that coupling lgac and sgac had less mitigation effect on membrane fouling one possible explanation lied on the fact that lgac and sgac released a large amount of pc during fluidization causing the increased amounts of deposited pc and membrane foulants figs 9 and 10 consistent with the results wu et al investigated the behavior of fluidized gac in a hybrid gac microfiltration process and found that the presence of gac led to an increase of water turbidity by 20 30 ntu and the fine carbon particles released by gac readily deposited on the membrane surface enhancing irreversible fouling wu et al 2014 pang et al also observed the average gac loss after 8 cycles of filtration and backwashing was approximately 0 33 and pc was released into the backwash and filtration effluent pang et al 2005 furthermore since lgac mainly released smaller sized pc these micro scaled particles might readily cause pore blockage demonstrating the negligible r p removal by lgac shown in fig 8b and d 3 3 mechanisms of membrane fouling control and economic analysis the mechanisms of fluidized gac on fouling mitigation and corresponding pc release were further explored according to the hydrodynamic analysis of gac with different shapes fig 13a b showed the statistical analysis of v p in the forms of probability distribution and whisker box plots obviously rgac had the broader v p distribution than other two particles i e lgac and sgac indicative of the more difference in particle velocities associated with the more spherical shape moreover rgac had the highest average particle velocity among the three shapes fig 13c this phenomenon suggested that the spherical shaped gac could achieve higher shear rate than others thus benefitting the fouling reduction at the same packing ratio of 50 lgac achieved highest particle concentration but lowest particle momentum followed by sgac and rgac fig 13d the higher particle concentration associated with lgac and sgac suggested that this type of gac shape could reduce the fluidization bed voidage while the interactions between fluidized particles were enhanced which strengthened the particle particle collisions thus exhausting the particle momentums this contributed to explain why lgac and sgac had much lower particle momentum than rgac shown in fig 13d such higher particle concentration and more particle particle collisions of cylindrical shaped gac i e lgac and sgac probably caused by interlocking effects which further contributed to the significant release of pc as evidenced by 16 3 mg l and 12 1 mg l pc released by lgac and sgac as compared to merely 3 4 mg l pc produced from rgac fig 12d fig 14a illustrated that rgac was more conducive to alleviating membrane fouling due to strong particle momentum and mechanical scouring acting on membrane surface and less pc release achieving lowest fouling rate and pc deposition among three shaped gac particles besides the energy consumption required for gac fluidization was further calculated which was only 0 047 kwh m3 for rgac as compared with 0 066 kwh m3 and 0 075 kwh m3 for sgac and lgac respectively this demonstrated that rgac achieved the optimal fouling control performance at the expense of lowest energy consumption fig 14b exhibited the discrepant fouling mechanisms caused by pac and biochar during filtration as well as compared the performances and expenses of using pac and biochar in the integrated gac pc uf water treatment system apparently the pc deposition amount and effluent cod between rgac pac uf and rgac biochar uf were similar however membrane fouling rate of rgac pac uf was higher than rgac biochar uf more importantly the expenditure of using pac was significantly higher than biochar it was believed that the regeneration cost of pac was roughly 40 60 of its market price market price around 5000 rmb t in china shao et al 2013 while was 50 80 for biochar market price around 3000 rmb t in china ahmed et al 2016 dai et al 2019 singh and srivastava 2022 on the condition of using 50 mg l pc and daily regeneration during 30 d running at a constant flux of 30 l m3 d the estimated expenditure of pc purchase and regeneration was around 0 18 rmb m3 for pac while was 0 14 rmb m3 for biochar this implied a 20 expenditure saving if pac was replaced by biochar with better permeability and commensurate effluent quality consequently gac biochar uf might be a promising water treatment system more suitable for large scale applications the system not only achieves effective removal of organic matter from the water but also operates without a sharp rise in tmp in addition biochar has more significant economic benefits instead of pac the future prospect of this study involves two perspectives i verifying the performance of such gac pc uf water treatment process in a large scale reactor during long term operation ii exploring the effectiveness of such gac pc uf process in removing emerging micropollutants e g drugs endocrine disruptors disinfection by products and corresponding improvement strategies meanwhile it should be noted that this proposed system can be employed to treat a variety of water bodies such as surface water groundwater effluents from wwtps as well as some lightly polluted wastewater etc since pac biochar adsorption and uf retention have no selectivity for most of aquatic contaminants kim et al 2019 loewenberg et al 2014 mohammadi and esmaeelifar 2005 mozia and tomaszewska 2004 in this work we just used surface water as a representative water matrix which was commonly treated by traditional pac uf biochar uf processes mozia and tomaszewska 2004 oh et al 2006 definitely the applications of this system to treat more complex water wastewater will be evaluated in the future studies 4 conclusions based on the current challenges of the novel gac pac uf process this study mainly focused on exploring the performance of different shaped gac particles on membrane fouling control and unveiling the behaviors of pac and biochar in terms of adsorption and deposition during operation the primary conclusions can be drawn as follows the water treatment effectiveness of pac uf with the effluent codmn of 11 7 mg l was slightly better than that of biochar uf with 12 1 12 4 mg l codmn in effluent the amount of g biochar deposited on membrane surface reaching 2 41 g m3 was higher than that of pac 2 23 g m3 accompanied by distinct deposition patterns where original pac uniformly dispersed on membranes while biochar was inclined to agglomerate coupling rgac with pac biochar uf process achieved the optimal fouling mitigation at the expense of lowest energy consumption with the least pc release of merely 3 4 mg l comparatively sgac and lgac had weakened capabilities on fouling reduction especially lgac who released 16 2 mg l small sized pc probably causing severer membrane fouling biochar associated fouling could be successfully compensated via combining with fluidized rgac a 20 expenditure was saved if pac was replaced by biochar with achieving commensurate effluent quality but better permeability which implied the integrated rgac biochar uf might be a promising water treatment system more suitable for large scale applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15092,in current ultrafiltration systems limited removal for small sized contaminants and membrane fouling remain longstanding obstacles to overcome herein a novel process by simultaneous coupling powered carbon pc and fluidized granular activated carbon gac with ultrafiltration was proposed aiming to achieve high effluent quality and mitigated membrane fouling this study conducted mechanistic explorations on the performances of different shaped gac particles on fouling control and pc release during fluidization meanwhile comparing the utilizations of powdered activated carbon pac and biochar in terms of their adsorption deposition and interactions with aquatic contaminants during filtration the results showed that the effluent cod of biochar uf was slightly higher than pac uf attributed to lower specific surface area and pore volume present on biochar compared with pac uf the biochar uf without fluidized gac exhibited higher fouling propensity due to more organics attached on membranes via bridging with ca2 released by the biochar concurrently distinct morphologies were found for pac and biochar depositions where pac uniformly dispersed on membranes but biochar tended to agglomerate interestingly fluidized spherical gac rgac with highest particle momentum and least energy consumption appeared highly effective in reducing fouling associated with biochar and the overall fouling rate of rgac biochar uf was even lower than rgac pac uf system more importantly substantial amount of small sized pc was released by two cylindrical shaped gacs which were determined to be around 12 16 mg l in contrast to merely 3 4 mg l produced from rgac consequently the rgac biochar uf system achieved commensurate effluent quality but better permeability than rgac pac uf along with a 20 expenditure saved which might be a promising water treatment system more suitable for large scale applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration granular activated carbon gac biochar powdered activated carbon pac powdered carbon release data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite widely industrial scale applications current ultrafiltration uf process still meets several perennial challenges including limited removal for small molecular contaminants and tenacious fouling issue etc cai et al 2021 gao et al 2022 modified uf process by combining with powdered activated carbon pac adsorption has been proved to be an efficient process to improve water quality nonetheless there are limited full scale applications of such pac uf process especially the integrated pac uf because of severe uf fouling and the more prominent fact that pac unavoidably contacts with the membranes which possibly undermines the performance of filtration stoquart et al 2012 previously considerable efforts suggested that large amount of pac deposited on uf membrane resulting in a greatly increased filtration resistance for instance oh et al investigated the effect of pac addition on hollow fiber ultrafiltration system and found that the daily pac mass loading on membrane surface was estimated to be 117 g m2 d which could not be removed even by backwashing oh et al 2006 besides pac was reported to increase membrane fouling rate in the form of cake layer jiang et al 2020 in this context current pac uf process in practical application is preferentially set as a separated configuration with an individual pac separator which leads to higher capital and operating costs stoquart et al 2012 others would choose coagulation replacing pac but may compromise effluent quality zhang et al 2005 traditional methods for mitigating membrane fouling include water backwashing or chemical cleaning etc both of which cannot continuously control fouling development or pac deposition on membranes more importantly it was reported that backwashing seemed not effective in removing pac attachment or other recalcitrant foulants oh et al 2006 in recent years the method of using liquid solid fluidization means to continuously mitigate membrane fouling has gained increasing attentions mainly due to the advantages of low energy consumption and simple operation in recent few studies a variety of fluidized particles were employed to alleviate membrane fouling in mbr systems among which millimeter sized granular activated carbon gac was generally preferred owing to its low cost suitable particle density around 1500 g m3 and porous structure pradhan et al 2012 siembida et al 2010 up to date fluidized gac particles have been successfully utilized in membrane bioreactor mbr for a long term operation for example yu et al operated a mbr with the assistance of fluidized gac for approximate 70 days and found the addition of gac effectively reduced membrane fouling rate by 57 1 yu et al 2020 similar investigation by shin et al coupled gac fluidization with anaerobic mbr where membrane fouling was well controlled for 485 days without chemical cleaning shin et al 2014 all of these studies verified that using fluidized gac was an effective approach to control membrane fouling in an environmental friendly way thus could be potentially employed in the gac pac uf system where severe pac deposition and uf fouling simultaneously occurred in the proposed gac pac uf system pac is responsible for adsorbing contaminants and improving permeate quality while fluidized gac particles are targeted for mitigating pac deposition and uf fouling previously we have reported the performance of such gac pac uf system achieving a maximum of 45 8 fouling removal and similar effluent quality as compared with pac uf process yu et al 2022 nevertheless such integrated water treatment process still suffers from several challenges firstly the governing fouling control mechanism is attributed to momentum transfer between gac particles and membrane wu et al 2017 which could be significantly influenced by different gac shapes for instance r escudie et al explored the effect of teflon particle shapes on the mixing and segregation of a liquid fluidized bed which was greatly varied attributed to differentiated turbulence enhancement produced during particle fluidization escudié et al 2006 secondly the expenditure of using pac as adsorbent is relatively high undermining the feasibility of employing such gac pac uf process in large scale water treatment process given such situation biochar was reported to have abundant microporous structure and strong adsorption performance leng et al 2021 tan et al 2021 more importantly the cost of biochar is merely half the price of pac campbell et al 2018 providing the opportunities to be applied in such integrated system however biochar and pac are derived from different carbonaceous substances resulting in their discrepant properties and behaviors in adsorption and deposition besides the fouling mechanisms of pac uf and biochar uf processes are complicated where pac biochar adsorbs organics accompanied by depositing on membrane surface in the literature numerous studies have been documented on the mechanism of pac acting on membranes vindicating that pac and organic substances had synergistic effect on fouling formation shao et al 2016 in contrast limited work was devoted to investigating biochar deposition as well as biochar associated fouling characteristics based on the current challenges of such novel gac pac uf process the aim of this study is to fundamentally explore i the performance of different shaped gac particles i e spherical short cylindrical and long cylindrical gac particles on fouling mitigation and their detailed action mechanisms ii the viability of using biochar as an alternative to replace pac with their exhaustive deposition behaviors and interactions with water contaminants unveiled during filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials and preparations surface water in this experiment was collected from north lake of beijing institute of technology liang xiang campus with its detailed characteristics displayed in table s1 the polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membranes were ordered from beijing separate company with the mean molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 kda before experiments the flat sheet membrane was soaked in deionized water for 24 h its permeability was measured by using deionized water at room temperature pac was purchased from cabot corporation usa while biochar made from the wheat straw was ordered from henan xingnuo company china in order to minimize the influence of size effect on pac and biochar performances original pac original biochar p biochar and ground biochar g biochar were used in the study for comparison purpose the g biochar was obtained by grinding p biochar in an agate mortar then manually sieved and collected using 12 µm and 18 µm standard sieves the mean particle size of pac g biochar and p biochar was measured to be 13 46 2 24 µm 15 72 2 10 µm and 92 3 3 20 µm by a mastersizer malvern england respectively gac particles were ordered from huanyu company china to ease the comparison each gac particle with varied shapes was prepared to possess a constant particle volume of around 5 2 mm3 specifically spherical gac rgac particles with the mean diameter of 2 15 mm were sieved by collecting the particles intercepted between 2 00 mm and 2 30 mm sieves short cylindrical particles sgac with the diameter of 4 mm were trimmed to the length of 0 4 mm while the long cylindrical particles lgac with the diameter of 1 5 mm were cut to the length of 3 mm the dimensions of obtained gac particles were further affirmed by a micrometer before experiment gac particles were soaked in lake water until adsorption saturation to refrain from their influences on pac biochar adsorption factually millimeter sized gac particles have limited adsorption on aqueous contaminants due to the large particle size and small specific surface area and cannot replace pac biochar in the integrated water treatment process 2 2 characterization of pac and biochar the specific surface area and pore characteristics of powdered carbon pc i e pac and biochar were tested by automatic surface and porosity analyzer ankersmid belsorp max netherlands the water contact angle of pc was determined by a contact angle analyzer data physics oca 15e through the sessile drop method briefly pac or biochar was adhered onto glass slides with double sided adhesive tape and further compacted into flakes thereafter a water droplet with volume of 2 μl dropped on the pc surface to acquire the static water contact angle the measurement was repeated at five different locations fourier transform infrared spectra ftir of pc were detected by a nicolet is10 spectrometer thermo fisher scientific us with the wavenumber range of 500 4000 cm 1 prior to measurement pc samples were sufficiently dried compacted into flakes and cut into 1 cm 1 cm sheet for testing in addition the zeta potentials of pc were measured by a nanosizer malvern england and each measurement was repeated at least 6 times 2 3 experimental setup and operation conditions the schematic diagram of the experimental setup depicted in fig 1 was a liquid solid fluidization membrane filtration system whereby 100 mg pc was added to 2 l feed water to achieve the pc concentration of 50 mg l and gac particles were filled into membrane cells reaching to 50 of cell volume multiply metal meshes with a diameter of around 0 5 mm were placed on the top and bottom of the cell aiming to allow pc to flow through while prevent the entrainment of gac the uf membrane with effective area of 0 002 m2 was exposed to influent water and fluidized gac particles the rest of which was covered by scotch tapes aiming to avoid the influence of pac entrapment in the edge gaps of membrane cells therefore the tmp changes were merely caused by this exposed part of the membrane a calibrated digital gear pump cole parmer us was employed to provide circulating liquid velocity u l required for gac fluidization in this study different u 1 were required for the different shaped gac particles to achieve a fixed fluidized bed height of 100 mm where the membrane surfaces could be entirely scoured by the fluidized particles during the experiment the setup was operated at a constant flux of 30 l m2 h controlled by a peristaltic pump cole parmer usa and the transmembrane pressure tmp was measured by two pressure transmitters cole parmer us mounted on both the inlet and outlet of the membrane cell with labview software automatically recording the data at a time interval of 10 s each of the filtration tests was operated 300 min and the fouled membrane was autopsied for further analysis 2 4 fouling resistance measurement and fouling observation the resistance in series model was applied to analyze various fouling resistances according to the eqs 1 2 as follows 1 r t δ p μ j 2 r t r m r c r p where r t r m r c r p represent the total resistance m 1 membrane resistance m 1 cake layer resistance m 1 and pore blocking resistance m 1 respectively δ p is the tmp across membrane kpa μ is the viscosity of feed water pa s j is the permeate flux l m2 h briefly r m and r t were determined by directly filtering deionized water through virgin and fouled uf membrane after carefully wiping the pc and other foulants deposited on fouled membrane r m r p could be obtained by filtrating deionized water through the wiped membrane then r c and r p were acquired based on eq 2 the morphology of fouling layer was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss supra55 germany after thoroughly dried by a freeze dryer beijing boyikang experimental instrument company china the surface pictures of fouled membranes were randomly taken and at least 5 pictures were captured for each observation 2 5 deposited pc amount measurement and extraction of membrane foulants after the operation the deposited pc and other foulants attached on the membrane were collected by a brush then transferred into the vial with 30 ml deionized water thereafter the pc was separated from the suspension by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 20 min and resuspended in 30 ml deionized water the turbidity of the suspension was measured using a turbidity meter sanxin company china to quantify the amount of deposited pc according to the pervious method by shao et al shao et al 2017 fig s1 proved that the adsorbent concentrations and suspension turbidities had good linear relationships with r 2 values of 0 999 thus the mass of pc deposited on the membrane could be obtained by multiplying the pc concentration by the sample volume in addition the supernatant containing soluble foulants obtained by centrifugation was further filtered through 0 45 μm filters for further characterization 2 6 analysis of effluent quality and foulant composition the water qualities of effluents and corresponding foulant samples extracted above were further analyzed specifically chemical oxygen demand codmn was measured in accordance to the standard method tan et al 2021 meanwhile ion contents in terms of ca2 and mg2 were determined by hach spectrophotometer dr1900 hach using hach commercial hardness determination kit then each concentration obtained from test was further converted to the actual ion concentration based on the atomic mass of ca mg the measurements of codmn and ion contents were repeated three times with the mean value represented excitation emission matrix eem spectra of each sample were detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan for analyzing the componential information briefly excitation scans were set from 200 to 500 nm at 10 nm intervals for each excitation wavelength emission wavelengths range were set to 250 550 nm with 2 nm stepping the scanning speed were constantly set at 1200 nm min for all the samples with the excitation and emission slits of 10 nm furthermore the analysis of fluorescence regional integration fri method was conducted to quantitively present the volumetric percentages of each component based on a previous method in the literature cai et al 2016 to provide the accurate data comparison among various water samples all of the eem determinations were performed by the same instrument within one day the first region and second region raleigh scatterings in the spectra were all subtracted from accounting the peak area in each region by using origin 2018b in order to avoid probable effect of raleigh scattering 2 7 hydrodynamic characteristics of fluidized gac particles to further demonstrate the mechanisms of fouling mitigation and possible pc release by gac particles during fluidization the hydrodynamics of fluidized gac particles with regard to particle velocity particle concentration and particle momentum were characterized via the high speed image analysis a high speed camera hua teng vision camera china was employed to capture the videos of fluidized gac particles to fair the comparison all the videos were captured at membrane height of 30 mm during the steady state fluidization each recording lasted for around 10 12 s where the capture frequency was 90 hz i e 1 s recorded 90 images afterwards the captured videos were first decomposed into continuous images via imagej software each of the gac particles in the images identified with their central locations were manually labeled then the coordinates x y of each gac particle could be extracted from the imagej after calibration the fluidized particle velocity v p as well as other parameters i e particle concentration momentum etc could be calculated according to the coordinates the details of hydrodynamic parameter characterization were provided in supplementary information for each video at least 1200 gac particle velocities were achieved wang et al 2016 2 8 energy consumption analysis the energy consumption of gac fluidization per effluent product e p kwh m3 was calculated by eqs 3 4 according to a previous study wang et al 2020 3 e p e r 3600 q p where qp m3 s is the permeate flowrate er kw is the energy requirement approximated obtained by eq 4 4 e r δ p b e d q f where q f m3 s is the circulation flowrate i e 1 50 10

ε mf is the bed voidage at minimum fluidization condition that is calculated based on eq 6 wang et al 2017 yang 2003 6 ε m f 0 415 φ 0 483 where φ is particle sphericity that is obtained from the images of different shaped gac particles using the following eq 7 wadell 1933 wang et al 2018 7 φ 2 a π d c m i n where a is the projected area of gac particle d cmin is the diameter of the minimum circumscribed circle around gac particle 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of pc type on fouling formation and water treatment performance 3 1 1 characterization of pac and biochar pac is typically obtained from a variety of carbonaceous substances e g coal wood while biochar is generally originated from straws husks manure etc which leads to remarkable differences in their properties abhishek et al 2022 krahnstöver and wintgens 2018 in the current study pac and biochar we used were made from coal and wheat straw respectively as displayed in table 1 the specific surface area and pore volume of pac were dramatically larger than those of original biochar p biochar and ground biochar g biochar although the mean size of pac and g biochar particles was roughly similar especially the specific surface area of pac which was 931 46 m2 g was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of biochar i e ranging from 74 9 m2 g to 75 99 m2 g the saturation of three adsorbents could be indicated by testing adsorption kinetic curves which were added in fig s2 of supporting information suggesting both pac and biochar reached saturation after 4 h meanwhile the final saturation adsorption capacity of pac p biochar and g biochar for cod was 102 2 56 2 and 59 1 mg cod g respectively regarding surface charge the zeta potentials of the all pcs were negative with pac more negatively charged than p biochar and g biochar as shown in fig 2 a pac surface was hydrophobic with contact angle of 124 2 whereas biochar surface was found to be hydrophilic with the contact angle of around 55 this was probably because the surface of biochar contained numerous hydrophilic groups as witnessed by ftir spectra in fig 2 b the peak intensities of biochar especially the oh appearing at 3420 cm 1 were significantly higher than that of pac indicating more hydroxyl groups present on the biochar surface in addition c o at 1630 cm 1 and co at 1100 cm 1 associated with carboxyl groups zhang et al 2019 were also higher on biochar surfaces contributing to the hydrophilic properties 3 1 2 water treatment effectiveness the effluents collected from various uf associated systems after operation were further analyzed as observed from fig 3a the cod of uf effluents was significantly decreased with pac or biochar addition which was due to their capabilities to adsorb contaminants from surface water comparatively the effluent cod value of biochar uf was slightly higher than that of pac uf which could be explained by the larger specific surface area and pore volume of pac displayed in table 1 hardness is also an important criterion for reflecting water quality it should be mentioned that ca2 was not detected in the permeate which could be explained by the following points i ca2 could cross link with natural organic matter nom and readily deposit on the membrane surface to form serious membrane fouling ahn et al 2008 ii ca2 was easy to precipitate especially when the alkalinity of the feed water was high e g 121 11 mg l as caco3 in this study in contrast mg2 was detectable in all of the effluents and after adding pac biochar the mg2 contents in the effluents decreased fig 3a it was interesting to find that the removal rate of mg2 by p biochar or g biochar was slightly higher than that of pac which could be interpreted by the fact that the surface of biochar contained a large number of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups enhancing the adsorption of mg2 fig 2b in the literature it was also reported that the surface of biochar contained abundant hydroxyl and carbonyl groups which significantly enhanced the adsorption of the ions kamali et al 2021 kołodyńska et al 2018 niazi et al 2018 previous studies also showed that biochar prepared from wheat straw was also rich in co3 2 which could act as additional adsorption sites to form precipitation with ca2 and mg2 thus contributing to increased adsorption with these ions bashir et al 2018 pan et al 2013 to reveal the organic components in effluent the relationship between the fluorescent components and the eem spectra regions was established as follows regions i and ii ex em 200 250 200 380 nm simple aromatic protein like substances region iii ex em 200 250 380 500 nm fulvic acid like materials region iv ex em 250 280 200 380 nm soluble microbial byproduct like substances region v ex em 280 500 380 500 nm humic acid like substances cai et al 2016 fig 3b showed that single uf seemed less effective for removing humic acid like substances with smaller molecular sizes while pac uf or biochar uf processes effectively improved effluent quality mainly attributed to the enhanced adsorption of small sized contaminants in addition according to the literature the saturated adsorbents suspended in feed water could be separated via sedimentation coagulation or filtration by microsieves cloth filters etc krahnstover and wintgens 2018 vu et al 2014 then new regenerated adsorbents were cycled back to feed tank the detailed regeneration methods for pac and biochar included thermal chemical and electrochemical treatments etc okwadha et al 2009 yuan et al 2016 3 1 3 membrane fouling propensity fig 4a depicted the fouling performances of uf filtration coupled with pac biochar the uf alone without pac biochar was conducted as reference where the final tmp reached 25 83 kpa after 300 min operation apparently 50 mg l pac biochar addition accelerated uf fouling development significantly comparatively the minimum tmp rise of 13 4 mpa was observed in the filtration with pac uf and the maximum tmp rise was 26 2 mpa found in the filtration with g biochar uf in addition the tmp increase of p biochar uf was still higher than that of pac uf despite relatively larger size of p biochar uf in contrast to pac as shown in fig 4b pac biochar addition mainly led to an obvious increase of r c rather than r p because the size range of pc i e 13 46 96 3 μm was much larger than pore diameter of uf membrane 3 1 4 pc deposition on membrane surface the amounts of pac biochar attached on the membrane surface were determined fig 5 indicated that the deposition amount of g biochar on the membrane surface reaching to 2 41 g m2 which was significantly higher than that of p biochar i e only 1 57 g m2 in fact based on the characterization results shown in table 1 the primary difference between p biochar and g biochar lied on the particle size which significantly varied from 92 3 µm to 15 72 µm besides the slight difference in their surface charge i e 21 5 mv for p biochar and 18 1 mv for g biochar might affect the deposition amount of biochar where the less charged surface of g biochar weakened the repulsive interactions with negatively charged uf membrane thus contributing to its attachment on membrane surface more importantly the deposited amount of g biochar was still slightly higher than that of pac i e 2 23 g m2 although their particle sizes were similar since the zeta potential of pac surface appeared to be more negatively charged than g biochar table 1 there exhibited much stronger repulsions between pac particles as well as pac membrane during pac deposition resulting in less adherence than g biochar besides it was reported that the adsorption of humic acid like contaminants by pac also contributed to an increase in the repulsion between pacs shao et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 4 p biochar uf process presented higher fouling propensity as compared with pac uf but the deposited amount of p biochar was found to be much lower implying that pc deposition was not the dominant reason responsible for the fouling herein further comparisons regarding fouling morphology and compositions were performed the morphologies of pac biochar fouling layers were further observed by sem both membranes fouled by pac biochar suspensions in real surface water as well as di water were compared it was intriguing that distinct deposition patterns were found for pac and biochar when suspended in di water original pac uniformly dispersed on membranes in contrast p biochar and g biochar were inclined to agglomerate and did not fully cover membrane surface the aggregation of biochar was probably attributed to ca2 released by biochar in fact the presence of a certain amount of calcium compounds on biochar surface had been reported in numerous papers bashir et al 2018 nan et al 2021 in this study the amount of ca2 released by g biochar in di water was determined to be approximately 60 6 4 9 mg g in contrast to merely 5 8 1 2 mg g found for pac the details of which were displayed in table s2 of supplementary materials these released ca2 might bridge biochar particles together by the interacting on with hydroxyl or carbonyl groups on biochar surfaces resulting in the agglomeration of biochar zhang et al 2022 in the scenario of surface water the deposition morphology of pc did not change significantly except for additional attachment of aquatic contaminants observed on membrane surface fig 6 3 1 5 analysis of membrane foulants the foulants on membrane surface after removing the deposited pc were characterized and shown in fig 7 the codmn results indicated that the amount of total contaminants attached on membrane surface was significantly increased for biochar uf systems as compared with uf alone or pac uf this was possibly elucidated by the fact that more ca2 and mg2 released from biochar table s2 which could readily interact with negatively charged contaminants thus facilitating the enlargement of foulant size and the subsequent aggregation on membrane surface kamali et al 2021 nan et al 2021 consistent with this result it was reported that both of sodium alginate and humic acid could cross link with the biochar via ca2 bridging leading to their enhanced depositions on membrane surface zhang et al 2022 fig 7b suggested that the foulants on membrane surface entrained a large amount of ca2 which manifested the previous speculation in section 3 1 2 that most of ca2 was retained by membranes leading to the undetectable content present in effluent for p biochar uf and g biochar uf systems the ca2 contents on the membrane surface reached to 226 6 mg m2 and 211 3 mg m2 respectively which were 19 7 and 11 6 higher than pac uf system 189 3 mg m2 this phenomenon was again owing to the more ca2 release from biochar as described above resulting in more contaminants and ca2 retention on membrane surface additionally the mg2 content on membrane surface did not exhibited much differences and there was no significant variation in the foulant composition between pac uf system and biochar uf system 3 2 effect of gac particle shape on fouling mitigation and water treatment 3 2 1 performance of mitigating membrane fouling and pc deposition as illustrated in fig 4 both pac uf and biochar uf systems caused severe fouling due to the significant depositions of contaminants and pc when treating real surface water herein a novel system by simultaneous coupling fluidized gac particles and pc with uf was proposed in order to effectively control membrane fouling and improve effluent quality fig 8 displayed the performances of three different shaped gac particles i e spherical gac rgac short cylindrical gac sgac and long cylindrical gac lgac on membrane fouling control during 300 min filtration pac uf system presented a sharp tmp increase with calculated fouling rate of 0 046 kpa min while coupling fluidized rgac particles obviously reduced membrane fouling rate by 53 9 in contrast to 43 0 for sgac and 28 2 for lgac similarly p biochar uf combined with fluidized gac also exhibited consistent results but better performance for fouling mitigation as evidenced by 76 4 76 1 and 70 decrease in fouling rate observed for rgac sgac and lgac respectively as a consequence rgac with spherical structure featured the best membrane fouling mitigation effectiveness especially in alleviating biochar associated fouling furthermore coupling with the three shaped gac particles resulted in a significant decrease in r c which was attributed to the strong scouring of fluidized gac exerted on cake layer interestingly rgac and sgac also led to the decreases of r p which might attribute to the occurrence of gac induced liquid turbulence leading to the decreased probability of contaminants entering into membrane pores apparently sgac and lgac had weaker capability on reducing membrane fouling especially lgac which appeared not effective in mitigating pore blockage red circles in fig 8c 8e as a consequence coupling rgac resulted in a membrane fouling rate of 0 021 kpa min for the pac uf while 0 017 kpa min for g biochar uf system further indicating that rgac was more effective in reducing fouling caused by biochar the overall fouling rate of rgac g biochar uf system was even lower than rgac pac uf system although the fouling propensity of pac uf without gac particles was significantly higher than g biochar uf fig 4a these results further implied that biochar causing fouling increase could be successfully compensated via combining with fluidized rgac particles under the scouring of fluidized gac particles the amounts of pac biochar deposited on membrane surface were also dramatically alleviated fig 9 specifically pac with the amount of 2231 9 mg m2 appeared on membrane surface when operated pac uf system while only 396 4 mg m2 507 8 mg m2 and 595 2 mg m2 pac were found when coupled with fluidized rgac sgac and lgac respectively this indicated that fluidized gac particles reduced more than 70 of pac deposition especially rgac whose capability for removing deposited pac reached to 82 2 in agreement with these results combinations with rgac sgac and lgac with biochar uf systems again strikingly reduced the biochar depositions following the order of rgac sgac lgac and highest biochar removal rate of 82 3 occurred in the scenario of rac g biochar uf rgac exhibited higher effectiveness in removing pc than sgac and lgac and consequently resulted in the similar deposition amounts of pac p biochar and g biochar i e ranging from 396 4 to 438 7 mg m2 3 2 2 performance of mitigating membrane foulants the foulants after removing pc were further characterized with the results shown in fig 10 apart from the capability to alleviate pc deposition the fluidized gac particles could assist to reduce other foulants adhered on membrane surface to varying degrees regarding pac uf system the cod amount of attached foulants with fluidized rgac sgac and lgac decreased by 38 7 34 7 and 34 1 respectively comparatively in biochar uf system the performance was more desirable with 42 4 46 2 42 1 and 38 7 of cod decrease obtained for rgac sgac and lgac fig 10c d showed that ca2 was more inclined to adhere on membrane surface than mg2 and coupling with three fluidized gacs was able to alleviate ion attachment especially for ca2 consistent with the results above rgac again exhibited strongest fouling control performance in terms of foulant cod and ions removal additionally fig 10e f showed the componential proportions of membrane foulants obviously after combined with fluidized gacs membrane foulants were still mainly dominated by humic acid like substances which accounted for more than 70 of the total foulants while gac shape had negligible impact on the foulant composition 3 2 3 influences on the water treatment of integrated gac pc uf process fig 11 exhibited the effluent quality in the various systems with and without fluidized gac particles although fig 3 demonstrated that the effluent quality increased after adding pac biochar limited changes were found in the effluent codmn and ion contents after coupling with various shaped gac particles notably the addition of gacs substantially increased proportion of humic acid like substances in the effluents of pac uf fig 11e probably because of less cake layer formed causing the weakened retention for small sized contaminants intriguingly negligible influences of such gac scouring appeared on the effluent composition of biochar uf fig 11f the overall effluent quality for rgac pac uf and rgac biochar uf systems were roughly similar with the total cod values of 13 6 13 9 mg l and mg2 contents of 7 4 7 5 mg l however it should be noted that the effluent quality might change with a long term operation or more complex water matrix due to the substantial variations in the pac and biochar properties table 1 and the applications of this system to treat more complex water wastewater sources during a long term operation will be evaluated in the next stage work 3 2 4 powdered carbon release from fluidized gac during gac fluidization it can be expected that there exists significant frictions and collisions between gac particles potentially triggering the release of powdered carbon during operation recently even though increasing evidences suggested the effectiveness of using fluidized particles on fouling control mostly in mbr it was noteworthy that no relevant studies in the literature explored the pc release issue during gac fluidization presumably the pc released by gac may further adsorb contaminants and improve effluent quality meanwhile adversely deposit on membrane surface besides the deposition of pc released by fluidized gac particles probably has a certain impact on the fouling layer structure fig 12a b showed the size distributions of pc released by fluidized sgac and lgac after 300 min filtration both of which were concentrated within the range of 1 µm to 10 µm close to the mean size of pac i e 13 46 µm in contrast the pc released by rgac was in a broader distribution between 1 µm and 100 µm moreover fig 11d displayed the total amounts of pc released by lgac and sgac were 16 3 mg l and 12 1 mg l respectively as compared to merely 3 4 mg l by rgac considering the fact that original pac biochar content added in feed solution was 50 mg l for this study such high amount of pc release around 12 16 mg l by sgac and lgac should remarkably affect the operation of integrated water treatment system as witnessed by fig 8 more pc deposition and severer fouling were observed for sgac and lgac than rgac implying that coupling lgac and sgac had less mitigation effect on membrane fouling one possible explanation lied on the fact that lgac and sgac released a large amount of pc during fluidization causing the increased amounts of deposited pc and membrane foulants figs 9 and 10 consistent with the results wu et al investigated the behavior of fluidized gac in a hybrid gac microfiltration process and found that the presence of gac led to an increase of water turbidity by 20 30 ntu and the fine carbon particles released by gac readily deposited on the membrane surface enhancing irreversible fouling wu et al 2014 pang et al also observed the average gac loss after 8 cycles of filtration and backwashing was approximately 0 33 and pc was released into the backwash and filtration effluent pang et al 2005 furthermore since lgac mainly released smaller sized pc these micro scaled particles might readily cause pore blockage demonstrating the negligible r p removal by lgac shown in fig 8b and d 3 3 mechanisms of membrane fouling control and economic analysis the mechanisms of fluidized gac on fouling mitigation and corresponding pc release were further explored according to the hydrodynamic analysis of gac with different shapes fig 13a b showed the statistical analysis of v p in the forms of probability distribution and whisker box plots obviously rgac had the broader v p distribution than other two particles i e lgac and sgac indicative of the more difference in particle velocities associated with the more spherical shape moreover rgac had the highest average particle velocity among the three shapes fig 13c this phenomenon suggested that the spherical shaped gac could achieve higher shear rate than others thus benefitting the fouling reduction at the same packing ratio of 50 lgac achieved highest particle concentration but lowest particle momentum followed by sgac and rgac fig 13d the higher particle concentration associated with lgac and sgac suggested that this type of gac shape could reduce the fluidization bed voidage while the interactions between fluidized particles were enhanced which strengthened the particle particle collisions thus exhausting the particle momentums this contributed to explain why lgac and sgac had much lower particle momentum than rgac shown in fig 13d such higher particle concentration and more particle particle collisions of cylindrical shaped gac i e lgac and sgac probably caused by interlocking effects which further contributed to the significant release of pc as evidenced by 16 3 mg l and 12 1 mg l pc released by lgac and sgac as compared to merely 3 4 mg l pc produced from rgac fig 12d fig 14a illustrated that rgac was more conducive to alleviating membrane fouling due to strong particle momentum and mechanical scouring acting on membrane surface and less pc release achieving lowest fouling rate and pc deposition among three shaped gac particles besides the energy consumption required for gac fluidization was further calculated which was only 0 047 kwh m3 for rgac as compared with 0 066 kwh m3 and 0 075 kwh m3 for sgac and lgac respectively this demonstrated that rgac achieved the optimal fouling control performance at the expense of lowest energy consumption fig 14b exhibited the discrepant fouling mechanisms caused by pac and biochar during filtration as well as compared the performances and expenses of using pac and biochar in the integrated gac pc uf water treatment system apparently the pc deposition amount and effluent cod between rgac pac uf and rgac biochar uf were similar however membrane fouling rate of rgac pac uf was higher than rgac biochar uf more importantly the expenditure of using pac was significantly higher than biochar it was believed that the regeneration cost of pac was roughly 40 60 of its market price market price around 5000 rmb t in china shao et al 2013 while was 50 80 for biochar market price around 3000 rmb t in china ahmed et al 2016 dai et al 2019 singh and srivastava 2022 on the condition of using 50 mg l pc and daily regeneration during 30 d running at a constant flux of 30 l m3 d the estimated expenditure of pc purchase and regeneration was around 0 18 rmb m3 for pac while was 0 14 rmb m3 for biochar this implied a 20 expenditure saving if pac was replaced by biochar with better permeability and commensurate effluent quality consequently gac biochar uf might be a promising water treatment system more suitable for large scale applications the system not only achieves effective removal of organic matter from the water but also operates without a sharp rise in tmp in addition biochar has more significant economic benefits instead of pac the future prospect of this study involves two perspectives i verifying the performance of such gac pc uf water treatment process in a large scale reactor during long term operation ii exploring the effectiveness of such gac pc uf process in removing emerging micropollutants e g drugs endocrine disruptors disinfection by products and corresponding improvement strategies meanwhile it should be noted that this proposed system can be employed to treat a variety of water bodies such as surface water groundwater effluents from wwtps as well as some lightly polluted wastewater etc since pac biochar adsorption and uf retention have no selectivity for most of aquatic contaminants kim et al 2019 loewenberg et al 2014 mohammadi and esmaeelifar 2005 mozia and tomaszewska 2004 in this work we just used surface water as a representative water matrix which was commonly treated by traditional pac uf biochar uf processes mozia and tomaszewska 2004 oh et al 2006 definitely the applications of this system to treat more complex water wastewater will be evaluated in the future studies 4 conclusions based on the current challenges of the novel gac pac uf process this study mainly focused on exploring the performance of different shaped gac particles on membrane fouling control and unveiling the behaviors of pac and biochar in terms of adsorption and deposition during operation the primary conclusions can be drawn as follows the water treatment effectiveness of pac uf with the effluent codmn of 11 7 mg l was slightly better than that of biochar uf with 12 1 12 4 mg l codmn in effluent the amount of g biochar deposited on membrane surface reaching 2 41 g m3 was higher than that of pac 2 23 g m3 accompanied by distinct deposition patterns where original pac uniformly dispersed on membranes while biochar was inclined to agglomerate coupling rgac with pac biochar uf process achieved the optimal fouling mitigation at the expense of lowest energy consumption with the least pc release of merely 3 4 mg l comparatively sgac and lgac had weakened capabilities on fouling reduction especially lgac who released 16 2 mg l small sized pc probably causing severer membrane fouling biochar associated fouling could be successfully compensated via combining with fluidized rgac a 20 expenditure was saved if pac was replaced by biochar with achieving commensurate effluent quality but better permeability which implied the integrated rgac biochar uf might be a promising water treatment system more suitable for large scale applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15093,nano zero valent iron nzvi has been widely used to improve refractory wastewater treatment however the rapid dissolution of nzvi causes a waste of resources and an unstable bioaugmentation herein to verify the essential role of slow release of nzvi on biological systems a core shell structured fe c composite was developed to demonstrate the long term feasibility of fe c for enhancing azo dye biodegradation in comparison to a mixture of nzvi and carbon powder fe c the 150 days of long term reactor operation showed that although both fe c and fe c enhanced azo dye degradation the former achieved a better performance than the latter the strengthening effect of fe c was also more durable and stable than fe c it may be due to the fact that the carbon layer of fe c could interact with extracellular polymeric substances eps through physical adsorption and chemical bonding to form a stable buffer to regulate nzvi dissolution the buffer layer could not only regulate the attack of h on nzvi to reduce its dissolution rate but also complex released fe2 and neutralize oh to alleviate the passivation layer formed on the nzvi surface moreover microbial community analysis indicated that both fe c and fe c increased the abundance of fermentative bacteria e g bacteroidetes vadinha17 propionicicella and methanogens e g methanobacterium but only fe c promoted the growth of azo dye degraders e g clostridium geobacter metatranscriptomic analysis further revealed that only fe c could substantially stimulate the expression of azoreductase and redox mediator e g riboflavin ubiquinone biosynthesis involved in the extracellular degradation of azo dye this work provides novel insights into the bioaugmentation of fe c for refractory wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe c composites azo dye biodegradation extracellular polymeric substances redox mediator azoreductase expression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic treatment is a promising pre treatment process to improve the biodegradability of refractory wastewater via transforming macromolecular organics kong et al 2019 refractory organic nitrogen pollutants e g azo dyes nitro aromatics are the representative contaminants which are ubiquitous in industrial wastewaters such as textile dying wastewater chemical wastewater and spraying paint wastewater dai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 however conventional anaerobic treatment processes could not achieve satisfactory removal of azo dye cui et al 2019 many efforts have so far been attempted to improve the anaerobic degradation of dyes among which the use of zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi was identified as an attractive approach due to its high efficiency and strong reducibility compared to carbon based nanomaterials li et al 2013 2019 however the effectiveness of nzvi on anaerobic systems varied case by case barrena et al 2021 he et al 2017 it may be attributed to the following reasons first owing to the high reactivity nzvi can rapidly release h2 when exposed to h xie et al 2017 the escape of h2 reduces the electron utilization of nzvi and wastes nzvi second high h2 partial pressure resulting from the substantial h2 accumulation could have an inhibitory effect on methanogenesis metabolism yang et al 2013 nzvi may also have direct toxic effects on anaerobes due to its reductive disruption of the cell membrane he et al 2017 third nzvi is prone to agglomerate and inorganic salt ions could precipitate the released fe2 and form a passivation layer on the surface of nzvi which may reduce its accessibility khalil et al 2017 xu et al 2021a in this light a long term evaluation of the effect of nzvi on the system stability and microbial community is indeed necessary which however has not well been documented previously carbon coating nzvi to form core shell structured fe c composites may overcome the drawbacks of nzvi stated above the carbon layer of fe c could be beneficial for regulating the dissolution of nzvi due to its porous property also the carbon layer could reduce the inhibitory effects of inorganic salts on nzvi activation and avoid the formation of nzvi clusters xu et al 2021a thus the release of electrons from fe c may be more consistent and stable than that from pure nzvi in biological systems the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps is ubiquitous xiao et al 2017 we hypothesized that the combination of carbon layer of fe c and eps could be a feasible strategy to stably regulate the dissolution rate of nzvi thereby enhancing electron utilization although eps alone can reduce the h2 release rate from nzvi dissolution via accepting electrons from nzvi and enhance h2 yield via preventing nzvi corrosion passivation he et al 2017 the eps properties are sensitive to environmental disturbances for example a change in ph and or released fe2 could greatly affect the structure and surface properties of eps which may weaken its affinity or adsorption to nzvi influencing electron utilization wang et al 2012 the presence of carbon layer would make eps more resilient to environmental disturbances on one hand eps could embed in the porous carbon layer and then form an integrated buffer layer which could regulate the transfer of h from the bulk to the nzvi surface and adjust the release rate of electrons in return the carbon layer could independently act as a protective layer to reduce the impact of external disturbances e g toxic metal ions on eps properties by neutralization and adsorption ensuring eps stability on the other hand the carbon layer together with eps can complex the released fe2 and avoid the formation of a passivation layer on the nzvi surface thus it highlights a comprehensive study to demonstrate the potential synergistic effect of the carbon layer and eps on electron utilization of nzvi therefore the overall objective of this study was to investigate the long term feasibility and stability of fe c composites modified egsb reactor treating wastewater containing refractory organic nitrogen azo dye was chosen as the representative recalcitrant compound to systematically characterize the underlying mechanisms towards the interactions between the carbon layer and eps the effects of eps concentration electroactive compounds in eps and zero valent iron zvi type on the dissolution of zvi were explored the electron transport activity microbial community and gene expression associated with the degradation of azo dye were then examined the findings obtained in this study could provide insightful information about the manipulation of anaerobic systems with zvi to promote the degradation of recalcitrant compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 additives seeding sludge and synthetic wastewater nzvi 40 nm and 100 nm 99 9 purity and carbon powder 150 nm 99 9 purity were purchased from shanghai rhawn reagent co ltd china micro sized zvi mzvi 1000 nm 99 9 purity was purchased from dknano tech co ltd china the core shell structured fe c composites with an average diameter of 150 nm were synthesized

media 2 2 experimental set up and operational parameters three identical egsb reactors with a working volume of 2 5 l and a height of 50 cm were employed one reactor amended with fe c composites was named rfe c one reactor amended with a mixture of carbon powder and 100 nm nzvi was named rfe c and another without additives was named rcon the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations were 20 g l with an mlvss mlss ratio of 0 72 the ph inside reactors was adjusted to 6 8 7 8 with nahco3 solution the entire experiment lasted 150 days at room temperature 23 2 c which was divided into four stages the dosage of fe c and nzvi was according to the result of preliminary experiment and the additives addition was only conducted on days 30 61 97 113 and 135 the detailed information on the operating parameters of the reactors is described in table 1 during additives addition nzvi was initially transferred into a 50 ml syringe equipped with a three port valve in the anaerobic chamber due to its high reactivity and then nzvi was introduced into the bottom of reactor through the syringe the cod dye aromatic amines and fe2 concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured daily 2 3 effect of eps on zvi dissolution experiment i was designed to investigate the effects of eps concentration on zvi dissolution fig s3 eps was obtained from the granular sludge collected at the end of stage iii the detailed protocols about eps extraction and characterization can be found in text s2 the batch experiments were conducted in 100 ml serum bottle with 1 g l 100 nm nzvi and 60 ml eps solution of different concentrations i e 0 32 96 160 mg l the initial ph of each bottle was adjusted to 6 8 7 2 with 0 2 mol l hcl naoh solution to exclude the interferences of inorganic salts on nzvi dissolution nacl was added to ensure that the nacl concentration of each serum bottle is 0 05 all the bottles were purged with n2 for 15 min to remove oxygen and equipped with a three port valve for gas collection and sampling the bottles were placed on a shaker with 150 rpm at 35 c for 800 h samples are taken every two days using a syringe for the determination of h2 vol ph and fe2 concentration the batch experiments were conducted in triplicates experiment ii was performed to explore the interactions between eps and different types of zvi based on the results of experiment i 96 mg l eps was chosen as the optimal eps concentration for slowing the dissolution rate of nzvi four types of zvi were investigated including 40 nm nzvi 100 nm nzvi 1000 nm mzvi and 150 nm fe c the dosage of zvi was the same in each batch experiment bottle the batch experiments were conducted in 50 ml serum bottle with 20 ml eps solution and the other conditions were the same to those described in experimental i the h2 vol ph and fe2 concentration were measured every two days at the end of batch experiment the corroded zvi was collected for morphologies observation by scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscope afm functional group determination by flourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and crystal identification by x ray diffraction xrd with a 2 theta range from 20 to 90 samples pretreatment for physicochemical properties analysis was carried out according to xu et al 2021a 2 4 chemical microbial activity and microbial community analyzes cod mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 1998 the concentrations of aromatic amines and azo dye were measured by spectrophotometry based on xu et al 2021c the fe2 was determined using the phenanthroline method the content of ch4 was determined periodically with a gas chromatograph gc gc 14a shimadzu japan the strength of granular sludge was measured following xu et al 2021a cyclic voltammetry cv sludge conductivity and relative ets activity of granules were also analyzed and their protocols are presented in text s3 a total of 9 sludge samples were collected on days 60 and 112 for 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil bio 101 vista ca illumina pyrosequencing was conducted on the miseq pe300 platform illumina inc ca us by major biotech co ltd shanghai china the detailed information about the high throughput sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis is described in text s4 3 results 3 1 long term performance of fe c and nzvi modified bioreactors the egsb reactors were continuously operated for 150 days fig 1 in stage i days 1 29 the three bioreactors stabilized within 10 days and displayed similar cod removal efficiencies 90 on average but most of the azo dye remained in the effluent approximately 70 mg l in stage ii days 30 96 the effluent cod concentrations were again comparable among the bioreactors 92 on average which may be due to the long hrt employed 30 h the average removal efficiency of azo dye in the three bioreactors followed the order of rfe c 82 rfe c 78 rcon 49 correspondingly the concentrations of intermediates of dye degradation aromatic amines followed the same order of rfe c rfe c rcon the results indicate that both fe c composites and fe c enhanced azo dye degradation and fe c composites could achieve a better performance than fe c which is also supported by the higher decolorization efficiency in rfe c vs rfe c fig s4 in stage iii days 97 134 the dye concentration in the influent increased to approximately 200 mg l a pronounced fluctuation of dye concentration in rcon was observed resulting in 26 43 removal efficiency on average conversely the performance of rfe c and rfe c was relatively stable throughout stage iii though the dosages of fe c composites and fe c were reduced to 1 5 g the average dye removal efficiencies in rfe c and rfe c were 54 and 66 respectively which were substantially higher than that in rcon however unlike the stable performance of rfe c the concentrations of cod dye and fe2 in the effluent of rfe c experienced obvious fluctuations with each dosing event this result further demonstrates the better performance of rfe c than rfe c and the enhancing effect of fe c was more stable and durable in stage iv days 135 150 the influent azo dye concentration was further increased to 400 mg l to evaluate whether fe c and fe c could mitigate the inhibitory effect of high concentration azo dye on anaerobic systems result showed that the effluent concentrations of dye and cod increased in all bioreactors but the average dye removal efficiency of rfe c was still the highest similar as stage iii fe2 concentration in stage iv in the effluent of rfe c was also higher and displayed substantial fluctuation compared to that in the effluent of rfe c it seems that fe c could allow microbial community being more resistant and resilient to azo dye toxicity additionally fe c and fe c additions resulted in different influence patterns on the properties of granular sludge the surface of granular sludge in rfe c showed a laminated structure and the channels on the granules surface seemed to be clogged while the granule surface in rfe c was loose and the channel like structure was visible fig 2 the channels of granular sludge are crucial for substrates transfer the blockage of channels in rfe c could increase mass transfer resistance and subsequently cause a reduced mechanical strength of granular sludge compared to that in rfe c fig s5 these results indicate that although nzvi could improve the system performance the long term adverse effects of nzvi on granular sludge could not be avoided 3 2 characteristics of electrochemical activity to better understand the effects of fe c and nzvi on the redox properties of the anaerobic system the electrochemical behavior of the sludge was tested two pairs of reductive and oxidative peaks were detected during the cv analysis fig 3 a the peak currents increased with the presence of fe c and nzvi following the order of rfe c 0 48 ma rfe c 0 43 ma rcon 0 40 ma this result suggests that fe c and nzvi increased the electrochemical response more sensitive dpv tests were then conducted to identify the electroactive compounds fig 3b two pairs of dpv peaks with oxidation peaks at 132 and 172 mv and reduction peaks at 138 and 176 mv were determined attributing to cytochromes okamoto et al 2013 compared with rcon both the sludge conductivity and ets activity in rfe c and rfe c were higher fig 3c and d interestingly the relative ets activity in rfe c decreased from 118 to 109 when the dosage decreased from 7 to 2 5 g while the relative ets activity in rfe c remained in increasing trend suggesting that fe c possessed higher stability and durability than fe c in terms of electron transport enhancement 3 3 effect of eps on zvi dissolution 3 3 1 interaction of eps and different types of zvi the effects of eps concentration on zvi dissolution were revealed in fig 4 compared to eps free solution a low concentration of 32 mg l eps did not significantly change the release rate of h2 from nzvi however the high concentration of eps 96 and 160 mg l exhibited significant inhibition on h2 production fig 4a meanwhile the effect of eps on the dissolution of zvi with different particle sizes was further explored fig 4b the result showed that more h2 was released with the increased size of zvi fe2 was released in all groups fig s6 suggesting that eps could reduce the release rate of h2 but could not completely hinder zvi dissolution moreover the ph increased significantly in the 1000 nm mzvi due to its rapid dissolution initially compared to the other groups fig s6 furthermore the release of h2 was lower in fe c compared to 100 nm nzvi which may be attributed to the presence of a carbon layer of fe c thus the interactions of the carbon layer of fe c and eps could reduce the release rate of h2 3 3 2 characterization of corroded zvi at the end of experiment ii the morphologies of zvi surface were investigated fig 5 the surface of corroded 40 nm nzvi was compact and small sized agglomerates fig 5a the surface of the corrosion product became loose and rough with elevated sizes of zvi fig 5b for instance the 1000 nm mzvi had obvious corrosion traces and several pores fig 5c moreover clusters were formed in 1000 nm mzvi while the 40 nm nzvi group was still uniformly dispersed fig 5e and f in contrast the surface of corroded fe c particle was compact and rather dense and its morphology was similar to that of 40 nm nzvi thus zvi with a large particle size was more likely to be corroded by eps solution while the combination of the carbon layer and eps could alleviate the dissolution of zvi additionally eds analysis showed that fe c and o were the dominant elements on the surface of corrosion products table s2 suggesting that eps could be adsorbed and or bound on the zvi or fe c surface xrd analysis was further employed to characterize the corrosion products fig 6 a for the 100 nm nzvi in the pure aqueous solution the intensity of iron peak was significantly lower than that of the 100 nm nzvi with eps similarly the intensity of the iron peak decreased gradually with increased sizes of zvi which is consistent with the result of h2 production however no obvious iron oxide crystals were detected on the 1000 nm mzvi this could be because the release of fe2 can not only be converted into iron oxide precipitates but also interact with eps via complexation eljamal et al 2018 he et al 2020 as a result the structure and surface properties of eps changed which could weaken the protective effect of eps on zvi dissolution 3 3 3 analysis of properties of eps considering that functional groups in eps may affect zvi dissolution eps were characterized by ftir spectra as shown in fig 6b the peak at 3400 cm 1 was associated with oh stretching and the peak at 1600 cm 1 was attributed to c o and c c stretching in protein structure zhu et al 2012 a minor peak at 1578 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching of nh in protein while the peak near approximately 1400 cm 1 was attributed to coo wang et al 2012 the peak at 1020 cm 1 was assigned to the vibrational stretching of co c and ch in carbohydrates the amine group bending in eps is prone to obtain h and then be protonated while carboxylic groups can neutralize oh by deprotonation omoike and chorover 2004 it means that eps can act as a buffer layer due to the presence of abundant and diverse functional groups which might regulate the direct contact between h oh and zvi fe2 to change the electrons utilization it should be pointed out that the species of functional groups on the surface of fe c was different from nzvi materials which may be due to the penetration of eps into the carbon layer xps analysis also confirmed the interaction between eps and nzvi figs 6c and s7 in addition uv spectra were employed to further analyze the changes in electroactive compounds in eps after reaction with zvi fig 6d two apparent absorbance peaks at approximately 267 and 410 nm were detected in the original eps which could be associated with riboflavin and cytochromes xiao et al 2017 after reaction with zvi the intensities of two absorption bonds substantially decreased suggesting that these electroactive compounds could interact with nzvi and or fe2 interestingly the intensities of absorption peaks in the fe c group were significantly lower than in the other groups which might be attributed to the penetration of those electroactive compounds into the carbon layer of fe c it was noted that the intensity of the peak at approximately 410 nm decreased while the peak at approximately 345 nm increased suggesting that the redox reaction could occur in eps chen et al 2014 martinez and alvarez 2018 besides 3d eem was conducted to reveal the effects of fluorescent compounds in eps on zvi dissolution three characteristic peaks are identified in the original eps fig s8 peak a ex em 280 350 peak b ex em 345 415 and peak c ex em 420 470 which represented tryptophan like humic acid like and riboflavin like substances xu et al 2018 zhu et al 2012 compared to the original eps the intensity of fluorescent compounds in eps decreased in all groups fig 7 suggesting that eps may be adsorbed by zvi and or reacted with zvi for the 40 nm nzvi the intensity of all peaks in eps was significantly lower than that of the 100 nm nzvi and 1000 nm mzvi interestingly the peaks of a and b even disappeared in the fe c suggesting that fe c composites could exhibit a better ability in capturing eps compared to other zvi materials it means that the carbon layer was beneficial for the enrichment of eps on the nzvi surface 3 4 effects of zvi based materials on the microbial community the microbial compositions at genus level are presented in fig 8 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 significantly increased in the presence of fe c or fe c bacteroidetes vadinha17 was fermentative bacteria xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2018b which could decompose complex organics with vfas being the by products previous studies reported that the addition of nzvi could enhance the hydrolysis acidification process during anaerobic digestion feng et al 2014 the abundance of synergistaceae and anaerolinea decreased with increased dye concentration indicating their low tolerance to the toxicity of dye the extracellular respiration performed by electroactive bacteria generally accepts electrons released from the organics and zvi to reduce dye clostridium desulfovibirio and geobacter were found to be electrotrophic or electroactive bacteria lovley 2022 which play an important role in azo dye degradation no substantial difference in azo dye degraders e g clostridium desulfovibirio was found between the rcon and rfe c regardless of azo dye concentration in contrast fe c could promote the growth of clostridium and geobacter and their abundance was 10 4 and 0 7 in rfe c respectively in addition methanobacterium and methanosaeta were the dominant methanogens among which methanobacterium is a hydrogenophilic methanogen that can utilize h2 and co2 to produce methane zhang et al 2022 both fe c and fe c increased the abundance of fermentative bacteria e g bacteroidetes vadinha17 propionicicella and methanogens e g methanobacterium methanobacterium is an electrotrophic microorganism and can accept electrons from nzvi and other microbial species via direct interspecies electron transfer the ch4 content in rfe c and rfe of stage ii was significantly higher than that of rcon fig s9 however the ch4 content did not have a significant difference between rfe c and rcon in stages iii and iv suggesting that the strengthening effect of nzvi is weakened in addition the abundance of methanosaeta was the lowest in rfe c thus fe c could shift methane production pathways from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic 3 5 effects of zvi based materials on the mrna expression metatranscriptomic analysis was employed to investigate the metabolic activity of microbial communities the expression levels of key enzymes associated with byproduct formation electron transport dye degradation and methanogenic metabolism are shown in fig 8c and d formate dehydrogenases are a set of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of formate to co2 donating the electrons to nad or cytochrome which are important in anaerobic metabolism rathod et al 2017 as such formate dehydrogenase fdhb fdhd and fdhf was highly expressed but did not have substantial differences among the three bioreactors likely due to the same cod concentrations in the influent generally the majority of azo dye is characterized by large molecular weights and strong polarities and cannot enter cells suggesting the significant role of extracellular degradation mediated by electroactive bacteria in breaking down these compounds liu et al 2017 a series of enzymes and or redox mediators could participate in dye biodegradation including electron transfer flavoprotein nad p h dehydrogenase riboflavin synthase ubiquinone biosynthesis protein and azoreductase dai et al 2016 rathod et al 2017 the expression of electron transfer flavoprotein fixa b and riboflavin synthase riba behlt was at high level in all the bioreactors suggesting that it is necessary for the dye biodegradation compared with the rcon the expression levels of nad p h dehydrogenase were increased by 179 and 115 in rfe c and rfe c the nad p h dehydrogenase nqo1 wrba and nqr can act as an electron donor to take part in the cleavage of azo bond pricelius et al 2007 the expression levels of ubiquinone synthase ubia bdegi in rfe c and rfe c were 3 4 fold and 1 4 fold higher than that of rcon respectively the degradation of large molecular azo dye requires the participation of a redox mediator such as riboflavin and ubiquinone that can act as electron shuttles between the nad p h dehydrogenase and azoreductase sarkar et al 2017 the expression level of azoreductase azor in rfe c was significantly higher than that of rfe c and rcon however the expression level of azoreductase did not have a significant difference between rfe c and rcon likely suggesting that the strengthening effect of nzvi is not durable these results indicate that fe c stimulated the expression of functional enzymes that mediate electron transfer and facilitated the establishment of electron transfer between electron donor and azo dye considering that both dye and methanogens can act as electron acceptors during organic oxidation the expression of enzymes involved in methane metabolism including methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis were analyzed fig 8d the expression levels of fmda g ftr mch and mer involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in rcon were similar with that in rfe c which was substantially lower than that in rfe c in accord with the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing and ch4 content the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and content of ch4 were similar between rcon and rfe c the expression levels of key enzymes ack acss cdha bdeg involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis were even lower in rfe c than that rcon this may be related to the instability and non sustainability of strengthening effect of fe c 4 discussion in this study the effects of fe c and nzvi on the decolorization ability of anaerobic system were systematically demonstrated although the effects of nzvi dosage and nzvi type on the performance of anaerobic systems were previously reported feng et al 2014 yang et al 2013 how h2 release rate from the dissolution of nzvi on the long term stability of reactor performance has not been fully understood results showed that dosing fe c or fe c shortened the startup time of the reactors and promoted azo dye degradation fig 1 however the mechanisms of their impacts on the system performance were different briefly the life cycle of the strengthening effect of fe c composites on the biodegradation of azo dye was greater than that of fe c the performance of rfe c was also more stable and efficient than that of rfe c such differences could be explained by three possible mechanisms firstly eps could encapsulate nzvi in biological systems he et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 and reduce the dissolution rate of nzvi likely attributing to the abundant functional groups in eps such as amino groups of proteins fig 6 however the affinity of pure nzvi to eps was relatively weak resulting in less eps attachment thus it could not efficiently slow the dissolution rate of nzvi which is supported by the finding that a low concentration of eps could not alleviate nzvi dissolution at all fig 4a meanwhile nzvi particles are easy to aggregate as clusters and reduce the effective surface and electron utilization of nzvi fig 5 conversely in the presence of carbon layer eps uniformly dispersed and was efficiently captured in the carbon layer through physical adsorption and or chemical bonding owing to the good adsorption properties of the porous carbon layer of fe c fig 7 in this light the impact of environmental disturbances e g ph fe2 on the properties of eps in and on the carbon layer could be weakened and the unique chemical properties of eps could be maintained meanwhile the carbon layer possesses good sorption ability for anions and buffer capacity in the micro region under acid or alkaline conditions xiao et al 2018 as a result nzvi of fe c was well protected and the dissolution rate of nzvi of fe c further slowed down compared with nzvi fig 4b the synergistic effect of eps and carbon layer also resulted in the homogeneous dispersion of nzvi in fe c which alleviated the cluster of nzvi particles during the dissolution process fig 5 and improved the electron utilization of nzvi compared to fe c more electroactive compounds e g cytochromes riboflavin were secreted and present in eps in the presence of fe c fig 8 previous studies reported that eps could be directly involved in extracellular electron transfer due to the presence of redox active in eps sathishkumar et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 thus the reactor with fe c could achieve higher electron utilization efficacy secondly although eps could complex with fe2 to form stable fe eps complex and prevent the formation of nzvi corrosion passivation layer to some extent e g iron oxides ferrous phosphates he et al 2020 the complexing capacity of the eps attached on the surface of nzvi particles might be weakened or even disappear in the presence of abundant fe2 released from nzvi dissolution for example as observed in the batch experiment the dissolved fe2 was high as 80 mg l e g after 120 h of reaction in 100 nm nzvi group fig s6 which was much higher than 25 mg l in fe c group it can be inferred that the protective ability of the attached eps on pure nzvi would decrease faster compared to that attached on the surface of fe c as for the fe c composites the carbon layer could act as a buffer material to react with the released fe2 and or neutralize oh inside the carbon layer as such the protective ability of eps to nzvi via complexing process could be more lasting it should be noted that the carbon layer could also change the reaction site of fe2 and inorganic salts by reducing the diffusion of inorganic salt ions from the inside to outside of the carbon layer it suggests that iron salt precipitation could be more likely generated on the surface of the carbon layer or in the bulk rather than on the surface of nzvi particles in addition the average particle size of nzvi in fe c composites was approximately 100 nm fig s1 which is consistent with gong et al 2018 but we observed that the ph fluctuation in the nzvi dissolution of fe c composites was less pronounced than that of 100 nm nzvi particles fig s6 suggesting the buffering capacity of carbon layer wang et al 2012 reported that acidic or alkaline conditions in the micro region could change the dispersion of eps and affect the affinity of eps to nzvi in this light we speculate that fe c could have a greater ability to mitigate the effects of substantial fluctuations of ph on eps properties and maintain its protective ability to nzvi thirdly nzvi and fe c imposed different impacts on the microbial community although both nzvi and fe c could increase the functional microorganisms involved in hydrolysis acidification of organic matter e g bacteroidetes vadinha17 and methanogenesis e g methanobacterium fig 8 substantially higher abundance of electroactive bacteria e g clostridium geobacter was only observed in the presence of fe c as stated above electroactive bacteria are the key players in dye degradation it could explain the better performance of rfe c than rfe c shi et al 2022 reported zero valent iron could also promote the growth of electroactive bacteria in an anaerobic biofilm reactor treating dairy wastewater which is contradictory to the finding observed in this study it may be due to the fact that the sludge samples used for the microbial community were collected at the end of respective stages instead of the time points right after the dosing events of fe c considering the fast dissolution rate of pure nzvi the intermittent dosing strategies employed in this study may have less effects on microbial community and function especially the electroactive populations as time went by after nzvi addition these findings were further demonstrated by metatranscriptomic analysis fig 8c in which only fe c could substantially stimulate the expression of genes associated with dye degradation e g nqo1 ubia and azor thus fe c could exhibit greater advantages over fe c in enhancing dye degradation and maintaining system stability 5 environmental implications nzvi is known to be an effective bioaugmentation additive in terms of promoting the transformation of various refractory organic pollutants and improving methane production during anaerobic wastewater treatment feng et al 2014 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a previous studies primarily focused on the nzvi enhancing effect in short term batch experiments and its effect on the long term stability of reactor performance was largely neglected xu et al 2021b yang et al 2013 in this study we found that the enhancing effect of pure nzvi was unstable and not durable from a long term operation perspective which greatly limits its practical application in anaerobic wastewater treatment alternatively the core shell structured fe c composites could address such issues the porous carbon layer can interact with eps to form an integrated buffer layer by adsorption and chemical bonding the buffer layer not only regulates the attack of h on nzvi to reduce the dissolution rate of nzvi but also neutralizes and absorbs inorganic salt ions to alleviate the formation of a passivation layer on the nzvi surface therefore the activation process of nzvi in fe c was relatively stable and durable and a better reactor performance can be obtained nzvi has been reported to have obvious toxic effects on microbial cells due to its strong reducibility and physical sting on cells he et al 2017 lefevre et al 2016 the presence of a carbon layer of fe c composites could avoid direct contact between the cells and nzvi which may weaken the toxicity of nzvi on cells these merits further confirmation via more meticulous studies in the future according to the preparation method of fe c employed in this work the cost resulted from fe c synthesis would be high however given the effectiveness and stability of its bioaugmentation on system performance both the dosage and dosing frequency of fe c could be reduced thus the operational cost induced by fe c dosage may be comparable or even less than nzvi which highlights further investigations via techno economic analysis 6 conclusion herein fe c composites mediated slow release technology of nzvi was developed to promote the biodegradation of azo dye the main findings fe c composites achieved a better decolorization efficiency of azo dye than the mixture of nzvi and carbon powder and the strengthening effect of fe c was more stable and durable fe c composites stimulated the secretion of electroactive compounds e g cytochromes riboflavin to enhance the electron transport activity which facilitated the biodegradation of azo dye the dissolution of nzvi was regulated by eps due to its chemical properties the interactions of the carbon layer of fe c and eps further reduced the dissolution of nzvi and enhance electron utilization different from nzvi fe c not only substantially increased the abundance of functional microorganisms involved in the degradation of azo dye e g clostridium geobacter but also highly stimulated the expression of azoreductase riboflavin and ubiquinone biosynthesis thereby achieving a better and more stable removal of azo dye declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

15093,nano zero valent iron nzvi has been widely used to improve refractory wastewater treatment however the rapid dissolution of nzvi causes a waste of resources and an unstable bioaugmentation herein to verify the essential role of slow release of nzvi on biological systems a core shell structured fe c composite was developed to demonstrate the long term feasibility of fe c for enhancing azo dye biodegradation in comparison to a mixture of nzvi and carbon powder fe c the 150 days of long term reactor operation showed that although both fe c and fe c enhanced azo dye degradation the former achieved a better performance than the latter the strengthening effect of fe c was also more durable and stable than fe c it may be due to the fact that the carbon layer of fe c could interact with extracellular polymeric substances eps through physical adsorption and chemical bonding to form a stable buffer to regulate nzvi dissolution the buffer layer could not only regulate the attack of h on nzvi to reduce its dissolution rate but also complex released fe2 and neutralize oh to alleviate the passivation layer formed on the nzvi surface moreover microbial community analysis indicated that both fe c and fe c increased the abundance of fermentative bacteria e g bacteroidetes vadinha17 propionicicella and methanogens e g methanobacterium but only fe c promoted the growth of azo dye degraders e g clostridium geobacter metatranscriptomic analysis further revealed that only fe c could substantially stimulate the expression of azoreductase and redox mediator e g riboflavin ubiquinone biosynthesis involved in the extracellular degradation of azo dye this work provides novel insights into the bioaugmentation of fe c for refractory wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fe c composites azo dye biodegradation extracellular polymeric substances redox mediator azoreductase expression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic treatment is a promising pre treatment process to improve the biodegradability of refractory wastewater via transforming macromolecular organics kong et al 2019 refractory organic nitrogen pollutants e g azo dyes nitro aromatics are the representative contaminants which are ubiquitous in industrial wastewaters such as textile dying wastewater chemical wastewater and spraying paint wastewater dai et al 2016 liu et al 2017 however conventional anaerobic treatment processes could not achieve satisfactory removal of azo dye cui et al 2019 many efforts have so far been attempted to improve the anaerobic degradation of dyes among which the use of zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi was identified as an attractive approach due to its high efficiency and strong reducibility compared to carbon based nanomaterials li et al 2013 2019 however the effectiveness of nzvi on anaerobic systems varied case by case barrena et al 2021 he et al 2017 it may be attributed to the following reasons first owing to the high reactivity nzvi can rapidly release h2 when exposed to h xie et al 2017 the escape of h2 reduces the electron utilization of nzvi and wastes nzvi second high h2 partial pressure resulting from the substantial h2 accumulation could have an inhibitory effect on methanogenesis metabolism yang et al 2013 nzvi may also have direct toxic effects on anaerobes due to its reductive disruption of the cell membrane he et al 2017 third nzvi is prone to agglomerate and inorganic salt ions could precipitate the released fe2 and form a passivation layer on the surface of nzvi which may reduce its accessibility khalil et al 2017 xu et al 2021a in this light a long term evaluation of the effect of nzvi on the system stability and microbial community is indeed necessary which however has not well been documented previously carbon coating nzvi to form core shell structured fe c composites may overcome the drawbacks of nzvi stated above the carbon layer of fe c could be beneficial for regulating the dissolution of nzvi due to its porous property also the carbon layer could reduce the inhibitory effects of inorganic salts on nzvi activation and avoid the formation of nzvi clusters xu et al 2021a thus the release of electrons from fe c may be more consistent and stable than that from pure nzvi in biological systems the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps is ubiquitous xiao et al 2017 we hypothesized that the combination of carbon layer of fe c and eps could be a feasible strategy to stably regulate the dissolution rate of nzvi thereby enhancing electron utilization although eps alone can reduce the h2 release rate from nzvi dissolution via accepting electrons from nzvi and enhance h2 yield via preventing nzvi corrosion passivation he et al 2017 the eps properties are sensitive to environmental disturbances for example a change in ph and or released fe2 could greatly affect the structure and surface properties of eps which may weaken its affinity or adsorption to nzvi influencing electron utilization wang et al 2012 the presence of carbon layer would make eps more resilient to environmental disturbances on one hand eps could embed in the porous carbon layer and then form an integrated buffer layer which could regulate the transfer of h from the bulk to the nzvi surface and adjust the release rate of electrons in return the carbon layer could independently act as a protective layer to reduce the impact of external disturbances e g toxic metal ions on eps properties by neutralization and adsorption ensuring eps stability on the other hand the carbon layer together with eps can complex the released fe2 and avoid the formation of a passivation layer on the nzvi surface thus it highlights a comprehensive study to demonstrate the potential synergistic effect of the carbon layer and eps on electron utilization of nzvi therefore the overall objective of this study was to investigate the long term feasibility and stability of fe c composites modified egsb reactor treating wastewater containing refractory organic nitrogen azo dye was chosen as the representative recalcitrant compound to systematically characterize the underlying mechanisms towards the interactions between the carbon layer and eps the effects of eps concentration electroactive compounds in eps and zero valent iron zvi type on the dissolution of zvi were explored the electron transport activity microbial community and gene expression associated with the degradation of azo dye were then examined the findings obtained in this study could provide insightful information about the manipulation of anaerobic systems with zvi to promote the degradation of recalcitrant compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 additives seeding sludge and synthetic wastewater nzvi 40 nm and 100 nm 99 9 purity and carbon powder 150 nm 99 9 purity were purchased from shanghai rhawn

media 2 2 experimental set up and operational parameters three identical egsb reactors with a working volume of 2 5 l and a height of 50 cm were employed one reactor amended with fe c composites was named rfe c one reactor amended with a mixture of carbon powder and 100 nm nzvi was named rfe c and another without additives was named rcon the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations were 20 g l with an mlvss mlss ratio of 0 72 the ph inside reactors was adjusted to 6 8 7 8 with nahco3 solution the entire experiment lasted 150 days at room temperature 23 2 c which was divided into four stages the dosage of fe c and nzvi was according to the result of preliminary experiment and the additives addition was only conducted on days 30 61 97 113 and 135 the detailed information on the operating parameters of the reactors is described in table 1 during additives addition nzvi was initially transferred into a 50 ml syringe equipped with a three port valve in the anaerobic chamber due to its high reactivity and then nzvi was introduced into the bottom of reactor through the syringe the cod dye aromatic amines and fe2 concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured daily 2 3 effect of eps on zvi dissolution experiment i was designed to investigate the effects of eps concentration on zvi dissolution fig s3 eps was obtained from the granular sludge collected at the end of stage iii the detailed protocols about eps extraction and characterization can be found in text s2 the batch experiments were conducted in 100 ml serum bottle with 1 g l 100 nm nzvi and 60 ml eps solution of different concentrations i e 0 32 96 160 mg l the initial ph of each bottle was adjusted to 6 8 7 2 with 0 2 mol l hcl naoh solution to exclude the interferences of inorganic salts on nzvi dissolution nacl was added to ensure that the nacl concentration of each serum bottle is 0 05 all the bottles were purged with n2 for 15 min to remove oxygen and equipped with a three port valve for gas collection and sampling the bottles were placed on a shaker with 150 rpm at 35 c for 800 h samples are taken every two days using a syringe for the determination of h2 vol ph and fe2 concentration the batch experiments were conducted in triplicates experiment ii was performed to explore the interactions between eps and different types of zvi based on the results of experiment i 96 mg l eps was chosen as the optimal eps concentration for slowing the dissolution rate of nzvi four types of zvi were investigated including 40 nm nzvi 100 nm nzvi 1000 nm mzvi and 150 nm fe c the dosage of zvi was the same in each batch experiment bottle the batch experiments were conducted in 50 ml serum bottle with 20 ml eps solution and the other conditions were the same to those described in experimental i the h2 vol ph and fe2 concentration were measured every two days at the end of batch experiment the corroded zvi was collected for morphologies observation by scanning electron microscopy sem and atomic force microscope afm functional group determination by flourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and crystal identification by x ray diffraction xrd with a 2 theta range from 20 to 90 samples pretreatment for physicochemical properties analysis was carried out according to xu et al 2021a 2 4 chemical microbial activity and microbial community analyzes cod mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 1998 the concentrations of aromatic amines and azo dye were measured by spectrophotometry based on xu et al 2021c the

following xu et al 2021a cyclic voltammetry cv sludge conductivity and relative ets activity of granules were also analyzed and their protocols are presented in text s3 a total of 9 sludge samples were collected on days 60 and 112 for 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil bio 101 vista ca illumina pyrosequencing was conducted on the miseq pe300 platform illumina inc ca us by major biotech co ltd shanghai china the detailed information about the high throughput sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis is described in text s4 3 results 3 1 long term performance of fe c and nzvi modified bioreactors the egsb reactors were continuously operated for 150 days fig 1 in stage i days 1 29 the three bioreactors stabilized within 10 days and displayed similar cod removal efficiencies 90 on average but most of the azo dye remained in the effluent approximately 70 mg l in stage ii days 30 96 the effluent cod concentrations were again comparable among the bioreactors 92 on average which may be due to the long hrt employed 30 h the average removal efficiency of azo dye in the three bioreactors followed the order of rfe c 82 rfe c 78 rcon 49 correspondingly the concentrations of intermediates of dye degradation aromatic amines followed the same order of rfe c rfe c rcon the results indicate that both fe c composites and fe c enhanced azo dye degradation and fe c composites could achieve a better performance than fe c which is also supported by the higher decolorization efficiency in rfe c vs rfe c fig s4 in stage iii days 97 134 the dye concentration in the influent increased to approximately 200 mg l a pronounced fluctuation of dye concentration in rcon was observed resulting in 26 43 removal efficiency on average conversely the performance of rfe c and rfe c was relatively stable throughout stage iii though the dosages of fe c composites and fe c were reduced to 1 5 g the average dye removal efficiencies in rfe c and rfe c were 54 and 66 respectively which were substantially higher than that in rcon however unlike the stable performance of rfe c the concentrations of cod dye and fe2 in the effluent of rfe c experienced obvious fluctuations with each dosing event this result further demonstrates the better performance of rfe c than rfe c and the enhancing effect of fe c was more stable and durable in stage iv days 135 150 the influent azo dye concentration was further increased to 400 mg l to evaluate whether fe c and fe c could mitigate the inhibitory effect of high concentration azo dye on anaerobic systems result showed that the effluent concentrations of dye and cod increased in all bioreactors but the average dye removal efficiency of rfe c was still the highest similar as stage iii fe2 concentration in stage iv in the effluent of rfe c was also higher and displayed substantial fluctuation compared to that in the effluent of rfe c it seems that fe c could allow microbial community being more resistant and resilient to azo dye toxicity additionally fe c and fe c additions resulted in different influence patterns on the properties of granular sludge the surface of granular sludge in rfe c showed a laminated structure and the channels on the granules surface seemed to be clogged while the granule surface in rfe c was loose and the channel like structure was visible fig 2 the channels of granular sludge are crucial for substrates transfer the blockage of channels in rfe c could increase mass transfer resistance and subsequently cause a reduced mechanical strength of granular sludge compared to that in rfe c fig s5 these results indicate that although nzvi could improve the system performance the long term adverse effects of nzvi on granular sludge could not be avoided 3 2 characteristics of electrochemical activity to better understand the effects of fe c and nzvi on the redox properties of the anaerobic system the electrochemical behavior of the sludge was tested two pairs of reductive and oxidative peaks were detected during the cv analysis fig 3 a the peak currents increased with the presence of fe c and nzvi following the order of rfe c 0 48 ma rfe c 0 43 ma rcon 0 40 ma this result suggests that fe c and nzvi increased the electrochemical response more sensitive dpv tests were then conducted to identify the electroactive compounds fig 3b two pairs of dpv peaks with oxidation peaks at 132 and 172 mv and reduction peaks at 138 and 176 mv were determined attributing to cytochromes okamoto et al 2013 compared with rcon both the sludge conductivity and ets activity in rfe c and rfe c were higher fig 3c and d interestingly the relative ets activity in rfe c decreased from 118 to 109 when the dosage decreased from 7 to 2 5 g while the relative ets activity in rfe c remained in increasing trend suggesting that fe c possessed higher stability and durability than fe c in terms of electron transport enhancement 3 3 effect of eps on zvi dissolution 3 3 1 interaction of eps and different types of zvi the effects of eps concentration on zvi dissolution were revealed in fig 4 compared to eps free solution a low concentration of 32 mg l eps did not significantly change the release rate of h2 from nzvi however the high concentration of eps 96 and 160 mg l exhibited significant inhibition on h2 production fig 4a meanwhile the effect of eps on the dissolution of zvi with different particle sizes was further explored fig 4b the result showed that more h2 was released with the increased size of zvi fe2 was released in all groups fig s6 suggesting that eps could reduce the release rate of h2 but could not completely hinder zvi dissolution moreover the ph increased significantly in the 1000 nm mzvi due to its rapid dissolution initially compared to the other groups fig s6 furthermore the release of h2 was lower in fe c compared to 100 nm nzvi which may be attributed to the presence of a carbon layer of fe c thus the interactions of the carbon layer of fe c and eps could reduce the release rate of h2 3 3 2 characterization of corroded zvi at the end of experiment ii the morphologies of zvi surface were investigated fig 5 the surface of corroded 40 nm nzvi was compact and small sized agglomerates fig 5a the surface of the corrosion product became loose and rough with elevated sizes of zvi fig 5b for instance the 1000 nm mzvi had obvious corrosion traces and several pores fig 5c moreover clusters were formed in 1000 nm mzvi while the 40 nm nzvi group was still uniformly dispersed fig 5e and f in contrast the surface of corroded fe c particle was compact and rather dense and its morphology was similar to that of 40 nm nzvi thus zvi with a large particle size was more likely to be corroded by eps solution while the combination of the carbon layer and eps could alleviate the dissolution of zvi additionally eds analysis showed that fe c and o were the dominant elements on the surface of corrosion products table s2 suggesting that eps could be adsorbed and or bound on the zvi or fe c surface xrd analysis was further employed to characterize the corrosion products fig 6 a for the 100 nm nzvi in the pure aqueous solution the intensity of iron peak was significantly lower than that of the 100 nm nzvi with eps similarly the intensity of the iron peak decreased gradually with increased sizes of zvi which is consistent with the result of h2 production however no obvious iron oxide crystals were detected on the 1000 nm mzvi this could be because the release of fe2 can not only be converted into iron oxide precipitates but also interact with eps via complexation eljamal et al 2018 he et al 2020 as a result the structure and surface properties of eps changed which could weaken the protective effect of eps on zvi dissolution 3 3 3 analysis of properties of eps considering that functional groups in eps may affect zvi dissolution eps were characterized by ftir spectra as shown in fig 6b the peak at 3400 cm 1 was associated with oh stretching and the peak at 1600 cm 1 was attributed to c o and c c stretching in protein structure zhu et al 2012 a minor peak at 1578 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching of nh in protein while the peak near approximately 1400 cm 1 was attributed to coo wang et al 2012 the peak at 1020 cm 1 was assigned to the vibrational stretching of co c and ch in carbohydrates the amine group bending in eps is prone to obtain h and then be protonated while carboxylic groups can neutralize oh by deprotonation omoike and chorover 2004 it means that eps can act as a buffer layer due to the presence of abundant and diverse functional groups which might regulate the direct contact between h oh and zvi fe2 to change the electrons utilization it should be pointed out that the species of functional groups on the surface of fe c was different from nzvi materials which may be due to the penetration of eps into the carbon layer xps analysis also confirmed the interaction between eps and nzvi figs 6c and s7 in addition uv spectra were employed to further analyze the changes in electroactive compounds in eps after reaction with zvi fig 6d two apparent absorbance peaks at approximately 267 and 410 nm were detected in the original eps which could be associated with riboflavin and cytochromes xiao et al 2017 after reaction with zvi the intensities of two absorption bonds substantially decreased suggesting that these electroactive compounds could interact with nzvi and or fe2 interestingly the intensities of absorption peaks in the fe c group were significantly lower than in the other groups which might be attributed to the penetration of those electroactive compounds into the carbon layer of fe c it was noted that the intensity of the peak at approximately 410 nm decreased while the peak at approximately 345 nm increased suggesting that the redox reaction could occur in eps chen et al 2014 martinez and alvarez 2018 besides 3d eem was conducted to reveal the effects of fluorescent compounds in eps on zvi dissolution three characteristic peaks are identified in the original eps fig s8 peak a ex em 280 350 peak b ex em 345 415 and peak c ex em 420 470 which represented tryptophan like humic acid like and riboflavin like substances xu et al 2018 zhu et al 2012 compared to the original eps the intensity of fluorescent compounds in eps decreased in all groups fig 7 suggesting that eps may be adsorbed by zvi and or reacted with zvi for the 40 nm nzvi the intensity of all peaks in eps was significantly lower than that of the 100 nm nzvi and 1000 nm mzvi interestingly the peaks of a and b even disappeared in the fe c suggesting that fe c composites could exhibit a better ability in capturing eps compared to other zvi materials it means that the carbon layer was beneficial for the enrichment of eps on the nzvi surface 3 4 effects of zvi based materials on the microbial community the microbial compositions at genus level are presented in fig 8 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 significantly increased in the presence of fe c or fe c bacteroidetes vadinha17 was fermentative bacteria xu et al 2021a zhang et al 2018b which could decompose complex organics with vfas being the by products previous studies reported that the addition of nzvi could enhance the hydrolysis acidification process during anaerobic digestion feng et al 2014 the abundance of synergistaceae and anaerolinea decreased with increased dye concentration indicating their low tolerance to the toxicity of dye the extracellular respiration performed by electroactive bacteria generally accepts electrons released from the organics and zvi to reduce dye clostridium desulfovibirio and geobacter were found to be electrotrophic or electroactive bacteria lovley 2022 which play an important role in azo dye degradation no substantial difference in azo dye degraders e g clostridium desulfovibirio was found between the rcon and rfe c regardless of azo dye concentration in contrast fe c could promote the growth of clostridium and geobacter and their abundance was 10 4 and 0 7 in rfe c respectively in addition methanobacterium and methanosaeta were the dominant methanogens among which methanobacterium is a hydrogenophilic methanogen that can utilize h2 and co2 to produce methane zhang et al 2022 both fe c and fe c increased the abundance of fermentative bacteria e g bacteroidetes vadinha17 propionicicella and methanogens e g methanobacterium methanobacterium is an electrotrophic microorganism and can accept electrons from nzvi and other microbial species via direct interspecies electron transfer the ch4 content in rfe c and rfe of stage ii was significantly higher than that of rcon fig s9 however the ch4 content did not have a significant difference between rfe c and rcon in stages iii and iv suggesting that the strengthening effect of nzvi is weakened in addition the abundance of methanosaeta was the lowest in rfe c thus fe c could shift methane production pathways from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic 3 5 effects of zvi based materials on the mrna expression metatranscriptomic analysis was employed to investigate the metabolic activity of microbial communities the expression levels of key enzymes associated with byproduct formation electron transport dye degradation and methanogenic metabolism are shown in fig 8c and d formate dehydrogenases are a set of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of formate to co2 donating the electrons to nad or cytochrome which are important in anaerobic metabolism rathod et al 2017 as such formate dehydrogenase fdhb fdhd and fdhf was highly expressed but did not have substantial differences among the three bioreactors likely due to the same cod concentrations in the influent generally the majority of azo dye is characterized by large molecular weights and strong polarities and cannot enter cells suggesting the significant role of extracellular degradation mediated by electroactive bacteria in breaking down these compounds liu et al 2017 a series of enzymes and or redox mediators could participate in dye biodegradation including electron transfer flavoprotein nad p h dehydrogenase riboflavin synthase ubiquinone biosynthesis protein and azoreductase dai et al 2016 rathod et al 2017 the expression of electron transfer flavoprotein fixa b and riboflavin synthase riba behlt was at high level in all the bioreactors suggesting that it is necessary for the dye biodegradation compared with the rcon the expression levels of nad p h dehydrogenase were increased by 179 and 115 in rfe c and rfe c the nad p h dehydrogenase nqo1 wrba and nqr can act as an electron donor to take part in the cleavage of azo bond pricelius et al 2007 the expression levels of ubiquinone synthase ubia bdegi in rfe c and rfe c were 3 4 fold and 1 4 fold higher than that of rcon respectively the degradation of large molecular azo dye requires the participation of a redox mediator such as riboflavin and ubiquinone that can act as electron shuttles between the nad p h dehydrogenase and azoreductase sarkar et al 2017 the expression level of azoreductase azor in rfe c was significantly higher than that of rfe c and rcon however the expression level of azoreductase did not have a significant difference between rfe c and rcon likely suggesting that the strengthening effect of nzvi is not durable these results indicate that fe c stimulated the expression of functional enzymes that mediate electron transfer and facilitated the establishment of electron transfer between electron donor and azo dye considering that both dye and methanogens can act as electron acceptors during organic oxidation the expression of enzymes involved in methane metabolism including methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis were analyzed fig 8d the expression levels of fmda g ftr mch and mer involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in rcon were similar with that in rfe c which was substantially lower than that in rfe c in accord with the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing and ch4 content the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and content of ch4 were similar between rcon and rfe c the expression levels of key enzymes ack acss cdha bdeg involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis were even lower in rfe c than that rcon this may be related to the instability and non sustainability of strengthening effect of fe c 4 discussion in this study the effects of fe c and nzvi on the decolorization ability of anaerobic system were systematically demonstrated although the effects of nzvi dosage and nzvi type on the performance of anaerobic systems were previously reported feng et al 2014 yang et al 2013 how h2 release rate from the dissolution of nzvi on the long term stability of reactor performance has not been fully understood results showed that dosing fe c or fe c shortened the startup time of the reactors and promoted azo dye degradation fig 1 however the mechanisms of their impacts on the system performance were different briefly the life cycle of the strengthening effect of fe c composites on the biodegradation of azo dye was greater than that of fe c the performance of rfe c was also more stable and efficient than that of rfe c such differences could be explained by three possible mechanisms firstly eps could encapsulate nzvi in biological systems he et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 and reduce the dissolution rate of nzvi likely attributing to the abundant functional groups in eps such as amino groups of proteins fig 6 however the affinity of pure nzvi to eps was relatively weak resulting in less eps attachment thus it could not efficiently slow the dissolution rate of nzvi which is supported by the finding that a low concentration of eps could not alleviate nzvi dissolution at all fig 4a meanwhile nzvi particles are easy to aggregate as clusters and reduce the effective surface and electron utilization of nzvi fig 5 conversely in the presence of carbon layer eps uniformly dispersed and was efficiently captured in the carbon layer through physical adsorption and or chemical bonding owing to the good adsorption properties of the porous carbon layer of fe c fig 7 in this light the impact of environmental disturbances e g ph fe2 on the properties of eps in and on the carbon layer could be weakened and the unique chemical properties of eps could be maintained meanwhile the carbon layer possesses good sorption ability for anions and buffer capacity in the micro region under acid or alkaline conditions xiao et al 2018 as a result nzvi of fe c was well protected and the dissolution rate of nzvi of fe c further slowed down compared with nzvi fig 4b the synergistic effect of eps and carbon layer also resulted in the homogeneous dispersion of nzvi in fe c which alleviated the cluster of nzvi particles during the dissolution process fig 5 and improved the electron utilization of nzvi compared to fe c more electroactive compounds e g cytochromes riboflavin were secreted and present in eps in the presence of fe c fig 8 previous studies reported that eps could be directly involved in extracellular electron transfer due to the presence of redox active in eps sathishkumar et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 thus the reactor with fe c could achieve higher electron utilization efficacy secondly although eps could complex with fe2 to form stable fe eps complex and prevent the formation of nzvi corrosion passivation layer to some extent e g iron oxides ferrous phosphates he et al 2020 the complexing capacity of the eps attached on the surface of nzvi particles might be weakened or even disappear in the presence of abundant fe2 released from nzvi dissolution for example as observed in the batch experiment the dissolved fe2 was high as 80 mg l e g after 120 h of reaction in 100 nm nzvi group fig s6 which was much higher than 25 mg l in fe c group it can be inferred that the protective ability of the attached eps on pure nzvi would decrease faster compared to that attached on the surface of fe c as for the fe c composites the carbon layer could act as a buffer material to react with the released fe2 and or neutralize oh inside the carbon layer as such the protective ability of eps to nzvi via complexing process could be more lasting it should be noted that the carbon layer could also change the reaction site of fe2 and inorganic salts by reducing the diffusion of inorganic salt ions from the inside to outside of the carbon layer it suggests that iron salt precipitation could be more likely generated on the surface of the carbon layer or in the bulk rather than on the surface of nzvi particles in addition the average particle size of nzvi in fe c composites was approximately 100 nm fig s1 which is consistent with gong et al 2018 but we observed that the ph fluctuation in the nzvi dissolution of fe c composites was less pronounced than that of 100 nm nzvi particles fig s6 suggesting the buffering capacity of carbon layer wang et al 2012 reported that acidic or alkaline conditions in the micro region could change the dispersion of eps and affect the affinity of eps to nzvi in this light we speculate that fe c could have a greater ability to mitigate the effects of substantial fluctuations of ph on eps properties and maintain its protective ability to nzvi thirdly nzvi and fe c imposed different impacts on the microbial community although both nzvi and fe c could increase the functional microorganisms involved in hydrolysis acidification of organic matter e g bacteroidetes vadinha17 and methanogenesis e g methanobacterium fig 8 substantially higher abundance of electroactive bacteria e g clostridium geobacter was only observed in the presence of fe c as stated above electroactive bacteria are the key players in dye degradation it could explain the better performance of rfe c than rfe c shi et al 2022 reported zero valent iron could also promote the growth of electroactive bacteria in an anaerobic biofilm reactor treating dairy wastewater which is contradictory to the finding observed in this study it may be due to the fact that the sludge samples used for the microbial community were collected at the end of respective stages instead of the time points right after the dosing events of fe c considering the fast dissolution rate of pure nzvi the intermittent dosing strategies employed in this study may have less effects on microbial community and function especially the electroactive populations as time went by after nzvi addition these findings were further demonstrated by metatranscriptomic analysis fig 8c in which only fe c could substantially stimulate the expression of genes associated with dye degradation e g nqo1 ubia and azor thus fe c could exhibit greater advantages over fe c in enhancing dye degradation and maintaining system stability 5 environmental implications nzvi is known to be an effective bioaugmentation additive in terms of promoting the transformation of various refractory organic pollutants and improving methane production during anaerobic wastewater treatment feng et al 2014 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a previous studies primarily focused on the nzvi enhancing effect in short term batch experiments and its effect on the long term stability of reactor performance was largely neglected xu et al 2021b yang et al 2013 in this study we found that the enhancing effect of pure nzvi was unstable and not durable from a long term operation perspective which greatly limits its practical application in anaerobic wastewater treatment alternatively the core shell structured fe c composites could address such issues the porous carbon layer can interact with eps to form an integrated buffer layer by adsorption and chemical bonding the buffer layer not only regulates the attack of h on nzvi to reduce the dissolution rate of nzvi but also neutralizes and absorbs inorganic salt ions to alleviate the formation of a passivation layer on the nzvi surface therefore the activation process of nzvi in fe c was relatively stable and durable and a better reactor performance can be obtained nzvi has been reported to have obvious toxic effects on microbial cells due to its strong reducibility and physical sting on cells he et al 2017 lefevre et al 2016 the presence of a carbon layer of fe c composites could avoid direct contact between the cells and nzvi which may weaken the toxicity of nzvi on cells these merits further confirmation via more meticulous studies in the future according to the preparation method of fe c employed in this work the cost resulted from fe c synthesis would be high however given the effectiveness and stability of its bioaugmentation on system performance both the dosage and dosing frequency of fe c could be reduced thus the operational cost induced by fe c dosage may be comparable or even less than nzvi which highlights further investigations via techno economic analysis 6 conclusion herein fe c composites mediated slow release technology of nzvi was developed to promote the biodegradation of azo dye the main findings fe c composites achieved a better decolorization efficiency of azo dye than the mixture of nzvi and carbon powder and the strengthening effect of fe c was more stable and durable fe c composites stimulated the secretion of electroactive compounds e g cytochromes riboflavin to enhance the electron transport activity which facilitated the biodegradation of azo dye the dissolution of nzvi was regulated by eps due to its chemical properties the interactions of the carbon layer of fe c and eps further reduced the dissolution of nzvi and enhance electron utilization different from nzvi fe c not only substantially increased the abundance of functional microorganisms involved in the degradation of azo dye e g clostridium geobacter but also highly stimulated the expression of azoreductase riboflavin and ubiquinone biosynthesis thereby achieving a better and more stable removal of azo dye declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

15094,it is of great significance to start up the anammox process in the most commonly used anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process in treating mainstream municipal wastewater recently partial denitrification anammox pd a has attracted increasing interest as a new avenue in mainstream this study investigated the in situ start up of pd a process in a traditional a2 o process the pd a system was rapidly started up within 60 days by adding virgin carriers into the anoxic zone and then run stably for the next 90 days the in situ anammox activity reached 1 0 0 1 mg nh4 n l h contributing 37 9 6 2 of total nitrogen removal as a result the nitrogen removal efficiency of the system increased by 16 9 the anammox bacteria anaob on the anoxic biofilms were enriched with a doubling time of 14 53d and the relative abundance reached 2 49 on day 150 phylogenetic analysis showed the dominant anaob was related to ca brocadia sp 40 which was the only detected anammox genus in the anoxic biofilm from start up to stable operation batch tests and qpcr results revealed that compared with the floc sludge the anoxic biofilms exhibited no2 accumulation driven by pd and performed a better coordination between denitrifiers and anaob overall this study provides great confidence for the in situ fast start up of mainstream anammox using conventional activated sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox anoxic biofilms partial denitrification start up biological nitrogen removal municipal wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the finding of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox overthrew the cognition of biological nitrogen removal thereby affecting the research in this field over the following decades strous et al 1997 anammox bacteria anaob directly oxidize ammonium nh4 to dinitrogen gas n2 with nitrite no2 as electron acceptor and no need for oxygen or organic carbon thus it is a high efficiency and energy saving technology compared with the conventional technology strous et al 1998 at present anammox technologies have been widely implemented in treating ammonia rich wastewater such as digestion liquid and landfill leachate lackner et al 2014 current interest has focused on the mainstream municipal wastewater with low ammonia the shift from sidestream to mainstream application has become the trend of global anammox related technology development the start up of anammox installations is quite time consuming cao et al 2017 for example it took more than 3 years to start the world s first full scale anammox reactor which initially used ordinary sludge from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp as the seed sludge van der star et al 2007 in response to this problem most of the established anammox systems usually inoculated with mature anammox sludge especially for low strength mainstream sewage laureni et al 2016 miao et al 2020 peng et al 2019 nevertheless sufficient anammox biomass is not always available and some researches showed that the inadaptability of inoculated biomass to the new conditions led to performance instability cho et al 2011 yang et al 2017 attempting to in situ quickly start up through local activated sludge in wwtps could solve this issue which would greatly promote the practical application of anammox in mainstream to date the study on the start up of mainstream anammox was mainly carried out based on partial nitrification nh4 no2 coupled with anammox pn a process cao et al 2017 for example a recent study reported that a mainstream pn a system was started up in about 250 days using ordinary activated sludge and anammox granules where nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob suppression was the primary step wu et al 2021 however several studies have concluded that inhibiting nob growth is a real bottleneck in mainstream pn a cao et al 2017 qiu et al 2020 the unstable nob activity would not only lead to the extension of the start up time but also might result the deterioration of performance after start up recently as an alternative avenue partial denitrification no3 no2 coupled with anammox pd a process has received increasing attention for its stable and efficient performance chen et al 2021 a high nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 93 6 and over 95 nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio ntr was obtained in a two stage pd a system simultaneously treating domestic and nitrate wastewater du et al 2017 another study reported that over 90 nre was maintained in a single stage pd a reactor when the temperature decreased from 27 1 to 17 5 c du et al 2019 therefore the start up of mainstream anammox based on pd a process might be more advantageous anoxic biofilms are crucial for pd a process especially for plug flow continuous system currently the research on the start up of anammox was mainly concentrated in the reactors with high biomass retention such as sequencing batch reactor and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket choi et al 2020 deore et al 2022 however for large wwtps a2 o and its modified process are the most widely used zhang et al 2021b so it deserves special attention several studies have confirmed that the traditional a2 o process is difficult to provide a good habitat for anammox such as adequate substrate long sludge retention time srt li et al 2019 wang et al 2015 recently experimental evidences showed that the pd a system could be constructed by introducing anoxic biofilms in the anoxic unit and the nre could be significantly improved gao et al 2021a li et al 2020 however these previous studies all started by inoculating anammox biofilms directly into anoxic zones moreover they were more from the perspective of performance and feasibility rather than focusing on the start up considering that the formation of anoxic biofilms and the enrichment of anaob might be slow and hard the start up of pd a process might become a major limitation for the practical application in plug flow continuous system therefore some key information such as start up time and microbial community would be critical to the practical application to our best knowledge there has never been any reports about the in situ start up of this process and insight into its mechanism is vital for practical application based on the above this study constructed an a2 o reactor with virgin carriers added to the anoxic zone to explore the start up of pd a process thus the long term performance in situ growth kinetics and activity of anaob nitrogen removal pathway microbial community succession and spatial distribution were investigated meanwhile the mechanism of in situ enrichment of anaob by anoxic biofilms and potential application were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation a continuous plug flow reactor 1 16 m 0 15 m 0 5 m effective volume 54 l fig 1 was implemented with a2 o process for 210 days using removable baffles the rectangular reactor was divided into seven units specifically one anaerobic unit two anoxic units and four aerobic units with a volume ratio of 1 4 4 the hydraulic retention time hrt was 13 hour the nitrifying liquid reflux and recycled activated sludge were adopted at 200 and 100 of the influent flow respectively the reactor was pumped with actual domestic wastewater nh4 n 59 50 79 49 mg l cod 152 4 280 5 mg l collected

consisted two phases in phase i the reactor run for 60 days to facilitate adaptation to the current operating conditions in phase ii moving virgin carriers k3 type table s2 were added into the anoxic zone at a packing ratio of 25 and other operation condition was the same as phase i different from most previous studies using fixed bed biofilm reactor gao et al 2021a li et al 2020 this study used moving bed biofilm reactor to better fit the actual wwtp submersible mixer was set up in the anoxic zone to fluidize the carriers table s3 2 2 activity tests nitrogen conversion was monitored by measuring the microbial activity specifically denitrification and pd a by batch tests biofilms and floc sludge samples were taken from the reactor and carefully rinsed with milli q water for three times then trace elements and mineral elements table s4 were added and quantified to 0 5 l with milli q water the substrates used for denitrification were no3 and acetate while those for pd a were nh4

domestic sewage fig 2 in phase ⅰ the bioreactor was inoculated with floc sludge and then operated for 60 days to make it stably adapt to the current operating conditions similar to most a2 o processes the reactor showed excellent nitrification performance and organics removal with removal efficiencies of nh4 n and cod achieving 97 8 5 5 and 81 7 6 2 respectively fig 2 however due to the organic matter in wastewater was not enough for heterotrophic denitrification cod tin 3 8 0 6 the nitrogen removal efficiency nre was only 58 1 7 3 and the corresponding effluent tin was 16 4 2 9 mg l which exceeded the stringent class a discharge standards in china faced with this situation external carbon source e g sodium acetate methanol was usually dosed in wwtps to achieve discharge standards nevertheless it increased the operation cost in the present study adding moving virgin carriers k3 to the anoxic zones of the a2 o bioreactor was adopted at a 25 filling ratio to in situ start up pd a process for a better nitrogen removal in the early stage phase ii 1 days 1 30 the nre did not notably change the average effluent tin was 18 0 2 7 mg l with a removal efficiency of 54 0 6 9 fig 2b c however from days 30 to 60 the effluent tin decreased from 18 4 mg l to 11 7 mg l and the corresponding removal efficiency increased to 73 1 furthermore the in situ anammox activity was evaluated by nh4 n loss in anoxic zone fig 2e which showed that the obvious anammox activity was detected after 30 days the anammox activity increased rapidly from day 30 to day 60 and reached 1 0 mg nh4 n l h on day 60 which was significantly correlated with the increase of nre r2 0 92 p 0 001 fig s2 the required start up time was acquired by fitting the time course of in situ anammox activity with boltzmann function as displayed in fig 2e which showed that the start up time was less than 60 days in the stable operation stage phase ii 3 days 60 150 although the influent cod tin ratio decreased to 3 1 0 4 the average nre remained a stable value of 70 9 4 1 and the corresponding effluent tin was 11 6 1 6 mg l fig 2b c values which met the discharge standards in china moreover the in situ anammox activity also stabilized at 1 0 0 1 mg nh4 n l h and anammox contributed 37 9 6 2 to total nitrogen removal 3 1 2 details of nutrients distribution typical variations of nitrogen phosphorus and cod on phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ 3 were detected along the reactor fig 3 a b which were used to further reveal the detail of nitrogen and organic matter removal in phase ⅰ nitrogen removal was mainly carried out in the anaerobic zone accounting for 72 16 although the hrt in the anoxic zone was as long as 6 h the denitrification in the anoxic zone was very weak due to the lack of carbon source resulting in the nitrogen loss in anoxic zone only accounted for 13 51 fig 3a meanwhile numerous no3 n was returned to the anaerobic zone through sludge recycle which seriously affected the phosphorus release fig 3a resulting in almost no phosphorus removal performance fig s3 in phase ⅱ 3 the core nitrogen removal function zone was transferred from the anaerobic zone to the anoxic zone and the nitrogen loss in anoxic zone increased to 55 81 fig 3b moreover although no no2 n accumulation was detected in the anoxic zone simultaneous decrease in no3 n and nh4 n were observed like one stage pn a this phenomenon could be considered as one stage pd a process which refers to the simultaneous partial denitrification and anammox without nitrite accumulation the specific nitrogen conversion mechanism would be elaborated in section 3 3 in addition more phosphorus released in anaerobic zone phase ⅰ 2 34 mg p l phase ii 10 57 mg p l resulting a better phosphorus removal performance the phosphorus removal efficiency increased from 11 7 38 1 in phase ⅰ to 45 5 34 in phase ii and the corresponding effluent po4 3 p decreased from 4 3 1 6 mg l to 2 0 1 3 mg l fig s3 surprisingly although the variation of cod in anoxic zone was still very small it undertaken so many nitrogen removal tasks the specific reason would be analyzed in the following sections 3 2 rapid and high enrichment of anaob on anoxic biofilms the abundance and community structure of anaob were evaluated using qpcr and high throughput sequencing since the anoxic biofilms were too thin around day 30 to sample the 16 s rrna genes copy numbers of anaob on the anoxic biofilms was detected from day 60 as shown in fig 4 a the abundance of anaob on anoxic biofilms reached 2 33 108 copies g dry sludge 0 07 on day 60 and then gradually increased to 5 06 109 copies g dry sludge 2 49 on day 150 these results confirmed that anaob on the anoxic biofilms achieved rapid and high enrichment in order to more accurately reflect the enrichment of anaob the growth kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the qpcr results with the microbial growth kinetics equation as depicted in fig s4 the specific growth rate of anaob in anoxic biofilms was 0 048d 1 and the corresponding doubling time was calculated to be 14 53d on the other hand the abundance of anaob in the floc sludge also increased from 0 001 to 0 04 detected by qpcr fig 4a but it was significantly lower than that in the anoxic biofilms p 0 001 during this experimental period the biomass of anoxic biofilms gradually increased from 8 0 mg carrier on day 60 to 18 6 mg carrier on day 150 mlss 200 mg l 464 mg l fig s5 while the biomass of floc sludge remained stable at around 3100 mg l from the perspective of whole bioreactor although the biomass of the flocs was 15 times higher than that of the anoxic biofilms even on day 150 table s7 the abundance of anaob in the anoxic biofilms was greater than that in the floc sludge after day 112 fig 4b which indicated that anaob were indeed grow on anoxic biofilms furthermore 16 s rrna gene sequencing suggested that the only detectable anammox genus candidatus brocadia were enriched in the anoxic biofilms with an abundance of 1 30 on day 150 which is consistent with the qpcr results phylogenetic analysis suggests that the most abundant anammox otu 96 51 otu1274 is phylogenetically related to ca brocadia sp 40 fig 4c multiple studies reported that ca brocadia sp 40 was the predominant species in anammox reactor especially for low strength wastewater due to its lower half saturation constant value for no2 and high specific growth rate zhang et al 2017 zhang and okabe 2020 overall rapid and high enrichment of anaob was achieved by adding moving virgin carriers to the anoxic zones of the a2 o bioreactor 3 3 metabolic discrepancy between biofilm and floc sludge reveled by batch tests considering the simultaneous decrease of nh4 n and no3 n in anoxic zone batch tests were conducted to further investigate the nitrogen metabolic pathway by denitrification substrates no3 and cod and pd a substrates no3 nh4 and cod processes due to the coexistence of floc sludge and anoxic biofilms in the reactor the two types of biomass anoxic biofilms floc sludge were tested separately to better understand their respective roles in nitrogen removal as presented in fig 5 in the denitrification test with anoxic biofilms the no3 n and cod gradually decreased while no2 n production began at 3 h since the added sodium acetate was almost completely consumed the remaining cod might be refractory organics such as soluble microbial products that were difficult to be utilized by the denitrification michael kordatou et al 2015 the final residue of no2 n and no3 n were 5 04 mg l and 3 64 mg l fig 5a respectively and the corresponding ntr was 32 54 for floc sludge no3 n and cod rapidly decreased from 18 21 mg l and 95 10 mg l to 8 19 mg l and 44 16 mg l respectively then cod did not change notably and no3 n completely reduced with a slower rate at 5 h while no no2 n production throughout the process fig 5c according to the change of no3 n reduction rate and cod it was speculated that the denitrifying electron donor was mainly external carbon source sodium acetate from 0 to 1 h while it might be endogenous or adsorbed carbon source within the following 4 h these results suggested that anoxic biofilms presented better no2 accumulation driven by pd than floc sludge in the pd a test with the anoxic biofilms a simultaneous decrease in nh4 n and no3 n was observed at rates of 1 63 mg n l h and 2 24 mg n l h respectively while no no2 n production throughout the process fig 5b the final concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were 4 50 mg l and 0 respectively fig 5b and anammox contributed to 86 93 of the total nitrogen loss for floc sludge the changes of no3 n and cod were almost the same as the denitrification test fig 5d however there was almost no notably change in nh4 n concentrations throughout the process these results suggested that compared with floc sludge the anoxic biofilms performed better coordination ability of denitrification and anammox moreover compared with the denitrification test the pd a test with anoxic biofilms did not show no2 n production and anammox contributed to 86 93 of the nitrogen loss fig 5b however the ntr of the denitrification test with anoxic biofilms was only 32 54 fig 5a indicating that more no3 n was only reduced to no2 n which was then utilized by anaob thus in the anoxic zone of the reactor the consumption of no2 n was mainly completed by the anaob on the anoxic biofilm and the denitrifiers in the floc sludge resulting no accumulation of no2 n in addition the consumption of cod was higher than the theoretical required value in the batch tests and the excess cod consumption needs to be further explored in the future under the same amount of carbon source the nitrogen removal amounts of pd a and denitrification batch tests were 34 25 mg l and 8 90 mg l respectively the no3 n reduction efficiency in the pd a test was 100 meaning that the no3 n produced by anammox was also reduced to no2 n or n2 therefore the pd a process could save a large amount of organic carbon source resulting a better nitrogen removal under a lower cod n 3 4 variation of key nitrogen removal functional genes the functional genes abundance in the anoxic biofilms and floc sludge including hzsb narg nirs and nirk were determined using qpcr using specific primers during the start up and stable period as presented in fig 6 the hzsb is a specific functional gene of anaob the abundance of hzsb in anoxic biofilms gradually increased from 1 85 109 copies g dry sludge on day 60 to 1 73 1010 copies g dry sludge on day 150 fig 6a which was consistent with the abundance variation of anaob these results further confirmed the steady growth of anaob on anoxic biofilms rather than on floc sludge the nirs and nirk are the functional gene of denitrifiers related to no2 reduction the abundance of nirs and nirk in anoxic biofilms also gradually increased with biofilm development while they did not change notably in floc sludge fig 6a additionally the ratio of nirs nirk hzsb could be used to characterize the no2 competition between denitrifiers and anaob it could observe that the ratio of nirs nirk hzsb in anoxic biofilms decreased from 19 89 on day 60 to 5 75 on day 150 fig 6a indicating that the no2 competition ability of anaob was continuously strengthened on the contrary the ratio of nirs nirk hzsb in the floc sludge was always much higher than 100 fig 6a which confirmed that denitrifiers in the floc sludge dominated the competition for no2 the narg is the functional gene of denitrifiers related to no3 reduction it could observe that the variation trend of narg between anoxic biofilms and floc sludge were opposite fig 6b indicating that there is a dynamic competition for no3 reduction between anoxic biofilms and floc sludge 3 5 microbial community succession the biodiversity and structure of the microbial community were analyzed by high throughput sequencing the evaluation of alpha diversity was conducted table s8 the species richness was determined by ace and chao values and the species diversity was characterized by shannon and simpson values results showed that the species diversity of anoxic biofilms were increasing after system start up while species richness decreased first then increased the venn diagram showed a total of 629 otus shared in the three anoxic biofilms samples fig 6c while there were 212 otus unique for day 60 79 for day 112 and 325 for day 150 these results indicated that although the nitrogen removal performance of the system remained stable after day 60 the microbial community structure of the anoxic biofilms was still changing and becoming more and more complex which meant that the anoxic biofilms gradually became mature similarly compared with that before adding carriers the floc sludge decreased 499 otus and increased 515 new outs on day 150 fig s6 which indicated that the formation of anoxic biofilms also influenced the microbial community of floc sludge the microbial community of anoxic biofilms displayed a remarkable variation at the phylum level as shown in fig 6d when the system was successfully started day 60 there were four main bacterial phylum in the anoxic biofilms firmicutes 38 0 actinobacteriota 20 1 chloroflexi 19 4 and proteobacteria 9 3 the planctomycetes which the anaob belong to reached 1 5 during the stable operation period day 60 150 proteobacteria and chloroflexi substantially increased to 29 7 and 25 7 respectively becoming the dominant phylum on anoxic biofilms meanwhile the planctomycetes increased to 3 1 and the bacteroidota acidobacteriota and patescibacteria also increased from 2 9 2 08 and 2 0 to 9 0 4 2 and 3 5 respectively on the contrary firmicutes and actinobacteriota decreased significantly to 4 4 and 5 3 which indicated that these microorganisms play an important role in the early stage of anoxic biofilms development these results suggested that during the development and maturation of anoxic biofilms functional microorganisms had obvious succession rules at genus level with the enrichment of anaob both pd functional and fermentation related genera were enriched in anoxic biofilms supporting the no2 supply for anaob on day 60 the abundance of denitrifiers such as olb14 denitratisoma and dechloromonas reached 2 53 during the stable operation period day 60 150 with the further maturation of biofilm denitrifyiers gradually grew into the dominant bacteria on anoxic biofilm and their relative abundance increased from 2 53 to 18 85 with the major genus of olb14 4 85 denitratisoma 2 98 and dechloromonas 2 34 fig 6e it has reported that olb14 denitratisoma and dechloromonas could potentially drive pd processes producing no2 during no3 reduction lawson et al 2017 shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in addition a large number of the fermentation related genera accounted for more than 62 4 on the anoxic biofilms which was significantly superior to others on day 60 fig 6e such as romboutsia 14 46 clostridium sensu stricto 1 12 83 norank f norank o microtrichales 4 38 4 33 and norank f norank o c10 sb1a 1 65 were involved in the hydrolysis and acidification process cao et al 2021 gao et al 2021b kessler et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 which might be responsible for the fermentation of lowly biodegradable organics from raw sewage and soluble microbial products smps to generate volatile fatty acids vfas for denitrifiers ji et al 2020 during the stable operation the relative abundance of these fermentation associated genera was decreased to 25 96 fig 6e which might because the denitrifiers gradually became dominant groups and competed for living space these fermentation associated genera enriched in anoxic biofilms also interpreted the reason that although the cod concentration in anoxic zone changed still little after adding carriers the reduction of no3 n was significantly enhanced 3 6 characteristic of pd a biofilm structure revealed by fish clsm typical composite pd a anoxic biofilms were sampled from the reactor and analyzed for the distribution of anaob and others fishclsm conducted on the cryosection of anoxic biofilms is shown in fig 7 results showed that the anaob were located on the whole carrier which further confirmed anammox enriched in the anoxic biofilms interestingly in the outside of the anoxic biofilms there were mainly other bacteria rather than anammox meanwhile morphology of the anoxic biofilms also showed red blotchy microorganisms mainly located in the inner layer of biofilms fig s7 previous studies also reported that anaob distributed inside of pn a biofilm and granule to prevent the influence of environmental factors and biomass loss wells et al 2017 in this study the spatial differentiation between anaob and other bacteria on the anoxic biofilms could avoid loss of anammox biomass due to hydraulic turbulence and mechanical friction ensuring the enrichment and retention of anaob 4 discussion the start up of the anammox process is the primary step for its practical application especially without adequate inoculum this study successfully in situ started a mainstream amammox process within 60 days under no specific inoculum table s9 summarized the current researches on the start up of anammox process in mainstream which either used synthetic wastewater or inoculated anammox sludge the start up time of this study was comparable to that of these direct inoculation studies which suggested that in situ start up using local activated sludge could also quickly realized although many studies related to the enrichment of anammox in the anoxic zone by adding biofilm carriers have been reported gao et al 2021a li et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 this technology is still in the preliminary exploration stage on the one hand related studies almost started by inoculating anammox biofilms from mainstream or sidestream directly into anoxic zones however large amounts of anammox seed biofilms are not available in most areas and it is also impractical for direct inoculation in large scale wwtps for the first time this study used ordinary activated sludge to form anammox biofilm in situ in a lab scale test which greatly promote the practical application of this technology especially for the areas lacking anammox seeds on the other hand related studies were more from the perspective of performance and feasibility rather than focusing on the start up the long time to form anoxic biofilms and enrich anaob could be the major limitation for the practical application fortunately this study confirmed that pd a could start up in 60 days even with the addition of virgin carriers which provide an important theoretical reference for the practical application of this technology to date most of the researches on the start up of anammox systems has focused on the pn a process in mainstream qiu et al 2020 but only few studies have realized using ordinary activated sludge to in situ start up anammox process for example the successful start up of pn a process through nitrifying sludge pn sludge and denitrifying phosphorus removal sludge separately was achieved in sbbr reactor based on aeration control zhang et al 2021a however the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance due to the unstable nob activity after pn a system start up have been frequently reported bunse et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in order to washout or suppress nob accompanied by a variety of complex operation controls the threshold of practical application of pn a technology is greatly raised and the technical level of front line operators is difficult to meet by contrast as an alternative avenue for no2 supply pd a exhibited more stable performance especially in mainstream conditions because it bypass the issue of nob chen et al 2021 most importantly the control methods for pd a was relatively easy and simple to conduct zhang et al 2019a in this study the operating conditions were the same as conventional a2 o process except adding carriers into anoxic zone and the performance remained very stable after start up anoxic biofilms created a favourable habitat for anaob is the key for start up and stable operation first anoxic biofilms exhibited no2 accumulation driven by pd fig 5 which laid the foundation for the enrichment of anaob the biodegradable organics in the anoxic zone was extremely insufficient and no3 in the anoxic zone was always surplus fig 3 which could promote the enrichment of pd functional bacteria and favoring they to convert no3 to no2 only zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b second a better coordination between denitrifiers and anaob in anoxic biofilms was displayed considering a lower growth rate and cell yield of anaob than other heterotrophic groups e g denitrifiers kumar and lin 2010 tang et al 2013 maintaining appropriate synergism are also important batch test showed that although the ability of anoxic biofilms to supply no2 was limited anammox became the dominant pathway for no2 reduction due to its stronger competitive ability than denitrifiers fig 5 6 meanwhile since autotrophic nitrogen removal saved carbon source which could in turn promote the no3 reduction compared with anaerobic zone the low level of organics in anoxic zone is critical to maintain the dominant role of anaob daigger 2014 ma et al 2020 third the enrichment of fermentation associated genera on anoxic biofilms might solve the problem of lack of carbon source after adding carriers the cod n of influent was low but denitrification activity in anoxic zone was greatly enhanced this was mainly attributed to the enrichment of fermentation associated genera on anoxic biofilms which could drive the hydrolytic and acidifying process facilitating the in situ utilization of slowly biodegradable organics for pd process ji et al 2020 liu et al 2021 however the specific metabolic process and metabolite of fermentation in the present study need to further investigate in the future fourth anoxic biofilms provided a steady and appropriate macroconditions on the one hand the srt of anoxic biofilms is independent so the microorganisms on anoxic biofilms would not lose with the sludge discharge gao et al 2022 meanwhile anaob grew inside the biofilm and the outermost layer of the biofilm was surrounded by other bacteria fig 7 which could avoid loss of anammox biomass due to hydraulic disturbances and friction lu et al 2022 on the other hand anoxic zone had the best macro environment for proliferation of anaob low do low organic matter concentration and optimal ph unlike floc sludge which was cycled under anaerobic anoxic and oxic zone anoxic biofilms always in anoxic unit could enrich specific microorganisms although more and more researches have shown the feasibility of mainstream anammox practical application is still in the earlier developmental phase this work confirmed that the fast installation of pd a could realize through adding carrier forming biofilm in the anoxic zone which provides great confidence for the practical application however there are still some key aspects need to investigate in the future research although anaob were further enriched during stable operation but the nitrogen removal efficiency did not increase accordingly because the anoxic zone is a mixed system of floc sludge and biofilms and nitrogen removal is conducted by coupling autotrophic and heterotrophic the relationship between the abundance of anaob and nre needs to be further clarified moreover the sludge concentration of anoxic biofilms was significantly lower than floc sludge adjusting the ratio of biofilm to floc sludge might enhance anammox contribution to achieve advanced nitrogen removal in addition obvious microbial succession was observed in the formation of anoxic biofilms which requires further study especially in the initial colonization phase last but not the least this study was carried out in the lab scale conditions such as influent fluctuations and temperature changes in the pilot and full scale might have a greater impact on the start up 5 conclusion this study investigated the in situ start up process of pd a system in mainstream by adding virgin carriers into the anoxic zone of a traditional a2 o process the main conclusion are as follows the pd a process was successfully started up within 60 days the nre increased by 16 9 under low cod n 3 2 0 4 with a stable effluent tin 11 6 1 6 mg l and anammox contributed 37 9 6 2 of total nitrogen removal the anaob on the anoxic biofilms were rapidly enriched with a doubling time of 14 53d and the relative abundance was 2 49 on day 150 phylogenetic analysis showed the dominant species was related to ca brocadia sp 40 anoxic biofilms presented better no2 accumulation driven by pd than floc sludge and performed better coordination ability of partial denitrification and anammox declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15094,it is of great significance to start up the anammox process in the most commonly used anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process in treating mainstream municipal wastewater recently partial denitrification anammox pd a has attracted increasing interest as a new avenue in mainstream this study investigated the in situ start up of pd a process in a traditional a2 o process the pd a system was rapidly started up within 60 days by adding virgin carriers into the anoxic zone and then run stably for the next 90 days the in situ anammox activity reached 1 0 0 1 mg nh4 n l h contributing 37 9 6 2 of total nitrogen removal as a result the nitrogen removal efficiency of the system increased by 16 9 the anammox bacteria anaob on the anoxic biofilms were enriched with a doubling time of 14 53d and the relative abundance reached 2 49 on day 150 phylogenetic analysis showed the dominant anaob was related to ca brocadia sp 40 which was the only detected anammox genus in the anoxic biofilm from start up to stable operation batch tests and qpcr results revealed that compared with the floc sludge the anoxic biofilms exhibited no2 accumulation driven by pd and performed a better coordination between denitrifiers and anaob overall this study provides great confidence for the in situ fast start up of mainstream anammox using conventional activated sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox anoxic biofilms partial denitrification start up biological nitrogen removal municipal wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the finding of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox overthrew the cognition of biological nitrogen removal thereby affecting the research in this field over the following decades strous et al 1997 anammox bacteria anaob directly oxidize ammonium nh4 to dinitrogen gas n2 with nitrite no2 as electron acceptor and no need for oxygen or organic carbon thus it is a high efficiency and energy saving technology compared with the conventional technology strous et al 1998 at present anammox technologies have been widely implemented in treating ammonia rich wastewater such as digestion liquid and landfill leachate lackner et al 2014 current interest has focused on the mainstream municipal wastewater with low ammonia the shift from sidestream to mainstream application has become the trend of global anammox related technology development the start up of anammox installations is quite time consuming cao et al 2017 for example it took more than 3 years to start the world s first full scale anammox reactor which initially used ordinary sludge from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp as the seed sludge van der star et al 2007 in response to this problem most of the established anammox systems usually inoculated with mature anammox sludge especially for low strength mainstream sewage laureni et al 2016 miao et al 2020 peng et al 2019 nevertheless sufficient anammox biomass is not always available and some researches showed that the inadaptability of inoculated biomass to the new conditions led to performance instability cho et al 2011 yang et al 2017 attempting to in situ quickly start up through local activated sludge in wwtps could solve this issue which would greatly promote the practical application of anammox in mainstream to date the study on the start up of mainstream anammox was mainly carried out based on partial nitrification nh4 no2 coupled with anammox pn a process cao et al 2017 for example a recent study reported that a mainstream pn a system was started up in about 250 days using ordinary activated sludge and anammox granules where nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob suppression was the primary step wu et al 2021 however several studies have concluded that inhibiting nob growth is a real bottleneck in mainstream pn a cao et al 2017 qiu et al 2020 the unstable nob activity would not only lead to the extension of the start up time but also might result the deterioration of performance after start up recently as an alternative avenue partial denitrification no3 no2 coupled with anammox pd a process has received increasing attention for its stable and efficient performance chen et al 2021 a high nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 93 6 and over 95 nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio ntr was obtained in a two stage pd a system simultaneously treating domestic and nitrate wastewater du et al 2017 another study reported that over 90 nre was maintained in a single stage pd a reactor when the temperature decreased from 27 1 to 17 5 c du et al 2019 therefore the start up of mainstream anammox based on pd a process might be more advantageous anoxic biofilms are crucial for pd a process especially for plug flow continuous system currently the research on the start up of anammox was mainly concentrated in the reactors with high biomass retention such as sequencing batch reactor and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket choi et al 2020 deore et al 2022 however for large wwtps a2 o and its modified process are the most widely used zhang et al 2021b so it deserves special attention several studies have confirmed that the traditional a2 o process is difficult to provide a good habitat for anammox such as adequate substrate long sludge retention time srt li et al 2019 wang et al 2015 recently experimental evidences showed that the pd a system could be constructed by introducing anoxic biofilms in the anoxic unit and the nre could be significantly improved gao et al 2021a li et al 2020 however these previous studies all started by inoculating anammox biofilms directly into anoxic zones moreover they were more from the perspective of performance and feasibility rather than focusing on the start up considering that the formation of anoxic biofilms and the enrichment of anaob might be slow and hard the start up of pd a process might become a major limitation for the practical application in plug flow continuous system therefore some key information such as start up time and microbial community would be critical to the practical application to our best knowledge there has never been any reports about the in situ start up of this process and insight into its mechanism is vital for practical application based on the above this study constructed an a2 o reactor with virgin carriers added to the anoxic zone to explore the start up of pd a process thus the long term performance in situ growth kinetics and activity of anaob nitrogen removal pathway microbial community succession and spatial distribution were investigated meanwhile the mechanism of in situ enrichment of anaob by anoxic biofilms and potential application were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation a continuous plug flow reactor 1 16 m 0 15 m 0 5 m effective volume 54 l fig 1 was implemented with a2 o process for 210 days using removable baffles the rectangular reactor was divided into seven units specifically one anaerobic unit two anoxic units and four aerobic units with a volume ratio of 1 4 4 the hydraulic retention time hrt was 13 hour the nitrifying liquid reflux and recycled activated sludge were adopted at 200 and 100 of the influent flow respectively the reactor was pumped with actual domestic wastewater nh4 n 59 50 79 49 mg l cod 152 4 280 5 mg l collected

consisted two phases in phase i the reactor run for 60 days to facilitate adaptation to the current operating conditions in phase ii moving virgin carriers k3 type table s2 were added into the anoxic zone at a packing ratio of 25 and other operation condition was the same as phase i different from most previous studies using fixed bed biofilm reactor gao et al 2021a li et al 2020 this study used moving bed biofilm reactor to better fit the actual wwtp submersible mixer was set up in the anoxic zone to fluidize the carriers table s3 2 2 activity tests nitrogen conversion was monitored by measuring the microbial activity specifically denitrification and pd a by batch tests biofilms and floc sludge samples were taken from the reactor and carefully rinsed with milli q water for three times then trace elements and mineral elements table s4 were added and quantified to 0 5 l with milli q water the substrates used for denitrification were no3 and acetate while those for pd a were nh4

embedded in an o c t compound sakura torrance ca usa and cut into 25 μm thick slices at 20 c with a freezing microtome leica cm1950 leica wetzlar germany subsequently the slices were hybridized with the specific oligonucleotide probe the details of the probes are provided in table s6 amx368 probes labelled with cy5 dye was used to detect anammox bacteria and eub338 i ii iii mix labelled with cy3 dye for detecting general bacteria which were displayed in red and blue respectively daims et al 1999 schmid et al 2003 finally the slices were visualized in detail by a clsm olympus fluoviewfv3000 tokyo japan 3 results 3 1 start up and stable operation of partial denitrification anammox systems 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance throughout the whole stage the a2 o reactor was fed with real domestic sewage fig 2 in phase ⅰ the bioreactor was inoculated with floc sludge and then operated for 60 days to make it stably adapt to the current operating conditions similar to most a2 o processes the reactor showed excellent nitrification performance and organics removal with removal efficiencies of nh4 n and cod achieving 97 8 5 5 and 81 7 6 2 respectively fig 2 however due to the organic matter in wastewater was not enough for heterotrophic denitrification cod tin 3 8 0 6 the nitrogen removal efficiency nre was only 58 1 7 3 and the corresponding effluent tin was 16 4 2 9 mg l which exceeded the stringent class a discharge standards in china faced with this situation external carbon source e g sodium acetate methanol was usually dosed in wwtps to achieve discharge standards nevertheless it increased the operation cost in the present study adding moving virgin carriers k3 to the anoxic zones of the a2 o bioreactor was adopted at a 25 filling ratio to in situ start up pd a process for a better nitrogen removal in the early stage phase ii 1 days 1 30 the nre did not notably change the average effluent tin was 18 0 2 7 mg l with a removal efficiency of 54 0 6 9 fig 2b c however from days 30 to 60 the effluent tin decreased from 18 4 mg l to 11 7 mg l and the corresponding removal efficiency increased to 73 1 furthermore the in situ anammox activity was evaluated by nh4 n loss in anoxic zone fig 2e which showed that the obvious anammox activity was detected after 30 days the anammox activity increased rapidly from day 30 to day 60 and reached 1 0 mg nh4 n l h on day 60 which was significantly correlated with the increase of nre r2 0 92 p 0 001 fig s2 the required start up time was acquired by fitting the time course of in situ anammox activity with boltzmann function as displayed in fig 2e which showed that the start up time was less than 60 days in the stable operation stage phase ii 3 days 60 150 although the influent cod tin ratio decreased to 3 1 0 4 the average nre remained a stable value of 70 9 4 1 and the corresponding effluent tin was 11 6 1 6 mg l fig 2b c values which met the discharge standards in china moreover the in situ anammox activity also stabilized at 1 0 0 1 mg nh4 n l h and anammox contributed 37 9 6 2 to total nitrogen removal 3 1 2 details of nutrients distribution typical variations of nitrogen phosphorus and cod on phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ 3 were detected along the reactor fig 3 a b which were used to further reveal the detail of nitrogen and organic matter removal in phase ⅰ nitrogen removal was mainly carried out in the anaerobic zone accounting for 72 16 although the hrt in the anoxic zone was as long as 6 h the denitrification in the anoxic zone was very weak due to the lack of carbon source resulting in the nitrogen loss in anoxic zone only accounted for 13 51 fig 3a meanwhile numerous no3 n was returned to the anaerobic zone through sludge recycle which seriously affected the phosphorus release fig 3a resulting in almost no phosphorus removal performance fig s3 in phase ⅱ 3 the core nitrogen removal function zone was transferred from the anaerobic zone to the anoxic zone and the nitrogen loss in anoxic zone increased to 55 81 fig 3b moreover although no no2 n accumulation was detected in the anoxic zone simultaneous decrease in no3 n and nh4 n were observed like one stage pn a this phenomenon could be considered as one stage pd a process which refers to the simultaneous partial denitrification and anammox without nitrite accumulation the specific nitrogen conversion mechanism would be elaborated in section 3 3 in addition more phosphorus released in anaerobic zone phase ⅰ 2 34 mg p l phase ii 10 57 mg p l resulting a better phosphorus removal performance the phosphorus removal efficiency increased from 11 7 38 1 in phase ⅰ to 45 5 34 in phase ii and the corresponding effluent po4 3 p decreased from 4 3 1 6 mg l to 2 0 1 3 mg l fig s3 surprisingly although the variation of cod in anoxic zone was still very small it undertaken so many nitrogen removal tasks the specific reason would be analyzed in the following sections 3 2 rapid and high enrichment of anaob on anoxic biofilms the abundance and community structure of anaob were evaluated using qpcr and high throughput sequencing since the anoxic biofilms were too thin around day 30 to sample the 16 s rrna genes copy numbers of anaob on the anoxic biofilms was detected from day 60 as shown in fig 4 a the abundance of anaob on anoxic biofilms reached 2 33 108 copies g dry sludge 0 07 on day 60 and then gradually increased to 5 06 109 copies g dry sludge 2 49 on day 150 these results confirmed that anaob on the anoxic biofilms achieved rapid and high enrichment in order to more accurately reflect the enrichment of anaob the growth kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the qpcr results with the microbial growth kinetics equation as depicted in fig s4 the specific growth rate of anaob in anoxic biofilms was 0 048d 1 and the corresponding doubling time was calculated to be 14 53d on the other hand the abundance of anaob in the floc sludge also increased from 0 001 to 0 04 detected by qpcr fig 4a but it was significantly lower than that in the anoxic biofilms p 0 001 during this experimental period the biomass of anoxic biofilms gradually increased from 8 0 mg carrier on day 60 to 18 6 mg carrier on day 150 mlss 200 mg l 464 mg l fig s5 while the biomass of floc sludge remained stable at around 3100 mg l from the perspective of whole bioreactor although the biomass of the flocs was 15 times higher than that of the anoxic biofilms even on day 150 table s7 the abundance of anaob in the anoxic biofilms was greater than that in the floc sludge after day 112 fig 4b which indicated that anaob were indeed grow on anoxic biofilms furthermore 16 s rrna gene sequencing suggested that the only detectable anammox genus candidatus brocadia were enriched in the anoxic biofilms with an abundance of 1 30 on day 150 which is consistent with the qpcr results phylogenetic analysis suggests that the most abundant anammox otu 96 51 otu1274 is phylogenetically related to ca brocadia sp 40 fig 4c multiple studies reported that ca brocadia sp 40 was the predominant species in anammox reactor especially for low strength wastewater due to its lower half saturation constant value for no2 and high specific growth rate zhang et al 2017 zhang and okabe 2020 overall rapid and high enrichment of anaob was achieved by adding moving virgin carriers to the anoxic zones of the a2 o bioreactor 3 3 metabolic discrepancy between biofilm and floc sludge reveled by batch tests considering the simultaneous decrease of nh4 n and no3 n in anoxic zone batch tests were conducted to further investigate the nitrogen metabolic pathway by denitrification substrates no3 and cod and pd a substrates no3 nh4 and cod processes due to the coexistence of floc sludge and anoxic biofilms in the reactor the two types of biomass anoxic biofilms floc sludge were tested separately to better understand their respective roles in nitrogen removal as presented in fig 5 in the denitrification test with anoxic biofilms the no3 n and cod gradually decreased while no2 n production began at 3 h since the added sodium acetate was almost completely consumed the remaining cod might be refractory organics such as soluble microbial products that were difficult to be utilized by the denitrification michael kordatou et al 2015 the final residue of no2 n and no3 n were 5 04 mg l and 3 64 mg l fig 5a respectively and the corresponding ntr was 32 54 for floc sludge no3 n and cod rapidly decreased from 18 21 mg l and 95 10 mg l to 8 19 mg l and 44 16 mg l respectively then cod did not change notably and no3 n completely reduced with a slower rate at 5 h while no no2 n production throughout the process fig 5c according to the change of no3 n reduction rate and cod it was speculated that the denitrifying electron donor was mainly external carbon source sodium acetate from 0 to 1 h while it might be endogenous or adsorbed carbon source within the following 4 h these results suggested that anoxic biofilms presented better no2 accumulation driven by pd than floc sludge in the pd a test with the anoxic biofilms a simultaneous decrease in nh4 n and no3 n was observed at rates of 1 63 mg n l h and 2 24 mg n l h respectively while no no2 n production throughout the process fig 5b the final concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were 4 50 mg l and 0 respectively fig 5b and anammox contributed to 86 93 of the total nitrogen loss for floc sludge the changes of no3 n and cod were almost the same as the denitrification test fig 5d however there was almost no notably change in nh4 n concentrations throughout the process these results suggested that compared with floc sludge the anoxic biofilms performed better coordination ability of denitrification and anammox moreover compared with the denitrification test the pd a test with anoxic biofilms did not show no2 n production and anammox contributed to 86 93 of the nitrogen loss fig 5b however the ntr of the denitrification test with anoxic biofilms was only 32 54 fig 5a indicating that more no3 n was only reduced to no2 n which was then utilized by anaob thus in the anoxic zone of the reactor the consumption of no2 n was mainly completed by the anaob on the anoxic biofilm and the denitrifiers in the floc sludge resulting no accumulation of no2 n in addition the consumption of cod was higher than the theoretical required value in the batch tests and the excess cod consumption needs to be further explored in the future under the same amount of carbon source the nitrogen removal amounts of pd a and denitrification batch tests were 34 25 mg l and 8 90 mg l respectively the no3 n reduction efficiency in the pd a test was 100 meaning that the no3 n produced by anammox was also reduced to no2 n or n2 therefore the pd a process could save a large amount of organic carbon source resulting a better nitrogen removal under a lower cod n 3 4 variation of key nitrogen removal functional genes the functional genes abundance in the anoxic biofilms and floc sludge including hzsb narg nirs and nirk were determined using qpcr using specific primers during the start up and stable period as presented in fig 6 the hzsb is a specific functional gene of anaob the abundance of hzsb in anoxic biofilms gradually increased from 1 85 109 copies g dry sludge on day 60 to 1 73 1010 copies g dry sludge on day 150 fig 6a which was consistent with the abundance variation of anaob these results further confirmed the steady growth of anaob on anoxic biofilms rather than on floc sludge the nirs and nirk are the functional gene of denitrifiers related to no2 reduction the abundance of nirs and nirk in anoxic biofilms also gradually increased with biofilm development while they did not change notably in floc sludge fig 6a additionally the ratio of nirs nirk hzsb could be used to characterize the no2 competition between denitrifiers and anaob it could observe that the ratio of nirs nirk hzsb in anoxic biofilms decreased from 19 89 on day 60 to 5 75 on day 150 fig 6a indicating that the no2 competition ability of anaob was continuously strengthened on the contrary the ratio of nirs nirk hzsb in the floc sludge was always much higher than 100 fig 6a which confirmed that denitrifiers in the floc sludge dominated the competition for no2 the narg is the functional gene of denitrifiers related to no3 reduction it could observe that the variation trend of narg between anoxic biofilms and floc sludge were opposite fig 6b indicating that there is a dynamic competition for no3 reduction between anoxic biofilms and floc sludge 3 5 microbial community succession the biodiversity and structure of the microbial community were analyzed by high throughput sequencing the evaluation of alpha diversity was conducted table s8 the species richness was determined by ace and chao values and the species diversity was characterized by shannon and simpson values results showed that the species diversity of anoxic biofilms were increasing after system start up while species richness decreased first then increased the venn diagram showed a total of 629 otus shared in the three anoxic biofilms samples fig 6c while there were 212 otus unique for day 60 79 for day 112 and 325 for day 150 these results indicated that although the nitrogen removal performance of the system remained stable after day 60 the microbial community structure of the anoxic biofilms was still changing and becoming more and more complex which meant that the anoxic biofilms gradually became mature similarly compared with that before adding carriers the floc sludge decreased 499 otus and increased 515 new outs on day 150 fig s6 which indicated that the formation of anoxic biofilms also influenced the microbial community of floc sludge the microbial community of anoxic biofilms displayed a remarkable variation at the phylum level as shown in fig 6d when the system was successfully started day 60 there were four main bacterial phylum in the anoxic biofilms firmicutes 38 0 actinobacteriota 20 1 chloroflexi 19 4 and proteobacteria 9 3 the planctomycetes which the anaob belong to reached 1 5 during the stable operation period day 60 150 proteobacteria and chloroflexi substantially increased to 29 7 and 25 7 respectively becoming the dominant phylum on anoxic biofilms meanwhile the planctomycetes increased to 3 1 and the bacteroidota acidobacteriota and patescibacteria also increased from 2 9 2 08 and 2 0 to 9 0 4 2 and 3 5 respectively on the contrary firmicutes and actinobacteriota decreased significantly to 4 4 and 5 3 which indicated that these microorganisms play an important role in the early stage of anoxic biofilms development these results suggested that during the development and maturation of anoxic biofilms functional microorganisms had obvious succession rules at genus level with the enrichment of anaob both pd functional and fermentation related genera were enriched in anoxic biofilms supporting the no2 supply for anaob on day 60 the abundance of denitrifiers such as olb14 denitratisoma and dechloromonas reached 2 53 during the stable operation period day 60 150 with the further maturation of biofilm denitrifyiers gradually grew into the dominant bacteria on anoxic biofilm and their relative abundance increased from 2 53 to 18 85 with the major genus of olb14 4 85 denitratisoma 2 98 and dechloromonas 2 34 fig 6e it has reported that olb14 denitratisoma and dechloromonas could potentially drive pd processes producing no2 during no3 reduction lawson et al 2017 shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in addition a large number of the fermentation related genera accounted for more than 62 4 on the anoxic biofilms which was significantly superior to others on day 60 fig 6e such as romboutsia 14 46 clostridium sensu stricto 1 12 83 norank f norank o microtrichales 4 38 4 33 and norank f norank o c10 sb1a 1 65 were involved in the hydrolysis and acidification process cao et al 2021 gao et al 2021b kessler et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 which might be responsible for the fermentation of lowly biodegradable organics from raw sewage and soluble microbial products smps to generate volatile fatty acids vfas for denitrifiers ji et al 2020 during the stable operation the relative abundance of these fermentation associated genera was decreased to 25 96 fig 6e which might because the denitrifiers gradually became dominant groups and competed for living space these fermentation associated genera enriched in anoxic biofilms also interpreted the reason that although the cod concentration in anoxic zone changed still little after adding carriers the reduction of no3 n was significantly enhanced 3 6 characteristic of pd a biofilm structure revealed by fish clsm typical composite pd a anoxic biofilms were sampled from the reactor and analyzed for the distribution of anaob and others fishclsm conducted on the cryosection of anoxic biofilms is shown in fig 7 results showed that the anaob were located on the whole carrier which further confirmed anammox enriched in the anoxic biofilms interestingly in the outside of the anoxic biofilms there were mainly other bacteria rather than anammox meanwhile morphology of the anoxic biofilms also showed red blotchy microorganisms mainly located in the inner layer of biofilms fig s7 previous studies also reported that anaob distributed inside of pn a biofilm and granule to prevent the influence of environmental factors and biomass loss wells et al 2017 in this study the spatial differentiation between anaob and other bacteria on the anoxic biofilms could avoid loss of anammox biomass due to hydraulic turbulence and mechanical friction ensuring the enrichment and retention of anaob 4 discussion the start up of the anammox process is the primary step for its practical application especially without adequate inoculum this study successfully in situ started a mainstream amammox process within 60 days under no specific inoculum table s9 summarized the current researches on the start up of anammox process in mainstream which either used synthetic wastewater or inoculated anammox sludge the start up time of this study was comparable to that of these direct inoculation studies which suggested that in situ start up using local activated sludge could also quickly realized although many studies related to the enrichment of anammox in the anoxic zone by adding biofilm carriers have been reported gao et al 2021a li et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 this technology is still in the preliminary exploration stage on the one hand related studies almost started by inoculating anammox biofilms from mainstream or sidestream directly into anoxic zones however large amounts of anammox seed biofilms are not available in most areas and it is also impractical for direct inoculation in large scale wwtps for the first time this study used ordinary activated sludge to form anammox biofilm in situ in a lab scale test which greatly promote the practical application of this technology especially for the areas lacking anammox seeds on the other hand related studies were more from the perspective of performance and feasibility rather than focusing on the start up the long time to form anoxic biofilms and enrich anaob could be the major limitation for the practical application fortunately this study confirmed that pd a could start up in 60 days even with the addition of virgin carriers which provide an important theoretical reference for the practical application of this technology to date most of the researches on the start up of anammox systems has focused on the pn a process in mainstream qiu et al 2020 but only few studies have realized using ordinary activated sludge to in situ start up anammox process for example the successful start up of pn a process through nitrifying sludge pn sludge and denitrifying phosphorus removal sludge separately was achieved in sbbr reactor based on aeration control zhang et al 2021a however the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance due to the unstable nob activity after pn a system start up have been frequently reported bunse et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in order to washout or suppress nob accompanied by a variety of complex operation controls the threshold of practical application of pn a technology is greatly raised and the technical level of front line operators is difficult to meet by contrast as an alternative avenue for no2 supply pd a exhibited more stable performance especially in mainstream conditions because it bypass the issue of nob chen et al 2021 most importantly the control methods for pd a was relatively easy and simple to conduct zhang et al 2019a in this study the operating conditions were the same as conventional a2 o process except adding carriers into anoxic zone and the performance remained very stable after start up anoxic biofilms created a favourable habitat for anaob is the key for start up and stable operation first anoxic biofilms exhibited no2 accumulation driven by pd fig 5 which laid the foundation for the enrichment of anaob the biodegradable organics in the anoxic zone was extremely insufficient and no3 in the anoxic zone was always surplus fig 3 which could promote the enrichment of pd functional bacteria and favoring they to convert no3 to no2 only zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b second a better coordination between denitrifiers and anaob in anoxic biofilms was displayed considering a lower growth rate and cell yield of anaob than other heterotrophic groups e g denitrifiers kumar and lin 2010 tang et al 2013 maintaining appropriate synergism are also important batch test showed that although the ability of anoxic biofilms to supply no2 was limited anammox became the dominant pathway for no2 reduction due to its stronger competitive ability than denitrifiers fig 5 6 meanwhile since autotrophic nitrogen removal saved carbon source which could in turn promote the no3 reduction compared with anaerobic zone the low level of organics in anoxic zone is critical to maintain the dominant role of anaob daigger 2014 ma et al 2020 third the enrichment of fermentation associated genera on anoxic biofilms might solve the problem of lack of carbon source after adding carriers the cod n of influent was low but denitrification activity in anoxic zone was greatly enhanced this was mainly attributed to the enrichment of fermentation associated genera on anoxic biofilms which could drive the hydrolytic and acidifying process facilitating the in situ utilization of slowly biodegradable organics for pd process ji et al 2020 liu et al 2021 however the specific metabolic process and metabolite of fermentation in the present study need to further investigate in the future fourth anoxic biofilms provided a steady and appropriate macroconditions on the one hand the srt of anoxic biofilms is independent so the microorganisms on anoxic biofilms would not lose with the sludge discharge gao et al 2022 meanwhile anaob grew inside the biofilm and the outermost layer of the biofilm was surrounded by other bacteria fig 7 which could avoid loss of anammox biomass due to hydraulic disturbances and friction lu et al 2022 on the other hand anoxic zone had the best macro environment for proliferation of anaob low do low organic matter concentration and optimal ph unlike floc sludge which was cycled under anaerobic anoxic and oxic zone anoxic biofilms always in anoxic unit could enrich specific microorganisms although more and more researches have shown the feasibility of mainstream anammox practical application is still in the earlier developmental phase this work confirmed that the fast installation of pd a could realize through adding carrier forming biofilm in the anoxic zone which provides great confidence for the practical application however there are still some key aspects need to investigate in the future research although anaob were further enriched during stable operation but the nitrogen removal efficiency did not increase accordingly because the anoxic zone is a mixed system of floc sludge and biofilms and nitrogen removal is conducted by coupling autotrophic and heterotrophic the relationship between the abundance of anaob and nre needs to be further clarified moreover the sludge concentration of anoxic biofilms was significantly lower than floc sludge adjusting the ratio of biofilm to floc sludge might enhance anammox contribution to achieve advanced nitrogen removal in addition obvious microbial succession was observed in the formation of anoxic biofilms which requires further study especially in the initial colonization phase last but not the least this study was carried out in the lab scale conditions such as influent fluctuations and temperature changes in the pilot and full scale might have a greater impact on the start up 5 conclusion this study investigated the in situ start up process of pd a system in mainstream by adding virgin carriers into the anoxic zone of a traditional a2 o process the main conclusion are as follows the pd a process was successfully started up within 60 days the nre increased by 16 9 under low cod n 3 2 0 4 with a stable effluent tin 11 6 1 6 mg l and anammox contributed 37 9 6 2 of total nitrogen removal the anaob on the anoxic biofilms were rapidly enriched with a doubling time of 14 53d and the relative abundance was 2 49 on day 150 phylogenetic analysis showed the dominant species was related to ca brocadia sp 40 anoxic biofilms presented better no2 accumulation driven by pd than floc sludge and performed better coordination ability of partial denitrification and anammox declaration of competing interest the authors declare
