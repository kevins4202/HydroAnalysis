20925,liquified natural gas lng is increasingly used as fuel in marine industry for transportation and storage purposes it is kept at 163 c under atmospheric pressure when lng gets in contact with a plate pipe or a tank it causes very significant thermal load on the structure which has until that point been kept at environmental temperature the current study presents the nonlinear transient thermoelastic response of circular annular plates which experience sudden cryogenic thermal load this is the first time that thermoelastic analysis has been presented for any structure under such condition the material is composed of stainless steel s u s 304 and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 and is functionally graded through the thickness the novel material configuration proposed in this study has been used for the first time in cryogenic and low temperature applications material properties are evaluated based on available experimental data and assumed to be temperature dependent the nonlinear governing equations and boundary conditions are obtained with the von kármán assumption and the first order shear deformation theory the governing equations are discretized and solved with the generalized differential quadrature method gdqm and newton raphson iterative method the temporal evolution of the temperature field is obtained by solving fourier type heat conduction equation using gdqm and crank nicolson scheme the results have been validated with axisymmetric fem models using solid elements a detailed parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effect of temperature dependency material distribution thermal mechanical boundary conditions geometrical nonlinearity and plate size on the thermoelastic response the results show that transient thermoelastic response of plates under sudden cryogenic cooling can be very different than steady state response significant deflections occur in a fraction of a second because of the sudden thermal load and decrease over time the highest stresses appear predominantly in the initial phase but can also appear later depending on the plate geometry and boundary conditions for certain thermal boundary condition the response of a plate under low temperature thermal load can qualitatively differ from high temperature thermal load graphical abstract image 1 keywords transient thermoelastic analysis

gas lng as fuel in ships kumar et al 2011 lng is stored and transported at 163 c under atmospheric pressure when lng gets in contact with any plate pipe or a tank it causes very significant thermal load on the structure which has until that point been kept at environmental temperature international maritime organization imo has issued international code of safety for ships using gases or other low flashpoint fuels igf code that specifies handling of lng code 2014 however like any other fluid accidental lng spill can still happen during the transfer from storage tanker to fuel tanks and this would expose surrounding structures to cryogenic thermal load edeskuty and stewart 1996 spills can have consequences on structural safety thus impacting the safety of passengers and crew which makes it worthwhile to carefully study their effects in addition other cryogenic liquids e g liquid nitrogen known as ln2 are being used in other fields for example medicine where medical instruments have to endure sudden thermal cooling timmerhaus and flynn 2013 materials exposed to cryogenic liquids experience a sudden temperature drop and develop potentially high thermal stresses these stresses are developed in elastic continuum due to a nonuniform temperature field throughout the body which needs to be properly accounted to ensure safe operation of devices and structures 1 2 thermoelasticity at high temperatures thermoelasticity is a field abundant with research works that assess thermal effects in structures however the attention is almost exclusively directed to analysis of high temperature effects due to its vast applications enormous amount of scientific studies has been published on the topic and it is impossible to present thorough literature review here instead we present selected prominent works heating a constrained member causes it to buckle vibrate and generally change stress state either in linear or nonlinear regime hetnarski et al 2009 boley and weiner published an informative textbook in 1960 about the theory of thermoelectricity in various structural members with consideration of geometrical nonlinearities boley and weiner 1960 mian and spencer proposed a 3d elasticity analytical solution of an inhomogeneous plate under thermal and mechanical loadings mian and spencer 1998 reddy and cheng presented the thermoelastic results for a functionally graded material fgm rectangular plate using asymptotic solution reddy and cheng 2001 their results are useful resource for validation of the plate theories it was found that when the plate is subjected to high temperature thermal load the maximum compressive longitudinal stress would occur on the plate top surface in 1956 for the first time boley observed that the response of slender beams under very rapid heating would be in the form of thermally induced vibration boley 1956 since then the thermally induced vibration has received considerable attention for high temperature load praveen and reddy conducted a research study on the dynamic transient thermoelastic response of fgm plate under suddenly applied thermal and mechanical loads praveen and reddy 1998 they assessed the effect of temperature field boundary condition plate thickness geometrical nonlinearities and material distribution index and observed that fgm material distribution plays an important role in their results vel and batra obtained an exact 3d static solution for a fgm rectangular plate subjected to the sinusoidal thermo mechanical load vel and batra 2002 they performed a comparative study on analytical 3d solution and 2d solutions with different plate theories including classical plate theory cpt first order shear deformation theory fsdt and third order shear deformation theory tsdt they observed that for very thick plates length to thickness equals 5 under thermal load there is a 26 difference between transverse displacement from exact solution and cpt and fsdt they reported that this error in thick plates could be due to the neglect of transverse normal stress and strain later in another study they studied the transient 3d thermal stress analysis of fgm plate subjected to the uniform heat supply vel and batra 2003 they showed that the transient longitudinal stress induced by the rapid prescribed temperature load is 8 times larger than its steady state solution cho and oden studied the transient thermal stress characteristics of fgm plate using finite element method fem and crank nicolson scheme cho and oden 2000 they observed that there is a considerable difference between thermal stress distribution from steady state and transient solutions and this is more profound near the bottom surface of fgm yang and huang obtained the semi analytical nonlinear transient solution of fgm plate with geometrical imperfection yang and huang 2007 they found that the transient response is strongly influenced by temperature field and material distribution index liang et al studied the semi analytical natural frequency and transient solution of fgm cylindrical shell under thermal environment liang et al 2019a they employed differential quadrature method for space discretization and laplace transform for time domain their results reveal that increasing thickness radius ratio would decrease the shell peak displacement but increasing length radius ratio would increase the peak displacement kiani and eslami numerically studied the dynamic thermoelastic behavior of fgm circular plate considering material and geometrical nonlinearities kiani and eslami 2014 the plate experiences a sudden uniform thermal load which might induce vibrations depending on the boundary condition type material and geometrical parameters their results show that neglecting the geometrical nonlinearity would underestimate the induced deflections and stress values javani et al 2019 extended the work by kiani and eslami and presented the dynamic thermoelastic response of fgm annular plate under heat shock they performed a parametric study and showed that all the mentioned parameters including temperature dependency boundary condition plate size and material properties have significant effect on the plate response 1 3 thermoelasticity and fracture at cryogenic temperatures structural response in cryogenic temperatures has received drastically lower attention compared with elevated temperatures very few of those studies focus on thermoelastic response cryogenic and low temperature environment can induce large amount of thermal stress and cause severe damage and fracture in structures a research group in sandia national laboratory utilized the high performance computational models to explore the risk of cryogenic and fire thermal damage in lng cargo ships when a large lng tank breach happens pettiet al 2013 they performed computational fluid dynamic cfd analysis during a breach event in order to estimate the lng pool size and amount of vaporization to this end they used the fem model to obtain the crack pattern and fracture analysis they developed series of experimental tests to evaluate material properties in temperature range from 161 c up to 1000 c and used them to update their numerical models their study reveals that the brittle cracking embrittlement in the tanker s hull section is the main reason of fracture in another study kalan and petti conducted series of experimental tests to explore the crack propagation in the steel plate subjected to the cryogenic spills kalan and petti 2011 they developed four different test phases to investigate the effect of temperature profile cooling rate material properties fracture characteristics and a few other parameters iannaccone et al performed a comparative analysis of the inherent safety performance of the foreseen technologies for lng bunkering iannaccone et al 2019 inherent safety ranking was established based on overall indicators deriving from severity of consequences and credibility of loss of containment events li and tang performed structural risk analysis of damaged membrane lng carriers after grounding based on bayesian belief networks li and tang 2019 the extreme accidental condition of the lng leak and subsequent cryogenic impacts on the structural strength were considered using the nonlinear fem steady state heat conduction analysis was performed and parts of structure that cooled below 40 c were removed from the fem model assuming they have fractured which is potentially an oversimplification of the real failure process baalisampang et al proposed a numerical methodology to study the effect of small and medium sized lng spills on typical steel structures baalisampang et al 2019 they combined the ansys fem structural module with a cfd tool to conduct the transient thermal and structural analysis they performed a static analysis for a geometry without any cracks to find out the regions with the maximum von mises stress afterward they performed the fracture analysis with a cracked geometry where the crack is placed at the maximum stress region obtained from the previous stage the case they considered show that immediate crack propagation will not happen however cryogenic spill could have a long term effect on the structural design life de beer et al presented their research study about impact of cryogenic spills on floating lng tankers where they quantified the risk of fracture due to the cryogenic thermal shock de beer et al 2019 to this end they used combination of linear elastic fracture mechanics and fem to simulate the crack propagation in lng tanker main deck small scale experimental tests were performed to validate their numerical model they found out that it is unlikely that small spills induce fracture in steel deck because lng will evaporate before the stress intensity factor reaches critical value they also mentioned that the protective insulation coatings prolong the structural life against cryogenic thermal shock oh and coauthors utilized the abaqus fem package to study the effect of insulation layer on the cryogenic induced thermal shock of composite laminates oh et al 2013 they conducted a transient thermal stress analysis to predict stress levels for a composite laminate that has been immersed into the ln2 their results reveal that an insulation layer greatly reduces the maximum stress in thickness direction and suppress risk of delamination and matrix cracking in some cases cryogenic induced thermal stress is not a drawback and engineers use cryogenic fluids to break the materials with the cryogenic fracturing technique huanget al 2020 for example the rocks could rapidly cool down with ln2 where thermal stress could cause fracture huang et al has recently explored the literature and presented a deep review on cryogenic fracturing technology considering several aspects huanget al 2020 1 4 materials carbon steels and low alloy steels become brittle when cooled down to cryogenic temperatures reducing their ductility and fracture toughness they belong to a large group of materials with body centered cubic bcc crystallographic structure whose fracture toughness is sensitive to temperature variations callister and rethwisch 2011 to prevent or reduce ductile to brittle transition special types of materials were developed such as austenitic stainless steels 9 and 7 ni steels david 2003 however these materials are only used for special cases since they are expensive and difficult to weld research on cheaper low nickel alloy steels high manganese alloy steels and invar alloys continues lindströmet al 2015 to achieve cost savings an alternative is to clad high performing material on top of a cheap one where the former is exposed to low temperatures this forms functionally graded steels fgss a sub category of functionally graded materials fgms where properties vary continuously or semi continuously in the thickness direction fgms are popular in high temperature applications combining properties of ceramics and metals koizumi 1997 from the manufacturing perspective the fgss can be categorized into two types those made by adding layers to build up a part and those made solely by mass transport or use of diffusion suresh and mortensen 1998 additive manufacturing am techniques are being widely used to manufacture graded steel and metals with an arbitrary gradient function for example laser direct metal deposition ldmd as one of the am methods is a useful technique to fabricate the graded steels that locally melts the metal powder using laser heat source shah et al employed the ldmd technique to produce graded fgs made of stainless steel 316l and inconel 718 shah et al 2014 other than am techniques with the aid of electroslag remelting esr process we can produce graded steels refs aghazedeh mohandesi and shahosseinie 2005 mohandesi et al 2006 studied the manufacturing characteristics of fgss made of austenitic stainless steel and low carbon steel through esr method this type of material is similar the one considered in this research in this paper we consider stainless steel s u s 304 low carbon steel a i s i 1020 and the combination of the two functionally graded through the thickness for the latter stainless hetnarski et al 2009 steel is assumed to be on the exposed side due to its sustained fracture toughness and ductility while low carbon steel is on the opposite side for its better price and weldability 1 5 present study based on the literature review it is clear that low temperature thermoelectricity has not received proper attention to the best of authors knowledge there is no previous research on the nonlinear transient thermoelastic response of plates subjected to rapid cryogenic cooling very high stresses could arise due to combined thermal and mechanical loads which needs to be addressed to ensure integrity of structures furthermore fast and accurate analysis techniques need to be developed for design this study aims to investigate the nonlinear transient thermoelastic response of circular and annular plates when exposed to cryogenic temperatures on one of the faces these plate shapes are selected since spill can resemble a circle marshall and mundt 1995 center for chemical process safety ccps 1999 annular plates are generalization of circular plates frequently considered in high temperature loading which is used here for validation and comparison the circular annular plates are typically used in marine vessels as manhole covers tanker hatch cover and a few other applications material is functionally graded being stainless steel s u s 304 on the exposed side and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 on the other material properties are considered to be temperature dependent relying on the experimental data the novel fgm configuration proposed in this study is used for the first time in cryogenic and low temperature applications the plate is mathematically defined within the fsdt framework given that significant deflections can arise geometrical nonlinearity is considered through von kármán assumption the set of nonlinear governing equations are derived through hamilton s principle and solutions are obtained via generalized differential quadrature method gdqm and newton raphson technique the temporal evolution of the temperature field is obtained by solving fourier type heat conduction equation using gdqm and crank nicolson scheme results are validated using previous studies in the literature and fem abaqus where plates are modeled with solid elements 2 functionally graded materials in low temperatures fgms have shown a great capability under severe conditions such as high transient cooling in a very short time reddy and chin 1998 therefore with the aid of fgm concept a mixture of carbon steel and stainless steel can be used for austenitic martensitic functionally graded steels fgss it is worth mentioning that austenitic martensitic fgs is a semi brittle material and can be manufactured by electroslag remelting process aghazedeh mohandesi and shahosseinie 2005 barati et al 2010 consider an fgm circular annular plate with inner radius r i outer radius r o and thickness h which is subjected to the axisymmetric transverse rapid thermal load as it is shown in the fig 1 the cylindrical coordinate system r θ z is defined and the origin is located at the mid plane center of the plate in this coordinate system r θ and z represent the radial circumferential and through the thickness direction respectively obviously when r i is equal to zero the annular plate will become a solid circular plate the thermomechanical properties of fgm substrate plate are graded through the thickness direction which can be changed with any arbitrary function the power law model is employed to represent volume fraction distribution of fgm medium constituents as follows 1 v i 0 5 z h ξ v j 1 v i where the v i and v j are each constituent volume fraction and ξ is non negative power law index according to the voigt homogenization scheme the inhomogeneous equivalent thermal and mechanical properties of fgm medium could be evaluated reddy and chin 1998 hence young s modulus e poission s ratio ν thermal conductivity κ thermal expansion coefficient α specific heat capacity c v and density ρ can be expressed as follows 2 p z t p j t p i j t v i p i j t p i t p j t where p i and p j are the thermal and mechanical properties of fgm substrate constituents the stainless steel 300 series such as 304 and 304 l have shown stable mechanical properties at high strain rates and under cryogenic environment which make them suitable for such severe conditions lee et al 2009 kim et al 2013 kim et al 2014 therefore i and j indices correspond to the stainless steel s u s 304 and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 constituents respectively 2 1 thermomechanical properties from cryogenic to room temperatures the material properties at cryogenic temperatures can be much different than at the room temperature in order to accurately predict the fgm medium behavior the constituent properties are considered to be temperature dependent td the thermomechanical properties of s u s 304 and a i s i 1020 in cryogenic temperatures have been obtained from the experiments available in the literature timmerhaus and flynn 2013 corruccini and gniewek 1961 eldridge and deem 1961 childs et al 1973 properties of solid mater mann 1977 marquardt et al 2002 the experimental data related to the thermal conductivity κ and specific heat c v is curve fitted with the logarithmic 8th order polynomial equation while the data related to the young s modulus e poisson s ratio ν and thermal expansion coefficient α is curve fitted with 4th order polynomial equation as follows thermal conductivity κ and specific heat c v 3 log 10 p a b log 10 t c log 10 t 2 d log 10 t 3 e log 10 t 4 f log 10 t 5 g log 10 t 6 h log 10 t 7

literature for thermal expansion coefficient is in the form of integrated linear thermal expansion 5 l t l 293 l 293 where l 293 is initial length at 293 k the coefficient of thermal expansion can be easily evaluated by taking a derivative of the integrated thermal expansion 6 α t 1 l d l t d t tables 1 and 2 show the td material properties coefficients for eqs 3 and 4 in case that the material properties are temperature independent tid the properties are evaluated at reference temperature t 0 293 k 3 methodology 3 1 equation of motion since the loading and boundary conditions of the annular circular plate are axisymmetric the thermoelastic response of plate is axisymmetric hence according to the axisymmetric fsdt framework the radial u and transverse displacement w components of plate are given as 7 u r z t u 0 r t z ϕ r r t w r t z w 0 r t where the u 0 w 0 are the radial and transverse displacements of any point on the midplane while ϕ r represents the transverse normal rotation about θ axis in order to account for von kármán geometrical nonlinearity the nonlinear strain displacement kinematic relation in polar coordinates may be written as 8 ε r r u r 1 2 w r 2 ε θ θ 1 r u γ r z u z w r where ε r r and ε θ θ denote the radial and circumferential strains while γ r z expresses the shear strain component in this paper the comma and are partial derivatives with respect to

plate based on the fsdt can be expressed as 12 n r r n θ θ m r r m θ θ q r z h 2 h 2 σ r r σ θ θ z σ r r z σ θ θ k s τ r z d z where k s is the shear correction factor corresponding to the assumptions in fsdt this value depends on the material properties loading type and boundary conditions the procedure of accurate calculation for k s is rather complex especially for fgm however in the current study the approximated value chosen for k s is 5 6 praveen and reddy 1998 now substituting eqs 9 and 10 into 12 yields 13 n r r n θ θ m r r m θ θ q r z a 11 a 12 a 12 a 22 b 11 b 12 b 11 b 12 d 11 b

15 n t m t h 2 h 2 e z t α z t 1 ν z t t r θ z t 0 r θ z 1 z d z following uncoupled thermoelastic theory the governing equation of the motion for the axisymmetric annular circular plate subject to the thermal loading can be derived using hamilton s principle reddy 2003 16 δ t 1 t 2 π d t δ t 1 t 2 t u v d t 0 where t u and v refer to the kinetic energy strain energy and the work done by external loads respectively for the present study the virtual kinetic energy δ t and virtual external work δ v would be zero therefore the virtual strain energy δ u of the plate is defined as 17 δ u r i r o h 2 h 2 σ r r δ ε r r σ θ θ δ ε θ θ k s τ r z δ γ r z r d z d r by substituting eqs 9 10 and 12 into eq 17 integrating through z and r directions and then carrying out some mathematical

0 should always follow the condition 21 u 0 ϕ r q r z n r r w 0 r 0 the derived governing equations in eq 19 consist of highly nonlinear terms originating from geometrical and material nonlinearities therefore it is quite difficult to provide analytical solution due to the complexity hence in this study the generalized differential quadrature method gdqm a strong numerical method is adopted to discretize the set of governing equation eq 19 and respective boundary conditions eq 20 21 the capability of gdqm in dealing with highly nonlinear differential equations is shown in kiani and eslami 2014 javani et al 2019 babaee et al 2018 keleshteri and jelovica 2020 liang et al 2019b lianget al 2019 for brevity the details of gdqm approach and mesh grids are discussed in appendix a by applying gdqm into the eqs 19 21 the set of governing equations will take the following form 22 k 11 x t k 12 x t k 13 x t k 21 x t k 22 x t k 23 x t k 31 x t k 32 x t k 33 x t 3 n r 3 n r x 3 n r 1 f t 3 n r 1 where k i j t x is the stiffness matrix which is dependent on the temperature and displacement vector x and n r is the number of grid points in radial direction the set of highly nonlinear algebraic equations eq 22 can be solved via an iterative algorithm using well known newton raphson scheme reddy 2014 3 2 heat conduction equation the temporal evolution of the temperature distribution in annular circular fgm plate subjected to the rapid cooling can be evaluated using transient heat conduction equation neglecting the heat generated within the body the transient heat conduction equation may be written in the form of hetnarski et al 2009 23 κ z t t i i ρ z t c v z t t it is assumed that the temperature profile only varies across the plate thickness i z since the material heterogeneity is considered to be through the thickness and thermal loading is applied on the entire top surface to obtain the temperature profile the heat equation eq 23 should be solved along with the initial and boundary conditions it is assumed that the bottom surface carbon steel is either insulated or experiences prescribed temperature while the upper surface stainless steel is exposed to a time dependent rapid temperature drop or a heat flux reduction rapid cooling mathematically these conditions are described as follows 24 c a s e 1 t h 2 t t t h t t h 2 t t b h t c a s e 2 t h 2 t t t h t t z h 2 t 0 i n s u l a t e d c a s e 3 k h 2 t t z h 2 t q h t t z h 2 t 0 i n s u l a t e d i n i t i a l c o n d i t i o n t z 0 t 0 where h t is the ramp function which becomes unity at t 0 001 s t t and t b are the temperatures at the top and bottom plate surface 25 h t t 0 001 t 0 001 s 1 t 0 001 s analytical solution of the eq 23 may not be possible due to the fact that the material properties κ and c v strongly depend on the temperature while temperature itself is unknown and is going to be evaluated in eq 23 therefore with the aid of gdqm the spatial domain can be discretized and the equation will be converted into the matrix form as follows 26 c t t n z n z t n z k t t n z n z t n z f t t n z where n z is the node number in the thickness direction according to the procedure proposed in ref reddy 2014 the alpha family time approximation method crank nicolson scheme has been employed for time domain discretization it is to be noted that since material properties are temperature dependent at each time step first material properties should be evaluated at reference temperature t 0 and then temperature distribution should be calculated using eq 26 andeq 24 the material properties need to be updated with the obtained temperature and consequently eq 26 should be resolved at each time step this iterative procedure should be repeated until the temperature value obtained from eq 26 converges to a certain value 4 results and discussion in this section the proposed methodology is implemented into the matlab ver r2020a to investigate the transient thermoelastic response of the annular circular plate under cryogenic rapid thermal load hereinafter the w is the maximum lateral mid plane deflection at r 0 and r r i r o 2 for solid circular and annular plates respectively the temperature t is obtained at the mid section z 0 for all numerical results the maximum radial and hoop stresses are denoted by the σ r r and σ θ θ and are obtained at top face z h 2 and inner edge r r i for convention for example m c i m s s means that the inner edge is movable clamped and the outer edge is immovable simply supported for the sake of numerical implementation the inner radius of solid circular plate is chosen to be r i 10 8 m the choice of geometry considered in examples is motivated by typical structural dimensions in marine vessels where plate thickness is commonly in range from 5 m m to 20 m m while the span between supports stiffeners frames decks is from 500 m m to 3000 m m moreover manholes small hatch covers and small openings can have radius from 50 m m to 1000 m m 4 1 validation to validate the proposed formulation and respective results three comparative examples are presented in this section using available literature and fem abaqus package ver 6 22 corp 2018 as mentioned above according to the literature review there is no similar work on thermoelastic response of fgm plate at low and cryogenic temperatures therefore for validation case 1 and 2 present methodology has been compared with high temperature thermal loading results reported in refs kiani and eslami 2014 javani et al 2019 for validation case 3 however cryogenic lateral thermal load is considered and the results are compared with fem abaqus based on axisymmetric plate model linear element cax4t with four nodes is used and coupled temperature displacement formulation is employed mesh consists of 60 elements through the thickness and 100 elements along the half span between r i to r o this mesh is sufficient according to the preliminary mesh convergence study for all validation cases both td and tid assumptions have been considered 4 1 1 validation case 1 2 high temperature plate is made of ceramic silicon nitride s i 3 n 4 which undergoes lateral high temperature thermal load immovable simply supported boundary condition is used case 1 is a solid circular plate with 6 m m thickness and 80 m m radius obtained from ref kiani and eslami 2014 case 2 is an annular plate with 5 m m thickness 20 and 100 m m inner and outer radius respectively following ref javani et al 2019 the top surface of solid circular and annular plate is exposed to the step load of t t 600 k and 700 k respectively the maximum deflection w versus time is shown in fig 2 revealing very good agreement between current study and the literature 4 1 2 validation case 3 cryogenic and low temperature a solid circular and annular plate are considered made of s u s 304 with i m s s boundary condition subjected to cryogenic rapid thermal load on the upper face the plate is initially at t 293 k and the top surface suddenly drops to t t 93 k we consider this temperature drop throughout the study as a generalization of the thermal load in case of other cryogenic liquids the geometrical characteristics of the solid annular plate are h 5 m m r i 20 m m and r o 100 m m fig 3 shows the transient temperature at the mid plane and plate maximum deflections according to fig 3 the present results correlate very well with the fem abaqus as it can be seen from the fig 2 the plate under high temperature thermal load gradually displaces upward until it reaches the steady solution however in the fig 3 the plate under cryogenic rapid thermal loading rapidly displaces downward until it reaches the maximum value and then deflections reverse and the plate converges to the steady state therefore for case 1 thermal boundary condition the thermoelastic behavior of the plate under low temperature environment qualitatively differs from the high temperatures 4 1 3 remarks on coupling and inertia effects the thermoelastic coupling effect is function of rapidity of cooling heating load application boley and weiner 1960 according to the boley the rapidity of cooling heating application can be represented by t 0 input time here we can refer to this as the time step this time must be compared with two other time characteristics of the system namely the characteristic mechanical time t m and the characteristic thermal time t t t m l v e t t h 2 k 26 where l v e h and k are effective length dilatational wave speed thickness and thermal diffusivity the velocity of propagation of dilatational wave in an elastic medium is 27 v e λ 2 μ ρ where λ and μ are lame constants and ρ is density it is permissible to employ uncoupled thermoelastic formulations if the inequality conditions in below are satisfied 28 t t t m 29 t 0 t m all the subsequent results have met the inequality conditions eqs 28 and 29 in addition we can see that the results using uncoupled approach in this study matches well with the coupled temperature displacement analysis in abaqus fig 3 providing further justification for the uncoupled sequentially coupled approach the results from fig 3 show that the uncoupled thermoelasticity formulation taken in this study is sufficient to describe the plate response since the difference to fem which uses coupled thermoelastic approach is negligible in case of applying cryogenic load in a shock form and depending on the plate thickness and other parameters the responses may be in form of thermally induced vibrations hetnarski et al 2009 boley 1956 boley has quantified this effect with an inertia parameter b t m t where t m is the thermal characteristics time and t is the first natural period boley and weiner 1960 boley 1956 with the loading scenario considered in the current study this effect does not exist 4 2 parametric studies 4 2 1 effect of temperature dependency fig 3 demonstrates that tid assumption can lead to overestimation of lateral deflections and through the thickness temperature both temperature and deflection are lower when considering td properties which is opposite to high temperature thermal loading kiani and eslami 2014 javani et al 2019 as it is shown in fig 2 td assumption in high temperature case results in larger deflections these results however are influenced by properties of the considered materials and might be different for other materials the tid assumption is conservative but far from reality therefore only td results are presented in continuation 4 2 2 the effect of thermal boundary conditions fig 4 presents the influence of thermal boundary condition on thermoelastic response of the annular plate the details of each boundary condition case have been provided in the eq 24 section 3 2 for the case 1 and 2 the top face is exposed to prescribed temperature t t 93 h t k where h t is a ramp function as defined in eq 25 for the case 3 the top surface experiences the prescribed heat flux with the amount of q 10 6 h t w m 2 fig 4 demonstrates that the plates with case 1 and 2 thermal boundary conditions are initially showing similar trend in temperature deflection and both radial and hoop stress after about 1 s the response curves deviate from each other due to the insulated bottom surface in case 2 the temperature value at the insulated bottom surface changes to fulfill the zero heat flux condition it is worth noting that the maximum deflections for both case 1 and 2 are identical while the respective steady state deflections are different likewise the primary peak values related to the radial and hoop stresses are identical for both case 1 and 2 while as time passes the stresses diverge from each other based on fig 4 radial stress for case 2 is greater than for case 1 while in case of hoop stress it is the opposite generally the induced hoop stress is greater than radial stress for the discussed cases case 3 boundary condition causes quite a different response than the other two cases as the temperature distribution for this case is different than the others the maximum lateral deflection occurs later for case 3 compared with case 1 and 2 since the rate of temperature change for this case is smaller we can decompose radial and hoop stresses components into mechanical and thermal parts according to the eq 10 the thermal part of radial and hoop stresses is very similar it increases from zero stress free condition until it reaches the maximum and then drops down dome like shape the mechanical part of radial stress time history is similar to the maximum lateral deflection behavior as its absolute value increases up to a certain time and then decreases to a value near zero the summation of thermal and mechanical parts would form the total radial hoop stress the radial and hoop stress at t 5 s is not zero it is close to zero for the presented time duration and it will change as time continues 4 2 3 effect of plate geometry the influence of thickness on the maximum lateral deflection w of annular plate subjected to the cryogenic rapid cooling is presented in fig 5 as it can be seen once the upper face experiences the cryogenic thermal load the plate rapidly displaces downwards after the extreme displacement is reached deflections reverse and the plate converges to the steady state this behavior is regularly repeating for all annular circular plates in the current study according to fig 5 increase of the thickness leads to a decrease of the maximum lateral deflection the reason is that thicker plates have higher stiffness and therefore they have smaller deflection in comparison with their counterparts furthermore thin plates reach steady state solution faster than thick plates this is because thin plates cool down faster resulting in lower temperature gradient through the thickness fig 6 presents the influence of inner radius r i on the maximum lateral deflection w as it can be seen inner radius does not affect the steady state solution and all plates converge to the same value the steady state solution attains near zero value since the case 2 boundary condition is considered insulated bottom surface where the through the thickness temperature gradient is minimal it is to be noted that based on fig 6 when r i decreases the maximum lateral deflection increases according to fig 7 outer radius r o has a significant influence on the maximum lateral deflection w of the plate it can be seen that the plates with larger span larger r o have larger deflection this behavior is originating from the fact that larger r o generates larger thermal induced stress resultants n t and m t and consequently the lateral deflection becomes larger furthermore as seen in figs 5 7 all cases eventually approach the steady state solution with time the trend of the deflection curves in figs 4 7 highlights the importance of transient thermoelastic analysis carried out in the current study compared with static steady state type of analysis in a fraction of a second the deflection suddenly increases and reaches a peak while the final state is attained at a much later stage therefore static steady state solution significantly underestimates the displacements and is unreliable 4 2 4 the effect of material distribution material distribution has an important effect on the thermoelastic behavior of a plate as ξ increases from 0 to the material changes from a i s i 1020 carbon steel to s u s 304 stainless steel respectively according to fig 8 the plate made of s u s 304 steel ξ 0 has larger deflection and radial stress than plates made with smaller s u s 304 steel volume fraction ξ 0 this means that adding more a i s i 1020 carbon steel into the s u s 304 phase will reduce the thermal stress and transverse deflection which is good achievement on the other hand a i s i 1020 steel is a brittle material and not suited for exposure to cryogenic temperatures on the top face nonetheless due to its relatively low price it is rational in some applications to incorporate it to a semi brittle fgm medium containing both a i s i 1020 and s u s 304 the rapid cryogenic thermal load could generate high stresses which can endanger structural integrity we can see from eq 10 that both mechanical and thermal stresses are contributing factors in the radial stress at the top face the thermal stress behaves as a step function which causes instantaneous primary peak in the radial stress once the thermal load is applied the mechanical part of the radial stress starts increasing from zero value until it reaches its maximum compressive value later it reverses towards tensile stress until it becomes steady the summation of thermal and mechanical parts of radial stress explains the secondary peak in the radial stress time history it can be seen from fig 8 b that the plate composed of pure s u s 304 steel produces greater radial stress than other material compositions 4 2 5 the effect of mechanical boundary conditions fig 9 shows that the mechanical supports have a significant influence on the thermoelastic response of the plate subjected to the cryogenic thermal load boundary condition with higher kinematical restraint axial and rotational allows smaller transverse deflection since the plate can more easily resist the thermal bending moment induced by the cryogenic thermal load for example the highest deflection is obtained for m s s m s s boundary condition since the boundary can both rotate and displace axially radial and hoop stress are significantly affected by the mechanical boundary conditions radial stress for the m s s m s s and i m s s i m s s instantly reaches maximum value and then gradually decays over time while for m c m s s and i m c i m s s it takes some time to reach the maximum value there is a considerable difference in the stress level magnitudes for various boundary supports therefore it is important to consider an appropriate boundary condition in this type of analysis 4 2 6 the effect of geometrical nonlinearity geometrical nonlinearity typically becomes important when deflections increase beyond 30 of plate thickness ventsel and krauthammer 2001 to better elaborate on the geometrical nonlinearity effect we have considered two different examples circular and annular plates in fig 10 for each example the plates have the same geometry material properties thermal and mechanical boundary conditions but one with linear and the other nonlinear geometrical assumption as fig 10 shows the response is not accurate for the example 1 when only linear assumption is employed as there is about 15 difference between linear and nonlinear solutions in this case the maximum deflection to thickness ratio w h is near 50 and therefore we could expect that linear assumption is not accurate on the other hand example 2 shows only 2 difference between linear and nonlinear solutions as maximum deflection to thickness ratio w h is only about 12 we can see that the linear assumption overestimates the deflection as the ratio of maximum deflection to the thickness gets larger the difference between linear and nonlinear geometrical solutions becomes larger as well therefore it is important to consider the von karman assumption as in some of the considered cases w h ratio is near 50 5 conclusion present paper investigates for the first time thermoelastic response of fgm solid circular annular plate under sudden cryogenic cooling the plate undergoes cooling on the upper face having kinematic boundary conditions at the edges this loading scenario aims to provide better understanding of the response of plates in ships that transport lng or use it as fuel the geometrical nonlinearities are considered through von kármán assumption the semi brittle fgm composed of stainless steel s u s 304 and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 is functionally graded through the thickness the thermomechanical properties are temperature dependent based on the fsdt framework the governing equations and associated boundary conditions are derived the gdqm and newton raphson method are employed to solve the governing equations the fourier type heat conduction equation is solved using gdqm and crank nicolson scheme to obtain temperature profile the comprehensive parametric study has been carried out to study the effect of different parameters on the thermoelastic response of plates under rapid cryogenic thermal load the present results are quite general and can be extended to the other types of structures and may be useful for further investigation in the field of thermoelectricity of solid structures in cryogenic and low temperatures as we show in this paper the plate in exposure of cryogenic temperature can exhibit significant nonlinear bending response before reaching steady state high stresses can be developed which can potentially endanger the safety of the structure depending on the type of thermal boundary condition the transient thermoelastic response of plate under cryogenic thermal load qualitatively differs from the high temperature load for example for high temperature loading with case 1 boundary condition the maximum lateral deflection is obtained with steady state solution while for cryogenic temperature loading it appears before the steady state as shown in this paper however this difference depends on the thermal boundary conditions for case 2 thermal boundary condition the maximum radial stress would occur later in the response near the steady state solution even for cryogenic thermal loading therefore transient analysis in the low temperature thermal loading is important for certain boundary conditions in case thermal load is applied as a shock and plates are slender inertia effect might become important and the solution could exhibit thermally induced vibrations however this requires deeper investigation and should be considered in future furthermore the induced thermal stresses could potentially lead to fracture which should also be considered in future nonetheless the proposed material distribution in this study could reduce the risk of fracture due

20925,liquified natural gas lng is increasingly used as fuel in marine industry for transportation and storage purposes it is kept at 163 c under atmospheric pressure when lng gets in contact with a plate pipe or a tank it causes very significant thermal load on the structure which has until that point been kept at environmental temperature the current study presents the nonlinear transient thermoelastic response of circular annular plates which experience sudden cryogenic thermal load this is the first time that thermoelastic analysis has been presented for any structure under such condition the material is composed of stainless steel s u s 304 and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 and is functionally graded through the thickness the novel material configuration proposed in this study has been used for the first time in cryogenic and low temperature applications material properties are evaluated based on available experimental data and assumed to be temperature dependent the nonlinear governing equations and boundary conditions are obtained with the von kármán assumption and the first order shear deformation theory the governing equations are discretized and solved with the generalized differential quadrature method gdqm and newton raphson iterative method the temporal evolution of the temperature field is obtained by solving fourier type heat conduction equation using gdqm and crank nicolson scheme the results have been validated with axisymmetric fem models using solid elements a detailed parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effect of temperature dependency material distribution thermal mechanical boundary conditions geometrical nonlinearity and plate size on the thermoelastic response the results show that transient thermoelastic response of plates under sudden cryogenic cooling can be very different than steady state response significant deflections occur in a fraction of a second because of the sudden thermal load and decrease over time the highest stresses appear predominantly in the initial phase but can also appear later depending on the plate geometry and boundary conditions for certain thermal boundary condition the response of a plate under low temperature thermal load can qualitatively differ from high temperature thermal load graphical abstract image 1 keywords transient thermoelastic analysis thermal stress sudden cryogenic thermal load fgm circular annular plate generalized differential quadrature method 1 introduction 1 1 background marine industry is increasingly using liquefied natural gas lng as fuel in ships kumar et al 2011 lng is stored and transported at 163 c under atmospheric pressure when lng gets in contact with any plate pipe or a tank it causes very significant thermal load on the structure which has until that point been kept at environmental temperature international maritime organization imo has issued international code of safety for ships using gases or other low flashpoint fuels igf code that specifies handling of lng code 2014 however like any other fluid accidental lng spill can still happen during the transfer from storage tanker to fuel tanks and this would expose surrounding structures to cryogenic thermal load edeskuty and stewart 1996 spills can have consequences on structural safety thus impacting the safety of passengers and crew which makes it worthwhile to carefully study their effects in addition other cryogenic liquids e g liquid nitrogen known as ln2 are being used in other fields for example medicine where medical instruments have to endure sudden thermal cooling timmerhaus and flynn 2013 materials exposed to cryogenic liquids experience a sudden temperature drop and develop potentially high thermal stresses these stresses are developed in elastic continuum due to a nonuniform temperature field throughout the body which needs to be properly accounted to ensure safe operation of devices and structures 1 2 thermoelasticity at high temperatures thermoelasticity is a field abundant with research works that assess thermal effects in structures however the attention is almost exclusively directed to analysis of high temperature effects due to its vast applications enormous amount of scientific studies has been published on the topic and it is impossible to present thorough literature review here instead we present selected prominent works heating a constrained member causes it to buckle vibrate and generally change stress state either in linear or nonlinear regime hetnarski et al 2009 boley and weiner published an informative textbook in 1960 about the theory of thermoelectricity in various structural members with consideration of geometrical nonlinearities boley and weiner 1960 mian and spencer proposed a 3d elasticity analytical solution of an inhomogeneous plate under thermal and mechanical loadings mian and spencer 1998 reddy and cheng presented the thermoelastic results for a functionally graded material fgm rectangular plate using asymptotic solution reddy and cheng 2001 their results are useful resource for validation of the plate theories it was found that when the plate is subjected to high temperature thermal load the maximum compressive longitudinal stress would occur on the plate top surface in 1956 for the first time boley observed that the response of slender beams under very rapid heating would be in the form of thermally induced vibration boley 1956 since then the thermally induced vibration has received considerable attention for high temperature load praveen and reddy conducted a research study on the dynamic transient thermoelastic response of fgm plate under suddenly applied thermal and mechanical loads praveen and reddy 1998 they assessed the effect of temperature field boundary condition plate thickness geometrical nonlinearities and material distribution index and observed that fgm material distribution plays an important role in their results vel and batra obtained an exact 3d static solution for a fgm rectangular plate subjected to the sinusoidal thermo mechanical load vel and batra 2002 they performed a comparative study on analytical 3d solution and 2d solutions with different plate theories including classical plate theory cpt first order shear deformation theory fsdt and third order shear deformation theory tsdt they observed that for very thick plates length to thickness equals 5 under thermal load there is a 26 difference between transverse displacement from exact solution and cpt and fsdt they reported that this error in thick plates could be due to the neglect of transverse normal stress and strain later in another study they studied the transient 3d thermal stress analysis of fgm plate subjected to the uniform heat supply vel and batra 2003 they showed that the transient longitudinal stress induced by the rapid prescribed temperature load is 8 times larger than its steady state solution cho and oden studied the transient thermal stress characteristics of fgm plate using finite element method fem and crank nicolson scheme cho and oden 2000 they observed that there is a considerable difference between thermal stress distribution from steady state and transient solutions and this is more profound near the bottom surface of fgm yang and huang obtained the semi analytical nonlinear transient solution of fgm plate with geometrical imperfection yang and huang 2007 they found that the transient response is strongly influenced by temperature field and material distribution index liang et al studied the semi analytical natural frequency and transient solution of fgm cylindrical shell under thermal environment liang et al 2019a they employed differential quadrature method for space discretization and laplace transform for time domain their results reveal that increasing thickness radius ratio would decrease the shell peak displacement but increasing length radius ratio would increase the peak displacement kiani and eslami numerically studied the dynamic thermoelastic behavior of fgm circular plate considering material and geometrical nonlinearities kiani and eslami 2014 the plate experiences a sudden uniform thermal load which might induce vibrations depending on the boundary condition type material and geometrical parameters their results show that neglecting the geometrical nonlinearity would underestimate the induced deflections and stress values javani et al 2019 extended the work by kiani and eslami and presented the dynamic thermoelastic response of fgm annular plate under heat shock they performed a parametric study and showed that all the mentioned parameters including temperature dependency boundary condition plate size and material properties have significant effect on the plate response 1 3 thermoelasticity and fracture at cryogenic temperatures structural response in cryogenic temperatures has received drastically lower attention compared with elevated temperatures very few of those studies focus on thermoelastic response cryogenic and low temperature environment can induce large amount of thermal stress and cause severe damage and fracture in structures a research group in sandia national laboratory utilized the high performance computational models to explore the risk of cryogenic and fire thermal damage in lng cargo ships when a large lng tank breach happens pettiet al 2013 they performed computational fluid dynamic cfd analysis during a breach event in order to estimate the lng pool size and amount of vaporization to this end they used the fem model to obtain the crack pattern and fracture analysis they developed series of experimental tests to evaluate material properties in temperature range from 161 c up to 1000 c and used them to update their numerical models their study reveals that the brittle cracking embrittlement in the tanker s hull section is the main reason of fracture in another study kalan and petti conducted series of experimental tests to explore the crack propagation in the steel plate subjected to the cryogenic spills kalan and petti 2011 they developed four different test phases to investigate the effect of temperature profile cooling rate material properties fracture characteristics and a few other parameters iannaccone et al performed a comparative analysis of the inherent safety performance of the foreseen technologies for lng bunkering iannaccone et al 2019 inherent safety ranking was established based on overall indicators deriving from severity of consequences and credibility of loss of containment events li and tang performed structural risk analysis of damaged membrane lng carriers after grounding based on bayesian belief networks li and tang 2019 the extreme accidental condition of the lng leak and subsequent cryogenic impacts on the structural strength were considered using the nonlinear fem steady state heat conduction analysis was performed and parts of structure that cooled below 40 c were removed from the fem model assuming they have fractured which is potentially an oversimplification of the real failure process baalisampang et al proposed a numerical methodology to study the effect of small and medium sized lng spills on typical steel structures baalisampang et al 2019 they combined the ansys fem structural module with a cfd tool to conduct the transient thermal and structural analysis they performed a static analysis for a geometry without any cracks to find out the regions with the maximum von mises stress afterward they performed the fracture analysis with a cracked geometry where the crack is placed at the maximum stress region obtained from the previous stage the case they considered show that immediate crack propagation will not happen however cryogenic spill could have a long term effect on the structural design life de beer et al presented their research study about impact of cryogenic spills on floating lng tankers where they quantified the risk of fracture due to the cryogenic thermal shock de beer et al 2019 to this end they used combination of linear elastic fracture mechanics and fem to simulate the crack propagation in lng tanker main deck small scale experimental tests were performed to validate their numerical model they found out that it is unlikely that small spills induce fracture in steel deck because lng will evaporate before the stress intensity factor reaches critical value they also mentioned that the protective insulation coatings prolong the structural life against cryogenic thermal shock oh and coauthors utilized the abaqus fem package to study the effect of insulation layer on the cryogenic induced thermal shock of composite laminates oh et al 2013 they conducted a transient thermal stress analysis to predict stress levels for a composite laminate that has been immersed into the ln2 their results reveal that an insulation layer greatly reduces the maximum stress in thickness direction and suppress risk of delamination and matrix cracking in some cases cryogenic induced thermal stress is not a drawback and engineers use cryogenic fluids to break the materials with the cryogenic fracturing technique huanget al 2020 for example the rocks could rapidly cool down with ln2 where thermal stress could cause fracture huang et al has recently explored the literature and presented a deep review on cryogenic fracturing technology considering several aspects huanget al 2020 1 4 materials carbon steels and low alloy steels become brittle when cooled down to cryogenic temperatures reducing their ductility and fracture toughness they belong to a large group of materials with body centered cubic bcc crystallographic structure whose fracture toughness is sensitive to temperature variations callister and rethwisch 2011 to prevent or reduce ductile to brittle transition special types of materials were developed such as austenitic stainless steels 9 and 7 ni steels david 2003 however these materials are only used for special cases since they are expensive and difficult to weld research on cheaper low nickel alloy steels high manganese alloy steels and invar alloys continues lindströmet al 2015 to achieve cost savings an alternative is to clad high performing material on top of a cheap one where the former is exposed to low temperatures this forms functionally graded steels fgss a sub category of functionally graded materials fgms where properties vary continuously or semi continuously in the thickness direction fgms are popular in high temperature applications combining properties of ceramics and metals koizumi 1997 from the manufacturing perspective the fgss can be categorized into two types those made by adding layers to build up a part and those made solely by mass transport or use of diffusion suresh and mortensen 1998 additive manufacturing am techniques are being widely used to manufacture graded steel and metals with an arbitrary gradient function for example laser direct metal deposition ldmd as one of the am methods is a useful technique to fabricate the graded steels that locally melts the metal powder using laser heat source shah et al employed the ldmd technique to produce graded fgs made of stainless steel 316l and inconel 718 shah et al 2014 other than am techniques with the aid of electroslag remelting esr process we can produce graded steels refs aghazedeh mohandesi and shahosseinie 2005 mohandesi et al 2006 studied the manufacturing characteristics of fgss made of austenitic stainless steel and low carbon steel through esr method this type of material is similar the one considered in this research in this paper we consider stainless steel s u s 304 low carbon steel a i s i 1020 and the combination of the two functionally graded through the thickness for the latter stainless hetnarski et al 2009 steel is assumed to be on the exposed side due to its sustained fracture toughness and ductility while low carbon steel is on the opposite side for its better price and weldability 1 5 present study based on the literature review it is clear that low temperature thermoelectricity has not received proper attention to the best of authors knowledge there is no previous research on the nonlinear transient thermoelastic response of plates subjected to rapid cryogenic cooling very high stresses could arise due to combined thermal and mechanical loads which needs to be addressed to ensure integrity of structures furthermore fast and accurate analysis techniques need to be developed for design this study aims to investigate the nonlinear transient thermoelastic response of circular and annular plates when exposed to cryogenic temperatures on one of the faces these plate shapes are selected since spill can resemble a circle marshall and mundt 1995 center for chemical process safety ccps 1999 annular plates are generalization of circular plates frequently considered in high temperature loading which is used here for validation and comparison the circular annular plates are typically used in marine vessels as manhole covers tanker hatch cover and a few other applications material is functionally graded being stainless steel s u s 304 on the exposed side and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 on the other material properties are considered to be temperature dependent relying on the experimental data the novel fgm configuration proposed in this study is used for the first time in cryogenic and low temperature applications the plate is mathematically defined within the fsdt framework given that significant deflections can arise geometrical nonlinearity is considered through von kármán assumption the set of nonlinear governing equations are derived through hamilton s principle and solutions are obtained via generalized differential quadrature method gdqm and newton raphson technique the temporal evolution of the temperature field is obtained by solving fourier type heat conduction equation using gdqm and crank nicolson scheme results are validated using previous studies in the literature and fem abaqus where plates are modeled with solid elements 2 functionally graded materials in low temperatures fgms have shown a great capability under severe conditions such as high transient cooling in a very short time reddy and chin 1998 therefore with the aid of fgm concept a mixture of carbon steel and stainless steel can be used for austenitic martensitic functionally graded steels fgss it is worth mentioning that austenitic martensitic fgs is a semi brittle material and can be manufactured by electroslag remelting process aghazedeh mohandesi and shahosseinie 2005 barati et al 2010 consider an fgm circular annular plate with inner radius r i outer radius r o and thickness h which is subjected to the axisymmetric transverse rapid thermal load as it is shown in the fig 1 the cylindrical coordinate system r θ z is defined and the origin is located at the mid plane center of the plate in this coordinate system r θ and z represent the radial circumferential and through the thickness direction respectively obviously when r i is equal to zero the annular plate will become a solid circular plate the thermomechanical properties of fgm substrate plate are graded through the thickness direction which can be changed with any arbitrary function the power law model is employed to represent volume fraction distribution of fgm medium constituents as follows 1 v i 0 5 z h ξ v j 1 v i where the v i and v j are each constituent volume fraction and ξ is non negative power law index according to the voigt homogenization scheme the inhomogeneous equivalent thermal and mechanical properties of fgm medium could be evaluated reddy and chin 1998 hence young s modulus e poission s ratio ν thermal conductivity κ thermal expansion coefficient α specific heat capacity c v and density ρ can be expressed as follows 2 p z t p j t p i j t v i p i j t p i t p j t where p i and p j are the thermal and mechanical properties of fgm substrate constituents the stainless steel 300 series such as 304 and 304 l have shown stable mechanical properties at high strain rates and under cryogenic environment which make them suitable for such severe conditions lee et al 2009 kim et al 2013 kim et al 2014 therefore i and j indices correspond to the stainless steel s u s 304 and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 constituents respectively 2 1 thermomechanical properties from cryogenic to room temperatures the material properties at cryogenic temperatures can be much different than at the room temperature in order to accurately predict the fgm medium behavior the constituent properties are considered to be temperature dependent td the thermomechanical properties of s u s 304 and a i s i 1020 in cryogenic temperatures have been obtained from the experiments available in the literature timmerhaus and flynn 2013 corruccini and gniewek 1961 eldridge and deem 1961 childs et al 1973 properties of solid mater mann 1977 marquardt et al 2002 the experimental data related to the thermal conductivity κ and

easily evaluated by taking a derivative of the integrated thermal expansion 6 α t 1 l d l t d t tables 1 and 2 show the td material properties coefficients for eqs 3 and 4 in case that the material properties are temperature independent tid the properties are evaluated at reference temperature t 0 293 k 3 methodology 3 1 equation of motion since the loading and boundary conditions of the annular circular plate are axisymmetric the thermoelastic response of plate is axisymmetric hence according to the axisymmetric fsdt framework the radial u and transverse displacement w components of plate are given as 7 u r z t u 0 r t z ϕ r r t w r t z w 0 r t where the u 0 w 0 are the radial and transverse displacements of any point on the midplane while ϕ r represents the transverse normal rotation about θ axis in order to account for von kármán geometrical nonlinearity the nonlinear strain displacement kinematic relation in polar coordinates may be written as 8 ε r r u r 1 2 w r 2 ε θ θ 1 r u γ

therefore it is quite difficult to provide analytical solution due to the complexity hence in this study the generalized differential quadrature method gdqm a strong numerical method is adopted to discretize the set of governing equation eq 19 and respective boundary conditions eq 20 21 the capability of gdqm in dealing with highly nonlinear differential equations is shown in kiani and eslami 2014 javani et al 2019 babaee et al 2018 keleshteri and jelovica 2020 liang et al 2019b lianget al 2019 for brevity the details of gdqm approach and mesh grids are discussed in appendix a by applying gdqm into the eqs 19 21 the set of governing equations will take the following form 22 k 11 x t k 12 x t k 13 x t k 21 x t k 22 x t k 23 x t k 31 x t k 32 x t k 33 x t 3 n r 3 n r x 3 n r 1 f t 3 n r 1 where k i j t x is the stiffness matrix which is dependent on the temperature and displacement vector x and n r is the number of grid points in radial direction the set of highly nonlinear algebraic equations eq 22 can be solved via an iterative algorithm using well known newton raphson scheme reddy 2014 3 2 heat conduction equation the temporal evolution of the temperature distribution in annular circular fgm plate subjected to the rapid cooling can be evaluated using transient heat conduction equation neglecting the heat generated within the body the transient heat conduction equation may be written in the form of hetnarski et al 2009 23 κ z t t i i ρ z t c v z t t it is assumed that the temperature profile only varies across the plate thickness i z since the material heterogeneity is considered to be through the thickness and thermal loading is applied on the entire top surface to obtain the temperature profile the heat equation eq 23 should be solved along with the initial and boundary conditions it is assumed that the bottom surface carbon steel is either insulated or experiences prescribed temperature while the upper surface stainless steel is exposed to a time dependent rapid temperature drop or a heat flux reduction rapid cooling mathematically these conditions are described as follows 24 c a s e 1 t h 2 t t t h t t h 2 t t b h t c a s e 2 t h 2 t t t h t t z h 2 t 0 i n s u l a t e d c a s e 3 k h 2 t t z h 2 t q h t t z h 2 t 0 i n s u l a t e d i n i t i a l c o n d i t i o n t z 0 t 0 where h t is the ramp function which becomes unity at t 0 001 s t t and t b are the temperatures at the top and bottom plate surface 25 h t t 0 001 t 0 001 s 1 t 0 001 s analytical solution of the eq 23 may not be possible due to the fact that the material properties κ and c v strongly depend on the temperature while temperature itself is unknown and is going to be evaluated in eq 23 therefore with the aid of gdqm the spatial domain can be discretized and the equation will be converted into the matrix form as follows 26 c t t n z n z t n z k t t n z n z t n z f t t n z where n z is the node number in the thickness direction according to the procedure proposed in ref reddy 2014 the alpha family time approximation method crank nicolson scheme has been employed for time domain discretization it is to be noted that since material properties are temperature dependent at each time step first material properties should be evaluated at reference temperature t 0 and then temperature distribution should be calculated using eq 26 andeq 24 the material properties need to be updated with the obtained temperature and consequently eq 26 should be resolved at each time step this iterative procedure should be repeated until the temperature value obtained from eq 26 converges to a certain value 4 results and discussion in this section the proposed methodology is implemented into the matlab ver r2020a to investigate the transient thermoelastic response of the annular circular plate under cryogenic rapid thermal load hereinafter the w is the maximum lateral mid plane deflection at r 0 and r r i r o 2 for solid circular and annular plates respectively the temperature t is obtained at the mid section z 0 for all numerical results the maximum radial and hoop stresses are denoted by the σ r r and σ θ θ and are obtained at top face z h 2 and inner edge r r i for convention for example m c i m s s means that the inner edge is movable clamped and the outer edge is immovable simply supported for the sake of numerical implementation the inner radius of solid circular plate is chosen to be r i 10 8 m the choice of geometry considered in examples is motivated by typical structural dimensions in marine vessels where plate thickness is commonly in range from 5 m m to 20 m m while the span between supports stiffeners frames decks is from 500 m m to 3000 m m moreover manholes small hatch covers and small openings can have radius from 50 m m to 1000 m m 4 1 validation to validate the proposed formulation and respective results three comparative examples are presented in this section using available literature and fem abaqus package ver 6 22 corp 2018 as mentioned above according to the literature review there is no similar work on thermoelastic response of fgm plate at low and cryogenic temperatures therefore for validation case 1 and 2 present methodology has been compared with high temperature thermal loading results reported in refs kiani and eslami 2014 javani et al 2019 for validation case 3 however cryogenic lateral thermal load is considered and the results are compared with fem abaqus based on axisymmetric plate model linear element cax4t with four nodes is used and coupled temperature displacement formulation is employed mesh consists of 60 elements through the thickness and 100 elements along the half span between r i to r o this mesh is sufficient according to the preliminary mesh convergence study for all validation cases both td and tid assumptions have been considered 4 1 1 validation case 1 2 high temperature plate is made of ceramic silicon nitride s i 3 n 4 which undergoes lateral high temperature thermal load immovable simply supported boundary condition is used case 1 is a solid circular plate with 6 m m thickness and 80 m m radius obtained from ref kiani and eslami 2014 case 2 is an annular plate with 5 m m thickness 20 and 100 m m inner and outer radius respectively following ref javani et al 2019 the top surface of solid circular and annular plate is exposed to the step load of t t 600 k and 700 k respectively the maximum deflection w versus time is shown in fig 2 revealing very good agreement between current study and the literature 4 1 2 validation case 3 cryogenic and low temperature a solid circular and annular plate are considered made of s u s 304 with i m s s boundary condition subjected to cryogenic rapid thermal load on the upper face the plate is initially at t 293 k and the top surface suddenly drops to t t 93 k we consider this temperature drop throughout the study as a generalization of the thermal load in case of other cryogenic liquids the geometrical characteristics of the solid annular plate are h 5 m m r i 20 m m and r o 100 m m fig 3 shows the transient temperature at the mid plane and plate maximum deflections according to fig 3 the present results correlate very well with the fem abaqus as it can be seen from the fig 2 the plate under high temperature thermal load gradually displaces upward until it reaches the steady solution however in the fig 3 the plate under cryogenic rapid thermal loading rapidly displaces downward until it reaches the maximum value and then deflections reverse and the plate converges to the steady state therefore for case 1 thermal boundary condition the thermoelastic behavior of the plate under low temperature environment qualitatively differs from the high temperatures 4 1 3 remarks on coupling and inertia effects the thermoelastic coupling effect is function of rapidity of cooling heating load application boley and weiner 1960 according to the boley the rapidity of cooling heating application can be represented by t 0 input time here we can refer to this as the time step this time must be compared with two other time characteristics of the system namely the characteristic mechanical time t m and the characteristic thermal time t t t m l v e t t h 2 k 26 where l v e h and k are effective length dilatational wave speed thickness and thermal diffusivity the velocity of propagation of dilatational wave in an elastic medium is 27 v e λ 2 μ ρ where λ and μ are lame constants and ρ is density it is permissible to employ uncoupled thermoelastic formulations if the inequality conditions in below are satisfied 28 t t t m 29 t 0 t m all the subsequent results have met the inequality conditions eqs 28 and 29 in addition we can see that the results using uncoupled approach in this study matches well with the coupled temperature displacement analysis in abaqus fig 3 providing further justification for the uncoupled sequentially coupled approach the results from fig 3 show that the uncoupled thermoelasticity formulation taken in this study is sufficient to describe the plate response since the difference to fem which uses coupled thermoelastic approach is negligible in case of applying cryogenic load in a shock form and depending on the plate thickness and other parameters the responses may be in form of thermally induced vibrations hetnarski et al 2009 boley 1956 boley has quantified this effect with an inertia parameter b t m t where t m is the thermal characteristics time and t is the first natural period boley and weiner 1960 boley 1956 with the loading scenario considered in the current study this effect does not exist 4 2 parametric studies 4 2 1 effect of temperature dependency fig 3 demonstrates that tid assumption can lead to overestimation of lateral deflections and through the thickness temperature both temperature and deflection are lower when considering td properties which is opposite to high temperature thermal loading kiani and eslami 2014 javani et al 2019 as it is shown in fig 2 td assumption in high temperature case results in larger deflections these results however are influenced by properties of the considered materials and might be different for other materials the tid assumption is conservative but far from reality therefore only td results are presented in continuation 4 2 2 the effect of thermal boundary conditions fig 4 presents the influence of thermal boundary condition on thermoelastic response of the annular plate the details of each boundary condition case have been provided in the eq 24 section 3 2 for the case 1 and 2 the top face is exposed to prescribed temperature t t 93 h t k where h t is a ramp function as defined in eq 25 for the case 3 the top surface experiences the prescribed heat flux with the amount of q 10 6 h t w m 2 fig 4 demonstrates that the plates with case 1 and 2 thermal boundary conditions are initially showing similar trend in temperature deflection and both radial and hoop stress after about 1 s the response curves deviate from each other due to the insulated bottom surface in case 2 the temperature value at the insulated bottom surface changes to fulfill the zero heat flux condition it is worth noting that the maximum deflections for both case 1 and 2 are identical while the respective steady state deflections are different likewise the primary peak values related to the radial and hoop stresses are identical for both case 1 and 2 while as time passes the stresses diverge from each other based on fig 4 radial stress for case 2 is greater than for case 1 while in case of hoop stress it is the opposite generally the induced hoop stress is greater than radial stress for the discussed cases case 3 boundary condition causes quite a different response than the other two cases as the temperature distribution for this case is different than the others the maximum lateral deflection occurs later for case 3 compared with case 1 and 2 since the rate of temperature change for this case is smaller we can decompose radial and hoop stresses components into mechanical and thermal parts according to the eq 10 the thermal part of radial and hoop stresses is very similar it increases from zero stress free condition until it reaches the maximum and then drops down dome like shape the mechanical part of radial stress time history is similar to the maximum lateral deflection behavior as its absolute value increases up to a certain time and then decreases to a value near zero the summation of thermal and mechanical parts would form the total radial hoop stress the radial and hoop stress at t 5 s is not zero it is close to zero for the presented time duration and it will change as time continues 4 2 3 effect of plate geometry the influence of thickness on the maximum lateral deflection w of annular plate subjected to the cryogenic rapid cooling is presented in fig 5 as it can be seen once the upper face experiences the cryogenic thermal load the plate rapidly displaces downwards after the extreme displacement is reached deflections reverse and the plate converges to the steady state this behavior is regularly repeating for all annular circular plates in the current study according to fig 5 increase of the thickness leads to a decrease of the maximum lateral deflection the reason is that thicker plates have higher stiffness and therefore they have smaller deflection in comparison with their counterparts furthermore thin plates reach steady state solution faster than thick plates this is because thin plates cool down faster resulting in lower temperature gradient through the thickness fig 6 presents the influence of inner radius r i on the maximum lateral deflection w as it can be seen inner radius does not affect the steady state solution and all plates converge to the same value the steady state solution attains near zero value since the case 2 boundary condition is considered insulated bottom surface where the through the thickness temperature gradient is minimal it is to be noted that based on fig 6 when r i decreases the maximum lateral deflection increases according to fig 7 outer radius r o has a significant influence on the maximum lateral deflection w of the plate it can be seen that the plates with larger span larger r o have larger deflection this behavior is originating from the fact that larger r o generates larger thermal induced stress resultants n t and m t and consequently the lateral deflection becomes larger furthermore as seen in figs 5 7 all cases eventually approach the steady state solution with time the trend of the deflection curves in figs 4 7 highlights the importance of transient thermoelastic analysis carried out in the current study compared with static steady state type of analysis in a fraction of a second the deflection suddenly increases and reaches a peak while the final state is attained at a much later stage therefore static steady state solution significantly underestimates the displacements and is unreliable 4 2 4 the effect of material distribution material distribution has an important effect on the thermoelastic behavior of a plate as ξ increases from 0 to the material changes from a i s i 1020 carbon steel to s u s 304 stainless steel respectively according to fig 8 the plate made of s u s 304 steel ξ 0 has larger deflection and radial stress than plates made with smaller s u s 304 steel volume fraction ξ 0 this means that adding more a i s i 1020 carbon steel into the s u s 304 phase will reduce the thermal stress and transverse deflection which is good achievement on the other hand a i s i 1020 steel is a brittle material and not suited for exposure to cryogenic temperatures on the top face nonetheless due to its relatively low price it is rational in some applications to incorporate it to a semi brittle fgm medium containing both a i s i 1020 and s u s 304 the rapid cryogenic thermal load could generate high stresses which can endanger structural integrity we can see from eq 10 that both mechanical and thermal stresses are contributing factors in the radial stress at the top face the thermal stress behaves as a step function which causes instantaneous primary peak in the radial stress once the thermal load is applied the mechanical part of the radial stress starts increasing from zero value until it reaches its maximum compressive value later it reverses towards tensile stress until it becomes steady the summation of thermal and mechanical parts of radial stress explains the secondary peak in the radial stress time history it can be seen from fig 8 b that the plate composed of pure s u s 304 steel produces greater radial stress than other material compositions 4 2 5 the effect of mechanical boundary conditions fig 9 shows that the mechanical supports have a significant influence on the thermoelastic response of the plate subjected to the cryogenic thermal load boundary condition with higher kinematical restraint axial and rotational allows smaller transverse deflection since the plate can more easily resist the thermal bending moment induced by the cryogenic thermal load for example the highest deflection is obtained for m s s m s s boundary condition since the boundary can both rotate and displace axially radial and hoop stress are significantly affected by the mechanical boundary conditions radial stress for the m s s m s s and i m s s i m s s instantly reaches maximum value and then gradually decays over time while for m c m s s and i m c i m s s it takes some time to reach the maximum value there is a considerable difference in the stress level magnitudes for various boundary supports therefore it is important to consider an appropriate boundary condition in this type of analysis 4 2 6 the effect of geometrical nonlinearity geometrical nonlinearity typically becomes important when deflections increase beyond 30 of plate thickness ventsel and krauthammer 2001 to better elaborate on the geometrical nonlinearity effect we have considered two different examples circular and annular plates in fig 10 for each example the plates have the same geometry material properties thermal and mechanical boundary conditions but one with linear and the other nonlinear geometrical assumption as fig 10 shows the response is not accurate for the example 1 when only linear assumption is employed as there is about 15 difference between linear and nonlinear solutions in this case the maximum deflection to thickness ratio w h is near 50 and therefore we could expect that linear assumption is not accurate on the other hand example 2 shows only 2 difference between linear and nonlinear solutions as maximum deflection to thickness ratio w h is only about 12 we can see that the linear assumption overestimates the deflection as the ratio of maximum deflection to the thickness gets larger the difference between linear and nonlinear geometrical solutions becomes larger as well therefore it is important to consider the von karman assumption as in some of the considered cases w h ratio is near 50 5 conclusion present paper investigates for the first time thermoelastic response of fgm solid circular annular plate under sudden cryogenic cooling the plate undergoes cooling on the upper face having kinematic boundary conditions at the edges this loading scenario aims to provide better understanding of the response of plates in ships that transport lng or use it as fuel the geometrical nonlinearities are considered through von kármán assumption the semi brittle fgm composed of stainless steel s u s 304 and low carbon steel a i s i 1020 is functionally graded through the thickness the thermomechanical properties are temperature dependent based on the fsdt framework the governing equations and associated boundary conditions are derived the gdqm and newton raphson method are employed to solve the governing equations the fourier type heat conduction equation is solved using gdqm and crank nicolson scheme to obtain temperature profile the comprehensive parametric study has been carried out to study the effect of different parameters on the thermoelastic response of plates under rapid cryogenic thermal load the present results are quite general and can be extended to the other types of structures and may be useful for further investigation in the field of thermoelectricity of solid structures in cryogenic and low temperatures as we show in this paper the plate in exposure of cryogenic temperature can exhibit significant nonlinear bending response before reaching steady state high stresses can be developed which can potentially endanger the safety of the structure depending on the type of thermal boundary condition the transient thermoelastic response of plate under cryogenic thermal load qualitatively differs from the high temperature load for example for high temperature loading with case 1 boundary condition the maximum lateral deflection is obtained with steady state solution while for cryogenic temperature loading it appears before the steady state as shown in this paper however this difference depends on the thermal boundary conditions for case 2 thermal boundary condition the maximum radial stress would occur later in the response near the steady state solution even for cryogenic thermal loading therefore transient analysis in the low temperature thermal loading is important for certain boundary conditions in case thermal load is applied as a shock and plates are slender inertia effect might become important and the solution could exhibit thermally induced vibrations however this requires deeper investigation and should be considered in future furthermore the induced thermal stresses could potentially lead to fracture which should also be considered in future nonetheless the proposed material distribution in this study could reduce the risk of fracture due

20926,the existing studies have been primarily focused on the lateral behavior of large diameter stubby pile or small diameter slender pile in sand with little attention paid to large diameter slender pile this study presents a unique series of centrifuge tests on monotonic and cyclic lateral behavior of heavily instrumented large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand two typical length to diameter ratios l d are considered with the same length l 60 m but different diameters d 4 and 6 m it is found that the lateral behaviors of large diameter slender pile including its monotonic p y response cyclic accumulation of lateral displacement and cyclic stiffness evolution are marginally different from those of small diameter slender piles but significantly deviate from the large diameter stubby piles this may suggest the longstanding argument of diameter effect is relatively minor while the lateral behavior of monopile in sand is more significantly governed by the relative pile soil stiffness the api 2011 non conservatively predicts both stiffness and capacity of the large diameter slender piles leading to development of a new p y formulation these centrifuge testing

recent decades kaynia 2019 the ewea 2020 up to 2018 more than 20 gw offshore wind turbines have been installed worldwide and more than 520 gw of total installed capacity is anticipated by 2050 cohen 2019 one key factor that would limit the economic development of offshore wind turbines lies in the foundation which takes up to 30 40 of the total project cost byrne and houlsby 2003 sun et al 2012 of all different foundation types the monopile originating from the laterally loaded single pile in oil and gas industry is the most widely adopted for its relatively low fabrication and installation cost doherty and gavin 2012 wang et al 2018 by 2018 more than 81 of 5258 installed offshore wind turbines in european countries are supported by the monopile foundations the ewea 2020 the design of laterally loaded monopile principally considers two aspects a the ultimate lateral capacity which aims to avoid collapse in an extreme loading event b cyclic stiffness degradation which affects repeated accumulation of pile deformation and therefore fatigue damage within the pile and the turbine structure jeng 2001 liu et al 2015 markou and kaynia 2018 wang et al 2020 the lateral behavior of monopile in sand may be potentially affected by pile diameter d sørensen 2012 doherty and gavin 2012 or the ratio of pile embedment length over diameter l d li et al 2017 thieken et al 2015 hong et al

kim 2015 zhu et al 2016 qi et al 2016 and wang et al 2019 these studies mainly focus on the behavior of small diameter slender piles typically with d 3 m and l d 20 and large diameter stubby piles typically with d 4 m and l d 8 as illustrated in fig 1 gilbert et al 2018 truong et al 2018 the former pile is usually designed for foundations that support jacket foundations while the latter pile is mainly for foundations supporting offshore wind turbines in relatively stiff seabed e g dense sand or stiff clay as frequently encountered in the north sea byrne et al 2015 in addition to the two afore mentioned types of piles there has been emerging a new pile type with a unique geometrical form typically with d 4 m and l d 10 i e large diameter slender pile this type of pile has been widely used for offshore wind sites with presence of relatively soft seabed e g medium dense sand or soft clay along with typhoon loadings such as offshore china to ensure sufficient lateral resistance lai et al 2019 at the same time turbines of up to 15 mw with rotor diameters of up to 230 m are expected to be installed in the future around the world these giant turbines are anticipated to be supported by large diameter slender pile to ensure sufficient foundation stiffness and resistance steelwind nordenham 2020 in addition to the offshore wind farm the large diameter slender pile can also be used as breasting and mooring dolphins for berthing or mooring a vessel winkel 2016 since the geometries of the large diameter slender pile fall significantly beyond the parameter space of all the existing studies questions arise concerning its monotonic p y response cyclic characteristics including deformation accumulation and stiffness degradation this research gap has necessitated high quality experiments that offer fresh insights into the lateral behavior of large diameter slender pile for supporting the development of a vast number of wind farms being planned along offshore china in light of these discussions this study presents a unique series of centrifuge model tests simulating large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand subjected to monotonic and multi stage cyclic lateral loadings the tests were performed on two heavily instrumented monopiles with different diameters d 4 and 6 m in prototype but the same embedded depth l 60 m in prototype resulting l d of 15 and 10 respectively the experimental program was specifically designed to conform the likely conditions of monopiles in offshore china the measured results concerning the various monotonic and cyclic responses of the pile were interpreted and compared with those of the reported small diameter slender piles and large diameter stubby piles a new p y relationship is proposed to describe the lateral load transfer behavior of large diameter slender piles in sand 2 centrifuge modelling all of the centrifuge model tests reported in this study were carried out in the geotechnical centrifuge facility

monopile foundation existing study suggests that the drainage condition around the monopile is usually fully drained due to the high permeability of sand and low frequency of lateral loads lai et al 2019 klinkvort 2012 proved that tests performed using dry sand offer consistent results as compared to those performed in saturated sand under the same effective stress level therefore the centrifuge tests reported herein were all performed in dry sand at a centrifugal acceleration of 100g aiming to save the test preparation time and prevent the potential entry of water into the coating that protects strain gauges scaling factors for various physical quantities between the centrifuge model and the intended prototype relevant to these centrifuge tests are summarized in table 1 derivations for these scaling laws are given in taylor 1995 2 1 experimental program and objectives the unique geometric and geotechnical properties of monopiles practiced in offshore china are considered in this experimental program i e large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand a total of four series of centrifuge tests were carried out including monotonic and multi stage cyclic loading tests for two large diameter long slender monopiles the two piles have different diameters i e d 4 and 6 m in prototype but the same embedded length i e l 60 m leading to relative length over diameter ratios namely l d 15 and 10 two monotonic loading tests were performed first to investigate the lateral behavior of the larger diameter long slender piles these tests aim to a understand the lateral stiffness and capacity of large diameter long slender piles and to b examine the applicability of the existing p y models that were derived based on small diameter slender piles or large diameter stubby piles following the monotonic tests two series of multi stage load controlled cyclic loading tests were performed to investigate the long term cyclic response of the two large diameter slender monopiles the primary objectives of these tests are to a assess how do the cumulative rotation characteristics of these unique piles compared with that of the reported small diameter slender piles and larger diameter stubby piles and to b understand the evolution of cyclic lateral stiffness and bending moments including peak and lock in moment which determine the fatigue damage of the monopile details on the centrifuge test program in this study are summarized in table 2 to the authors best knowledge this work is the first to study the lateral behavior of large diameter slender piles d 4 m and l d 10 in sand while the previous work focused on lateral response of either large diameter stubby piles typically with d 4 m and l d 8 or small diameter slender piles typically with d 3 m and l d 20 2 2 centrifuge modelling package fig 2 a shows the plane view of the centrifuge model package all the dimensions are in prototype in meter except for numbers in parentheses which denote model scale in millimeter the model box has an internal plan area of 124 5 m by 124 5 m in prototype at a centrifugal acceleration of 100g which is sufficiently large to accommodate all the four tests as summarized in table 2 with minimum boundary effect the horizontal spacing between each two piles was designed to be no smaller than 8 d while the distance of the model pile to each boundary was no smaller than 6 d numerical ahmed and hawlader 2016 and experimental klinkvort 2012 kirkwood 2016 studies showed that the distance between the model piles and pile to the container boundary in this study is larger enough to eliminate any boundary effect fig 2 b presents the elevation view of the centrifuge model box the seabed has a thickness of 720 mm 72 m in prototype the model monopiles were prefixed with an aluminum frame to the target position and elevation before raining the sand into the model box the loading eccentricity in each test is 10 m in prototype above the ground surface for each test three linear variable differential transformers i e lvdts were installed at different heights to deduce the rotation and displacement at ground surface of each model pile the monotonic or cyclic load in each test was applied through a servo controlled hydraulic actuator the extension rod of the actuator was attached with a load cell to offer feedbacks to the closed loop system in the load controlled tests along with a lvdt to record the induced displacement at the loading height the hydraulic actuator was mounted on a rigid frame which can be moved to fit the location of four tested piles in this study the loading head pieces was curved to guarantee a point interaction between the lateral loading and the pile without any moment fig 2 c shows a photo illustrating the details of the pile head instrumented with lvdts while subjected to a lateral load 2 3 model pile and instrumentation the model piles in this study were fabricated from 750 mm long 7075 t6 aluminum alloy pipes the material has a compression yield strength of 572 mpa a tension yield strength of 503 mpa an elastic modulus of 71 7 gpa and a poison s ratio of 0 33 the wall thickness of each model pile was manufactured to be 2 mm so as to meet the equivalent section bending stiffness of typical monopile in offshore wind projects negro et al 2017 detail of the model piles and the corresponding prototype are summarized in table 3 fig 3 shows the typical model piles of two different diameters used in this study each model pile was instrumented with 27 levels of foil type strain gauges to measure the bending moment along the pile which form the basis for deriving the p y curve each level consists of four strain gauges that were arranged as a full wheatstone bridge aiming to minimize the temperature effect on the measured bending moment to protect the strain gauges each instrumented model pile was externally coated with a 1 mm thick epoxy with an elastic of 2 gpa the contribution of the epoxy coating on the bending stiffness of the pile has been taken into account as summarized in table 3 2 4 centrifuges model preparation and test procedure toyoura sand a standard testing material was used in all the experiments reported herein the sand consists of sub angular particles with a mean diameter d 50 of 0 17 mm and a uniformity coefficient uc of 1 7 its maximum and minimum void ratios are 0 977 and 0 597 respectively the critical state friction angle of the sand is 31 selected properties of the toyoura sand are summarized in table 4 ishihara 1993 the air pluvial deposition method was employed to prepare the model seabed before the preparation of the sand seabed the model piles were prefixed at their target position and elevated by a customized aluminum frame toyoura sand was then rained into the model box from a big sand hopper that was lifted by a crane at a constant falling height of 0 5 m above the rising surface of the sand the average relative density of the sand bed in this study is approximately 65 as summarized in table 2 after preparing the sandy seabed the aluminum frame that constrained the four model piles were dismantled this was followed by installation of the lateral loading system and the instrumentation i e lvdts for measuring lateral pile displacement the centrifuge model package was then transferred to the swinging platform and operated to the centrifugal acceleration of 100g in 10 steps with a constant increment of 10g for each upon reaching 100g a waiting period of 2 h was imposed to enable the stabilization of ground settlement before the commencement of each load controlled lateral pile test the loading condition for each test including amplitude and frequency is summarized in table 2 the monotonic tests were performed first on model piles p1 and p2 as shown in fig 2 a by displacement control at a loading rate of 0 1 mm s the loading rate is slow enough to eliminate any dynamic effect after the completion of the monotonic tests a series of load controlled cyclic tests were performed on model piles p3 and p4 as shown in fig 2 a with a period of 5 s for each loading cycle fig 4 a and b shows the measured episodes of cyclic loads in prototype applied to the monopiles with d 4 and 6 m respectively a total of five episodes of one cycling with increasing amplitudes 10 50 f u were applied to each monopile each loading episode consists of 1000 cycles of repeated loading at a constant amplitude it is evident that the servo controlled loading system has satisfactorily produced the designed multi stage cyclic loads for the two piles 2 5 post processing procedures to derive the p y curve according to the timoshenko beam theory the bending moment pile deflection and the soil reaction follow the relationships below 1 y φ d z d z m e i d z d z 2 p d 2 m d z 2 where y is the lateral deflection of monopile at depth z φ is the curvature of the monopile at depth z m is the bending moment at depth z ei is the section flexural modulus of the monopile and p is the soil reaction per unit length at depth z therefore the soil reaction p and the deflection y can be derived by double differentiation and double integration of the bending moment profile respectively following this theory the measured bending moment profile consisting of limited data points needed to be best fitted by a certain mathematic function in this study the 7th degree global polynomial approximation was adopted to fit the bending moment data following the common practice for deriving the p y curve of slender piles zhu et al 2016 haiderali and madabhushi 2016 in deriving the pile deflection profile additional boundary conditions are needed to determine the two integration constants that arise from the double integration of the bending moment profile the calculated rotation and deflection at the ground surface from the lvdts see fig 2 b were taken to serve as the purpose 3 beam on nonlinear winkler foundation model bnwf the p y method is the mostly adopted method for analysing the response of laterally loaded monopile in this method the monopile is modelled as a beam on nonlinear winkler foundation bnwf with the soil described by a serial of uncoupled nonlinear springs i e p y curves as shown in fig 5 according to the euler bernoulli beam theory the behavior of the bnwf model is governed by the following fourth order differential equation 3 e i d 4 y d z 4 p 0 where y lateral deflection of the monopile any give depth of z p soil reaction per unit length ei bending stiffness of the monopile to solve the fourth order differential equation of the bnwf model either finite difference method or finite element method can be used to discretize the soil monopile system in this study a beam spring model is built in the finite element program abaqus systèmes 2007 three dimensional beam elements b31 are adopted to model the monopile while the spring1 element in abaqus is used to model the nonlinear springs the nonlinear spring behavior is simulated by an external user defined file which contains pairs of force displacement relations calculated with any given p y model such as the one suggested by api 2011 4 lateral monotonic behavior of the large diameter slender piles in this and the subsequent sections all results are interpreted in prototype scale unless stated otherwise 4 1 monotonic load displacement response fig 6 shows the measured load deflection responses of the two monopiles with varying diameters d 4 and 6 m as illustrated each pile exhibited a continuous hardening response under the lateral loading with no apparent yielding point within the range of induced lateral displacement up to 0 14 d this trend is consistent with the behavior observed experimentally for laterally loaded monopiles by many other researches choo and kim 2015 kirkwood 2016 byrne et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 given the lack of yielding point for the load displacement curve a displacement based criterion that defines the monopile to yield at a threshold lateral displacement of 10 d byrne et al 2015 is employed to determine the lateral capacity f u of each pile the deduced lateral capacities of the piles with d 4 and 6 m are 25 mn and 77 mn respectively in the same figure the calculated load displacement curves based on bnwf model using the p y curve suggested by api 2011 are also presented for comparison it is seen that the current practice of api 2011 has led to an overestimation of the initial stiffness for the piles with d 4 and 6 m by 90 and 240 respectively this overestimation could be non conservative in the sense that it would drift the design for natural frequency of the wind turbine to the 1p limit that is susceptible to resonance and thus fatigue failure in addition the adoption of api 2011 has resulted in an overestimation of the lateral capacity deduced based on the 10 d criterion for the piles with d 4 and 6 m by 69 and 52 respectively 4 2 comparison of the p y curve between this study and the api 2011 to understand the difference between the measured and the calculated by api 2011 load displacement behavior p y curves were derived from the experiments at five typical depths and compared to those suggested by api 2011 as shown in fig 7 in the figure the deduced soil reaction p was normalized by the pile diameter d and vertical effect stress i e σ v at the corresponding depth while the lateral displacement y was normalized by the pile diameter d by doing so identical values of the initial slopes of the normalized p y curves at different depths mean the initial lateral stiffness k ini p y of these p y curves without normalization increases linearly with depth so does the ultimate lateral capacity p ult it is seen from fig 7 c that for each pile d 4 or 6 m the slope of the initial part k ini p yσ v of the experimentally deduced normalized p dσ v y d curves reduce with depth considering the vertical effective stress σ v increase linearly with depth the decrease of the initial slope with depth as shown in fig 7 c implies that the initial stiffness k ini does not increase linearly with depth instead it increases nonlinearly with depth at decreasing rate meanwhile as shown in fig 7 c for the two piles the experimentally deduced normalized p y curves at different depths tend to converge to the same ultimate value suggesting the normalized ultimate capacity p ult dσ v is insensitive to pile diameter this also means p ult of the two piles increases with depth at a constant rate these experimental observations are significantly different from the p y curves suggested by api 2011 where k ini value is assumed to increase linearly with depth while p ult value is assumed to increase nonlinearly with depth at an increasing rate quantitatively the p y curve suggested by api 2011 has overestimated the experimentally deduced initial stiffness by more than five times this explains its over prediction for the lateral pile head stiffness as shown in fig 6 and poor description of the p y curve as shown in fig 7 a and b 4 3 new p y formulation for large diameter slender monopile in view of the inadequacy of the api 2011 s p y curve to capture the behavior of large diameter slender piles as shown in figs 6 and 7 a new p y formulation is proposed based on the unique database on such piles reported herein following the routine practice the proposed p y curve consists of three parts the overall curve shape function the initial stiffness k ini and the ultimate soil resistance p ult it has been well recognized that the shape of p y curve in many occasions could be adequately captured by the following hyperbolic function georgiadis et al 1992 choo and kim 2015 klinkvort 2012 kirkwood 2016 zhu et al 2016 4 p y 1 k i n i y p u l t having selected the curve shape function the remaining issues are to formulate k ini and p ult in light of the experimental observations of large diameter slender piles the experimentally deduced distributions of k ini with depth along piles with d 4 and 6 m are shown in fig 8 the initial stiffness k ini is determined as the initial slope of the p y curves as shown in fig 7 c for comparison the deduced k ini distribution from experiments of large diameter stubby piles d 6 m l 31 42 8 m as reported by choo and kim 2015 is included in the figure in addition the figure also contains the calculated distributions of k ini suggested by api 2011 by klinkvort and hededal 2014 based on their large diameter stubby pile tests and by zhu et al 2016 based on their small diameter slender pile tests as illustrated the k ini distributions of the two piles with different d i e 4 and 6 m in this study fall within a narrow range which increase with depth but at a decreasing rate no obvious diameter effect on the k ini distributions is evident from the two centrifuge test results reported herein at each given depth the deduced k ini values of these large diameter slender piles are generally smaller than those of large diameter stubby piles choo and kim 2015 indeed choo and kim 2015 suggested a linear distribution of k ini with depth for the large diameter stubby piles compared to the measured k ini distributions in this experimental study api 2011 significantly overestimates the k ini values at all the depths klinkvort and hededal 2014 s equation derived based on large diameter stubby piles well captures the measured k ini values within the top 10 m but over predicts the measurement at greater depth comparatively zhu et al 2016 s equation proposed based on small diameter slender piles gives the best approximation for the measured distributions of k ini of the large diameter slender piles reported herein although it tends to slightly under predict the initial lateral stiffness at great depth the comparisons above appear to imply the value of k ini is more governed by pile rigidity but relatively insensitive to pile diameter based on the centrifuge test results reported herein the following exponent function is found to best describe the distribution of k ini for the large diameter slender piles 5 k i n i 350 σ v p a t m 0 7 where p atm is the atmospheric pressure fig 9 presents the distributions of ultimate soil pressure calculated by some commonly used approaches as proposed by api 2011 broms 1964 and zhang et al 2005 note that the test results of the two piles d 4 and 6 m reported herein in fig 7 c reveal the normalized ultimate capacity p ult dσ v is insensitive to pile diameter and the p ult value increases with depth at a constant rate the trends of calculated p ult distributions using the three approaches above are in line with these experimental observations except api 2011 s approach the p ult distributions proposed by broms 1964 and zhang et al 2005 were both attempted in conjunction with the readily determined curve shape function of p y eq 4 and non linear distribution function of k ini eq 5 it is found that the adoption of zhang et al 2005 s distribution function of p ult has led to better predictions for the load displacement responses of the two piles reported in this study evident in the following sub section thus the following equation proposed by zhang et al 2005 is employed to formulate distribution of p ult for large diameter slender piles 6 p u l t k p 2 γ z d where k p is the rankine s passive earth pressure coefficient γ is effective unit weight z is the depth and d is the pile diameter 4 4 validation of the proposed p y formulation for large diameter slender pile this sub section aims to verify the ability of proposed p y approach in predicting various observed lateral behavior of the large diameter slender piles including the load displacement relation and bending moment profile this was achieved by implementing the proposed p y formulations into the bnwf model built in abaqus wang et al 2020 fig 10 compares the measured and computed load displacement relations of the two large diameter slender piles d 4 and 6 m the computed results were obtained based on three sets of p y formulations as proposed by this study by zhu et al 2016 and by klinkvort and hededal 2014 among the three sets of selected p y formulations the one proposed in this study yields the best predictions for both the initial stiffness and the lateral capacity i e lateral load at 10 d of the two piles with different diameters the p y formulation proposed based on small diameter slender piles zhu et al 2016 offers closer approximation to the measured results than that proposed on the basis of large diameter stubby piles klinkvort and hededal 2014 this may suggest that the lateral behavior of monopile is more dependent on the relatively pile soil stiffness than the pile diameter the predictive capabilities of the three sets of p y formulations as used in fig 10 for the measured bending moment profiles along the two large diameter slender piles at typical loading stages are evaluated as shown in fig 11 despite the different formulations adopted in the three p y approaches they all predict quite similar bending moment profiles for the two piles at different loading stages which show reasonable agreements with the measured data it has been recognized that the bending moment profile of laterally loaded pile is not sensitive to the variable p y curves hetenyi 1946 barton et al 1983 augustesen et al 2009 compared with the bending moment profile the stiffness and capacity of laterally loaded pile however are significantly affected by the p y curves it is evident from figs 6 and 10 that the p y curves suggested by api 2011 and klinkvort and hededal 2014 lead to non conservative predictions for the lateral pile stiffness and capacity while the p y curves proposed by zhu et al 2016 and this study appear to result in more satisfactory predictions it is worth noting that the p y curves of zhu et al 2016 and this study were deduced from lateral loading tests on small diameter slender piles and large diameter slender piles respectively the similarity between the two may suggest the lateral behavior of pile is more dependent on relative soil pile stiffness rather than pile diameter it is also inferred by the two figures that the laterally loaded large diameter slender pile behaves more similarly to small diameter slender piles than the large diameter stubby piles in other words the lateral behavior of monopile is more dependent on the relatively pile soil stiffness than the pile diameter 5 lateral cyclic behavior of the large diameter slender piles 5 1 cumulative behavior of lateral displacement and rotation fig 12 a and b presents the measured cumulative lateral displacement and rotation with number of loading cycles in a typical large diameter slender pile d 6 m respectively it is seen that both the displacement and rotation accumulate with loading cycles but at a decreasing rate exhibiting a shakedown behavior for all the cyclic amplitudes applied up to 50 f u despite the progressively stabilized response of the pile under each episode of cycling the cumulative rotation remains to be a major concern the allowable rotation limit 0 25 as specified by dnv gl 2014 only holds for the smallest cyclic amplitude 10 f u fig 13 a b show respectively the normalized cumulative lateral displacement and rotation with number of loading cycles in a typical large diameter slender pile d 6 m in the figure each measured displacement or rotation at an arbitrary n th cycle is normalized with that induced by the 1st cycle for a given load episode the physical quantities in both x axis and y axis of the figure are presented in log scale it is seen that both the normalized lateral displacement and rotation increases with the log scaled number of loading cycles in an approximately linear form similar observations have also been made by leblanc et al 2010 klinkvort 2012 kirkwood 2016 and truong et al 2018 based on their model tests simulating laterally loaded piles in sand to quantify the rate of cyclic accumulation for a given pile it is a routine practice to fit the relationships in fig 13 a b with the power functions below truong et al 2018 7 l o g y n y 1 α y l o g n 8 l o g θ n θ 1 α θ l o g n where y 1 and y n denote cumulative lateral deflection at the 1st and the n th cycle of a given loading episode respectively θ 1 and θ n denote cumulative rotation at the 1st and the n th cycle of a given loading episode respectively α y and α θ are cyclic accumulation indices that gauge the rate of cumulative lateral displacement and rotation with number of cycles these two cyclic accumulation indices i e α y and α θ serve as the basis to compare the cyclic cumulative behavior of the large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand as reported herein with the existing relevant database for this purpose six sets of databases were collected based on the test results in this study and those reported elsewhere little and briaud 1988 rosquoët et al 2007 klinkvort and hededal 2013 li et al 2015 truong et al 2018 the tests involved in the six sets of databases were all related to cyclically loaded lateral piles in sand considering different values of relatively density of sand d r pile diameter d and relative pile soil stiffness e p i p e s l 4 as proposed by poulos and hull 1989 the relative soil pile stiffness can be quantified by a nondimensional coefficient e p i p e s l 4 e p i p e s and l denote the ﬂexural rigidity of the pile soil modulus and embedded depth of the pile respectively some key features of the tests involved in these databases are summarized in table 5 fig 14 a and b show the dependency of the cyclic accumulation index α y on pile diameter and relative soil pile stiffness respectively as shown in fig 14 a the cyclic accumulation index α y exhibits no clear dependency on the pile diameter for example strong divergence can be observed for the piles with diameter of approximately 4 m on the other hand the values of cyclic accumulation index α y can be better correlated to the relative soil pile stiffness e p i p e s l 4 as shown in fig 14 b for flexible piles e p i p e s l 4 0 0025 poulos and davis 1980 the cyclic accumulation index α y lies within a narrow range between 0 04 and 0 08 while α y of the stiff piles falls within a broader range between 0 08 and 0 19 fig 14 b also reveals that the α y values α y 0 04 0 07 of the large diameter slender piles reported herein are close to those α y 0 05 0 07 of the small diameter slender piles reported by rosquoët et al 2007 but much smaller than the α y values α y 0 08 0 22 of the large diameter stubby piles klinkvort and hededal 2013 li et al 2015 truong et al 2018 as far as the dependency of α y on d r is concerned see fig 14 c the α y values of flexible piles with either large diameter this study or small diameter rosquoët et al 2007 truong et al 2018 fall within a narrow range of 0 04 0 086 with no obvious dependency d r on the other hand the α y values of large diameter rigid piles rosquoët et al 2007 truong et al 2018 are more strongly dependent on d r i e less cyclic accumulation smaller α y for piles in denser sand larger α y this is probably attributed to the different failure mechanism between flexible and rigid piles the rigid piles experience rigid rotation under lateral loading with the soil resistance along the whole length mobilized when the mobilized soil resistance of flexible piles is concentrated at shallow depth with little mobilized at deep such that the former is more sensible to lateral soil resistance that increases with d r based on the readily collected database as shown in fig 14 it may be concluded that the cyclic accumulation index α y of piles in medium dense sand is mostly affected by relative pile soil stiffness while exhibit little dependency on pile diameter consequently the α y values of large diameter flexible piles are similar to those of small diameter flexible piles but differs significantly from those of large diameter stubby piles 5 2 evolution of dynamic foundation stiffness in addition to the cumulative deformation behavior another major concern for cyclically loaded monopile lies in dynamic foundation stiffness due to the dynamically sensitive nature of the wind turbine structure the dynamic foundation stiffness may be decomposed into lateral and rotation components it is evident analytically that the dynamic behavior of an offshore wind turbine structure is mainly governed by the rotational stiffness but is relatively insensitive to the lateral stiffness arany et al 2016 for example zania 2014 demonstrated that a 60 increase in rotational stiffness may lead to a 5 10 increase in the eigen frequency of a wind turbine structure therefore this sub section is focused on the interpretation of rotational stiffness which is calculated by taking the secant stiffness of each cycle of the moment rotation relationship fig 15 presents the development of rotational unloading stiffness with number of cycles in log scale for a typical large diameter flexible pile d 6 m subjected to the five loading episodes in the figure the rotational stiffness at each arbitrary n th cycle k θ n is normalized by that at the 1st cycle k θ 1 of the corresponding loading episode it is seen that the rational stiffness decreases with the increasing amplitude of cyclic loading as anticipated for each given cyclic amplitude however the rotational stiffness increases with the number of cycle in log scale following an approximately linear relationship because the stiffness of the sand around the pile is likely to increase as the constant amplitude cycling proceeds due to the densification of the sand the most significant stiffness increase occurs at the lowest amplitude of cycling 10 f u with a maximum percentage increase of approximately 150 this may shift an initially soft stiff designed wind turbine into the stiff zone with potential consequence of resonance of the structure these observed trends from test in sand differ from that in clay where the foundation stiffness decreases under constant amplitude cycling due to the soil stiffness reduction accompanied by the cumulative excess pore pressure hong et al 2017 lai et al 2019 to capture the evolution of unloading stiffness with loading cycles a logarithm function is usually adopted 9 k θ n k θ 1 1 μ ln n where k θ n and k θ 1 denote rotational stiffness at the 1st and the n th cycle of a given loading episode respectively μ is cyclic stiffness degradation index that characterizes the rate of rotational stiffness increase with number of cycles the deduced ranges of stiffness degradation index μ from the tests on the large diameter slender piles are illustrated in fig 16 accompanied with results from the published database on large diameter stubby piles leblanc et al 2010 klinkvort and hededal 2013 li et al 2015 and small diameter slender pile zhu et al 2016 the abscissa of the figure is the non dimensional relatively soil pile stiffness e p i p e s l 4 as defined by poulos and davis 1980 as shown in fig 16 the rotational stiffness shows little dependency on pile diameter with same range of 0 05 0 19 for the 4 m and 6 m diameter piles in this study on the other hand the values of rotational stiffness index μ are more governed by the relative soil pile stiffness e p i p e s l 4 it can be seen that for the flexible piles where e p i p e s l 4 0 0025 poulos and davis 1980 including the large diameter slender piles and the small diameter slender piles stiffness evolution indices μ similarly lie within the range between 0 05 and 0 19 while smaller stiffness evolution indices μ 0 02 and 0 07 are resulted in the large diameter stubby piles these observations may suggest that the cyclic stiffness evolution could be significantly affected by relative soil pile stiffness while the diameter effect is relatively minor in view of the scattered trends of the rotational stiffness data at different cyclic amplitude an attempt was made to generalize the trends by re plotting these data against the normalized residual rotation θ residual n θ residual 1 as shown in fig 17 the symbols θ residual n and θ residual 1 denote the residual rotations at the n th and the 1st cycle of a given pile under a corresponding loading episode respectively it can be seen that the normalized rotational stiffness k θ n k θ 1 of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m exhibits an approximately linear correlation to the normalized residual rotation θ residual n θ residual 1 irrespective of the cyclic amplitude this is probably because the residual pile rotation signifies the level of plastic soil strains developed around the pile which is related to the stiffness of the soil and thus the rotational stiffness of the pile the encouraging correlation between the two quantities as evident in fig 17 may have suggested an alternative way to quantify the evolution of pile stiffness through the cumulative residual deflection 5 3 development of peak and lock in bending moment the heavy instrumentation along each model pile has enabled a detailed examination of the development of peak moment and residual moments which jointly determines the fatigue damage that could have been accumulated in the pile during the multi stage cycling the residual moment is also alternatively defined as lock in moment kirkwood and haigh 2014 which refers to the bending moment being locked into the pile after unloading i e zero lateral load at the pile head fig 18 shows the development of peak and lock in bending moment profiles of a typical large diameter flexible pile d 6 m subjected to constant amplitude cycling 10 f u for clarity the figure only includes the measured data at three typical loading cycles namely the 1st 100th and 1000th cycles the calculated monotonic and cyclic bending moment profiles based on the p y approach suggested by api 2011 are also shown in the figure for comparison it can be seen that both the peak bending moment of the pile increases with number of loading cycles this is consistent with the observed increase in rotation of the pile during constant amplitude cycling see fig 12 b the api 2011 s p y approach is shown to underestimate the peak bending moment induced by the 1st loading cycle and the percentage increase of the peak bending moment during the subsequent cycling because the api 2011 s approach overestimates the stiffness of the p y response substantial lock in bending moment was induced after each unloading which can account for up to 40 of the peak bending moment developed during the preceding loading cycle the presence of lock in moment after unloading at zero lateral load is a consequence of plastic strains in the soil around the pile as signified by the measured residual lateral displacement and rotation fig 12 a and b the figure also shows that as the cycling proceeds the locations of maximum peak and lock in moments gradually move downward this implies a downward load transfer resulting from the cyclic degradation of soil resistance at shallow depth the difference between the maximum peak moment m p max and maximum lock in moments m l max which governs the fatigue of the monopile is further quantified by plotting the development of m l max m p max ratio during cycling at varying amplitudes as shown in fig 19 it is seen that at a given cycling number m l max m p max ratio generally increases with cyclic amplitude for each given cyclic amplitude the m l max m p max ratio increases almost linearly with number of cycles in log scale suggesting the lock in moment accumulates faster than the peak moment considering that the lock in bending moment is likely to be associated with the residual rotation of the pile attempts were also made to generalize the correlation between these two physically quantities in dimensionless forms by trial and error it is found that there exists a unique correlation between a dimensionless form involving lock in moment m l max n m p max n m l max 1 m p max 1 and the normalized residual rotation θ residual n θ residual 1 as illustrated in fig 20 it is worth noting that the fitted correlation shown in the figure is independent of pile diameter cyclic amplitude and number of cycles this may suggest the lock in moment is inherently related to the level of plastic soil strain around the pile which could be gauged by the residual rotation at the pile head 6 summary and conclusions this study presents a unique program of centrifuge model tests aiming to offer fresh insight into the lateral monotonic and cyclic behavior of large diameter slender piles d 4 m and l d 10 in medium dense sand particular emphasizes are placed on the comparative lateral behavior between the large diameter slender piles reported herein and those of the small diameter slender piles typically with d 3 m and l d 20 and large diameter stubby piles typically with d 4 m and l d 8 published in the literature interpretation of the centrifuge testing results has led to the following major conclusions 1 the monotonic p y load transfer behavior of the large diameter slender pile is marginally different from those of small diameter slender piles but significantly deviate from the large diameter stubby piles this may suggest the longstanding argument of diameter effect is indeed relatively minor while the lateral behavior of monopile in sand is more significantly affected by the relatively pile soil stiffness 2 the p y curve recommended by api 2011 tends to offer non conservative predictions for the large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand quantitatively api 2011 s p y curve has overestimated the initial stiffness and ultimate lateral capacity corresponding to a lateral head displacement of 10 d by 240 and 69 respectively a new p y relation with properly selected forms for initial stiffness and lateral capacity is therefore proposed to specifically capture the lateral load transfer behavior of large diameter slender piles validations have been made against the centrifuge testing results 3 the large diameter slender piles exhibit lower rates of cyclic displacement and rotation accumulation than those of the large diameter stubby piles but behave similarly as the small diameter slender piles in these regards this may suggest the cyclic behavior of laterally loaded piles in medium dense sand depends primarily on relative soil pile stiffness while the diameter effect is less dominating 4 substantial lock in bending moment was induced along the large diameter slender pile which can account for up to 40 of the peak bending moment developed within the same loading cycle the ratios between the lock in and peak moments which determine the fatigue damage cumulated along the pile exhibit a single trend of correlation with the normalized residual rotation at the pile head irrespective of pile diameter cyclic amplitude and number of cycles these centrifuge testing results form a unique database to support development of new design methods for large diameter slender piles and to verify advanced numerical analyses involving cyclic models which in turn would facilitate development of

20926,the existing studies have been primarily focused on the lateral behavior of large diameter stubby pile or small diameter slender pile in sand with little attention paid to large diameter slender pile this study presents a unique series of centrifuge tests on monotonic and cyclic lateral behavior of heavily instrumented large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand two typical length to diameter ratios l d are considered with the same length l 60 m but different diameters d 4 and 6 m it is found that the lateral behaviors of large diameter slender pile including its monotonic p y response cyclic accumulation of lateral displacement and cyclic stiffness evolution are marginally different from those of small diameter slender piles but significantly deviate from the large diameter stubby piles this may suggest the longstanding argument of diameter effect is relatively minor while the lateral behavior of monopile in sand is more significantly governed by the relative pile soil stiffness the api 2011 non conservatively predicts both stiffness and capacity of the large diameter slender piles leading to development of a new p y formulation these centrifuge testing results form a unique database to support development of new design methods for large diameter slender piles and to verify advanced numerical analyses involving cyclic models keywords centrifuge

recent decades kaynia 2019 the ewea 2020 up to 2018 more than 20 gw offshore wind turbines have been installed worldwide and more than 520 gw of total installed capacity is anticipated by 2050 cohen 2019 one key factor that would limit the economic development of offshore wind turbines lies in the foundation which takes up to 30 40 of the total project cost byrne and houlsby 2003 sun et al 2012 of all different foundation types the monopile originating from the laterally loaded single pile in oil and gas industry is the most widely adopted for its relatively low fabrication and installation cost doherty and gavin 2012 wang et al 2018 by 2018 more than 81 of 5258 installed offshore wind turbines in european countries are supported by the monopile foundations the ewea 2020 the design of laterally loaded monopile principally considers two aspects a the ultimate lateral capacity which aims to avoid collapse in an extreme loading event b cyclic stiffness degradation which affects repeated accumulation of pile deformation and therefore fatigue damage within the pile and the turbine structure jeng 2001 liu et al 2015 markou and kaynia 2018 wang et al 2020 the lateral behavior of monopile in sand may be potentially affected by pile diameter d sørensen 2012 doherty and gavin 2012 or the ratio of pile embedment length over diameter l d li et al 2017 thieken et al 2015 hong et al 2017 extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been performed to understand the monotonic and cyclic lateral behavior of piles klinkvort et al 2010 alderlieste 2011 leth 2013 choo and kim 2015 zhu et al 2016 qi et al 2016 and wang et al 2019 these studies mainly focus on the behavior of small diameter slender piles typically with d 3 m and l d 20 and large diameter stubby piles typically with d 4 m and l d 8 as illustrated in fig 1 gilbert et al 2018 truong et al 2018 the former pile is usually designed for foundations that support jacket foundations while the latter pile is mainly for foundations supporting offshore wind turbines in relatively stiff seabed e g dense sand or stiff clay as frequently encountered in the north sea byrne et al 2015 in addition to the two afore mentioned types of piles there has been emerging a new pile type with a unique geometrical form typically with d 4 m and l d 10 i e large diameter slender pile this type of pile has been widely used for offshore wind sites with presence of relatively soft seabed e g medium dense sand or soft clay along with typhoon loadings such as offshore china to ensure sufficient lateral resistance lai et al 2019 at the same time turbines of up to 15 mw with rotor diameters of up to 230 m are expected to be installed in the future around the world these giant turbines are anticipated to be supported by large diameter slender pile to ensure sufficient foundation stiffness and resistance steelwind nordenham 2020 in addition to the offshore wind farm the large diameter slender pile can also be used as breasting and mooring dolphins for berthing or mooring a vessel winkel 2016 since the geometries of the large diameter slender pile fall significantly beyond the parameter space of all the existing studies questions arise concerning its monotonic p y response cyclic characteristics including deformation accumulation and stiffness degradation this research gap has necessitated high quality experiments that offer fresh insights into the lateral behavior of large diameter slender pile for supporting the development of a vast number of wind farms being planned along offshore china in light of these discussions this study presents a unique series of centrifuge model tests simulating large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand subjected to monotonic and multi stage cyclic lateral loadings the tests were performed on two heavily instrumented monopiles with different diameters d 4 and 6 m in prototype but the same embedded depth l 60 m in prototype resulting l d of 15 and 10 respectively the experimental program was specifically designed to conform the likely conditions of monopiles in offshore china the measured results concerning the various monotonic and cyclic responses of the pile were interpreted and compared with those of the reported small diameter slender piles and large diameter stubby piles a new p y relationship is proposed to describe the lateral load transfer behavior of large diameter slender piles in sand 2 centrifuge modelling all of the centrifuge model tests reported in this study were carried out in the geotechnical centrifuge facility gcf at the hong kong university of science and technology hkust the beam centrifuge with a diameter of the rotating arm of 8 4 m has the maximum carrying capacity of 400g ton ng et al 2001 for the monopile foundation existing study suggests that the drainage condition around the monopile is usually fully drained due to the high permeability of sand and low frequency of lateral loads lai et al 2019 klinkvort 2012 proved that tests performed using dry sand offer consistent results as compared to those performed in saturated sand under the same effective stress level therefore the centrifuge tests reported herein were all performed in dry sand at a centrifugal acceleration of 100g aiming to save the test preparation time and prevent the potential entry of water into the coating that protects strain gauges scaling factors for various physical quantities between the centrifuge model and the intended prototype relevant to these centrifuge tests are summarized in table 1 derivations for these scaling laws are given in taylor 1995 2 1 experimental program and objectives the unique geometric and geotechnical properties of monopiles practiced in offshore china are considered in this experimental program i e large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand a total of four series of centrifuge tests were carried out including monotonic and multi stage cyclic loading tests for two large diameter long slender monopiles the two piles have different diameters i e d 4 and 6 m in prototype but the same embedded length i e l 60 m leading to relative length over diameter ratios namely l d 15 and 10 two monotonic loading tests were performed first to investigate the lateral behavior of the larger diameter long slender piles these tests aim to a understand the lateral stiffness and capacity of large diameter long slender piles and to b examine the applicability of the existing p y models that were derived based on small diameter slender piles or large diameter stubby piles following the monotonic tests two series of multi stage load controlled cyclic loading tests were performed to investigate the long term cyclic response of the two large diameter slender monopiles the primary objectives of these tests are to a assess how do the cumulative rotation characteristics of these unique piles compared with that of the reported small diameter slender piles and larger diameter stubby piles and to b understand the evolution of cyclic lateral stiffness and bending moments including peak and lock in moment which determine the fatigue damage of the monopile details on the centrifuge test program in this study are summarized in table 2 to the authors best knowledge this work is the first to study the lateral behavior of large diameter slender piles d 4 m and l d 10 in sand while the previous work focused on lateral response of either large diameter stubby piles typically with d 4 m and l d 8 or small diameter slender piles typically with d 3 m and l d 20 2 2 centrifuge modelling package fig 2 a shows the plane view of the centrifuge model package all the dimensions are in prototype in meter except for numbers in parentheses which denote model scale in millimeter the model box has an internal plan area of 124 5 m by 124 5 m in prototype at a centrifugal acceleration of 100g which is sufficiently large to accommodate all the four tests as summarized in table 2 with minimum boundary effect the horizontal spacing between each two piles was designed to be no smaller than 8 d while the distance of the model pile to each boundary was no smaller than 6 d numerical ahmed and hawlader 2016 and experimental klinkvort 2012 kirkwood 2016 studies showed that the distance between the model piles and pile to the container boundary in this study is larger enough to eliminate any boundary effect fig 2 b presents the elevation view of the centrifuge model box the seabed has a thickness of 720 mm 72 m in prototype the model monopiles were prefixed with an aluminum frame to the target position and elevation before raining the sand into the model box the loading eccentricity in each test is 10 m in prototype above the ground surface for each test three linear variable differential transformers i e lvdts were installed at different heights to deduce the rotation and displacement at ground surface of each model pile the monotonic or cyclic load in each test was applied through a servo controlled hydraulic actuator the extension rod of the actuator was attached with a load cell to offer feedbacks to the closed loop system in the load controlled tests along with a lvdt to record the induced displacement at the loading height the hydraulic actuator was mounted on a rigid frame which can be moved to fit the location of four tested piles in this study the loading head pieces was curved to guarantee a point interaction between the lateral loading and the pile without any moment fig 2 c shows a photo illustrating the details of the pile head instrumented with lvdts while subjected to a lateral load 2 3 model pile and instrumentation the model piles in this study were fabricated from 750 mm long 7075 t6 aluminum alloy pipes the material has a compression yield strength of 572 mpa a tension yield strength of 503 mpa an elastic modulus of 71 7 gpa and a poison s ratio of 0 33 the wall thickness of each model pile was manufactured to be 2 mm so as to meet the equivalent section bending stiffness of typical monopile in offshore wind projects negro et al 2017 detail of the model piles and the corresponding prototype are summarized in table 3 fig 3 shows the typical model piles of two different diameters used in this study each model pile was instrumented with 27 levels of foil type strain gauges to measure the bending moment along the pile which form the basis for deriving the p y curve each level consists of four strain gauges that were arranged as a full wheatstone bridge aiming to minimize the temperature effect on the measured bending moment to protect the strain gauges each instrumented model pile was externally coated with a 1 mm thick epoxy with an elastic of 2 gpa the contribution of the epoxy coating on the bending stiffness of the pile has been taken into account as summarized in table 3 2 4 centrifuges model preparation and test procedure toyoura sand a standard testing material was used in all the experiments reported herein the sand consists of sub angular particles with a mean diameter d 50 of 0 17 mm and a uniformity coefficient uc of 1 7 its maximum and minimum void ratios are 0 977 and 0 597 respectively the critical state friction angle of the sand is 31 selected properties of the toyoura sand are summarized in table 4 ishihara 1993 the air pluvial deposition method was employed to prepare the model seabed before the preparation of the sand seabed the model piles were prefixed at their target position and elevated by a customized aluminum frame toyoura sand was then rained into the model box from a big sand hopper that was lifted by a crane at a constant falling height of 0 5 m above the rising surface of the sand the average relative density of the sand bed in this study is approximately 65 as summarized in table 2 after preparing the sandy seabed the aluminum frame that constrained the four model piles were dismantled this was followed by installation of the lateral loading system and the instrumentation i e lvdts for measuring lateral pile displacement the centrifuge model package was then transferred to the swinging platform and operated to the centrifugal acceleration of 100g in 10 steps with a constant increment of 10g for each upon reaching 100g a waiting period of 2 h was imposed to enable the stabilization of ground settlement before the commencement of each load controlled lateral pile test the loading condition for each test including amplitude and frequency is summarized in table 2 the monotonic tests were performed first on model piles p1 and p2 as shown in fig 2 a by displacement control at a loading rate of 0 1 mm s the loading rate is slow enough to eliminate any dynamic effect after the completion of the monotonic tests a series of load controlled cyclic tests were performed on model piles p3 and p4 as shown in fig 2 a with a period of 5 s for each loading cycle fig 4 a and b shows the measured episodes of cyclic loads in prototype applied to the monopiles with d 4 and 6 m respectively a total of five episodes of one cycling with increasing amplitudes 10 50 f u were applied to each monopile each loading episode consists of 1000 cycles of repeated loading at a constant amplitude it is evident that the servo controlled loading system has satisfactorily produced the designed multi stage cyclic loads for the two piles 2 5 post processing procedures to derive the p y curve according to the timoshenko beam theory the bending moment pile deflection and the soil reaction follow the relationships below 1 y φ d z d z m e i d z d z 2 p d 2 m d z 2 where y is the lateral deflection of monopile at depth z φ is the curvature of the monopile at depth z m is the bending moment at depth z ei is the section flexural modulus of the monopile and p is the soil reaction per unit length at depth z therefore the soil reaction p and the deflection y can be derived by double differentiation and double integration of the bending moment profile respectively following this theory the measured bending moment profile consisting of limited data points needed to be best fitted by a certain mathematic function in this study the 7th degree global polynomial approximation was adopted to fit the bending moment data following the common practice for deriving the p y curve of slender piles zhu et al 2016 haiderali and madabhushi 2016 in deriving the pile deflection profile additional boundary conditions are needed to determine the two integration constants that arise from the double integration of the bending moment profile the calculated rotation and deflection at the ground surface from the lvdts see fig 2 b were taken to serve as the purpose 3 beam on nonlinear winkler foundation model bnwf the p y method is the mostly adopted method for analysing the response of laterally loaded monopile in this method the monopile is modelled as a beam on nonlinear winkler foundation bnwf with the soil described by a serial of uncoupled nonlinear springs i e p y curves as shown in fig 5 according to the euler bernoulli beam theory the behavior of the bnwf model is governed by the following fourth order differential equation 3 e i d 4 y d z 4 p 0 where y lateral deflection of the monopile any give depth of z p soil reaction per unit length ei bending stiffness of the monopile to solve the fourth order differential equation of the bnwf model either finite difference method or finite element method can be used to discretize the soil monopile system in this study a beam spring model is built in the finite element program abaqus systèmes 2007 three dimensional beam elements b31 are adopted to model the monopile while the spring1 element in abaqus is used to model the nonlinear springs the nonlinear spring behavior is simulated by an external user defined file which contains pairs of force displacement relations calculated with any given p y model such as the one suggested by api 2011 4 lateral monotonic behavior of the large diameter slender piles in this and the subsequent sections all results are interpreted in prototype scale unless stated otherwise 4 1 monotonic load displacement response fig 6 shows the measured load deflection responses of the two monopiles with varying diameters d 4 and 6 m as illustrated each pile exhibited a continuous hardening response under the lateral loading with no apparent yielding point within the range of induced lateral displacement up to 0 14 d this trend is consistent with the behavior observed experimentally for laterally loaded monopiles by many other researches choo and kim 2015 kirkwood 2016 byrne et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 given the lack of yielding point for the load displacement curve a displacement based criterion that defines the monopile to yield at a threshold lateral displacement of 10 d byrne et al 2015 is employed to determine the lateral capacity f u of each pile the deduced lateral capacities of the piles with d 4 and 6 m are 25 mn and 77 mn respectively in the same figure the calculated load displacement curves based on bnwf model using the p y curve suggested by api 2011 are also presented for comparison it is seen that the current practice of api 2011 has led to an overestimation of the initial stiffness for the piles with d 4 and 6 m by 90 and 240 respectively this overestimation could be non conservative in the sense that it would drift the design for natural frequency of the wind turbine to the 1p limit that is susceptible to resonance and thus fatigue failure in addition the adoption of api 2011 has resulted in an overestimation of the lateral capacity deduced based on the 10 d criterion for the piles with d 4 and 6 m by 69 and 52 respectively 4 2 comparison of the p y curve between this study and the api 2011 to understand the difference between the measured and the calculated by api 2011 load displacement behavior p y curves were derived from the experiments at five typical depths and compared to those suggested by api 2011 as shown in fig 7 in the figure the deduced soil reaction p was normalized by the pile diameter d and vertical effect stress i e σ v at the corresponding depth while the lateral displacement y was normalized by the pile diameter d by doing so identical values of the initial slopes of the normalized p y curves at different depths mean the initial lateral stiffness k ini p y of these p y curves without normalization increases linearly with depth so does the ultimate lateral capacity p ult it is seen from fig 7 c that for each pile d 4 or 6 m the slope of the initial part k ini p yσ v of the experimentally deduced normalized p dσ v y d curves reduce with depth considering the vertical effective stress σ v increase linearly with depth the decrease of the initial slope with depth as shown in fig 7 c implies that the initial stiffness k ini does not increase linearly with depth instead it increases nonlinearly with depth at decreasing rate meanwhile as shown in fig 7 c for the two piles the experimentally deduced normalized p y curves at different depths tend to converge to the same ultimate value suggesting the normalized ultimate capacity p ult dσ v is insensitive to pile diameter this also means p ult of the two piles increases with depth at a constant rate these experimental observations are significantly different from the p y curves suggested by api 2011 where k ini value is assumed to increase linearly with depth while p ult value is assumed to increase nonlinearly with depth at an increasing rate quantitatively the p y curve suggested by api 2011 has overestimated the experimentally deduced initial stiffness by more than five times this explains its over prediction for the lateral pile head stiffness as shown in fig 6 and poor description of the p y curve as shown in fig 7 a and b 4 3 new p y formulation for large diameter slender monopile in view of the inadequacy of the api 2011 s p y curve to capture the behavior of large diameter slender piles as shown in figs 6 and 7 a new p y formulation is proposed based on the unique database on such piles reported herein following the routine practice the proposed p y curve consists of three parts the overall curve shape function the initial stiffness k ini and the ultimate soil resistance p ult it has been well recognized that the shape of p y curve in many occasions could be adequately captured by the following hyperbolic function georgiadis et al 1992 choo and kim 2015 klinkvort 2012 kirkwood 2016 zhu et al 2016 4 p y 1 k i n i y p u l t having selected the curve shape function the remaining issues are to formulate k ini and p ult in light of the experimental observations of large diameter slender piles the experimentally deduced distributions of k ini with depth along piles with d 4 and 6 m are shown in fig 8 the initial stiffness k ini is determined as the initial slope of the p y curves as shown in fig 7 c for comparison the deduced k ini distribution from experiments of large diameter stubby piles d 6 m l 31 42 8 m as reported by choo and kim 2015 is included in the figure in addition the figure also contains the calculated distributions of k ini suggested by api 2011 by klinkvort and hededal 2014 based on their large diameter stubby pile tests and by zhu et al 2016 based on their small diameter slender pile tests as illustrated the k ini distributions of the two piles with different d i e 4 and 6 m in this study fall within a narrow range which increase with depth but at a decreasing rate no obvious diameter effect on the k ini distributions is evident from the two centrifuge test results reported herein at each given depth the deduced k ini values of these large diameter slender piles are generally smaller than those of large diameter stubby piles choo and kim 2015 indeed choo and kim 2015 suggested a linear distribution of k ini with depth for the large diameter stubby piles compared to the measured k ini distributions in this experimental study api 2011 significantly overestimates the k ini values at all the depths klinkvort and hededal 2014 s equation derived based on large diameter stubby piles well captures the measured k ini values within the top 10 m but over predicts the measurement at greater depth comparatively zhu et al 2016 s equation proposed based on small diameter slender piles gives the best approximation for the measured distributions of k ini of the large diameter slender piles reported herein although it tends to slightly under predict the initial lateral stiffness at great depth the comparisons above appear to imply the value of k ini is more governed by pile rigidity but relatively insensitive to pile diameter based on the centrifuge test results reported herein the following exponent function is found to best describe the distribution of k ini for the large diameter slender piles 5 k i n i 350 σ v p a t m 0 7 where p atm is the atmospheric pressure fig 9 presents the distributions of ultimate soil pressure calculated by some commonly used approaches as proposed by api 2011 broms 1964 and zhang et al 2005 note that the test results of the two piles d 4 and 6 m reported herein in fig 7 c reveal the normalized ultimate capacity p ult dσ v is insensitive to pile diameter and the p ult value increases with depth at a constant rate the trends of calculated p ult distributions using the three approaches above are in line with these experimental observations except api 2011 s approach the p ult distributions proposed by broms 1964 and zhang et al 2005 were both attempted in conjunction with the readily determined curve shape function of p y eq 4 and non linear distribution function of k ini eq 5 it is found that the adoption of zhang et al 2005 s distribution function of p ult has led to better predictions for the load displacement responses of the two piles reported in this study evident in the following sub section thus the following equation proposed by zhang et al 2005 is employed to formulate distribution of p ult for large diameter slender piles 6 p u l t k p 2 γ z d where k p is the rankine s passive earth pressure coefficient γ is effective unit weight z is the depth and d is the pile diameter 4 4 validation of the proposed p y formulation for large diameter slender pile this sub section aims to verify the ability of proposed p y approach in predicting various observed lateral behavior of the large diameter slender piles including the load displacement relation and bending moment profile this was achieved by implementing the proposed p y formulations into the bnwf model built in abaqus wang et al 2020 fig 10 compares the measured and computed load displacement relations of the two large diameter slender piles d 4 and 6 m the computed results were obtained based on three sets of p y formulations as proposed by this study by zhu et al 2016 and by klinkvort and hededal 2014 among the three sets of selected p y formulations the one proposed in this study yields the best predictions for both the initial stiffness and the lateral capacity i e lateral load at 10 d of the two piles with different diameters the p y formulation proposed based on small diameter slender piles zhu et al 2016 offers closer approximation to the measured results than that proposed on the basis of large diameter stubby piles klinkvort and hededal 2014 this may suggest that the lateral behavior of monopile is more dependent on the relatively pile soil stiffness than the pile diameter the predictive capabilities of the three sets of p y formulations as used in fig 10 for the measured bending moment profiles along the two large diameter slender piles at typical loading stages are evaluated as shown in fig 11 despite the different formulations adopted in the three p y approaches they all predict quite similar bending moment profiles for the two piles at different loading stages which show reasonable agreements with the measured data it has been recognized that the bending moment profile of laterally loaded pile is not sensitive to the variable p y curves hetenyi 1946 barton et al 1983 augustesen et al 2009 compared with the bending moment profile the stiffness and capacity of laterally loaded pile however are significantly affected by the p y curves it is evident from figs 6 and 10 that the p y curves suggested by api 2011 and klinkvort and hededal 2014 lead to non conservative predictions for the lateral pile stiffness and capacity while the p y curves proposed by zhu et al 2016 and this study appear to result in more satisfactory predictions it is worth noting that the p y curves of zhu et al 2016 and this study were deduced from lateral loading tests on small diameter slender piles and large diameter slender piles respectively the similarity between the two may suggest the lateral behavior of pile is more dependent on relative soil pile stiffness rather than pile diameter it is also inferred by the two figures that the laterally loaded large diameter slender pile behaves more similarly to small diameter slender piles than the large diameter stubby piles in other words the lateral behavior of monopile is more dependent on the relatively pile soil stiffness than the pile diameter 5 lateral cyclic behavior of the large diameter slender piles 5 1 cumulative behavior of lateral displacement and rotation fig 12 a and b presents the measured cumulative lateral displacement and rotation with number of loading cycles in a typical large diameter slender pile d 6 m respectively it is seen that both the displacement and rotation accumulate with loading cycles but at a decreasing rate exhibiting a shakedown behavior for all the cyclic amplitudes applied up to 50 f u despite the progressively stabilized response of the pile under each episode of cycling the cumulative rotation remains to be a major concern the allowable rotation limit 0 25 as specified by dnv gl 2014 only holds for the smallest cyclic amplitude 10 f u fig 13 a b show respectively the normalized cumulative lateral displacement and rotation with number of loading cycles in a typical large diameter slender pile d 6 m in the figure each measured displacement or rotation at an arbitrary n th cycle is normalized with that induced by the 1st cycle for a given load episode the physical quantities in both x axis and y axis of the figure are presented in log scale it is seen that both the normalized lateral displacement and rotation increases with the log scaled number of loading cycles in an approximately linear form similar observations have also been made by leblanc et al 2010 klinkvort 2012 kirkwood 2016 and truong et al 2018 based on their model tests simulating laterally loaded piles in sand to quantify the rate of cyclic accumulation for a given pile it is a routine practice to fit the relationships in fig 13 a b with the power functions below truong et al 2018 7 l o g y n y 1 α y l o g n 8 l o g θ n θ 1 α θ l o g n where y 1 and y n denote cumulative lateral deflection at the 1st and the n th cycle of a given loading episode respectively θ 1 and θ n denote cumulative rotation at the 1st and the n th cycle of a given loading episode respectively α y and α θ are cyclic accumulation indices that gauge the rate of cumulative lateral displacement and rotation with number of cycles these two cyclic accumulation indices i e α y and α θ serve as the basis to compare the cyclic cumulative behavior of the large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand as reported herein with the existing relevant database for this purpose six sets of databases were collected based on the test results in this study and those reported elsewhere little and briaud 1988 rosquoët et al 2007 klinkvort and hededal 2013 li et al 2015 truong et al 2018 the tests involved in the six sets of databases were all related to cyclically loaded lateral piles in sand considering different values of relatively density of sand d r pile diameter d and relative pile soil stiffness e p i p e s l 4 as proposed by poulos and hull 1989 the relative soil pile stiffness can be quantified by a nondimensional coefficient e p i p e s l 4 e p i p e s and l denote the ﬂexural rigidity of the pile soil modulus and embedded depth of the pile respectively some key features of the tests involved in these databases are summarized in table 5 fig 14 a and b show the dependency of the cyclic accumulation index α y on pile diameter and relative soil pile stiffness respectively as shown in fig 14 a the cyclic accumulation index α y exhibits no clear dependency on the pile diameter for example strong divergence can be observed for the piles with diameter of approximately 4 m on the other hand the values of cyclic accumulation index α y can be better correlated to the relative soil pile stiffness e p i p e s l 4 as shown in fig 14 b for flexible piles e p i p e s l 4 0 0025 poulos and davis 1980 the cyclic accumulation index α y lies within a narrow range between 0 04 and 0 08 while α y of the stiff piles falls within a broader range between 0 08 and 0 19 fig 14 b also reveals that the α y values α y 0 04 0 07 of the large diameter slender piles reported herein are close to those α y 0 05 0 07 of the small diameter slender piles reported by rosquoët et al 2007 but much smaller than the α y values α y 0 08 0 22 of the large diameter stubby piles klinkvort and hededal 2013 li et al 2015 truong et al 2018 as far as the dependency of α y on d r is concerned see fig 14 c the α y values of flexible piles with either large diameter this study or small diameter rosquoët et al 2007 truong et al 2018 fall within a narrow range of 0 04 0 086 with no obvious dependency d r on the other hand the α y values of large diameter rigid piles rosquoët et al 2007 truong et al 2018 are more strongly dependent on d r i e less cyclic accumulation smaller α y for piles in denser sand larger α y this is probably attributed to the different failure mechanism between flexible and rigid piles the rigid piles experience rigid rotation under lateral loading with the soil resistance along the whole length mobilized when the mobilized soil resistance of flexible piles is concentrated at shallow depth with little mobilized at deep such that the former is more sensible to lateral soil resistance that increases with d r based on the readily collected database as shown in fig 14 it may be concluded that the cyclic accumulation index α y of piles in medium dense sand is mostly affected by relative pile soil stiffness while exhibit little dependency on pile diameter consequently the α y values of large diameter flexible piles are similar to those of small diameter flexible piles but differs significantly from those of large diameter stubby piles 5 2 evolution of dynamic foundation stiffness in addition to the cumulative deformation behavior another major concern for cyclically loaded monopile lies in dynamic foundation stiffness due to the dynamically sensitive nature of the wind turbine structure the dynamic foundation stiffness may be decomposed into lateral and rotation components it is evident analytically that the dynamic behavior of an offshore wind turbine structure is mainly governed by the rotational stiffness but is relatively insensitive to the lateral stiffness arany et al 2016 for example zania 2014 demonstrated that a 60 increase in rotational stiffness may lead to a 5 10 increase in the eigen frequency of a wind turbine structure therefore this sub section is focused on the interpretation of rotational stiffness which is calculated by taking the secant stiffness of each cycle of the moment rotation relationship fig 15 presents the development of rotational unloading stiffness with number of cycles in log scale for a typical large diameter flexible pile d 6 m subjected to the five loading episodes in the figure the rotational stiffness at each arbitrary n th cycle k θ n is normalized by that at the 1st cycle k θ 1 of the corresponding loading episode it is seen that the rational stiffness decreases with the increasing amplitude of cyclic loading as anticipated for each given cyclic amplitude however the rotational stiffness increases with the number of cycle in log scale following an approximately linear relationship because the stiffness of the sand around the pile is likely to increase as the constant amplitude cycling proceeds due to the densification of the sand the most significant stiffness increase occurs at the lowest amplitude of cycling 10 f u with a maximum percentage increase of approximately 150 this may shift an initially soft stiff designed wind turbine into the stiff zone with potential consequence of resonance of the structure these observed trends from test in sand differ from that in clay where the foundation stiffness decreases under constant amplitude cycling due to the soil stiffness reduction accompanied by the cumulative excess pore pressure hong et al 2017 lai et al 2019 to capture the evolution of unloading stiffness with loading cycles a logarithm function is usually adopted 9 k θ n k θ 1 1 μ ln n where k θ n and k θ 1 denote rotational stiffness at the 1st and the n th cycle of a given loading episode respectively μ is cyclic stiffness degradation index that characterizes the rate of rotational stiffness increase with number of cycles the deduced ranges of stiffness degradation index μ from the tests on the large diameter slender piles are illustrated in fig 16 accompanied with results from the published database on large diameter stubby piles leblanc et al 2010 klinkvort and hededal 2013 li et al 2015 and small diameter slender pile zhu et al 2016 the abscissa of the figure is the non dimensional relatively soil pile stiffness e p i p e s l 4 as defined by poulos and davis 1980 as shown in fig 16 the rotational stiffness shows little dependency on pile diameter with same range of 0 05 0 19 for the 4 m and 6 m diameter piles in this study on the other hand the values of rotational stiffness index μ are more governed by the relative soil pile stiffness e p i p e s l 4 it can be seen that for the flexible piles where e p i p e s l 4 0 0025 poulos and davis 1980 including the large diameter slender piles and the small diameter slender piles stiffness evolution indices μ similarly lie within the range between 0 05 and 0 19 while smaller stiffness evolution indices μ 0 02 and 0 07 are resulted in the large diameter stubby piles these observations may suggest that the cyclic stiffness evolution could be significantly affected by relative soil pile stiffness while the diameter effect is relatively minor in view of the scattered trends of the rotational stiffness data at different cyclic amplitude an attempt was made to generalize the trends by re plotting these data against the normalized residual rotation θ residual n θ residual 1 as shown in fig 17 the symbols θ residual n and θ residual 1 denote the residual rotations at the n th and the 1st cycle of a given pile under a corresponding loading episode respectively it can be seen that the normalized rotational stiffness k θ n k θ 1 of the two monopiles d 4 and 6 m exhibits an approximately linear correlation to the normalized residual rotation θ residual n θ residual 1 irrespective of the cyclic amplitude this is probably because the residual pile rotation signifies the level of plastic soil strains developed around the pile which is related to the stiffness of the soil and thus the rotational stiffness of the pile the encouraging correlation between the two quantities as evident in fig 17 may have suggested an alternative way to quantify the evolution of pile stiffness through the cumulative residual deflection 5 3 development of peak and lock in bending moment the heavy instrumentation along each model pile has enabled a detailed examination of the development of peak moment and residual moments which jointly determines the fatigue damage that could have been accumulated in the pile during the multi stage cycling the residual moment is also alternatively defined as lock in moment kirkwood and haigh 2014 which refers to the bending moment being locked into the pile after unloading i e zero lateral load at the pile head fig 18 shows the development of peak and lock in bending moment profiles of a typical large diameter flexible pile d 6 m subjected to constant amplitude cycling 10 f u for clarity the figure only includes the measured data at three typical loading cycles namely the 1st 100th and 1000th cycles the calculated monotonic and cyclic bending moment profiles based on the p y approach suggested by api 2011 are also shown in the figure for comparison it can be seen that both the peak bending moment of the pile increases with number of loading cycles this is consistent with the observed increase in rotation of the pile during constant amplitude cycling see fig 12 b the api 2011 s p y approach is shown to underestimate the peak bending moment induced by the 1st loading cycle and the percentage increase of the peak bending moment during the subsequent cycling because the api 2011 s approach overestimates the stiffness of the p y response substantial lock in bending moment was induced after each unloading which can account for up to 40 of the peak bending moment developed during the preceding loading cycle the presence of lock in moment after unloading at zero lateral load is a consequence of plastic strains in the soil around the pile as signified by the measured residual lateral displacement and rotation fig 12 a and b the figure also shows that as the cycling proceeds the locations of maximum peak and lock in moments gradually move downward this implies a downward load transfer resulting from the cyclic degradation of soil resistance at shallow depth the difference between the maximum peak moment m p max and maximum lock in moments m l max which governs the fatigue of the monopile is further quantified by plotting the development of m l max m p max ratio during cycling at varying amplitudes as shown in fig 19 it is seen that at a given cycling number m l max m p max ratio generally increases with cyclic amplitude for each given cyclic amplitude the m l max m p max ratio increases almost linearly with number of cycles in log scale suggesting the lock in moment accumulates faster than the peak moment considering that the lock in bending moment is likely to be associated with the residual rotation of the pile attempts were also made to generalize the correlation between these two physically quantities in dimensionless forms by trial and error it is found that there exists a unique correlation between a dimensionless form involving lock in moment m l max n m p max n m l max 1 m p max 1 and the normalized residual rotation θ residual n θ residual 1 as illustrated in fig 20 it is worth noting that the fitted correlation shown in the figure is independent of pile diameter cyclic amplitude and number of cycles this may suggest the lock in moment is inherently related to the level of plastic soil strain around the pile which could be gauged by the residual rotation at the pile head 6 summary and conclusions this study presents a unique program of centrifuge model tests aiming to offer fresh insight into the lateral monotonic and cyclic behavior of large diameter slender piles d 4 m and l d 10 in medium dense sand particular emphasizes are placed on the comparative lateral behavior between the large diameter slender piles reported herein and those of the small diameter slender piles typically with d 3 m and l d 20 and large diameter stubby piles typically with d 4 m and l d 8 published in the literature interpretation of the centrifuge testing results has led to the following major conclusions 1 the monotonic p y load transfer behavior of the large diameter slender pile is marginally different from those of small diameter slender piles but significantly deviate from the large diameter stubby piles this may suggest the longstanding argument of diameter effect is indeed relatively minor while the lateral behavior of monopile in sand is more significantly affected by the relatively pile soil stiffness 2 the p y curve recommended by api 2011 tends to offer non conservative predictions for the large diameter slender piles in medium dense sand quantitatively api 2011 s p y curve has overestimated the initial stiffness and ultimate lateral capacity corresponding to a lateral head displacement of 10 d by 240 and 69 respectively a new p y relation with properly selected forms for initial stiffness and lateral capacity is therefore proposed to specifically capture the lateral load transfer behavior of large diameter slender piles validations have been made against the centrifuge testing results 3 the large diameter slender piles exhibit lower rates of cyclic displacement and rotation accumulation than those of the large diameter stubby piles but behave similarly as the small diameter slender piles in these regards this may suggest the cyclic behavior of laterally loaded piles in medium dense sand depends primarily on relative soil pile stiffness while the diameter effect is less dominating 4 substantial lock in bending moment was induced along the large diameter slender pile which can account for up to 40 of the peak bending moment developed within the same loading cycle the ratios between the lock in and peak moments which determine the fatigue damage cumulated along the pile exhibit a single trend of correlation with the normalized residual rotation at the pile head irrespective of pile diameter cyclic amplitude and number of cycles these centrifuge testing results form a unique database to support development of new design methods for large diameter slender piles and to verify advanced numerical analyses involving cyclic models which in turn would facilitate development of

20927,the subsea mudlift drilling system smd belongs to the system of dual gradient drilling when the natural gas hydrate layer is encountered with the smd system during the drilling process significant risks and failures are resulted by the decomposition and secondary formation of the hydrate to predict failures the environmental factors human factors and equipment factors are analyzed in this study firstly after the fault tree is established it is transformed into bayesian network bn using the mapping algorithm secondly the leaky noisy or node is added to bn and the uncertain influence of the logical relationship is considered then the established bn is transformed into the uncertainty dynamic bayesian networks udbns through the transition probability matrix if the dynamic uncertainty of equipment factors and human factors are considered in addition the cognitive reliability and error analysis method cream are used to determine the prior probability of human factors in the dbn model moreover we also use fuzzy theory and expert judgment to quantify the prior probability of equipment failure at the end of the experiment the ultimate result shows that the udbns model derived by the existing data can be used to predict the risk of lost circulation lc sticking and blockage during the drilling process and the dynamic success probability at different stages of the shut in process the correctness of the established udbns model is verified by the petri nets method keywords subsea mudlift drilling natural gas hydrate drilling risk udbns cream 1 introduction due to the uncertainty of the offshore environment and complex operating conditions offshore drilling works are often faced with various risks zhang et al 2018 the smd system is made of conventional marine drilling equipment and a new type of drilling equipment system for particular purposes operating environment equipment and well control are much different from traditional drilling therefore it is necessary to conduct a risk analysis on the smd system after considering the impact of uncertainty on the basis of deep water smd drilling technology and process research and to provide safety guarantee for the industrial application of the smd system this paper also considers the impact of the natural gas hydrate ngh layer on the smd system generally hydrates distribute in deep water shallow layers about 500 m above the seabed the high pressure and low temperature environment in this area is suitable for the formation of hydrates chong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 developed a model to describe hydrate blockage in a wellbore and determined the most likely locations for hydrate blockage gao et al 2018 analyzed the impact of geology environment and drilling risks and established a fault tree for risk assessment of drilling operations in deep water hydrate formations liu et al 2019 have established a mathematical model to predict the risk of hydrate blockage in deep water pipelines and proposed safe and effective deep water transportation hydrate risk prevention and control measures risk analysis is a useful tool to determine the possibility of accidents in offshore oilfield drilling operations it can be used to predict the probability of accidents diagnose the source of the corresponding failures and equationte relevant risk reduction measures khakzad et al 2013 researchers have proposed many risk analysis methods whittaker et al 2000 developed a markov chain model for predicting the reliability of multi structure software langseth and portinale 2007 discussed the characteristics of a modeling framework for bn particularly suitable for reliability applications and pointed out that reliability practitioners widely use bns conduct risk analysis guo and yang 2007 studied a reliability block diagram method abimbola et al 2014 developed a new bow tie model for safety risk analysis of drilling operations liu et al 2015c presented an application of deterministic and stochastic petri nets to evaluate the performance of subsea blowout preventer system guo et al 2016 and chang et al 2018b used fuzzy petri nets to evaluate the risk assessment ren et al 2018 and liu et al 2016 proposed a method of reliability evaluation combining go flow and bayesian networks the uncertainty in the drilling process can be separated into accidental uncertainty and cognitive uncertainty aven and zio 2013 accidental uncertainty is caused by natural changes or the random behavior of the physical system cognitive uncertainty is caused by a lack of knowledge or incompleteness to overcome the problem of uncertain logical relations in bayesian networks zhou et al 2016 proposed to use the leaky noisy or gate model to modify the conditional probability table in the analysis based on expert judgment fuzzy sets and evidence theory were used to deal with the data uncertainty in bayesian networks ferdous et al 2012 he et al 2018 in an smd deep water drilling system encountering a hydrate layer cause risks such as lc sticking the drill and blockage of the blowout preventers bop gao et al 2018 liu et al 2015a shut in failure can even occur during well control process the operations and equipment involved in the drilling process are different at different stages and the probability of drilling equipment failure gradually increases with time in actual operations various factors can lead to risks in the drilling process such as human operation factors environmental factors equipment factors and time factors however quantitative research was not conducted on the drilling risks of smd drilling systems encountering hydrate formations yet in this study we used the cream method to quantify the failure probability of human operations during drilling the prior probability of equipment failure is calculated by fuzzy theory and expert judgment uncertainty analysis is added to dbn by which the udbns model is established this paper uses the fault tree analysis method to analyze the risk when encountering an ngh layer for drilling and then establishes a udbns cream model to predict various risk probabilities the paper is structured as follows the structure and risk reasons for smd system are introduced in section 2 the methodology of establishing a udbns cream model is proposed in section 3 section 4 is a case study regarding the application of the udbns cream approach in quantitative risk probability analysis of the smd system the results and discussions are in section 5 finally the summary and conclusions are provided in section 6 2 background the dual gradient drilling technology in deep water mainly includes subsea mudlift drilling riserless drilling and dual density drilling which can solve the technical problems in deep sea drilling chen et al 2007 the smd system is a dual gradient well controlled drilling technology during drilling operations the riser fills with seawater the subsea pump and return pipeline is used to return the mud and to reduce the density of the fluid in the riser annulus to seawater density the return line of the mud liquid is shown by the arrow in fig 1 the static pressure of the liquid column around the subsea annulus is reduced to effectively control the wellbore annulus pressure and bottom hole pressure on the seabed the structure of the smd system is shown in fig 1 consisting of two types of equipment conventional drilling equipment and particular purpose drilling equipment the sea surface equipment is the same as the traditional drilling equipment the critical equipment and devices that the system needs to develop include a mud valve drill pipe valve solid phase treatment device and drilling fluid lifting device the drilling fluid lifting device is composed of a rotary separator and a subsea mud lifting pump all devices form a series system and the failure of each device may cause the entire system to fail to work normally compared with conventional land drilling deep water drilling may have more significant risks especially when encountering a ngh layer during drilling the main risk is related to the decomposition of hydrate in the pores which may lead to a series of major failures the main risks of deep water drilling encountering ngh layer are shown in fig 1 the existence of hydrates is related to the temperature and pressure of the surrounding environment changes in temperature and pressure will cause the decomposition and secondary formation of ngh after the ngh is decomposed the formation stress state changes the stratum loses the support force causing uneven stratum collapse and settlement which in turn causes large scale subsea landslides and damages the stability of the shaft wall the decomposition of natural gas hydrate will also affect the performance of the drilling fluid after drilling into a ngh layer a large amount of gas invades the drilling fluid which reduces the density of the drilling fluid and affects the pressure balance in the wellbore the gas can form ngh again in the wellbore and pipeline at certain pressure and temperature conditions the re formed ngh will block the pipeline and increase the density of the drilling fluid resulting in risks as lc sticking the drill and blockage of the bop 3 risk analysis techniques 3 1 dynamic bayesian network bayesian networks arise from a concept for reasoning complex uncertain problems where network means a graphical model dbn is a stochastic model with processing time series based on static bn and hidden markov model combining static network and time information wang et al 2020 liu et al 2015a b dbn can be represented as b0 b where b0 is a bn that defines the prior probability p xt and b is the transfer network liu et al 2015a the conditional probability distribution p xt δt xt can be expressed as equation 1 chang et al 2019a b liu and liu 2019 1 p x t δ t x t i 1 n p x t δ t i x t i dbns have been widely used in the risk prediction model based on time series the advantage is that it can detect the risk rate of each time period so that the fault can be found in time and then the problem can be solved 3 2 dbn modeling of series and parallel systems the fault tree ft of the series system and gate and parallel system or gate shown in fig 2 can be directly converted to bn chang et al 2018a each basic event of ft is converted to the parent node of the corresponding bn kabir et al 2019 each top event of ft is converted to the corresponding bn child node bn is then extended to dbn which contains three time slices in fig 2 cai et al 2013 the translation from ft to bn algorithm is ft mapping first the mapping from ft into bn includes a graphical and probability conversion based on previous work chang et al 2018a fig 2 illustrates the simplified process of mapping ft into bn liu et al 2015a in this phase the root event intermediate event and top event of ft are transformed into the root node intermediate event node and top event node of corresponding bn respectively the bn node is connected in the same way as the corresponding event in ft the parent nodes rc1 and rc2 have two states namely no and yes child node ie1 also has two states no and yes the and gate and or gate systems are shown in fig 2 they have the same structure except that the conditional probability table between their parent and child nodes is different fig 2 also shows the reliability of series and parallel systems as shown in fig 2 the reliability of series and parallel systems decreases with time but the reliability of parallel systems is better than that of series systems the following notations will be used in the rest root causes rc intermediate event ie top event te 3 3 uncertainty dbn modeling uncertainty is an essential factor in risk analysis including statistical uncertainty and system uncertainty wu et al 2016 statistical uncertainty means that given a model no specific results can be obtained but an accurate probability can be obtained system uncertainty means that the modeling can be incorrect due to cognitive limitations the uncertainty of the logical relationship and probability parameters is analyzed by combining uncertainty with dbn in the network 3 3 1 uncertainty analysis of the logical relationship between factors to carry out the uncertainty analysis of the logical relationship between factors a new node mu to dbn is introduced mu node has or or and logic relation modeling of uncertainty mu is necessary due to the lack of accurate judgment of a causal relationship between the nodes and their parents for example the relationship between the nodes rc2 and rc1 cannot completely follow the and gate the introduction of the mu node will lead to changes in the conditional probability table cpt of the child node the following takes the child node ie1 as an example the cpt of ie1 can be assigned as shown in table 1 e g p ie1 yes rc1 yes rc2 yes mu or 1 3 3 2 uncertainty dbn of probability parameters the uncertainty dbn of probability parameters includes two aspects the first is the uncertainty of the conditional probability from the parent node to the child node the noisy or model is used to calculate cpt wu et al 2016 the noisy or model is usually used to describe the relationship between n basic events parent nodes and the results intermediate events caused by them as shown in fig 3 using this model must satisfy three assumptions 1 all basic event nodes have only two states 2 the basic events rc1 rc2 rcn that caused the result ie are mutually independent 3 every basic event has a connection probability pi which satisfies p i p i e r c 1 r c 2 r c i r c i 1 r c n the ie probability node is the true value only if the rci is true in the noisy or structure model as shown in fig 3 all basic events rci constitute a set rcp all basic events are the set rct formed by the rci of the truth value the conditional probability of ie p ie rcp obtained from n basic events rc1 rc2 rcn can be expressed as feng et al 2020 2 p i p i e r c i p i e r c i 1 p i e r c i 3 p i e r c p 1 r c i ε r c t 1 p i according to equation 3 if rct is an empty set all basic events do not occur which means p i e r c p 0 however in actual situations the probability can not be zero and certain uncertain factors inevitably affect the state of ie therefore the model is further processed and the leaky noisy or model is used to represent the actual situation 1988 the leaky noisy or model is a further extension of the noisy or model fenton et al 2019 in the leaky noisy or model shown in fig 4 in addition to the parent nodes rc1 rc2 rcn the ie node has some unknown influence factors integrate all the unknown influencing factors into one affecting factor rcl the connection probability is pl and the conditional probability of ie is expressed as equation 4 4 p i e r c p 1 r c i ε r c t 1 p i 1 p l then the parent node of dbn at the current moment is compared with the parent node at the next moment and the conditional probability between them is time varying under complex ocean and working conditions as the performance of equipment degrades over time it assumes that the failure probability of equipment obeys an exponential distribution considering the failure rate λ and the repair rate μ of the equipment cai et al 2013 each parent node is assumed to be two states no and yes state no represents that the device is in a perfect operating state at first as time passes the device enters a fault state yes the state transition diagram of the node is shown in fig 5 assuming that the current time is t the time of the next test is t t tables 2 3 shows the state transition relationship between nodes without repair and perfect repair nie et al 2019 respectively in the offshore platform drilling each operation has two states success and failure which are human error factors assuming that the human failure state is only related to the state of the previous moment and has nothing to do with the state of the last moment the state transition of the human factor conforms to the homogeneous markov chain jiang et al 2020 human failure is a random event and the number of errors is a random independent variable the random variable of human error is assumed to follow a poisson distribution assuming that the average number of human failures per unit time is λ the state transition matrix of human factors is shown in table 4 wang et al 2017 3 4 calculate the prior probability of equipment through fuzzy theory to obtain the prior failure probability of offshore drilling equipment the fuzzy theory method is used in this study fuzzy set theory is widely regarded as a new method to deal with uncertainty ferdous et al 2012 the fuzzy theory provides a language with semantics which can transform qualitative knowledge and judgments into numerical reasoning li et al 2019 this section introduces the steps of using fuzzy set theory to analyze the prior probability of basic events of fault trees which can be divided into the following three stages yazdi and kabir 2017 step1 obtain the linguistic variables of basic events according to expert judgment step2 convert language variables into corresponding fuzzy numbers step3 convert the fuzzy number into a fuzzy possible score fps and then into the prior probability of the basic event due to the vague and obvious subjectivity of expert knowledge some researchers have explored ways to combine fuzzy theory with expert knowledge liu et al 2015b fuzzy numbers are used in fuzzy sets to deal with uncertain information in expert judgment in fuzzy mathematics many membership functions are used to deal with the uncertainty in the linguistic judgment of experts such as rectangular membership function triangular membership function trapezoidal membership function normal distribution type membership function etc in this paper the triangular membership function is selected the linguistic variables representing the probability of basic events are divided into seven levels very high vh medium high mh high h medium m low l medium low ml and very low vl the corresponding membership function is shown in fig 6 after a few experts have judged the linguistic variables of basic events the subjective opinions of the experts need to be aggregated into one opinion in this study the weighted average method of equation 5 is used to aggregate expert opinions thereby transforming multiple triangular membership functions into one triangular membership function yazdi and kabir 2017 5 z i j 1 m ω j p i j j 1 m ω j i 1 2 3 n where z i represents the aggregate fuzzy number of the basic event bei p ij is the linguistic expression of expert j for the event i ꙍ j is the weighting factor of expert j n is the number of input events m is the number of experts fps represents a clear value based on the aggregation of opinions of experts on basic events several techniques can be used to defuzzify the output result obtained in the fuzzy set theory including but not limited to the center of the area coa the center of the largest area max min bisector weight average mean max and the center of sum akkurt et al 2004 ross 2010 in this study the gravity or centre of area defuzzification techniques was used ramzali et al 2015 mathematically it can be expressed as equation 6 6 f p s z i x x d x z i x where fps represents the defuzzified output z i x represents the aggregated membership function x represents the output variable this equation can be applied to defuzzify triangular

to confirm the reliability of human factors as they are the influencing factors in smd system safety in this paper considering the effect of the surrounding environment operation process and personal perception on the related equipment during the drilling operation human reliability is obtained by using cream cream emphasizes that the performance output of the human effect in production activities is not isolated randomness behavior which depends on the environment or working conditions in which the person completes the task abrishami et al 2020 they ultimately determine the person s response behavior by influencing the person s cognitive control mode and its effects in different cognitive activities to determine the probability of human factors in deep water drilling cream categorizes cognitive functions into four categories observation interpretation planning and execution shirali et al 2019 each type of function has several failure modes table 5 shows the comparison between cognitive behavior and cognitive function and table 6 shows the cognitive function failure mode and the basic probability value of the cognitive function cfp the level of common performance condition cpc factors given by the cream method is evaluated the expected effect on performance reliability and the corresponding weighting factor of cognitive function are determined then the product of the weighting factors of all cpc factors under each cognitive function the total weight w of the cognitive function is obtained finally equation 10 is used to find the correction value of the cognitive failure probability corresponding to each cognitive activity that is the probability of human factor hfp 10 h f p c f p w 3 6 proposed method in this paper a framework for predicting the risk of smd drilling systems is developed which can be used to analyze various risks during the drilling process an overview of the proposed method is briefly described in fig 7 the framework is divided into three steps step 1 develop a fault tree model first determine the top events such as lc sticking the drill and blockage of the bop then establish intermediate events and basic events based on accident analysis step 2 develop the udbns model the first step is to transform the fault tree into a static bayesian network bn through cpt then some basic parameters are confirmed by analyzing the logical relationship of the factor and the uncertainty of probability parameters such as the transition probability table of equipment factors the transition probability table of human factors and the logical relationship of nodes in the network finally the udbns model is established among them the prior probability of human error is quantified by cream and the prior probability of equipment factor is determined by fuzzy theory and expert judgment step 3 analysis use the established udbns cream model to analyze the dynamic risks of the system udbns cream is a risk analysis method using the bayesian theory cream method and uncertainty analysis compared with the traditional fault tree method it is easier to analyze sophisticated risk analysis problems by the udbns cream method including multi state and multi time nodes 4 case study 4 1 fault tree of smd system ft is a deductive and structured methodology to determine the potential causes of an undesired event referred to as the top event kabir et al when drilling into the ngh layer during offshore drilling due to changes in temperature and pressure the equilibrium state of ngh is broken the generated gas enters the annulus between the drill pipe and the borehole wall decreasing the stability of the borehole wall besides the uneven bearing capacity of the formation is caused by the decomposition of the ngh layer which leads to formation leakage severe formation leakage may cause circulation lost which increases the risk of well control shut in the fault tree of the smd system shown in fig 8 is obtained after integrating environmental factors human factors and equipment factors 4 2 establish udbns cream model 4 2 1 using the cream method to calculate the probability of human error according to the cognitive behavior and cognitive function comparison table provided by the cream method the cognitive function corresponding to each human factor in the fault tree is determined as shown in columns 1 3 of table 8 based on the deep water drilling operating environment the level of common performance condition factors given by the cream method is evaluated the expected effect on performance reliability and the corresponding weighting factor of cognitive function are determined deep water drilling operations involve all 9 cpc factors cpc performance reliability and weighting factors are shown in table 7 to predict the failure probability of human factors in deep water smd system drilling operations the most likely failure mode and cfp of each human factor are firstly determined according to table 6 and columns 4 5 of table 8 then the total cognitive function weight w corresponding to each human factor is obtained in columns 6 of table 8 finally the hfp is calculated corresponding to each human factor 4 2 2 calculate the prior probability of equipment failure in this study the judgments of three experts who have sufficient experience in drilling related industries are used to quantify the prior probability of equipment failure their weight ratio is e1 e2 e3 0 325 0 378 0 297 table 9 shows the fuzzy function of the aggregate expert judgment the fuzzy probability score and the prior probability the trigonometric functions are used in the fuzzy membership function 4 2 3 establish udbns model this study uses the dbn model established by genle software genie 2019 which is a universal platform for rapid risk assessment according to the mapping algorithm described in section 3 2 the basic events and top events in the fault tree of the smd system are converted into the corresponding parent node and child node in the dbn model first the dbn uncertainty modeling described in section 3 3 is used to determine the dynamic transition probability and static failure probability of the parent node in the dbn model then considering the uncertain relationship between the factor logic the conditional probability table of the parent node and the child node is established the final dbn model is shown in fig 9 the prior probability of the environmental factor node is obtained from the literature gao et al 2018 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 as shown in table 10 in the dbn model both the parent node and the child node have two states yes and no according to the uncertainty modeling of the logical relationship of factors the uncertainty of the logical relationship between environmental factors sf2 and ndwenl ngh decomposition when encountering the ngh layer is described by adding mu nodes which have two states or and and in the dbn model due to the complexity and uncertainty of the smd drilling system the conditional probability table of the parent node of the or gate is estimated based on expert s experience and the leaky noisy or algorithm to reduce the impact uncertainty for example the parent node fospm failure of subsea pump module the causes of failure of the subsea pump module may include electrical failure ef6 and subsea pump failure ef7 the combined influence of the above two factors and the impact of uncertain factors then the following equations 11 14 are proposed based on the conditional probability from expert judgment 11 p fospm yes ef 6 yes 0 75 12 p fospm yes ef 6 no 0 15 13 p fospm yes ef 7 yes 0 98 14 p fospm yes ef 7 no 0 05 according to equation 2 the connection probability can be obtained as pef6 0 759 and pef7 0 979 the unknown factor rcl with a confidence level of 99 obeys the gaussian probability density therefore pl is estimated to be 0 01 by equation 4 and the conditional probability distribution of fospm is shown in table 11 after considering the uncertainty in fig 10 the probability of lc dropped from 0 043189 to 0 027204 in the 20th week in the dbn model there are 20 time slices with a segment of one week since the drilling time of a well is roughly 20 weeks on an offshore platform due to failure and repair the different states of all nodes in each subsequent time segment have different probability values among them the failure rate and repair rate of all equipment factor nodes are shown in table 12 which comes from oreda oreda 2002 4 3 model verification the petri nets method is used to validate the proposed model in stochastic petri nets for reliability modeling λ represents the failure rates of components fig 11 shows that the petri nets model of the unreasonable well structure design uwsd the uwsd system can be divided into two subsystems without considering human factors one is composed of ef2 and the other is composed of ef1 and ef3 ef2 r indicates the normal working condition of ef2 while ef2 f indicates that ef2 has failed similarly system r indicates that the second subsystem is working normally and system f represents a failure λ1 λ2 and λ3 are the failure rates of ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively in the petri nets model the risk probability of the ef1 and ef3 subsystem is 0 0593 while that of the ef2 subsystem is 0 0268 in the established udbns model the risk probabilities of two subsystems are 0 0570 ef1 and ef3 and 0 0257 ef2 which is approximately equal to the petri nets model indicating the accuracy of the proposed udbns model 5 results and discussions 5 1 dynamic drilling risk as mentioned in the introduction section the deep water drilling process can be divided into four working conditions as 1 encountering ngh layer ngh 2 encountering associated gas ag 3 encountering both ngh and ag ngh ag 4 normal drilling conditions the established udbns are used to conduct a dynamic risk analysis of drilling engineering under different working conditions under normal operating conditions the udbns are established without considering the influence of ngh the udbns that encounter ngh and associated gas can be obtained by changing the environmental factor nodes sf6 in the udbns to sf7 and sf8 the probability of lc sticking the drill blockage of the bop and the successful shut in are obtained respectively in fig 12 it can be seen that the lc risk under the ngh ag working condition is higher than other working conditions in each time segment whose maximum risk probability is 0 03285 in the 20th week under normal conditions the risk of lc is the smallest which is 0 017425 in the 20th week ngh working conditions and ag working conditions are between the above two working conditions and the probability of lc in ngh working conditions is 0 003308 which is higher than that of ag working conditions after the equipment is repaired the risk probability reduces in the four working conditions and remains unchanged after the first week in particular it can be seen that the probability of bop clogging is the largest in the 20th week the probability value reaches 0 040708 under ngh ag conditions due to the influence of hydrate blockage the probability of well control shut in failure under ngh ag conditions increases to 0 558416 5 2 sensitivity analysis of equipment factors in this section the results of inspection prediction or diagnostic analysis are compared and analyzed by specific parameters since the dbn parameters are calculated based on the failure rate sensitivity analysis is performed by setting the relative deviation of the failure rate to 3 levels 30 60 and 90 the sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the relative changes rc of the probabilities of lc and shut in working conditions as equation 15 15 r c r i s k i p r i s k i p r i s k i p r i s k i 100 where rc risk i represents the relative change in the risk probability of the smd system at time i p r i s k i indicates the risk probability when the equipment failure rate is unchanged p r i s k i indicates the risk probability when the equipment failure rate changes fig 13 shows the relative risk probability changes in 20 weeks when the failure rate of equipment is increased by 60 under the four operating conditions the probability changes in lc and shut in failure conditions are affected by various equipment among them lc is affected by ef1 ef7 and shut in is affected by ef8 ef12 in fig 13 a and c under ngh and ngh ag conditions the change of ef7 poor borehole stability failure rate has the greatest effect on the probability of lc in fig 13 b and d the change of ef7 subsea pump failure failure rate has the greatest effect on the probability of lc under ag and normal operating conditions under these four conditions the change of ef11 bop failure failure rate has the greatest effect on the probability of shut in failure fig 14 shows that the system relative risk probability changes effected by different equipment failure changing rates in the 20th week with the increase in equipment failure rate the probability of occurrence of various risks is increased in all working conditions the relative risk probability increases linearly with the change in failure rate similarly it can be obtained that ef1 and ef7 have the greatest impact on the probability of lc ef11 has the greatest impact on the probability of shut in failure when the failure rate of these three types of equipment increases by 90 the probability of occurrence of the two risks will increase by more than 20 indicating that this equipment should be maintained and repaired in time 5 3 analysis of the strength of the influence of human factors this section assumes that the lc has occurred under which means the status of the lc event is yes as shown in fig 15 the time slice node of one month is used in the sensitivity analysis from the established udbns model the posterior probabilities of the root causes of human error are updated the ratio of posterior probability to prior probability is defined as a kind parameter to indicate the strength of the influence of human factors on the system risk fig 15 shows the degree of influence of various human factors on system risk in different time periods the higher the ratio of the posterior probability to the prior probability the more obvious the influence of the human factor node on the system risk probability can be obtained in the experiment at the beginning of the operation at t 0 the influence of human error is the strongest as time increases the influence of each human factor decreases as shown in fig 15 the influence of hf1 hf7 hf8 and hf9 is stronger than others human factors therefore managers should focus on the above reasons in actual operation 5 4 influence of ngh decomposition on dynamic risk the decomposition and secondary formation probability of ngh depend on the surrounding pressure and temperature in the drilling process the graph of ngh secondary formation is shown in fig 16 these lead to changes in the various risk probabilities of smd system drilling process which ultimately affect the probability of a successful shut in fig 17 shows the risk probability of lc under different temperature pressure and working conditions at the 20th week as can be seen the probability of occurrence of each risk decreases with the decrease in the probability of ngh secondary formation fig 17 a and d show that the decomposition probability of ngh under ngh ag and ngh ag work conditions have a limited effect on lc and shut in failure while the impact on sticking the drill and blockage of the bop is significant in fig 17 b and c the secondary formation of ngh can cause blockage resulting in a stuck drill which blocks bop 6 conclusions in this study an udbns cream approach is proposed to dynamically analyze the risk of deep water dual gradient drilling with smd system over time considering the influence of uncertain factors combined with dbn to establish an udbns model the prior probability of equipment failure is obtained by using fuzzy theory the cream method is used to calculate the probability of human factors finally the udbns cream model is established considering the influence of ngh the developed udbns model is used for the risk analysis of smd system drilling the dynamic risk probability under four working conditions is obtained 1 after adding uncertain factors the probability of risk has decreased 2 among the four working conditions the ngh ag working condition has the greatest probability of occurrence of various risks 3 maintenance can significantly reduce the risk and stabilize the risk probability frequent maintenance of drilling equipment can improve the reliability of the drilling system 4 in the sensitivity analysis ef1 ef7 and ef11 are obtained as more sensitive devices and the change of their failure rate has a more significant impact on the system 5 through the analysis of human factors human factors such as hf1 hf7 hf8 and hf9 should be conhas have sidered carefully to reduce the possibility of risk 6 when drilling into ngh the probability of lc sticking the drill and blockage of the bop in smd system is higher than under normal working conditions due to the decomposition and secondary formation of ngh the secondary formation of ngh will increase the probability of sticking the drill and blockage of the bop during drilling operations the second formation of ngh should be suppressed as much as possible to prevent the formation of blockage credit authorship contribution statement chuan wang conceptualization methodology data curation writing review editing yong xia formal analysis writing original draft

20927,the subsea mudlift drilling system smd belongs to the system of dual gradient drilling when the natural gas hydrate layer is encountered with the smd system during the drilling process significant risks and failures are resulted by the decomposition and secondary formation of the hydrate to predict failures the environmental factors human factors and equipment factors are analyzed in this study firstly after the fault tree is established it is transformed into bayesian network bn using the mapping algorithm secondly the leaky noisy or node is added to bn and the uncertain influence of the logical relationship is considered then the established bn is transformed into the uncertainty dynamic bayesian networks udbns through the transition probability matrix if the dynamic uncertainty of equipment factors and human factors are considered in addition the cognitive reliability and error analysis method cream are used to determine the prior probability of human factors in the dbn model moreover we also use fuzzy theory and expert judgment to quantify the prior probability of equipment failure at the end of the experiment the ultimate result shows that the udbns model derived by the existing data can be used to predict the risk of lost circulation lc sticking and blockage during the drilling process and the dynamic success probability at different stages of the shut in process the correctness of the established udbns model is verified by the petri nets method keywords subsea mudlift drilling natural gas hydrate drilling risk udbns cream 1 introduction due to the uncertainty of the offshore environment and complex operating conditions offshore drilling works are often faced with various risks zhang et al 2018 the smd system is made of conventional marine drilling equipment and a new type of drilling equipment system for particular purposes operating environment equipment and well control are much different from traditional drilling therefore it is necessary to conduct a risk analysis on the smd system after considering the impact of uncertainty on the basis of deep water smd drilling technology and process research and to provide safety guarantee for the industrial application of the smd system this paper also considers the impact of the natural gas hydrate ngh layer on the smd system generally hydrates distribute in deep water shallow layers about 500 m above the seabed the high pressure and low temperature environment in this area is suitable for the formation of hydrates chong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 developed a model to describe hydrate blockage in a wellbore and determined the most likely locations for hydrate blockage gao et al 2018 analyzed the impact of geology environment and drilling risks and established a fault tree for risk assessment of drilling operations in deep water hydrate formations liu et al 2019 have established a mathematical model to predict the risk of hydrate blockage in deep water pipelines and proposed safe and effective deep water transportation hydrate risk prevention and control measures risk analysis is a useful tool to determine the possibility of accidents in offshore oilfield drilling operations it can be used to predict the probability of accidents diagnose the source of the corresponding failures and equationte relevant risk reduction measures khakzad et al 2013 researchers have proposed many risk analysis methods whittaker et al 2000 developed a markov chain model for predicting the reliability of multi structure software langseth and portinale 2007 discussed the characteristics of a modeling framework for bn particularly suitable for reliability applications and pointed out that reliability practitioners widely use bns conduct risk analysis guo and yang 2007 studied a reliability block diagram method abimbola et al 2014 developed a new bow tie model for safety risk analysis of drilling operations liu et al 2015c presented an application of deterministic and stochastic petri nets to evaluate the performance of subsea blowout preventer system guo et al 2016 and chang et al 2018b used fuzzy petri nets to evaluate the risk assessment ren et al 2018 and liu et al 2016 proposed a method of reliability evaluation combining go flow and bayesian networks the uncertainty in the drilling process can be separated into accidental uncertainty and cognitive uncertainty aven and zio 2013 accidental uncertainty is caused by natural changes or the random behavior of the physical system cognitive uncertainty is caused by a lack of knowledge or incompleteness to overcome the problem of uncertain logical relations in bayesian networks zhou et al 2016 proposed to use the leaky noisy or gate model to modify the conditional probability table in the analysis based on expert judgment fuzzy sets and evidence theory were used to deal with the data uncertainty in bayesian networks ferdous et al 2012 he et al 2018 in an smd deep water drilling system encountering a hydrate layer cause risks such as lc sticking the drill and blockage of the blowout preventers bop gao et al 2018 liu et al 2015a shut in failure can even occur during well control process the operations and equipment involved in the drilling process are different at different stages and the probability of drilling equipment failure gradually increases with time in actual operations various factors can lead to risks in the drilling process such as human operation factors environmental factors equipment factors and time factors however quantitative research was not conducted on the drilling risks of smd drilling systems encountering hydrate formations yet in this study we used the cream method to quantify the failure probability of human operations during drilling the prior probability of equipment failure is calculated by fuzzy theory and expert judgment uncertainty analysis is added to dbn by which the udbns model is established this paper uses the fault tree analysis method to analyze the risk when encountering an ngh layer for drilling and then establishes a udbns cream model to predict various risk probabilities the paper is structured as follows the structure and risk reasons for smd system are introduced in section 2 the methodology of establishing a udbns cream model is proposed in section 3 section 4 is a case study regarding the application of the udbns cream approach in quantitative risk probability analysis of the smd system the results and discussions are in section 5 finally the summary and conclusions are provided in section 6 2 background the dual gradient drilling technology in deep water mainly includes subsea mudlift drilling riserless drilling and dual density drilling which can solve the technical problems in deep sea drilling chen et al 2007 the smd system is a dual gradient well controlled drilling technology during drilling operations the riser fills with seawater the subsea pump and return pipeline is used to return the mud and to reduce the density of the fluid in the riser annulus to seawater density the return line of the mud liquid is shown by the arrow in fig 1 the static pressure of the liquid column around the subsea annulus is reduced to effectively control the wellbore annulus pressure and bottom hole pressure on the seabed the structure of the smd system is shown in fig 1 consisting of two types of equipment conventional drilling equipment and particular purpose drilling equipment the sea surface equipment is the same as the traditional drilling equipment the critical equipment and devices that the system needs to develop include a mud valve drill pipe valve solid phase treatment device and drilling fluid lifting device the drilling fluid lifting device is composed of a rotary separator and a subsea mud lifting pump all devices form a series system and the failure of each device may cause the entire system to fail to work normally compared with conventional land drilling deep water drilling may have more significant risks especially when encountering a ngh layer during drilling the main risk is related to the decomposition of hydrate in the pores which may lead to a series of major failures the main risks of deep water drilling encountering ngh layer are shown in fig 1 the existence of hydrates is related to the temperature and pressure of the surrounding environment changes in temperature and pressure will cause the decomposition and secondary formation of ngh after the ngh is decomposed the formation stress state changes the stratum loses the support force causing uneven stratum collapse and settlement which in turn causes large scale subsea landslides and damages the stability of the shaft wall the decomposition of natural gas hydrate will also affect the performance of the drilling fluid after drilling into a ngh layer a large amount of gas invades the drilling fluid which reduces the density of the drilling fluid and affects the pressure balance in the wellbore the gas can form ngh again in the wellbore and pipeline at certain pressure and temperature conditions the re formed ngh will block the pipeline and increase the density of the drilling fluid resulting in risks as lc sticking the drill and blockage of the bop 3 risk analysis techniques 3 1 dynamic bayesian network bayesian networks arise from a concept for reasoning complex uncertain problems where network means a graphical model dbn is a stochastic model with processing time series based on static bn and hidden markov model combining static network and time information wang et al 2020 liu et al 2015a b dbn can be represented as b0 b where b0 is a bn that defines the prior probability p xt and b is the transfer network liu et al 2015a the conditional probability distribution p xt δt xt can be expressed as equation 1 chang et al 2019a b liu and liu 2019 1 p x t δ t x t i 1 n p x t δ t i x t i dbns have been widely used in the risk prediction model based on time series the advantage is that it can detect the risk rate of each time period so that the fault can be found in time and then the problem can be solved 3 2 dbn modeling of series and parallel systems the fault tree ft of the series system and gate and parallel system or gate shown in fig 2 can be directly converted to bn chang et al 2018a each basic event of ft is converted to the parent node of the corresponding bn kabir et al 2019 each top event of ft is converted to the corresponding bn child node bn is then extended to dbn which contains three time slices in fig 2 cai et al 2013 the translation from ft to bn algorithm is ft mapping first the mapping from ft into bn includes a graphical and probability conversion based on previous work chang et al 2018a fig 2 illustrates the simplified process of mapping ft into bn liu et al 2015a in this phase the root event intermediate event and top event of ft are transformed into the root node intermediate event node and top event node of corresponding bn respectively the bn node is connected in the same way as the corresponding event in ft the parent nodes rc1 and rc2 have two states namely no and yes child node ie1 also has two states no and yes the and gate and or gate systems are shown in fig 2 they have the same structure except that the conditional probability table between their parent and child nodes is different fig 2 also shows the reliability of series and parallel systems as shown in fig 2 the reliability of series and parallel systems decreases with time but the reliability of parallel systems is better than that of series systems the following notations will be used in the rest root causes rc intermediate event ie top event te 3 3 uncertainty dbn modeling uncertainty is an essential factor in risk analysis including statistical uncertainty and system uncertainty wu et al 2016 statistical uncertainty means that given a model no specific results can be obtained but an accurate probability can be obtained system uncertainty means that the modeling can be incorrect due to cognitive limitations the uncertainty of the logical relationship and probability parameters is analyzed by combining uncertainty with dbn in the network 3 3 1 uncertainty analysis of the logical relationship between factors to carry out the uncertainty analysis of the logical relationship between factors a new node mu to dbn is introduced mu node has or or and logic relation modeling of uncertainty mu is necessary due to the lack of accurate judgment of a causal relationship between the nodes and their parents for example the relationship between the nodes rc2 and rc1 cannot completely follow the and gate the introduction of the mu node will lead to changes in the conditional probability table cpt of the child node the following takes the child node ie1 as an example the cpt of ie1 can be assigned as shown in table 1 e g p ie1 yes rc1 yes rc2 yes mu or 1 3 3 2 uncertainty dbn of probability parameters the uncertainty dbn of probability parameters includes two aspects the first is the uncertainty of the conditional probability from the parent node to the child node the noisy or model is used to calculate cpt wu et al 2016 the noisy or model is usually used to describe the relationship between n basic events parent nodes and the results intermediate events caused by them as shown in fig 3 using this model must satisfy three assumptions 1 all basic event nodes have only two states 2 the basic events rc1 rc2 rcn that caused the result ie are mutually independent 3 every basic event has a connection probability pi which satisfies p i p i e r c 1 r c 2 r c i r c i 1 r c n the ie probability node is the true value only if the rci is true in the noisy or structure model as shown in fig 3 all basic events rci constitute a set rcp all basic events are the set rct formed by the rci of the truth value the conditional probability of ie p ie rcp obtained from n basic events rc1 rc2 rcn can be expressed as feng et al 2020 2 p i p i e r c i p i e r c i 1 p i e r c i 3 p i e r c p 1 r c i ε r c t 1 p i according to equation 3 if rct is an empty set all basic events do not occur which means p i e r c p 0 however in actual situations the probability can not be zero and certain uncertain factors inevitably affect the state of ie therefore the model is further processed and the leaky noisy or model is used to represent the actual situation 1988 the leaky noisy or model is a further extension of the noisy or model fenton et al 2019 in the leaky noisy or model shown in fig 4 in addition to the parent nodes rc1 rc2 rcn the ie node has some unknown influence factors integrate all the unknown influencing factors into one affecting factor rcl the connection probability is pl and the conditional probability of ie is expressed as equation 4 4 p i e r c p 1 r c i ε r c t 1 p i 1 p l then the parent node of dbn at the current moment is compared with the parent node at the next moment and the conditional probability between them is time varying under complex ocean and working conditions as the performance of equipment degrades over time it assumes that the failure probability of equipment obeys an exponential distribution considering the failure rate λ and the repair rate μ of the equipment cai et al 2013 each parent node is assumed to be two states no and yes state no represents that the device is in a perfect operating state at first as time passes the device enters a fault state yes the state transition diagram of the node is shown in fig 5 assuming that the current time is t the time of the next test is t t tables 2 3 shows the state transition relationship between nodes without repair and perfect repair nie et al 2019 respectively in the offshore platform drilling each operation has two states success and failure which are human error factors assuming that the human failure state is only related to the state of the previous moment and has nothing to do with the state of the last moment the state transition of the human factor conforms to the homogeneous markov chain jiang et al 2020 human failure is a random event and the number of errors is a random independent variable the random variable of human error is assumed to follow a poisson distribution assuming that the average number of human failures per unit time is λ the state transition matrix of human factors is shown in table 4 wang et al 2017 3 4 calculate the prior probability of equipment through fuzzy theory to obtain the prior failure probability of offshore drilling equipment the fuzzy theory method is used in this study fuzzy set theory is widely regarded as a new method to deal with uncertainty ferdous et al 2012 the fuzzy theory provides a language with semantics which can transform qualitative knowledge and judgments into numerical reasoning li et al 2019 this section introduces the steps of using fuzzy set theory to analyze the prior probability of basic events of fault trees which can be divided into the following three stages yazdi and kabir 2017 step1 obtain the linguistic variables of basic events according to expert judgment step2 convert language variables into corresponding fuzzy numbers step3 convert the fuzzy number into a fuzzy possible score fps and then into the prior probability of the basic event due to the vague and obvious subjectivity of expert knowledge some researchers have explored ways to combine fuzzy theory with expert knowledge liu et al 2015b fuzzy numbers are used in fuzzy sets to deal with uncertain information in expert judgment in fuzzy mathematics many membership functions are used to deal with the uncertainty in the linguistic judgment of experts such as rectangular membership function triangular membership function trapezoidal membership function normal distribution type membership function etc in this paper the triangular membership function is selected the linguistic variables representing the probability of basic events are divided into seven levels very high vh medium high mh high h medium m low l medium low ml and very low vl the corresponding membership function is shown in fig 6 after a few experts have judged the linguistic variables of basic events the subjective opinions of the experts need to be aggregated into one opinion in this study the weighted average method of equation 5 is used to aggregate expert opinions thereby transforming multiple triangular membership functions into one triangular membership function yazdi and kabir 2017 5 z i j 1 m ω j p i j j 1 m ω j i 1 2 3 n where z i represents the aggregate fuzzy number of the basic event bei p ij is the linguistic expression of expert j for the event i ꙍ j is the weighting factor of expert j n is the number of input events m is the number of experts fps represents a clear value based on the aggregation of opinions of experts on basic events several techniques can be used to defuzzify the output result obtained in the fuzzy set theory including but not limited to the center of the area coa the center of the largest area max min bisector weight average mean max and the center of sum akkurt et al 2004 ross 2010 in this study the gravity or centre of area defuzzification techniques was used ramzali et al 2015 mathematically it can be expressed as equation 6 6 f p s z i x x d x z i x where fps represents the defuzzified output z i x represents the aggregated membership function x represents the output variable this equation can be applied to defuzzify triangular fuzzy numbers as follows triangular membership function equation 7 e g a a1 a2 a3 7 z i x x a 1 a 2 a 1 a 1 x a 2 a 3 x a 3 a 2 a 2 x a 3 0 o t h e r s 8 f p s a 1 a 2 x a 1 a 2 a 1 x d x a 2 a 3 a 3

to confirm the reliability of human factors as they are the influencing factors in smd system safety in this paper considering the effect of the surrounding environment operation process and personal perception on the related equipment during the drilling operation human reliability is obtained by using cream cream emphasizes that the performance output of the human effect in production activities is not isolated randomness behavior which depends on the environment or working conditions in which the person completes the task abrishami et al 2020 they ultimately determine the person s response behavior by influencing the person s cognitive control mode and its effects in different cognitive activities to determine the probability of human factors in deep water drilling cream categorizes cognitive functions into four categories observation interpretation planning and execution shirali et al 2019 each type of function has several failure modes table 5 shows the comparison between cognitive behavior and cognitive function and table 6 shows the cognitive function failure mode and the basic probability value of the cognitive function cfp the level of common performance condition cpc factors given by the cream method is evaluated the expected effect on performance reliability and the corresponding weighting factor of cognitive function are determined then the product of the weighting factors of all cpc factors under each cognitive function the total weight w of the cognitive function is obtained finally equation 10 is used to find the correction value of the cognitive failure probability corresponding to each cognitive activity that is the probability of human factor hfp 10 h f p c f p w 3 6 proposed method in this paper a framework for predicting the risk of smd drilling systems is developed which can be used to analyze various risks during the drilling process an overview of the proposed method is briefly described in fig 7 the framework is divided into three steps step 1 develop a fault tree model first determine the top events such as lc sticking the drill and blockage of the bop then establish intermediate events and basic events based on accident analysis step 2 develop the udbns model the first step is to transform the fault tree into a static bayesian network bn through cpt then some basic parameters are confirmed by analyzing the logical relationship of the factor and the uncertainty of probability parameters such as the transition probability table of equipment factors the transition probability table of human factors and the logical relationship of nodes in the network finally the udbns model is established among them the prior probability of human error is quantified by cream and the prior probability of equipment factor is determined by fuzzy theory and expert judgment step 3 analysis use the established udbns cream model to analyze the dynamic risks of the system udbns cream is a risk analysis method using the bayesian theory cream method and uncertainty analysis compared with the traditional fault tree method it is easier to analyze sophisticated risk analysis problems by the udbns cream method including multi state and multi time nodes 4 case study 4 1 fault tree of smd system ft is a deductive and structured methodology to determine the potential causes of an undesired event referred to as the top event kabir et al when drilling into the ngh layer during offshore drilling due to changes in temperature and pressure the equilibrium state of ngh is broken the generated gas enters the annulus between the drill pipe and the borehole wall decreasing the stability of the borehole wall besides the uneven bearing capacity of the formation is caused by the decomposition of the ngh layer which leads to formation leakage severe formation leakage may cause circulation lost which increases the risk of well control shut in the fault tree of the smd system shown in fig 8 is obtained after integrating environmental factors human factors and equipment factors 4 2 establish udbns cream model 4 2 1 using the cream method to calculate the probability of human error according to the cognitive behavior and cognitive function comparison table provided by the cream method the cognitive function corresponding to each human factor in the fault tree is determined as shown in columns 1 3 of table 8 based on the deep water drilling operating environment the level of common performance condition factors given by the cream method is evaluated the expected effect on performance reliability and the corresponding weighting factor of cognitive function are determined deep water drilling operations involve all 9 cpc factors cpc performance reliability and weighting factors are shown in table 7 to predict the failure probability of human factors in deep water smd system drilling operations the most likely failure mode and cfp of each human factor are firstly determined according to table 6 and columns 4 5 of table 8 then the total cognitive function weight w corresponding to each human factor is obtained in columns 6 of table 8 finally the hfp is calculated corresponding to each human factor 4 2 2 calculate the prior probability of equipment failure in this study the judgments of three experts who have sufficient experience in drilling related industries are used to quantify the prior probability of equipment failure their weight ratio is e1 e2 e3 0 325 0 378 0 297 table 9 shows the fuzzy function of the aggregate expert judgment the fuzzy probability score and the prior probability the trigonometric functions are used in the fuzzy membership function 4 2 3 establish udbns model this study uses the dbn model established by genle software genie 2019 which is a universal platform for rapid risk assessment according to the mapping algorithm described in section 3 2 the basic events and top events in the fault tree of the smd system are converted into the corresponding parent node and child node in the dbn model first the dbn uncertainty modeling described in section 3 3 is used to determine the dynamic transition probability and static failure probability of the parent node in the dbn model then considering the uncertain relationship between the factor logic the conditional probability table of the parent node and the child node is established the final dbn model is shown in fig 9 the prior probability of the environmental factor node is obtained from the literature gao et al 2018 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 as shown in table 10 in the dbn model both the parent node and the child node have two states yes and no according to the uncertainty modeling of the logical relationship of factors the uncertainty of the logical relationship between environmental factors sf2 and ndwenl ngh decomposition when encountering the ngh layer is described by adding mu nodes which have two states or and and in the dbn model due to the complexity and uncertainty of the smd drilling system the conditional probability table of the parent node of the or gate is estimated based on expert s experience and the leaky noisy or algorithm to reduce the impact uncertainty for example the parent node fospm failure of subsea pump module the causes of failure of the subsea pump module may include electrical failure ef6 and subsea pump failure ef7 the combined influence of the above two factors and the impact of uncertain factors then the following equations 11 14 are proposed based on the conditional probability from expert judgment 11 p fospm yes ef 6 yes 0 75 12 p fospm yes ef 6 no 0 15 13 p fospm yes ef 7 yes 0 98 14 p fospm yes ef 7 no 0 05 according to equation 2 the connection probability can be obtained as pef6 0 759 and pef7 0 979 the unknown factor rcl with a confidence level of 99 obeys the gaussian probability density therefore pl is estimated to be 0 01 by equation 4 and the conditional probability distribution of fospm is shown in table 11 after considering the uncertainty in fig 10 the probability of lc dropped from 0 043189 to 0 027204 in the 20th week in the dbn model there are 20 time slices with a segment of one week since the drilling time of a well is roughly 20 weeks on an offshore platform due to failure and repair the different states of all nodes in each subsequent time segment have different probability values among them the failure rate and repair rate of all equipment factor nodes are shown in table 12 which comes from oreda oreda 2002 4 3 model verification the petri nets method is used to validate the proposed model in stochastic petri nets for reliability modeling λ represents the failure rates of components fig 11 shows that the petri nets model of the unreasonable well structure design uwsd the uwsd system can be divided into two subsystems without considering human factors one is composed of ef2 and the other is composed of ef1 and ef3 ef2 r indicates the normal working condition of ef2 while ef2 f indicates that ef2 has failed similarly system r indicates that the second subsystem is working normally and system f represents a failure λ1 λ2 and λ3 are the failure rates of ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively in the petri nets model the risk probability of the ef1 and ef3 subsystem is 0 0593 while that of the ef2 subsystem is 0 0268 in the established udbns model the risk probabilities of two subsystems are 0 0570 ef1 and ef3 and 0 0257 ef2 which is approximately equal to the petri nets model indicating the accuracy of the proposed udbns model 5 results and discussions 5 1 dynamic drilling risk as mentioned in the introduction section the deep water drilling process can be divided into four working conditions as 1 encountering ngh layer ngh 2 encountering associated gas ag 3 encountering both ngh and ag ngh ag 4 normal drilling conditions the established udbns are used to conduct a dynamic risk analysis of drilling engineering under different working conditions under normal operating conditions the udbns are established without considering the influence of ngh the udbns that encounter ngh and associated gas can be obtained by changing the environmental factor nodes sf6 in the udbns to sf7 and sf8 the probability of lc sticking the drill blockage of the bop and the successful shut in are obtained respectively in fig 12 it can be seen that the lc risk under the ngh ag working condition is higher than other working conditions in each time segment whose maximum risk probability is 0 03285 in the 20th week under normal conditions the risk of lc is the smallest which is 0 017425 in the 20th week ngh working conditions and ag working conditions are between the above two working conditions and the probability of lc in ngh working conditions is 0 003308 which is higher than that of ag working conditions after the equipment is repaired the risk probability reduces in the four working conditions and remains unchanged after the first week in particular it can be seen that the probability of bop clogging is the largest in the 20th week the probability value reaches 0 040708 under ngh ag conditions due to the influence of hydrate blockage the probability of well control shut in failure under ngh ag conditions increases to 0 558416 5 2 sensitivity analysis of equipment factors in this section the results of inspection prediction or diagnostic analysis are compared and analyzed by specific parameters since the dbn parameters are calculated based on the failure rate sensitivity analysis is performed by setting the relative deviation of the failure rate to 3 levels 30 60 and 90 the sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the relative changes rc of the probabilities of lc and shut in working conditions as equation 15 15 r c r i s k i p r i s k i p r i s k i p r i s k i 100 where rc risk i represents the relative change in the risk probability of the smd system at time i p r i s k i indicates the risk probability when the equipment failure rate is unchanged p r i s k i indicates the risk probability when the equipment failure rate changes fig 13 shows the relative risk probability changes in 20 weeks when the failure rate of equipment is increased by 60 under the four operating conditions the probability changes in lc and shut in failure conditions are affected by various equipment among them lc is affected by ef1 ef7 and shut in is affected by ef8 ef12 in fig 13 a and c under ngh and ngh ag conditions the change of ef7 poor borehole stability failure rate has the greatest effect on the probability of lc in fig 13 b and d the change of ef7 subsea pump failure failure rate has the greatest effect on the probability of lc under ag and normal operating conditions under these four conditions the change of ef11 bop failure failure rate has the greatest effect on the probability of shut in failure fig 14 shows that the system relative risk probability changes effected by different equipment failure changing rates in the 20th week with the increase in equipment failure rate the probability of occurrence of various risks is increased in all working conditions the relative risk probability increases linearly with the change in failure rate similarly it can be obtained that ef1 and ef7 have the greatest impact on the probability of lc ef11 has the greatest impact on the probability of shut in failure when the failure rate of these three types of equipment increases by 90 the probability of occurrence of the two risks will increase by more than 20 indicating that this equipment should be maintained and repaired in time 5 3 analysis of the strength of the influence of human factors this section assumes that the lc has occurred under which means the status of the lc event is yes as shown in fig 15 the time slice node of one month is used in the sensitivity analysis from the established udbns model the posterior probabilities of the root causes of human error are updated the ratio of posterior probability to prior probability is defined as a kind parameter to indicate the strength of the influence of human factors on the system risk fig 15 shows the degree of influence of various human factors on system risk in different time periods the higher the ratio of the posterior probability to the prior probability the more obvious the influence of the human factor node on the system risk probability can be obtained in the experiment at the beginning of the operation at t 0 the influence of human error is the strongest as time increases the influence of each human factor decreases as shown in fig 15 the influence of hf1 hf7 hf8 and hf9 is stronger than others human factors therefore managers should focus on the above reasons in actual operation 5 4 influence of ngh decomposition on dynamic risk the decomposition and secondary formation probability of ngh depend on the surrounding pressure and temperature in the drilling process the graph of ngh secondary formation is shown in fig 16 these lead to changes in the various risk probabilities of smd system drilling process which ultimately affect the probability of a successful shut in fig 17 shows the risk probability of lc under different temperature pressure and working conditions at the 20th week as can be seen the probability of occurrence of each risk decreases with the decrease in the probability of ngh secondary formation fig 17 a and d show that the decomposition probability of ngh under ngh ag and ngh ag work conditions have a limited effect on lc and shut in failure while the impact on sticking the drill and blockage of the bop is significant in fig 17 b and c the secondary formation of ngh can cause blockage resulting in a stuck drill which blocks bop 6 conclusions in this study an udbns cream approach is proposed to dynamically analyze the risk of deep water dual gradient drilling with smd system over time considering the influence of uncertain factors combined with dbn to establish an udbns model the prior probability of equipment failure is obtained by using fuzzy theory the cream method is used to calculate the probability of human factors finally the udbns cream model is established considering the influence of ngh the developed udbns model is used for the risk analysis of smd system drilling the dynamic risk probability under four working conditions is obtained 1 after adding uncertain factors the probability of risk has decreased 2 among the four working conditions the ngh ag working condition has the greatest probability of occurrence of various risks 3 maintenance can significantly reduce the risk and stabilize the risk probability frequent maintenance of drilling equipment can improve the reliability of the drilling system 4 in the sensitivity analysis ef1 ef7 and ef11 are obtained as more sensitive devices and the change of their failure rate has a more significant impact on the system 5 through the analysis of human factors human factors such as hf1 hf7 hf8 and hf9 should be conhas have sidered carefully to reduce the possibility of risk 6 when drilling into ngh the probability of lc sticking the drill and blockage of the bop in smd system is higher than under normal working conditions due to the decomposition and secondary formation of ngh the secondary formation of ngh will increase the probability of sticking the drill and blockage of the bop during drilling operations the second formation of ngh should be suppressed as much as possible to prevent the formation of blockage credit authorship contribution statement chuan wang conceptualization methodology data curation writing review editing yong xia formal analysis writing original draft

resolution schemes would be significantly effective to enhance the computational efficiency and adaptivity of the fully lagrangian meshfree fsi solvers including those developed within the framework of projection based particle methods it should be noted here that adaptivity is considered among the so called grand challenges of sph by spheric sph research and engineering international community

accurate and stable results their multi resolution model was also successively applied to heat conduction in laser irradiation process in the paper by tanaka et al 2019 khayyer et al 2019 proposed the first multi resolution projection based particle method for hydroelastic fsi problems namely enhanced multi resolution mps mps fsi solver leading to clear improvements of computational efficiency in the isph context multi resolution isph was developed by khorasanizade and sousa 2016 although the method simply utilized averaged influence lengths between target particle i and its neighboring particle j without using taylor series consistent differential operator models which may bring about inaccurate estimations of variables as reported by tanaka et al 2018 the present study targets development of a robust multi resolution scheme in the sph framework as well as an accurate and efficient fully lagrangian sph based hydroelastic fsi solver capable of dealing with adaptive

resolution scheme 2 3 1 common influence length and sph based spp scheme in this study a multi resolution scheme is proposed in the context of sph for development of an enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver the present multi resolution sph based scheme incorporates constant smoothing length i e the length is set based on the largest particle diameter in calculation domain a modified sph density definition and a modified spp space potential particle tsuruta et al 2015 scheme revised with respect to the sph framework fig 1 a presents the advantage of common influence length or common sph smoothing length h with respect to various influence lengths that vary in space based on the diameter and thus smoothing length of considered target particle according to the figure for the case of constant influence length small diameter particle k can detect particle i as its neighbor and i detects k as well as its neighbor meanwhile considering various influence length where the influence lengths are locally constructed on the basis of target particle s diameter small diameter particle j does not detect particle i as its neighbor while particle i detects j as a neighbor leading to an inconsistent particle based calculation fig 1 b shows a schematic illustration of the spp scheme in the sph context in the spp scheme spp particles are generated for compensation of void spaces caused by the mixture of particles in various sizes and ensure a full compact support for the target particles incorporation of spp scheme results in consistent particle based discretizations accurate volume conservation and proper consideration of truncated kernel domain implementation of spp scheme is of clear importance in multi resolution fsi simulations due to presence of truncated fluid boundaries in the vicinity of fluid structure interface especially for simulation cases with large fluid structure diameter ratios in the sph framework the spp of fluid particle i is placed based on the following equations 14 ρ i j m j w i j 15 ρ i s p p ρ 0 ρ i f o r ρ 0 ρ i 0 f o r ρ 0 ρ i 16 w i i s p p w r i s p p r i ρ i s p p v i r i s p p r i r i s p p r i r g i r g i 17 r g i j j r i j v j w

fluid particle i in addition r g i denotes the relative coordinate vector of the centroid of the neighboring particles to target particle i note that eq 14 is valid here since the spp is defined solely for a target fluid particle with neighboring fluid particles of the same volume and the same density it should be highlighted here that this paper formulates and implements the spp concept in sph context for the first time 2 3 2 multi resolution fluid structure coupling scheme the developed multi resolution isph sph fsi solver includes a physically mathematically compatible coupling scheme referred to as fsa fluid structure acceleration based scheme proposed by khayyer et al 2018a in the fsa scheme in the calculation of fluid phase structure particles are incorporated as a moving boundary i e velocities and positions of structure particles are utilized as boundary conditions for solving the ppe corresponding to the fluid phase in the multi resolution fsi simulations both volume and density fields become discontinuous at fluid structure interface in order to precisely treat these discontinuities a careful sph definition of density must be considered in the sph literature the density of a target particle i is in general estimated as either ρ i m i j w i j e g hu and adams 2006 or ρ i j m j w i j e g monaghan 1992 shao and lo 2003 in this study a revised definition of density is considered as follows 20 ρ i ρ 0 i j v j w i j where ρ 0i stands for the physical initial or reference density of target particle i fig 2 shows a schematic presentation of possible sph density definitions four different cases are considered with respect to presence of density and or volume discontinuities corresponding to single phase single resolution case i multi phase single resolution case ii single phase multi resolution case iii and multi phase multi resolution case iv simulations for case i single phase single resolution e g inner fluid domain all sph density definitions are consistent for other cases however the calculated densities at a typical target particle may not become equal to the physical or reference density ρ 0 e g in case of water ρ 0 1000 kg m3 in particular and as shown in fig 2 estimations of density by either ρ i m i j w i j or ρ i j m j w i j for either fluid or structure would not become equal to the physical or reference density ρ 0 ρ f or ρ s at fluid structure interface that comprises of different spatial computational resolutions and densities case iv on the other hand the modified sph density definition eq 20 provides consistent values of density with respect to physical ones at fluid structure interface in all considered cases cases i to iv hence in this multi resolution framework eq 20 is considered for sph definition of density it must be highlighted here that except at fluid structure interface and its vicinity eq 3 or 14 would be perfectly equivalent to eq 20 with respect to eq 20 and considering the derivation of hs scheme that includes time derivative of density khayyer et al 2009 eq 5 is reformulated as 21 d ρ d t i c ρ 0 i j v j w i j u i j the modified definition of density eq 20 and modified source term eq 21 result in consistent and precise calculations in multi resolution projection based sph fsi solvers it should be noted that the newly considered sph density definition for multi resolution fsi simulations is utilized in hl eq 6 and gc eq 7 schemes however since derivative of density is not involved in their derivations gotoh et al 2014 there will be no change in formulation of these schemes after obtaining pressure field of fluid phase through solving the ppe the structure acceleration term induced by hydrodynamic pressure gradient at the fluid structure interface a fs is estimated fig 3 through applying the fsa coupling scheme the boundary conditions at the fluid structure interface koshizuka 2005 antoci et al 2007 khayyer et al 2018a i e 22 u s u f 23 σ i n t s n s σ i n t f n f are automatically satisfied n s and n f are normal vectors of structure and fluid interfaces in eq 23 σ int denotes the stress tensor interacting between fluid and structure fig 3 illustrates a schematic presentation regarding normal stress continuity in single and multi resolution isph sph hydroelastic fsi simulations for the single resolution case as shown in fig 3 a the pressure gradients between a pair of fluid f and structure s particles are equivalent in principle i e p fs p sf accordingly the components normal to the fluid structure interface would be opposite in direction and equal in magnitude i e the following relation would be true for every pair of fluid and structure particles 24 p fs n f p sf n s this relation would be equivalent to eq 23 portraying the continuity of normal stresses fig 3 b illustrates the concept of stress continuity in multi resolution simulation considering a typical case corresponding to diameter ratio of d f d s 2 0 v s m 1 4 v s m symbolizes a fine particle corresponding to a portion of its related coarse particle as an example for this case the momentum transfer due to the pressure gradient can be written as 25 ρ f v f p sf ρ f m 4 ρ f v f p s m f ρ f m 4 v f p s m p f v s m w s m f 26 ρ s v s p fs ρ s m 4 ρ s m v s m p f s m ρ s m m 4 v s m p f p s m v f w f s m considering the relation of w f s m w s m f v f v s v s m 1 4 v s and ρ s ρ s m the relation p fs p sf can be derived in multi resolution case indicating normal stress continuity at the fluid structure interface in multi resolution isph sph hydroelastic fsi simulations note that a similar discussion can be presented for other diameter ratio cases another example namely case of d f d s 3 0 is presented in fig 3 c to emphasize this aspect in this case the number of fine particles corresponding to the volume of a coarse particle would be 9 and thus the volume of every fine structure particles would be 1 9 of that of a coarse structure particle considered in single resolution case i e v s m 1 9 v s as portrayed in fig 3 c for this case also the normal stress continuity condition at fluid structure interface would be achieved and this would be the case for other fluid structure particle diameter ratios through application of the fsa scheme in multi resolution hydroelastic fsi simulations 2 4 determination of calculation time step for semi implicit fluid model and explicit structure model the computational time step sizes for fluid and structure δt f and δt s are defined according to courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and preset maximum allowable time step sizes δ t max f and δ t max s similar to the works by khayyer et al 2019 or lin et al 2015 27 δ t f min c c f l d min f u max f c c f l d min s u max s δ t max f 28 δ t s min c c f l d min s u max s c c f l c d min s c max s δ t max s where c cfl and c cfl c represent the cfl numbers c cfl 0 2 and c cfl c 1 0 u max f and u max s correspond to the maximum velocity magnitudes in fluid and structure sub domains d min f and d min s signify the minimum particle diameters in fluid and structure sub domains and c max s refers to maximum speed of sound in structure phase speed of sound of p wave in general c max s k s 3 g s 4 ρ s with k s and g s representing bulk modulus and shear modulus respectively the structure phase considers the cfl condition based on the speed of sound c s due to its explicit algorithm while such sound speed dependency does not exist in the time step criteria of fluid phase due to its semi implicit algorithm therefore the time step size and maximum time step size of structure phase will be considerably smaller than that of fluid phase accordingly in order to achieve consistent time advancement between fluid and structure phases during one step calculation of fluid the structure calculations should be conducted consecutively for κ δt f δt s times with fluid particles being spatially fixed note that in this study the maximum allowable time step size of structure δ t max s is set as δ t max s 0 005 δ t max f it must be noted that the time advancement criteria can be further enhanced especially for hydroelastic fsi corresponding to stiff structures through implementation of an implicit sph based structure solver e g peer et al 2018 along with higher order implicit time integration schemes e g shimizu et al 2019 3 numerical validations and investigations in this section the stability and accuracy of developed enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver are investigated by conducting benchmark tests including hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate fourey et al 2017 sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped elastic baffle idelsohn et al 2008 sloshing in a rolling tank with a hanging elastic baffle idelsohn et al 2008 and dam break with an elastic plate liao et al 2014 2015 comparisons will be also conducted in between proposed multi resolution isph sph and i multi resolution explicit isph sph in section 3 1 and ii multi resolution mps mps by khayyer et al 2019 in section 3 4 3 1 hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the first benchmark test for validation of enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver corresponds to hydrostatic water column on an elastic aluminum plate fourey et al 2017 where a theoretical equilibrium solution fourey et al 2017 exists fig 4 illustrates the computational setup of this benchmark test the width of water tank is 1 0 m and the water depth is 2 0 m the bottom of water tank comprises of a 5 0 cm h e 0 05 m thick elastic plate with a density of 2700 kg m3 ρ s 2700 kg m3 young s modulus of 67 5 gpa e s 67 5 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 34 υ s 0 34 the plate is suddenly loaded with the weight of a water column at t 0 s with the progress of simulation the fsi system eventually arrives at an equilibrium state with a certain static deformation of the plate as provided in the paper of fourey et al 2017 the theoretical static deflection at the mid span of the plate is equal to 6 85e 05 m the diameter of structure particles corresponds to h e d s 10 and the maximum allowable time step size for fluid is set equal to δt f max 2 0e 5 s fig 5 presents typical snapshots of particles together with pressure stress fields reproduced by proposed multi resolution fsi solver at t 0 5 s with three different diameter ratios of d f d s 1 0 2 0 and 2 5 according to the figure the developed multi resolution fsi solver appears to possess acceptable robustness and accuracy in reproduction of smooth and noise free pressure stress fields for all considered diameter ratios from the enlarged portions of the presented figure the continuity of particle distributions at the fluid structure interface is also well evident for all considered diameter ratios fig 6 portrays time variations of plate s mid span deflection simulated by the multi resolution isph sph fsi solver as shown in this figure almost similar results are obtained for all considered diameter ratios in all three considered resolutions the system is shown to reach an equilibrium state this classical benchmark test also allows us to test the energy conservation properties of the developed multi resolution hydroelastic fsi solver because the fsi system is a thermodynamically isolated system with no exchange of heat work with surroundings the total energy of the overall fsi system must remain invariant fig 7 shows time variations of a b normalized total energy of the overall fsi system and c kinetic energy of fluid phase fig 7 a and b portray gradual approaches towards equilibrium state and at the same time depict acceptable energy conservation property of the proposed multi resolution isph sph fsi solver less than 0 4 energy dissipation for 10 s of computation for all considered diameter ratios it should be noted here that fig 7 a shows variation of normalized total energy up to 1 s to clearly present the initial variation of total energy of the fsi system to present establishment of a thermodynamic equilibrium state by all three considered cases fig 7 b is presented which shows normalized total energy variation up to 10 s in addition according to fig 7 c after initial oscillations caused by sudden exposure of fluid structure particles to the gravitational acceleration as discussed in khayyer et al 2018a the kinetic energies of fluid phase particles gradually reach almost constant values close to zero corresponding to an equilibrium state table 1 shows the total particle number as well as cpu time for 1 s of simulation 1 s of physical time from this table application of multi resolution scheme with d f d s 2 and 2 5 has resulted in gradual reductions of required cpu time in specific cpu times for calculation of fluid phase i e prediction and correction steps are clearly shown to be reduced with coarser computational resolutions note that all simulations of this study are performed on a supercomputer system at kyoto university laurel 2 cpu of intel xeon broadwell 18 cores 2 1 ghz x 2 node and ram of 128 gb for all calculations related to computational cost 4 core 8 thread of cpu 2 1 ghz and 8 gb memories are used and the ppe matrix is solved by the intel mkl pardiso parallel direct solver as stated in the introduction several efforts have been made in simplifying the solution process of projection based particle methods through assumption of negligible time variations of pressure in small calculation time steps examples include hosseini et al 2007 rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 nomeritae et al 2016 this simplification of solution process allows an explicit calculation of pressure instead of an implicit one without the need for solving a global matrix equation of ppe and corresponding simultaneous linear equations which results in easy parallel computing on both cpu and gpu on the other hand this simplification would lead to imprecise projection of intermediate velocity field into a divergence free space a simple comparison is conducted here in order to highlight the significance of truly projection based particle methods including a proper solution for global matrix equation of ppe accordingly the results by proposed isph sph fsi solver are compared with those obtained by an explicit isph eisph sph fsi solver the only difference in between the coded eisph sph and isph sph methods corresponds to solution of ppe in the eisph the matrix equation of ppe a x b where a is a coefficient matrix x is the unknown column vector corresponding to pressure b is the source term column vector is simply discretized as follows hosseini et al 2007 rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 nomeritae et al 2016 29 p i k 1 b i j a i j p j k j a i j as previously stated in eq 29 an assumption of negligible pressure variation in one computational time step p j k 1 p j k is considered thus allowing an explicit calculation of pressure fig 8 a presents a qualitative comparison in between snapshots by isph sph and eisph sph at t 0 2 s with fluid structure diameter ratio of d f d s 2 0 from the presented figure the reproduced pressure fields by both solvers are smooth however the eisph sph has resulted in pressure overestimations performances of isph sph and eisph sph are also clearly portrayed in fig 8 b that presents theoretical and calculated time variations of deflections at the mid span of plate according to fig 8 b the result by eisph sph is characterized by relatively large oscillations of plate the oscillations are minimized as simulation proceeds however small scale oscillations persist indicating the failure of reaching an equilibrium state indeed the unphysical oscillations of plate bring about instabilities and inaccuracies in the hydrodynamics pressure field as well fig 8 c provides time variations of normalized total energy by isph sph and eisph sph the energy time history of isph sph is shown to be relatively smooth and more conservative in comparison to that of eisph sph the cause of observed differences in between isph sph and eisph sph is related to the calculation procedure of ppe the solution process of eisph eq 29 has similarity to an iterative method namely the jacobi method in the jacobi method pressure is calculated by successively solving eq 29 until the solutions converge however in the eisph eq 29 is solved only once without any iteration being involved in other words the obtained pressure by the eisph algorithm may contain considerable errors and thus would not guarantee a rigorous projection of the intermediate velocity field into a divergence free space in specific in this test case the main cause of instabilities and inaccuracies seen in eisph sph results arises from the inconsistent and imprecise calculation of pressure at the fluid structure interface 3 2 sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped elastic baffle an experiment of sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped

with baffles have been considered for verification e g sloshing in tank with rigid baffle e g chu et al 2018 or with elastic baffle e g hwang et al 2016 fig 9 presents a schematic illustration of the computational setup of this benchmark test at the center of the tank s bottom an elastic baffle is clamped and interacts with the fluid phase the material of the baffle corresponds to dielectric polyurethane resin the density and young s modulus of the baffle is ρ s 1100 kg m3 and e s 6 0 mpa respectively the fluid is sunflower oil with a density of 917 kg m3 ρ f 917 kg m3 and a kinematic

fields reproduced by proposed multi resolution fsi solver with a set of different diameter ratios d f d s 1 0 2 0 and 2 5 at three instants of t 1 84 s t 2 32 s and t 2 56 s respectively these figures demonstrate that the enhanced multi resolution isph sph has performed well with respect to reproduced stress pressure fields as well as their correspondence in all considered fluid structure diameter ratios in addition according to the enlarged views no unphysical gap appears in between fluid and structure phases for all resolution ratios thanks to the implemented multi resolution framework along with a consistent fluid structure coupling scheme with refining the fluid s resolution from d f d s 2 5 to d f d s 1 0 the quality of reproduced pressure field is gradually improved and eventually for d f d s 1 0 a qualitatively accurate pressure field with minimized local pressure noise is obtained the free surface profiles observed in simulations appear to be slightly more violent with respect to those in the experiment which may have been caused by underestimation of fluid viscous accelerations or difference of dimensions 2d simulation vs 3d experiment for improvement of this issue more consistent formulation of viscosity e g corrected isph khayyer et al 2008 as well as extension of simulations to 3d will be considered in our future works fig 13 shows the time variations of displacements of elastic baffle s free end simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver with different diameter ratios according to the presented figure all reproduced results corresponding to considered diameter ratios are well consistent with each other and the experimental data idelsohn et al 2008 note that the present multi resolution fsi solver performs well in a simulation where shear stresses play an important role due to presence of a highly viscous fluid i e the obtained results indicate accurate computations of shear stresses as well as normal stresses in a hydroelastic fsi test corresponding to violent sloshing flows table 2 presents the total particle number and cpu time for 1 s of simulation according to this table utilization of coarse fluid particles i e d f d s 2 and 2 5 leads to notable reductions of required cpu time it is also clear that due to reduction of total particle numbers by implementation of multi resolution scheme total required memory which is directly proportional to number of particles in domain would be also reduced reduction of required memory is an important matter especially for 3d simulations where considerably more particles are involved and thus resulting in a considerably large size matrix of ppe 3 3 sloshing in a rolling tank with a hanging elastic baffle sloshing in a rolling tank with a hanging elastic baffle idelsohn et al 2008 is simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver fig 14 portrays a schematic presentation of the computational setup of this benchmark test the sloshing fluid is water with a depth of 0 0575 m the material of the elastic baffle corresponds to a commercial neoprene rubber with a density of 1900 kg m3 ρ s 1900 kg m3 and young s modulus of 4 0 mpa e s 4 0 mpa a rolling motion with a maximum amplitude of 2 and a period of 1 646 s is applied to the tank idelsohn et al 2008 the particle diameter of structure and maximum allowable time step size for fluid are considered as d s 8 0e 4 m and δt f max 4 0e 5 s respectively figs 15 and 16 present typical snapshots of particles together with von mises stress pressure fields reproduced by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver with a set of different diameter ratios d f d s 1 0 2 0 and 2 5 at three instants of t 1 84 s t 2 92 s and t 3 32 s respectively these presented figures illustrate that for all considered resolution cases the enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver has reproduced smooth pressure field furthermore the water surface profiles appear to be almost consistent with those of the experiment for all diameter ratios fig 17 presents the time variations of displacements of the free end of the elastic baffle simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver with different diameter ratios along with experimental data idelsohn et al 2008 from this figure the time variations simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph solver are almost consistent with that of experiment in terms of the trend of variations and the amplitude of displacements although the results corresponding to different diameter ratios are consistent with each other some minor discrepancies in between simulation results and experimental data are observed that are expected to be minimized through application of more advanced and proper constitutive equations for structure model table 3 shows the information on total particle numbers as well as cpu time for 1 s of simulation of the considered benchmark test from this table the cpu cost related to calculation of fluid phase is found to be reduced by incorporating multi resolution framework in specific through consideration of fluid structure diameter ratios of d f d s 2 0 and d f d s 2 5 the overall cpu times are reduced by about 35 and 40 respectively 3 4 dam break with an elastic plate a dam break with an elastic plate liao et al 2014 2015 is simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver this test has been considered as a challenging and proper benchmark test for validation of hydroelastic fsi solvers e g sun et al 2019a fig 18 a shows a schematic illustration of the computational setup of this benchmark test the elastic plate is 0 004 m in thickness with a density of 1161 54 kg m3 ρ s 1161 54 kg m3 and young s modulus of 3 5 mpa e s 3 5 mpa the particle size of structure and maximum allowable time step size for fluid are considered as d s 1 0e 3 m and δt f max 1 5e 4 s respectively fig 18 b e presents snapshots of particles together with pressure stress fields by enhanced multi resolution isph sph with four different diameter ratios d f d s 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 at t 0 35 s according to these figures and the presented enlarged views for all diameter ratios the enhanced multi resolution isph sph has reproduced smooth and stable stress pressure fields without any unphysical gap at the interface boundary of fluid and structure from the presented figure the reproduced pressure stress fields appear to be quite close in magnitude and in almost fine correspondence with their corresponding experimental photo fig 19 depicts the time variations of the displacements of the elastic plate s free end reproduced by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver along with that corresponding to the experiment liao et al 2014 2015 this figure further confirms the consistency of enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver since results for all considered diameter ratios are quite close to each other and in acceptable agreements with the experimental data it must be noted here that observed discrepancies are expected to be minimized through incorporation of a more proper constitutive equation for the structure and consideration of air water two phase model in specific after the water jet impacts on the right wall after around t 0 45 s air cavities are entrapped inside the water phase and the entrapped cavities affect the flow field as observed in the experiment liao et al 2015 as well as the numerical study by sun et al 2019a development of air water structure multi phase multi physics solver will be conducted as a future work table 4 portrays the total particle numbers as well as required cpu time for 1 s of simulation this table shows that the implementation of the present multi resolution framework would lead to a notable reduction of computational cost and required memory for this specific test through consideration of fluid structure diameter ratios of d f d s 1 5 and d f d s 2 5 the overall cpu times are decreased by about 50 and 75 respectively indeed depending on the targeted problem and number of fluids structure particles this reduction percentage in cpu time would be different however the conducted test cases clearly portray that utilization of proposed multi resolution framework results in enhancement of computational efficiency without notable reduction of accuracy figs 20 and 21 portray qualitative quantitative comparisons in between results of enhanced multi resolution isph sph and those by enhanced multi resolution mps mps khayyer et al 2019 in simulation of the considered dam break with an elastic plate from figs 20 and 21 both sph and mps based solvers have resulted in qualitatively acceptable results with respect to the experiment meanwhile the sph based solver appears to have resulted in superior hydrodynamic pressure field from fig 21 the results by sph and mps based solvers seem to be well comparable incorporation of a more proper constitutive equation for the structure model that can better treat the material non linearities is expected to improve the accuracy of both fsi solvers in order to further investigate the robustness of proposed sph based hydroelastic solver and at the same time compare its performance with respect to our mps based hydroelastic fsi solver khayyer et al 2019 simulations of dam break with an elastic plate are re conducted by considering larger values for the fluid to structure diameter ratios i e d f d s being equal to 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 fig 22 presents a qualitative comparison in between enhanced multi resolution isph sph and enhanced multi resolution mps mps fsi solvers from the presented figure reproduction of a more accurate hydrodynamic pressure field by the sph based solver has become more evident as the difference of fluid structure computational resolutions is increased this indicates that the moving structure particles that are of different resolutions with respect to the fluid particles have provided more accurate boundary conditions for the ppe in the sph framework in order to portray the effectiveness of the implementation of spp scheme in multi resolution hydroelastic fsi simulations fig 23 presents a qualitative comparison in between results by enhanced multi resolution isph sph with and without the spp scheme from the presented figure incorporation of the spp scheme has had a clear effect on smoothness of pressure field in fluid this is achieved as inclusion of spp enhances the consistency of approximations at and in the vicinity of truncated boundaries e g fluid structure interface it should be noted that incorporation of spp scheme would in particular facilitate multi resolution calculations characterized by relatively large d f d s where target fluid particles in the vicinity of fluid structure interface would have truncated kernel domains in this case the generated space potential particle spp that represents the truncated kernel domain void region of a target fluid particle would contribute to provide position velocity boundary conditions for the ppe in case of large fluid structure diameter ratios fluid particles located on one side of the structure may see the fluid particles on the other side as their neighbors in such a case we need to ensure that accurate velocity position boundary conditions are being provided for pressure solution at every target fluid particle to ensure that the obtained pressure is precise corresponding to a divergence free velocity field in a projection based solution of fluid phase in such a case fluid particles on one side of the structure are simply ignored when seen by a target fluid particle on the other side this would bring about truncated kernel domains and then for every target fluid particle a corresponding spp would be generated to represent that void space and providing position velocity boundary conditions corresponding to that truncated kernel domain 4 concluding

fluid to structure d f d s the proposed enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver has reproduced smooth stress pressure fields and consistent structure deflection time variations indicating acceptable accuracy consistency of the method furthermore it is shown that through decreasing the computational spatial resolution in fluid considerable reductions of the computational costs are achieved with maintaining reasonable accuracy and stability the proposed enhanced multi resolution isph sph is also shown to outperform two other particle based fsi solvers namely the eisph sph fsi

extension of proposed solver to three dimensions in this appendix a preliminary trial to extend the proposed multi resolution fsi solver to three dimensions is presented in order to portray the

with pressure stress fields simulated by 3d enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver with a diameter ratio of d f d s 2 5 the presented figure shows that stable and continuous stress pressure fields are obtained with almost regular particle distributions near free surface as well as fluid structure interface without presence of any unphysical gaps or interparticle penetrations at fluid structure interface this important feature is achieved without application of any artificial numerical stabilizer the reproduced pressure field is almost noise free however improvements must be made with respect to theoretical considerations of the projection particle methods namely helmholtz leray decomposition and corresponding boundary conditions foias et al 2001 in fig a2 a three dimensional view of fig a1 is presented to portray the performance of 3d enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver from a qualitative perspective note that half of the fluid particles are not shown in order to demonstrate reproduced pressure field in the fluid as well as reproduced stress field in the structure in general the reproduced pressure stress fields are found to be smooth and qualitatively accurate fig a3 portrays time variations of the displacements of the elastic plate s free end reproduced by 2d 3d enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solvers along with that corresponding to the experiment liao et al 2014 2015 the deflection time history by 3d isph sph is consistent with that by 2d isph sph in particular with respect to deflection starting instant and maximum deflection magnitude furthermore the deflection time variation of 3d isph sph shows acceptable agreement with respect to the experiment the obtained preliminary results suggest effectiveness and robustness of the proposed multi resolution isph sph framework for 3d simulations however the development of 3d multi resolution isph sph should be accompanied by scrupulous validations not only in terms of stability and accuracy but also conservation and convergence properties with respect to both analytical and experimental data 
20928,a sph smoothed particle hydrodynamics based multi resolution fully lagrangian meshfree hydroelastic fsi fluid structure interaction solver is developed for accurate and adaptive reproductions of ocean engineering problems the presented hydroelastic fsi solver comprises of projection based isph incompressible sph fluid model and sph structure model through consideration of continuity navier

solvers are potentially advantageous in terms of computational flexibility and precise imposition of boundary conditions at the fluid structure interface regarding fully lagrangian meshfree projection based fsi solvers rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 proposed a fully explicit isph sph solver through assumption of negligible pressure time variations in small calculation time steps that could lead to an explicit solution of poisson pressure equation ppe hwang et al 2014 developed an mps based fsi solver this fsi solver was further enhanced by khayyer et al 2017a by incorporating several refined schemes for mps fluid model khayyer et al 2018a proposed an isph sph fsi solver that coupled an enhanced isph fluid model with a sph structure model through incorporation of a conservative coupling

established in the hamiltonian mechanics framework i e hmps or hsph hamiltonian mps or hamiltonian sph have been coupled with enhanced mps isph fluid models by khayyer et al 2018b despite possessing advantageous features for reproduction of fsi phenomena encountered in ocean engineering fully lagrangian meshfree computational methods face challenges corresponding to requirements of relatively considerable computational memory and cost chow et al 2018 in specific single resolution solvers discretize the fluid and structure computational domains uniformly leading to extremely fine computational resolutions for many encountered fsi problems e g large scale fsi problems including thin deformable structures besides as for projection based fully lagrangian meshfree fsi solvers that integrate different computational algorithms for fluid semi implicit algorithm and structure explicit algorithm and require solution for a global matrix corresponding to ppe for the fluid phase adaptive set up of the computational resolutions for fluid structure computational domains will result in considerable improvements of computational efficiency accordingly incorporation of multi resolution schemes would be significantly effective to enhance the computational efficiency and adaptivity of the fully lagrangian meshfree fsi solvers including those developed within the framework of projection based particle methods it should be noted here that adaptivity is considered among the so called grand challenges of sph by spheric sph research and engineering international community in the framework of particle methods a number of studies have aimed at developing multi resolution schemes both for weakly compressible sph wcsph monaghan 1992 and projection based particle methods i

adaptive particle refinement apr technique where the adaptive mesh refinement concept in mesh based methods berger and oliger 1984 was extended to sph sun et al 2018 and sun et al 2019a implemented the apr scheme in their delta plus sph code and reproduced high reynolds number flows interacting with various shape objects hu et al 2019 developed multi resolution wcsph method capable of dynamic splitting merging and successively conducted fsi simulations with high resolution around the regions of interest near fluid structure interfaces and low resolution elsewhere hu et al 2020 reproduced an fsi problem of water entry of a rigid cylinder by wcsph with dynamic particle refinement as for multi resolution projection based particle methods the first multi resolution mps method was proposed by koshizuka 2005 although the method did not guarantee consistency of pairwise interparticle forces tsuruta et al 2016 developed an enhanced multi resolution mps method providing continuous interaction forces between a pair of particles owing to the implemented concepts of common radius of influence revised weight function and space potential particle spp tanaka et al 2018 developed a multi resolution mps method capable of dynamic particle splitting coalescing with an averaged radius of influence between target particle and its neighboring particle resulting in sufficiently accurate and stable results their multi resolution model was also successively applied to heat conduction in laser irradiation process in the paper by tanaka et al 2019 khayyer et al 2019 proposed the first multi resolution projection based particle method for hydroelastic fsi problems namely enhanced multi resolution mps mps fsi solver leading to clear improvements of computational efficiency in the isph context multi resolution isph was developed by khorasanizade and sousa 2016 although the method simply utilized averaged influence lengths between target particle i and its neighboring particle j without using taylor series consistent differential operator models which may bring about inaccurate estimations of variables as reported by tanaka et al 2018 the present study targets development of a robust multi resolution scheme in the sph framework as well as an accurate and efficient fully lagrangian sph based hydroelastic fsi solver capable of dealing with adaptive refinements of fluid structure domains an enhanced version of isph method with several refined schemes is adopted as fluid model providing accurate solutions for continuity and navier stokes equations the structure model is founded in the framework of classical newtonian mechanics i e conservation of linear angular momenta with sph based discretizations khayyer et al 2018a the fluid structure coupling is carried out in a physically mathematically consistent way through incorporation of so called fsa fluid structure acceleration based scheme khayyer et al 2018a a newly developed sph based multi resolution framework comprising of a common influence length or common sph smoothing length h a modified sph density definition along with a careful modification of ppe s source term as well as a modified sph based space potential particle spp tsuruta et al 2015 scheme is incorporated for development of multi resolution isph sph fsi solver the proposed enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi

elastic plate liao et al 2014 2015 through consideration of different spatial computational resolutions for fluid and structure phases verifications are carried out qualitatively quantitatively mainly through considerations of pressure stress fields and structure deformation time histories for a set of different fluid structure diameter ratios comparisons are also made in between proposed multi

publications e g khayyer et al 2018c khayyer et al 2017c shimizu et al 2018 2 2 structure model the governing equations for structure correspond to linear angular momentum conservation equations

resolution scheme 2 3 1 common influence length and sph based spp scheme in this study a multi resolution scheme is proposed in the context of sph for development of an enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver the present multi resolution sph based scheme incorporates constant smoothing length i e the length is set based on the largest particle diameter in calculation domain a modified sph density definition and a modified spp space potential particle tsuruta et al 2015 scheme revised with respect to the sph framework fig 1 a presents the advantage of common influence length or common sph smoothing length h with respect to various influence lengths that vary in space based on the diameter and thus smoothing length of considered target particle according to the figure for the case of constant influence length small diameter particle k can detect particle i as its neighbor and i detects k as well as its neighbor meanwhile considering various influence length where the influence lengths are locally constructed on the basis of target particle s diameter small diameter particle j does not detect particle i as its neighbor while particle i detects j as a neighbor leading to an inconsistent particle based calculation fig 1 b shows a schematic illustration of the spp scheme in the sph context in the spp scheme spp particles are generated for compensation of void spaces caused by the mixture of particles in various sizes and ensure a full compact support for the target particles incorporation of spp scheme results in consistent particle based discretizations accurate volume conservation and proper consideration of truncated kernel domain implementation of spp scheme is of clear importance in multi resolution fsi simulations due to presence of truncated fluid boundaries in the vicinity of fluid structure interface especially for simulation cases with large fluid structure diameter ratios in the sph framework the spp of fluid particle i is placed based on the following equations 14 ρ i j m j w i j 15 ρ i s p p ρ 0 ρ i f o r ρ 0 ρ i 0 f o r ρ 0 ρ i 16 w i i s p p w r i s p p r i ρ i s p p v i r i s p p r i r i s p p r i r g i r g i 17 r g i j j r i j v j w i j j j i a nd j i s p p 18 u i s p p u i 19 ρ i s p p η ρ i s p p ρ i s p p ρ i s p p η η ρ i s p p m i w i i where r ispp and u ispp represent the position and velocity vectors of spp for target fluid particle i in addition r g i denotes the relative coordinate vector of the centroid of the neighboring particles to target particle i note that eq 14 is valid here since the spp is defined solely for a target fluid particle with neighboring fluid particles of the same volume and the same density it should be highlighted here that this paper formulates and implements the spp concept in sph context for the first time 2 3 2 multi resolution fluid structure coupling scheme the developed multi resolution isph sph fsi solver includes a physically mathematically compatible coupling scheme referred to as fsa fluid structure acceleration based scheme proposed by khayyer et al 2018a in the fsa scheme in the calculation of fluid phase structure particles are incorporated as a moving boundary i e velocities and positions of structure particles are utilized as boundary conditions for solving the ppe corresponding to the fluid phase in the multi resolution fsi simulations both volume and density fields become discontinuous at fluid structure interface in order to precisely treat these discontinuities a careful sph definition of density must be considered in the sph literature the density of a target particle i is in general estimated as either ρ i m i j w i j e g hu and adams 2006 or ρ i j m j w i j e g monaghan 1992 shao and lo 2003 in this study a revised definition of density is considered as follows 20 ρ i ρ 0 i j v j w i j where ρ 0i stands for the physical initial or reference density of target particle i fig 2 shows a schematic presentation of possible sph density definitions four different cases are considered with respect to presence of density and or volume discontinuities corresponding to single phase single resolution case i multi phase single resolution case ii single phase multi resolution case iii and multi phase multi resolution case iv simulations for case i single phase single resolution e g inner fluid domain all sph density definitions are consistent for other cases however the calculated densities at a typical target particle may not become equal to the physical or reference density ρ 0 e g in case of water ρ 0 1000 kg m3 in particular and as shown in fig 2 estimations of density by either ρ i m i j w i j or ρ i j m j w i j for either fluid or structure would not become equal to the physical or reference density ρ 0 ρ f or ρ s at fluid structure interface that comprises of different spatial computational resolutions and densities case iv on the other hand the modified sph density definition eq 20 provides consistent values of density with respect to physical ones at fluid structure interface in all considered cases cases i to iv hence in this multi resolution framework eq 20 is considered for sph definition of density it must be highlighted here that except at fluid structure interface and its vicinity eq 3 or 14 would be perfectly equivalent to eq 20 with respect to eq 20 and considering the derivation of hs scheme that includes time derivative of density khayyer et al 2009 eq 5 is reformulated as 21 d ρ d t i c ρ 0 i j v j w i j u i j the modified definition of density eq 20 and modified source term eq 21 result in consistent and precise calculations in multi resolution projection based sph fsi solvers it should be noted that the newly considered sph density definition for multi resolution fsi simulations is utilized in hl eq 6 and gc eq 7 schemes however since derivative of density is not involved in their derivations gotoh et al 2014 there will be no change in formulation of these schemes after obtaining pressure field of fluid phase through solving the ppe the structure acceleration term induced by hydrodynamic pressure gradient at the fluid structure interface a fs is estimated fig 3 through applying the fsa coupling scheme the boundary conditions at the fluid structure interface koshizuka 2005 antoci et al 2007 khayyer et al 2018a i e 22 u s u f 23 σ i n t s n s σ i n t f n f are automatically satisfied n s and n f are normal vectors of structure and fluid interfaces in eq 23 σ int denotes the stress tensor interacting between fluid and structure fig 3 illustrates a schematic presentation regarding normal stress continuity in single and multi resolution isph sph hydroelastic fsi simulations for the single resolution case as shown in fig 3 a the pressure gradients between a pair of fluid f and structure s particles are equivalent in principle i e p fs p sf accordingly the components normal to the fluid structure interface would be opposite in direction and equal in magnitude i e the following relation would be true for every pair of fluid and structure particles 24 p fs n f p sf n s this relation would be equivalent to eq 23 portraying the continuity of normal stresses fig 3 b illustrates the concept of stress continuity in multi resolution simulation considering a typical case corresponding to diameter ratio of d f d s 2 0 v s m 1 4 v s m symbolizes a fine particle corresponding to a portion of its related coarse particle as an example for this case the momentum transfer due to the pressure gradient can be written as 25 ρ f v f p sf ρ f m 4 ρ f v f p s m f ρ f m 4 v f p s m p f v s m w s m f 26 ρ s v s p fs ρ s m 4 ρ s m v s m p f s m ρ s m m 4 v s m p f p s m v f w f s m considering the relation of w f s m w s m f v f v s v s m 1 4 v s and ρ s ρ s m the relation p fs p sf can be derived in multi resolution case indicating normal stress continuity at the fluid structure interface in multi resolution isph sph hydroelastic fsi simulations note that a similar discussion can be presented for other diameter ratio cases another example namely case of d f d s 3 0 is presented in fig 3 c to emphasize this aspect in this case the number of fine particles corresponding to the volume of a coarse particle would be 9 and thus the volume of every fine structure particles would be 1 9 of that of a coarse structure particle considered in single resolution case i e v s m 1 9 v s as portrayed in fig 3 c for this case also the normal stress continuity condition at fluid structure interface would be achieved and this would be the case for other fluid structure particle diameter ratios through application of the fsa scheme in multi resolution hydroelastic fsi simulations 2 4 determination of calculation time step for semi implicit fluid model and explicit structure model the computational time step sizes for fluid and structure δt f and δt s are defined according to courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and preset maximum allowable time step sizes δ t max f and δ t max s similar to the works by khayyer et al 2019 or lin et al 2015 27 δ t f min c c f l d min f u max f c c f l d min s u max s δ t max f 28 δ t s min c c f l d min s u max s c c f l c d min s c max s δ t max s where c cfl and c cfl c represent the cfl numbers c cfl 0 2 and c cfl c 1 0 u max f and u max s correspond to the maximum velocity magnitudes in fluid and structure sub domains d min f and d min s signify the minimum particle diameters in fluid and structure sub domains and c max s refers to maximum speed of sound in structure phase speed of sound of p wave in general c max s k s 3 g s 4 ρ s with k s and g s representing bulk modulus and shear modulus respectively the structure phase considers the cfl condition based on the speed of sound c s due to its explicit algorithm while such sound speed dependency does not exist in the time step criteria of fluid phase due to its semi implicit algorithm therefore the time step size and maximum time step size of structure phase will be considerably smaller than that of fluid phase accordingly in order to achieve consistent time advancement between fluid and structure phases during one step calculation of fluid the structure calculations should be conducted consecutively for κ δt f δt s times with fluid particles being spatially fixed note that in this study the maximum allowable time step size of structure δ t max s is set as δ t max s 0 005 δ t max f it must be noted that the time advancement criteria can be further enhanced especially for hydroelastic fsi corresponding to stiff structures through implementation of an implicit sph based structure solver e g peer et al 2018 along with higher order implicit time integration schemes e g shimizu et al 2019 3 numerical validations and investigations in this section the stability and accuracy of developed enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver are investigated by conducting benchmark tests including hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate fourey et al 2017 sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped elastic baffle idelsohn et al 2008 sloshing in a rolling tank with a hanging elastic baffle idelsohn et al 2008 and dam break with an elastic plate liao et al 2014 2015 comparisons will be also conducted in between proposed multi resolution isph sph and i multi resolution explicit isph sph in section 3 1 and ii multi resolution mps mps by khayyer et al 2019 in section 3 4 3 1 hydrostatic water column on an elastic plate the first benchmark test for validation of enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver corresponds to hydrostatic water column on an elastic aluminum plate fourey et al 2017 where a theoretical equilibrium solution fourey et al 2017 exists fig 4 illustrates the computational setup of this benchmark test the width of water tank is 1 0 m and the water depth is 2 0 m the bottom of water tank comprises of a 5 0 cm h e 0 05 m thick elastic plate with a density of 2700 kg m3 ρ s 2700 kg m3 young s modulus of 67 5 gpa e s 67 5 gpa and poisson s ratio of 0 34 υ s 0 34 the plate is suddenly loaded with the weight of a water column at t 0 s with the progress of simulation the fsi system eventually arrives at an equilibrium state with a certain static deformation of the plate as provided in the paper of fourey et al 2017 the theoretical static deflection at the mid span of the plate is equal to 6 85e 05 m the diameter of structure particles corresponds to h e d s 10 and the maximum allowable time step size for fluid is set equal to δt f max 2 0e 5 s fig 5 presents typical snapshots of particles together with pressure stress fields reproduced by proposed multi resolution fsi solver at t 0 5 s with three different diameter ratios of d f d s 1 0 2 0 and 2 5 according to the figure the developed multi resolution fsi solver appears to possess acceptable robustness and accuracy in reproduction of smooth and noise free pressure stress fields for all considered diameter ratios from the enlarged portions of the presented figure the continuity of particle distributions at the fluid structure interface is also well evident for all considered diameter ratios fig 6 portrays time variations of plate s mid span deflection simulated by the multi resolution isph sph fsi solver as shown in this figure almost similar results are obtained for all considered diameter ratios in all three considered resolutions the system is shown to reach an equilibrium state this classical benchmark test also allows us to test the energy conservation properties of the developed multi resolution hydroelastic fsi solver because the fsi system is a thermodynamically isolated system with no exchange of heat work with surroundings the total energy of the overall fsi system must remain invariant fig 7 shows time variations of a b normalized total energy of the overall fsi system and c kinetic energy of fluid phase fig 7 a and b portray gradual approaches towards equilibrium state and at the same time depict acceptable energy conservation property of the proposed multi resolution isph sph fsi solver less than 0 4 energy dissipation for 10 s of computation for all considered diameter ratios it should be noted here that fig 7 a shows variation of normalized total energy up to 1 s to clearly present the initial variation of total energy of the fsi system to present establishment of a thermodynamic equilibrium state by all three considered cases fig 7 b is presented which shows normalized total energy variation up to 10 s in addition according to fig 7 c after initial oscillations caused by sudden exposure of fluid structure particles to the gravitational acceleration as discussed in khayyer et al 2018a the kinetic energies of fluid phase particles gradually reach almost constant values close to zero corresponding to an equilibrium state table 1 shows the total particle number as well as cpu time for 1 s of simulation 1 s of physical time from this table application of multi resolution scheme with d f d s 2 and 2 5 has resulted in gradual reductions of required cpu time in specific cpu times for calculation of fluid phase i e prediction and correction steps are clearly shown to be reduced with coarser computational resolutions note that all simulations of this study are performed on a supercomputer system at kyoto university laurel 2 cpu of intel xeon broadwell 18 cores 2 1 ghz x 2 node and ram of 128 gb for all calculations related to computational cost 4 core 8 thread of cpu 2 1 ghz and 8 gb memories are used and the ppe matrix is solved by the intel mkl pardiso parallel direct solver as stated in the introduction several efforts have been made in simplifying the solution process of projection based particle methods through assumption of negligible time variations of pressure in small calculation time steps examples include hosseini et al 2007 rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 nomeritae et al 2016 this simplification of solution process allows an explicit calculation of pressure instead of an implicit one without the need for solving a global matrix equation of ppe and corresponding simultaneous linear equations which results in easy parallel computing on both cpu and gpu on the other hand this simplification would lead to imprecise projection of intermediate velocity field into a divergence free space a simple comparison is conducted here in order to highlight the significance of truly projection based particle methods including a proper solution for global matrix equation of ppe accordingly the results by proposed isph sph fsi solver are compared with those obtained by an explicit isph eisph sph fsi solver the only difference in between the coded eisph sph and isph sph methods corresponds to solution of ppe in the eisph the matrix equation of ppe a x b where a is a coefficient matrix x is the unknown column vector corresponding to pressure b is the source term column vector is simply discretized as follows hosseini et al 2007 rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 nomeritae et al 2016 29 p i k 1 b i j a i j p j k j a i j as previously stated in eq 29 an assumption of negligible pressure variation in one computational time step p j k 1 p j k is considered thus allowing an explicit calculation of pressure fig 8 a presents a qualitative comparison in between snapshots by isph sph and eisph sph at t 0 2 s with fluid structure diameter ratio of d f d s 2 0 from the presented figure the reproduced pressure fields by both solvers are smooth however the eisph sph has resulted in pressure overestimations performances of isph sph and eisph sph are also clearly portrayed in fig 8 b that presents theoretical and calculated time variations of deflections at the mid span of plate according to fig 8 b the result by eisph sph is characterized by relatively large oscillations of plate the oscillations are minimized as simulation proceeds however small scale oscillations persist indicating the failure of reaching an equilibrium state indeed the unphysical oscillations of plate bring about instabilities and inaccuracies in the hydrodynamics pressure field as well fig 8 c provides time variations of normalized total energy by isph sph and eisph sph the energy time history of isph sph is shown to be relatively smooth and more conservative in comparison to that of eisph sph the cause of observed differences in between isph sph and eisph sph is related to the calculation procedure of ppe the solution process of eisph eq 29 has similarity to an iterative method namely the jacobi method in the jacobi method pressure is calculated by successively solving eq 29 until the solutions converge however in the eisph eq 29 is solved only once without any iteration being involved in other words the obtained pressure by the eisph algorithm may contain considerable errors and thus would not guarantee a rigorous projection of the intermediate velocity field into a divergence free space in specific in this test case the main cause of instabilities and inaccuracies seen in eisph sph results arises from the inconsistent and imprecise calculation of pressure at the fluid structure interface 3 2 sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped elastic baffle an experiment of sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped elastic baffle idelsohn et al 2008 is simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver in the literature corresponding to particle methods test cases related to sloshing flows interacting with baffles have been considered for verification e g sloshing in tank with rigid baffle e g chu et al 2018 or with elastic baffle e g hwang et al 2016 fig 9 presents a schematic illustration of the computational setup of this benchmark test at the center of the tank s bottom an elastic baffle is clamped and interacts with the fluid phase the material of the baffle corresponds to dielectric polyurethane resin the density and young s modulus of the baffle is ρ s 1100 kg m3 and e s 6 0 mpa respectively the fluid is sunflower oil with a density of 917 kg m3 ρ f 917 kg m3 and a kinematic viscosity of 5 0e 05 m2 s υ f 5 0e 05 m2 s a rolling motion with a maximum amplitude of 4 and a period of 1 211 s idelsohn et al 2008 is imposed on the tank the particle diameter for structure and maximum allowable time step size for fluid are set as d s 1 0e 3 m and δt f max 1 0e 4 s respectively figs 10 11 and 12 present typical snapshots of particles together with von mises stress pressure fields reproduced by proposed multi resolution fsi solver with a set of different diameter ratios d f d s 1 0 2 0 and 2 5 at three instants of t 1 84 s t 2 32 s and t 2 56 s respectively these figures demonstrate that the enhanced multi resolution isph sph has performed well with respect to reproduced stress pressure fields as well as their correspondence in all considered fluid structure diameter ratios in addition according to the enlarged views no unphysical gap appears in between fluid and structure phases for all resolution ratios thanks to the implemented multi resolution framework along with a consistent fluid structure coupling scheme with refining the fluid s resolution from d f d s 2 5 to d f d s 1 0 the quality of reproduced pressure field is gradually improved and eventually for d f d s 1 0 a qualitatively accurate pressure field with minimized local pressure noise is obtained the free surface profiles observed in simulations appear to be slightly more violent with respect to those in the experiment which may have been caused by underestimation of fluid viscous accelerations or difference of dimensions 2d simulation vs 3d experiment for improvement of this issue more consistent formulation of viscosity e g corrected isph khayyer et al 2008 as well as extension of simulations to 3d will be considered in our future works fig 13 shows the time variations of

corresponding to considered diameter ratios are well consistent with each other and the experimental data idelsohn et al 2008 note that the present multi resolution fsi solver performs well in a

a hydroelastic fsi test corresponding to violent sloshing flows table 2 presents the total particle number and cpu time for 1 s of simulation according to this table utilization of coarse fluid particles i e d f d s 2 and 2 5 leads to notable reductions of required cpu time it is also clear that due to reduction of total particle numbers by implementation of multi resolution scheme total required memory which is directly proportional to number of particles in domain would be also reduced reduction of required memory is an important matter especially for 3d simulations where considerably more particles are involved and thus resulting in a considerably large size matrix of ppe 3 3 sloshing in a rolling tank with a hanging elastic baffle sloshing in a rolling tank with a

illustrate that for all considered resolution cases the enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver has reproduced smooth pressure field furthermore the water surface profiles appear to be almost consistent with those of the experiment for all diameter ratios fig 17 presents the time variations of displacements of the free end of the elastic baffle simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver with different diameter ratios along with experimental data idelsohn et al 2008 from this figure the time variations simulated by enhanced multi resolution isph sph solver are almost consistent with that of experiment in terms of the trend of variations and the amplitude of displacements although the results corresponding to different diameter ratios are consistent with each other some minor discrepancies in between simulation results and experimental data are observed that are expected to be minimized through application of more advanced and proper constitutive equations for structure model table 3 shows the information on total particle numbers as well as cpu time for 1 s of simulation of the considered benchmark test from this table the cpu cost related to calculation of fluid phase is found to be reduced by incorporating multi resolution framework in specific through consideration of fluid structure diameter ratios of d f d s 2 0 and d f d s 2 5 the overall cpu

fields by enhanced multi resolution isph sph with four different diameter ratios d f d s 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 at t 0 35 s according to these figures and the presented enlarged views for all diameter ratios the enhanced multi resolution isph sph has reproduced smooth and stable stress pressure fields without any unphysical gap at the interface boundary of fluid and structure from the presented figure the reproduced pressure stress fields appear to be quite close in magnitude and in almost fine correspondence with their corresponding experimental photo fig 19 depicts the time variations of the displacements of the elastic plate s free end reproduced by enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver along with that corresponding to the experiment liao et al 2014 2015 this figure further confirms the consistency of enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver since results for all considered diameter ratios are quite close to each other and in acceptable agreements with the experimental data it must be noted here that observed discrepancies are expected to be minimized through incorporation of a more proper constitutive equation for the structure and consideration of air water two phase model in specific after the water jet impacts on the right wall after around t 0 45 s air cavities are entrapped inside the water phase and the entrapped cavities affect the flow field as observed in the experiment liao et al 2015 as well as the numerical study by sun et al 2019a development of air water structure multi phase multi physics solver will be conducted as a future work table 4 portrays the total particle numbers as well as required cpu time for 1 s of simulation this table shows that the implementation of the present multi resolution framework would lead to a notable reduction of computational cost and required memory for this specific test through consideration of fluid structure diameter ratios of d f d s 1 5 and d f d s 2 5 the overall cpu times are decreased by about 50 and 75 respectively indeed depending on the targeted problem and number of fluids structure particles this reduction percentage in cpu time would be different however the conducted test cases clearly portray that utilization of proposed multi resolution framework results in enhancement of computational efficiency without notable reduction of accuracy figs 20 and 21 portray qualitative quantitative comparisons in between results of enhanced multi resolution isph sph and those by enhanced multi resolution mps mps khayyer et al 2019 in simulation of the considered dam break with an elastic plate from figs 20 and 21 both sph and mps based solvers have resulted in qualitatively acceptable results with respect to the experiment meanwhile the sph based solver appears to have resulted in superior hydrodynamic pressure field from fig 21 the results by sph and mps based solvers seem to be well comparable incorporation of a more proper constitutive equation for the structure model that can better treat the material non linearities is expected to improve the accuracy of both fsi solvers in order to further investigate the robustness of proposed sph based hydroelastic solver and at the same time compare its performance with respect to our mps based hydroelastic fsi solver khayyer et al 2019 simulations of dam break with an elastic plate are re conducted by considering larger values for the fluid to structure diameter ratios i e d f d s being equal to 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 fig 22 presents a qualitative comparison in between enhanced multi resolution isph sph and enhanced multi resolution mps mps fsi solvers from the presented figure reproduction of a more accurate hydrodynamic pressure field by the sph based solver has become more evident as the difference of fluid structure computational resolutions is increased this indicates that the moving structure particles that are of different resolutions with respect to the fluid particles have provided more accurate boundary conditions for the ppe in the sph framework in order to portray the effectiveness of the implementation of spp scheme in multi resolution hydroelastic fsi simulations fig 23 presents a qualitative comparison in between results by enhanced multi resolution isph sph with and without the spp scheme from the presented figure incorporation of the spp scheme has had a clear effect on smoothness of pressure field in fluid this is achieved as inclusion of spp enhances the consistency of approximations at and in the vicinity of truncated boundaries e g fluid structure interface it should be noted that incorporation of spp scheme would in particular facilitate multi resolution calculations characterized by relatively large d f d s where target fluid particles in the vicinity of fluid structure interface would have truncated kernel domains in this case the generated space potential particle spp that represents the truncated kernel domain void region of a target fluid particle would contribute to provide position velocity boundary conditions for the ppe in case of large fluid structure diameter ratios fluid particles located on one side of the structure may see the fluid particles on the other side as their neighbors in such a case we need to ensure that accurate velocity position boundary conditions are being provided for pressure solution at every target fluid particle to ensure that the obtained pressure is precise corresponding to a divergence free velocity field in a projection based solution of fluid phase in such a case fluid particles on one side of the structure are simply ignored when seen by a target fluid particle on the other side this would bring about truncated kernel domains and then for every target fluid particle a corresponding spp would be generated to represent that void space and providing position velocity boundary conditions corresponding to that truncated kernel domain 4 concluding

fluid to structure d f d s the proposed enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solver has reproduced smooth stress pressure fields and consistent structure deflection time variations indicating acceptable accuracy consistency of the method furthermore it is shown that through decreasing the computational spatial resolution in fluid considerable reductions of the computational costs are achieved with maintaining reasonable accuracy and stability the proposed enhanced multi resolution isph sph is also shown to outperform two other particle based fsi solvers namely the eisph sph fsi solver that implemented an explicit solution of ppe on the basis of an assumption of negligible time variation of pressure in small time steps e g rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 as well as the enhanced

extension of proposed solver to three dimensions in this appendix a preliminary trial to extend the proposed multi resolution fsi solver to three dimensions is presented in order to portray the

fields are obtained with almost regular particle distributions near free surface as well as fluid structure interface without presence of any unphysical gaps or interparticle penetrations at fluid

accurate fig a3 portrays time variations of the displacements of the elastic plate s free end reproduced by 2d 3d enhanced multi resolution isph sph fsi solvers along with that corresponding to the experiment liao et al 2014 2015 the deflection time history by 3d isph sph is consistent with that by 2d isph sph in particular with respect to deflection starting instant and maximum deflection magnitude furthermore the deflection time variation of 3d isph sph shows acceptable agreement with respect to the experiment the obtained preliminary results suggest effectiveness and robustness of the proposed multi resolution isph sph framework for 3d simulations however the development of 3d multi resolution isph sph should be accompanied by scrupulous validations not only in terms of stability and accuracy but also conservation and convergence properties with respect to both analytical and experimental data 
20929,environmentally friendly piled coastal defence structures gained a particular significance in recent years given these structures do not interrupt the longshore cross shore sediment transport flow around an emergent pile is known to generate certain typical coherent flow patterns depending on the flow and boundary conditions as well as geometry when the bed is erodible the scouring process which typically takes place around the pile significantly alters these generated coherent structures the primary objective of this study is to understand the influence of the presence of a scour hole around the pile on the coherent flow structures time averaged kinematic characteristics i e mean flow and turbulence as well as dynamic pressure characteristics to achieve this objective a three dimensional numerical model was utilized the model that solves the flow around the emergent pile on rigid bed was calibrated by using a spatially and temporally high resolution experimental dataset later on high resolution dem data of a scoured bottom from flume experiments were imported into the calibrated model and the model was run with identical hydraulic conditions with the experiments then the outputs of the two models with rigid bed and with scoured bottom conditions were comparatively analysed it was seen that as a consequence of the presence of a scour hole lee wake vortices were dramatically weakened behind the cylinder instead of that a couple of pronounced large scale counter rotating streamwise vortices lscsv behind the cylinder dominate the flow domain to a great extent results suggest that the presence of a scour hole on the bed renders the pile more streamlined against the flow keywords cfd coherent flow structures flow body interaction local scour vortices drag force 1 introduction coastal waters are sensitive complex systems where morphological and ecological processes intensively and bilaterally interacted in recent years after experiencing the destructive impact of hard coastal engineering structures e g rubble mound breakwaters on morphological and ecological balances in coastal eco system eco friendly coastal structures which do not interrupt the longshore and cross shore sediment transport gained a particular significance yagci et al 2014 in this regard a piled supported structure which keeps the ongoing morphological balances in coastal waters emerges as a feasible alternative to conventional hard coastal engineering structures in these structures scour around the piles placed on an erodible bed is one of the typical problems that need to be investigated correctly additionally a complete understanding of how the turbulent processes taking place at the wake of the pile are altered after the scour occurred can only be achieved by investigation of the flow patterns around a pile on a scoured bed when a body is exposed to flow certain periodic coherent structures i e lee wake vortices downflow horseshoe vortex surface roller and large scale counter rotating streamwise vortices are generated in the vicinity of the obstruction e g raudkivi and ettema 1983 chiew and melville 1987 whitehouse 1998 sumer and fredsøe 2002 roulund et al 2005 unger and hager 2006 sumer 2014 kitsikoudis et al 2016 geometry flow conditions and the boundary conditions largely dictate the character of these coherent flow patterns generated around the obstacle common examples of these obstacles are supporting structures in rivers e g bridge piers melville and raudkivi 1996 marine domain e g piles of berthing structures or offshore wind turbines sumer and fredsøe 2002 and riparian vegetation in river corridors yagci et al 2016 kitsikoudis et al 2020 when these cylindrical supporting structures are placed on an erodible bed with the effect of the increasing turbulence and bottom shear stress due to the presence of the structure scour inevitably takes place around the obstacle consequently the boundary conditions change with time during this scour process the extent of the scour can be global or local depending on the surrounding conditions sumer et al 2005 this alteration in the boundary condition due to scour affects the existing bilateral interactions between the different components of generated secondary flow structures e g the interaction between downflow and horseshoe vortex once the scour is attained to an equilibrium condition while some of the generated coherent structures are weakened the others become more pronounced graf and istiarto 2002 understanding the flow structure around a cylinder is a complex fundamental hydrodynamic problem a large number of studies in this field were conducted so far bearman and zdravkovich 1978 cheung and melbourne 1983 bearman et al 1985 williamson 1985 1989 zdravkovich 1985 bearman and obasaju 1989 sumer and fredsøe 1997 to investigate the development processes of horseshoe vortex and lee wake vortices roulund et al 2005 carried out numerical and experimental model studies for a circular pile exposed to a steady flow their studies manifested the impact of the boundary layer thickness reynolds number and bed roughness on the generation of horseshoe vortex however their simulations did not incorporate the lee wake vortices the effect of lee wake vortices was evaluated in depth by baykal et al 2015 through the 3d numerical modelling for scour around a vertical cylinder according to sumer and fredsøe 1997 the cylinder reynolds number has a major effect on the characteristics of lee wake in addition the flow becomes unsteady in the lee wake region when the reynolds number is larger than 40 therefore once this threshold value is exceeded the vortex shedding starts occurring with a certain frequency baykal et al 2015 stated that these vortices at the lee side of the cylinder change over its height depending on the character of the velocity profile and the boundary layer condition also an increase in the boundary layer momentum resulting from increasing the bed roughness leads to a delay in separation sumer and fredsøe 1997 consequently the magnitude of vorticity becomes smaller near the bed and the lee wake vortices in the lower part of the cylinder are weaker than the upper part furthermore the experiments by kitsikoudis et al 2016 showed that the near bed flow begins to decelerate as a result of flow separation but the turbulence intensity suddenly rises behind the obstacle and its maximum is located in the distance about twice of the cylinder s diameter in downstream the scour around the cylinder has transient behaviour and its development is composed of various stages until the equilibrium stage is established the vortex shedding frequency as well as the generated secondary flow structures around the obstacle alters this dynamic process depending on the stage of the scour the scour depth eventually attains an equilibrium condition when the downflow originated secondary flow patterns can no longer transport the particles dey 1995 jacobsen et al 2014 petersen 2014 however it should be borne in mind that at the macroscopic scale the transportation of these particles in a scour hole is not only the consequence of time averaged secondary flow patterns but also the duration of energetic events as well as the length scale of the flow structure valyrakis et al 2013 so far it was impractical to detect such events in field studies with measurements yet the recently developed miniaturised instrumented particle by al obaidi et al 2020 became a promising device in further resolving the impact of such events in field measurements baker 1985 found that when the ratio of scour depth to the cylinder s diameter reaches 1 3 the scour process generally reaches equilibrium condition however this is not a crisp number and has a standard deviation of around 0 7 sumer and fredsøe 2002 the circulation of the horseshoe vortex increases with a decreasing rate in the scour hole and then this rate becomes constant at the equilibrium condition melville 1975 in the equilibrium scour the size of the horseshoe vortex increases and the bed shear stress decreases contrarily thus the development of the scour hole halts raudkivi and ettema 1983 the experiments by melville 1997 demonstrated that while the initial development of the scour hole is due to enhanced local shear stress near the obstacle the succeeding development is because of the strong downflow yagci et al 2017 experimentally found that the strength of the downflow increases while scouring is in progress eventually the downflow generated horseshoe vortex loses its capability to erode the bed material when the equilibrium condition is attained the occurrence stage of equilibrium conditions depends on bed material size of the obstruction flow and channel characteristics breusers et al 1977 the experimental studies by euler et al 2014 and kitsikoudis et al 2017 confirmed the effect of the inclination of a solid cylinder on flow structures they revealed that the increasing inclination of the cylinder renders the pile to be more streamlined in shape thus the scour volume decreases because the downflow at upstream gets weaker in addition due to the inclination the formation of the horseshoe vortex declines which causes less turbulence and the vortex shedding in the wake region becomes suppressed consequently inclination produces less scour volume and it decreases the scour depth and the location of maximum scour depth behind the obstacle shifts to downstream in general the higher the separation distance measured in upstream of the cylinder is the stronger the horseshoe vortex and the downflow around the obstacle are majd et al 2016 experimentally investigated the separation distance at the upstream of the cylinder which is the indicator of the strength of the primary mechanism the horseshoe vortex that drives the scour around the vertical pile they visualized this distance for various cylinder reynolds numbers and found that the separation distance tends to decrease with increasing cylinder reynolds number as aforementioned the dynamic physical processes behind the development of a scour hole is largely controlled by the obstacle flow and bottom morphometry characteristics during the scour development with the influence of the changing boundary conditions all the secondary coherent flow patterns exhibit an alternation however once the equilibrium condition is attained with the effect of stabilised new morphology around the obstacle the modified coherent structures also achieve a stable pattern the primary objective of the present study is to get a better understanding of the influence of scoured bottom around the cylinder on flow and turbulence structure in line with this perspective a direct comparison is made between the flow structures around the solid cylinder for the conditions of rigid bed and that of the scoured bottom first a 3d numerical model which focuses on the flow around the cylinder was set and validated against the intensive experimental dataset previously obtained by kitsikoudis et al 2016 under the rigid bed condition as a second step a high resolution dem data has a grid size smaller than 1 mm 1 mm of the scoured bottom case was incorporated into the calibrated model as a new bed condition this was followed by a comparative analysis of the outputs of the two numerical models run for the rigid bed and the scoured bottom conditions the primary aim of the study was to answer the following questions based on the numerical models what is the influence of the scour hole on coherent flow structures behind around the obstacle what is the effect of scour hole and deposited mound on time averaged kinematic characteristics of the flow in the vicinity of the cylinder what is the impact of the presence of scour hole on downflow upflow structures around the body how does the presence of a scour hole alter the dynamic pressure field around the obstruction inside and outside of the scour hole 2 methodology the study was designed upon the run of two consecutive numerical models in fig 1 the summary of the steps in the numerical modelling process is shown as a flow chart the primary focus of the first model was to simulate the flow field around a solid cylinder located on a rigid bed during the construction of the first numerical model as stated in fig 1 firstly the geometry of the obstacle mesh characteristics the initial and boundary conditions were defined this is followed by imposing the candidate rans turbulence closure models i e k epsilon k ω and rng into the model to replicate the turbulence characteristics in the flow field after running each turbulence model for the validation exercise the numerical model outputs from each model were compared with the experimental reference data which was originally produced by kitsikoudis et al 2016 by flume experiments this direct comparison showed that k ω was the best compatible turbulence model for this experimental data after this stage the k ω turbulence closure was utilized throughout the study unless the obtained outcomes are independent of the mesh properties the numerical outputs might be questionable or misleading therefore based on the asme standards standard for verification and validation in computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer mesh independency analyses were conducted this analysis assured that the numerical outcomes were independent of the properties of the imposed mesh after these steps the calibrated numerical model which successfully simulated the flow around a solid cylinder positioned on the rigid bottom was ready for the next step as mentioned above the primary objective of this study was to get a better understanding of the flow structure around the circular cylinder located on scoured bottom in equilibrium condition in line with the aim at the second step of this work high resolution dem data of the scoured bottom was incorporated into the calibrated model as the solid bottom condition the dem data was experimentally obtained by yagci et al 2017 fig 2 after the equilibrium bed condition was attained around a vertical emergent circular cylinder it is worth highlighting that the experiments by kitsikoudis et al 2016 and yagci et al 2017 were conducted in the same flume under identical flow conditions while undisturbed flow velocity was 0 29 m s in yagci et al 2017 this value was 0 33 m s in kitsikoudis et al 2016 these close values incidentally produce identical reynolds numbers this enabled the compatibility of incorporation of the dem data collected by yagci et al 2017 into the numerical model once the model is calibrated based on the data of kitsikoudis et al 2016 in their study yagci et al 2017 investigated clear water scour around an emergent cylinder for cohesionless sediment by employing a leica scan station c10 laser scanner for the creation of the digitised three dimensional map of the equilibrium bed they scanned the scoured bed for an approximately 1 m length of the flume across the full width the scan was repeated from six different locations for each scanning the resolution of the scanning grid was set as 1 mm 1 mm the view of the incorporated scoured bed data was given in fig 2 this high resolution dem data enables us to accurately simulate the flow structure around the scoured bottom which dictates turbulence production dissipation and total drag in the flow field once the dem data was imposed into the numerical model the mesh was regenerated accordingly the initial and boundary conditions were kept as in the previously calibrated model except the new bottom condition for which the model was run the numerical outputs were post processed and the results in terms of reynolds averaged velocity and turbulence kinetic energy profiles were validated in a typical scour hole that attained an equilibrium condition in the clear water scour regime it is expected that the sediment mobility number i e the ratio of the shields parameter to the critical shields parameter including the slope correction θ θ c r attains to a value smaller than or equal to unity as additional validation of the second numerical model the spatial distribution of θ θ c r in the vicinity of scoured bed was calculated by use of the bed shear stress values from the model and sediment characteristics from yagci et al 2017 it was seen that the model results satisfied with this fundamental condition as a consequence of these consecutive steps two numerical models which allow us to make a comparative analysis of the flow field around a solid cylinder located on the rigid bed and that of the scoured bottom were produced during this analysis the instantaneous coherent structures around the obstacles the time averaged flow quantities and the pressure distributions around the bodies were compared 2 1 description of the hydrodynamic model 2 1 1

value falls within the range of the subcritical regime i e wake region is completely turbulent the boundary layer is laminar sumer and fredsøe 1997 outlet boundary was selected as a free outflow both the outlet and the inlet water levels were defined as constant the depth was set to 0 31 m as in the experiments of kitsikoudis et al 2016 2 1 5 mesh generation a quadratic type of mesh was used in the numerical models as explained above in detail two different models were run during the study the first one was on rigid bed the second one was scoured bottom in equilibrium condition during the generation of mesh the same mesh quality was maintained for both of these cases basically for these characteristic cases two different mesh resolutions were applied in a planar surface around the cylinder for refinement the growth rates and aspect ratios around the solid cylinders were set to 1 2 and 1 respectively within this condensed mesh in addition for the case of the scoured bottom model these ratios were kept constant inside the scour hole to improve the mesh quality near the bottom the characteristics of the mesh structures of these two models were briefly summarised in table 1 below the numerical model was validated against the experimental data by kitsikoudis et al 2016 in the numerical model the numerical probes were placed at identical coordinates with that of the physical probes of kitsikoudis et al fig 3 2016 to make a direct comparison the time series were extracted from the model output with a sampling frequency of 100 hz i e the same measurement frequency was used in the relevant experiments 2 2 model validation 2 2 1 selection of the turbulence closure model three different turbulence closure models were tested to see their performance in the representation of turbulence processes in the flow field behind the obstruction the candidate approximations to simulate the turbulence were k ω i e the original version developed by wilcox standard k epsilon and renormalisation group rng k epsilon closures the simulations for testing these models were run until the mass averaged kinetic energy of the model domain was stabilised once the numerical stability is attained the results of the models were then post processed and compared with the experimentally measured velocity data the numerical trials indicated that the k ω turbulence model yielded significantly better agreement with the data compared to the other tested turbulence closure models the high efficiency of the k ω closure model in the case of boundary layer flows with a strong adverse pressure gradient or flow separation has already been shown in the pertinent literature roulund et al 2005 baykal et al 2015 larsen et al 2016 with this result k ω turbulence closure was utilized throughout the numerical campaign 2 2 2 validation for the case of flow around cylinder over rigid bed as stated above the numerical model with the rigid bed condition was validated against the experimental data for the validation four different parameters were used dimensionless time averaged streamwise velocities u u streamwise and lateral turbulence intensities u r m s u v r m s u and normalized turbulence kinetic energy t k e u 2 the comparisons made between the results of the numerical model and that of the experiments were made at the described locations in the flow field the variation of time averaged velocity and turbulence quantities i e u u u r m s u v r m s u t k e u 2 at the upstream and downstream centerline of the solid cylinder y d 0 the time averaged velocity and turbulence quantities averaged across the depth i e u u u r m s u v r m s u t k e u 2 along the centerline of the flume y d 0 at upstream and downstream of the solid cylinder the variation of time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulence quantities i e u u u r m s u v r m s u t k e u 2 at the horizontal plane i e planar surface at z h 0 4 at the downstream of the solid cylinder the angle brackets denote depth averaging such as 4 u 1 h 0 h u z d z as can be seen from fig 4 a the time averaged streamwise velocity distribution along with the depth at the centerline of the cylinder obtained by the numerical model is generally in good agreement with that measured in the experiments although the numerical model yields slightly lower values for the near bed region at this region the cylinder induced turbulence has a less significant role in governing the flow domain compared to the bed generated turbulence i e at upstream and far downstream of the obstacle a probable reason for this slight difference is that due to the nature of the experimental measurements by adv in kitsikoudis et al 2016 the adv probe employed in the experiments may have presumably created a certain contraction effect near the bed region this might induce a subtle increment in time averaged velocities near the bed however at the near downstream of the cylinder due to the fact that the flow domain is largely controlled by the obstacle induced turbulence rather than adv probe induced turbulence and the inertia of the flow is reduced this adv induced contraction effect near the bottom is relatively mitigated hence in those regions numerical model outputs and experimental measurements are better in agreement as an overall assessment it can be said that the numerical model yielded a satisfactory performance in simulating the distribution of time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulence quantities across the depth at the centerline of the flume in fig 5 a the depth averaged streamwise velocities along the centerline at upstream and downstream of the solid cylinder are given this type of comparison of the data enables us to evaluate the capability of the numerical model in the simulation of flow characteristics in a broader perspective in line with the comparison given in the previous paragraph the numerical model is shown to be capable of capturing the streamwise velocity values along the centerline with high accuracy the longitudinal distribution of the depth averaged streamwise turbulence intensity along the flume centerline u r m s u is given in fig 5b when fig 5b is examined it can be seen that the numerical model output exhibited a reasonable performance in terms of representing cylinder induced streamwise turbulence intensity a similar analysis can also be made for the performance of the numerical model in simulating the depth averaged lateral turbulence intensities v r m s u and depth averaged turbulence kinetic energy t k e u 2 in fig 5c and d respectively differing from fig 5b in fig 5c and d the values slightly deviate from the experimental data at the upstream and downstream of the pile respectively these slight deviations presumably stem from the handling of the turbulence closure in k ω model such that u r m s and v r m s in the numerical model correspond to the vortex shedding induced turbulence whereas t k e corresponds to the sub grid turbulence on the other hand experimental data includes both sources of turbulence therefore the numerical model generally tends to slightly underestimate the turbulence quantities compared to that from the experiments however the outputs are in acceptable agreement in fig 6 the comparison of lateral distributions of u u u r m s u v r m s u and t k e u 2 between experimental and numerical data were given for the planar surface of z h 0 4 as can be seen from fig 6 there is a good agreement between the experiment and the numerical results in terms of u u on the other hand turbulence intensities calculated by the numerical model slightly deviate from the experimental data the same remarks can be repeated for the normalized tke t k e u 2 as well it is seen that u r m s and t k e values close to the cylinder are underestimated by the numerical model fig 6b and c the reason for this underestimation is related to the handling of the turbulence closure in the present model as explained above on the other hand the model overpredicts v r m s values close to the cylinder particularly at x 1 25d 2d this result shows that the strength of lee wake vortices at the given range is higher in the numerical model outputs compared to the experiments presumably because of the weaker turbulence dissipation estimated in the model due to the breaking up of vortices into smaller vortices a quantitative comparison of numerical model results with the experimental results presented in fig 6 shows that the relative mean error is around 15 on average if the number of the comparison sections i e lateral profiles are considered such a deviation from the experimental data can be regarded as acceptable as discussed above the accuracy of the model results was tested against the experimental data collected on a three dimensional measurement grid by kitsikoudis et al 2016 although a great number of comparison points were used during this verification process and a satisfactory agreement was obtained between the experimental data and the numerical model there were still slight deviations from experimental data in urms vrms and tke overwhelmingly within the region between 1 5d 4 0d according to the experimental data by kitsikoudis et al 2016 this region corresponds to the zone where the convective acceleration in streamwise direction takes its highest value fig 6a in kitsikoudis et al 2016 also the increase in tke is the steepest in this region along the entire wake the physical reason behind such a sudden variation of flow quantities in the wake region can be explained by the presence of shear induced lateral momentum transfer more specifically due to the velocity deficit between wake region and contraction region sudden lateral momentum transfers periodically block the pairs of vortices this sudden and periodic effect brings about the formation of macroscale and microscale coherent structures in the flow domain in a typical experiment differing from the perfectly idealized boundary conditions in the numerical model the surface roughness in surfaces fluid properties i e viscosity density temperature suspended particles are spatially or temporally variable it is obvious that the scales of these coherent structures are quite sensitive to many boundary conditions apparently the utilized rans model is not perfect in capturing some coherent structures that cause additional turbulence and thus the present numerical results deviate from experimental data at certain regions 2 2 3 validation for the case of flow around cylinder over scoured bottom as stated above the numerical model developed for the scoured bottom case was validated conceptually by means of the mobility number of the bed sediment θ θ c r which is defined as the ratio of the shields parameter to the critical shields parameter including the slope correction the shields parameter non dimensional bed shear stress is defined by 5 θ τ γ s γ d 50 where τ is the local bed shear stress d 50 is the median sediment grain size of bed material γ is the specific weight of the water and γ s is the specific weight of sediment grains θ c r is the critical shields parameter corrected for the slope effect roulund et al 2005 6 θ c r θ c r 0 cos β 1 sin 2 α tan 2 β tan 2 ϕ cos α sin β tan ϕ here θ c r 0 is the critical shields parameter for bed sediment on a flatbed ϕ is the angle of repose of bed sediment β is the local transverse slope angle and α is the angle between the local flow velocity vector and the direction of the local steepest bed slope fig 4 in roulund et al 2005 the modified critical shields parameter given in eq 6 ensures that the slope effect transverse uphill or downhill orientation is accounted for in the mobility of the bed sediment in the experiments of yagci et al 2017 undisturbed far field shields parameter was measured as θ 0 04 whereas the undisturbed critical shields parameter was θ c r 0 0 045 resulting in a clear water scour regime yagci et al 2017 reported that the equilibrium scour conditions were almost established at the end of their tests which would suggest having the θ θ c r 1 condition satisfied around the pile i e in the scour hole the sediment mobility θ θ c r was calculated over the entire domain of the numerical flume bed by use of the sediment data of yagci et al 2017 d 50 0 52 mm γ s γ 2 65 ϕ 42 with the spatial distribution of τ taken from the numerical model results the result is shown in fig 7 as can be seen the θ θ c r 1 condition is satisfied almost all over the bed with the exception of a thin crescent shaped region at the immediate upstream of the scour hole shown in brown contour this is actually not unexpected since the experimental conditions of yagci et al 2017 indicated that very slight sediment mobility was still seen given that their experiments lasted around 8 h shorter than the expected perfect equilibrium this result shows that the numerical model is capable of representing the near bed flow of the tested case 3 analysis of the results in this section the numerical outputs of the rigid bed and scoured bottom cases were presented in a comparative manner for understanding the influence of the presence of a scour hole on the flow structure around the cylinder in fig 8 the variations of instantaneous streamlines around the cylinders were presented for the two characteristic cases i e flow around the cylinder on a rigid bed and that on the scoured bottom cases respectively generally speaking the coherent flow structures taking place around an obstacle are basically dictated by the geometrical properties of the obstacle flow characteristics as well as morphological features of the bed the obstacle i e cylinder diameter surface roughness and flow characteristics initial and boundary conditions were kept constant throughout the present numerical modelling study therefore the flow structures which emerged after the scour can be regarded as the direct consequence of the altered bottom condition in other words the alteration of bed morphology due to scour creates the differences in flow characteristics around the obstacle when fig 8 is examined within this perspective it can be concluded that once the scouring process attains an equilibrium condition the coherent flow structures around the body exhibit an entirely different character compared to those of the rigid bed case owing to the modified morphometric features of the bed around the cylinder the lee wake vortices cyclic vortex shedding behind the obstacle significantly die out instead a new secondary flow structure namely large scale counter rotating streamwise vortices lscsv dominate the flow domain behind the obstacle to a great extent as can be deduced from fig 8 this characteristic flow structure i e lscsv asymmetrically distributed at the near downstream of the cylinder owing to the asymmetries of the scoured bed geometry in order to get a better understanding of the lscsv the data from four characteristic cross sections located at downstream of the body were extracted from the flow domain and given in fig 9 as can be concluded from fig 9 a couple of asymmetrically distributed lscsv significantly dominate the flow domain behind the obstacle the strength of this characteristic coherent structure is the most pronounced close to the pile e g for x 0 5d and weakens toward further downstream in a typical scour experiment the asymmetry in the scour hole is an expected natural feature given that the initial condition of the bed cannot be perfectly homogeneous or symmetric in terms of porosity and compaction this non homogeneous bottom condition inevitably produces an asymmetrical scour hole and an asymmetrical ridge as can be confirmed from fig 2 see fig 4a in yagci et al 2017 for further details based on this basic fact it can be asserted that the asymmetry of the scour hole and the ridge could be the major factor behind the occurrence of the asymmetrical lscsv observed in fig 9 another significant outcome that can be drawn from fig 9 is that as the strength of the lscsv weakens in the direction of the flow the centers of the lscsvs shift outwards for both of the vortices in addition it can be barely noticed that only the dominant lscsv still exists even at the 4d downstream of the body while the smaller lscsv vanished in a shorter extent 3 1 influence of scour hole on the streamwise velocity distribution in figs 10 and 11 the spatial distribution of time averaged streamwise velocities u u over the vertical plane along the edges and the centerline of the cylinders were presented in a normalized manner for both of the tested cases when a general comparison is made with regard to the flow structure belonging to the rigid bed fig 10 and scoured bottom fig 11 cases certain remarkable differences are seen immediately the main reason behind this dramatic difference can be considered that while the lee wake vortices dominate the wake region in the rigid bed case in the scoured bottom condition this zone is mostly dictated by the coherent flow structure of lscsv as previously discussed fig 10 points out that the recirculation zone the dark blue region with negative streamwise velocity originated due to the lee wake vortices located just downstream of the cylinder which is a severely considerable rigid bed case therefore for this case rather sudden transitions of streamwise velocity u x are observed behind the obstacle compared to that of the scoured bottom case this implies that strong vorticities emerge behind the obstacle and dissipated in a short distance a well known feature of flow behind a pile kitsikoudis et al 2017 the dissipation of lee wake vortices within a short distance can be considered as the natural consequence of the stronger lateral shear stress which takes place in the case of the pile on a rigid bed case this strong lateral shear stress i e momentum transfer is the direct consequence of the stark contraction effect fig 10a and c as well as the significant drop in velocity within the lee side region fig 10b differing from the rigid bed case for the scoured bottom case the decrease of u u in the wake region is significantly less no negative velocities and it exhibits a gradually varying pattern as can be seen from fig 11a and c the presence of scour hole significantly dampens the contraction effect at the edges of the obstacle and prevent the sudden drop of velocity behind the obstruction this situation causes the change of velocity pattern quite gradually in the flow direction 3 2 influence of deposited mound on the distribution of streamwise velocity in addition to the above analysis the increased velocity values were observed in the scoured bottom condition at the further downstream of the obstacle fig 11 high velocity values occupy a significantly larger zone in this case it can be easily noticed that this high velocity zone is located over the deposited mound where a significant contraction effect on the vertical plane is expected because of the decreased water depth i e due to the presence of the deposited mound besides it is also seen from fig 11 that multiple ripples are uniformly distributed over the deposited mound while velocities are relatively higher on those ripple crests velocities are considerably lower at the lee of the ripples in a physically consistent way it is also worth mentioning the streamwise velocity distribution over the deposited mound fig 11b the vertical velocity distribution over the deposited mound exhibits a quite unusual character in this zone the highest values occur around the mid depth while the velocity values near the water surface and near the bed take relatively lower values in an overall assessment the findings reveal that the coherent structure terms as lscsv which substitutes for the lee wake vortices due to the presence of scoured bottom brings about a more complex flow pattern 3 3 comparative analysis of the time averaged vertical velocity in fig 12 the contour plots of time averaged vertical velocity distribution at upstream and downstream of the cylinder over the vertical plane along the centerline were given for both the rigid bed and scoured bottom cases in these figures the vector plots at certain longitudinal intervals are also shown a common pattern seen from the figures of both cases is that just upstream of the obstacle there are distinct positive and negative vertical velocity regions near the surface and the bottom region respectively these patterns are clear manifestations of the two well known coherent structures 1 surface roller and 2 downflow it is also seen from fig 12b that both surface roller and downflow regions expand due to the presence of the scour hole particularly the strength of the downflow near the bottom within the scour hole is significantly augmented compared to the rigid bed case this result is consistent with the finding obtained by yagci et al 2017 who experimentally observed that the strength of downflow increases during the scouring process this is so remarkable that the negative vertical time averaged velocity covers the entire scour hole besides sudden downward negative vertical velocities are observed just at the upstream end of the scour hole probably due to the sudden expansion of the cross sectional flow area with the presence of the scour hole it is also seen from fig 12 that no negative vertical velocity values are detected for the scoured bottom case at downstream of the obstacle differing from the rigid bed case in the rigid bed case there are noticeable downward directed velocity values behind the body this situation is so clear that the vectors within this zone for the rigid bed case demonstrate two vertical recirculation cells among those two cells the one observed near the bottom is significantly smaller than the one near the surface the larger recirculation observed near the surface is the consequence of the adverse pressure gradient induced lee wake vortices as previously analysed by graf and istiarto 2002 in a detailed manner 3 4 influence of scour hole on the pressure distribution in fig 13 time averaged dynamic pressure in excess of hydrostatic pressure distributions around the cylinder over different horizontal planes are presented for certain levels above the initial bed level both for rigid bed and scoured bottom cases as can be seen from fig 12 these four characteristic levels were selected 1 in the regions near the bed located within the downflow zone 2 slightly far from the bed located within the downflow zone 3 mid depth region and 4 surface roller region it can be deduced from fig 13 that differing from the rigid bottom case for scoured bottom case dynamic pressure values behind the cylinder close to the bottom i e for z 0 5 cm and z 5 5 cm always take positive values as a consequence of the vanishing of the lee wake vortices this situation is an obvious manifestation of the diminishing of the adverse pressure gradient around the body due to the presence of the scour hole this prevents the formation of negative pressure behind the pile rendering the pile to be more streamlined however apparently this impact of the scour hole on the adverse pressure gradient decreases towards the surface as a result of this at the levels of z 15 5 cm and z 28 5 cm negative pressure fields take place behind the obstacle although they are rather faint another conclusion that can be drawn from fig 13 is that the streamwise pressure gradients p x in front of the pile near the bed i e for z 0 5 and z 5 5 are significantly steeper for scoured bottom case compared to rigid bottom cases however behind the cylinder this pattern turns the other way around this pressure gradient pattern can be linked to the fact that the bottom surface slope of the scour hole is steeper at the upstream and it is significantly less steep at the downstream compared to the rigid bed case for all the elevations the dynamic pressure calculated in the scoured bottom case takes relatively higher values compared to its counterpart points for the rigid bed case this situation can be attributed to the fact that the velocity values around the cylinder for the scoured bottom case are significantly lower compared to rigid bed cases due to the presence of the scour hole last but not least the asymmetry in pressure distribution around the cylinder for the case of the scoured bottom is quite distinguishable this obvious asymmetry can be thought of as a direct consequence of the asymmetry of the scoured bottom also it should be noted that the asymmetry in pressure distribution can also be the main reason behind the asymmetry of lscsv downstream of the obstacle in fig 14 for comparative analysis the pressure distributions around the cylinders as a function of the bearing angle θ are given for different characteristics elevations the pressure distributions obtained from the model for the rigid bed case are in very good agreement with the well known pressure distribution around a circular pile in a transcritical regime sumer and fredsøe 1997 p 41 as a general assessment the pressure distribution around the cylinder for the scoured bottom case takes significantly higher values compared to that of the rigid bed case this difference is specifically prominent behind the cylinder i e 90 θ 270 particularly for the cases of z 0 5 cm and z 5 5 cm this implies in a way that the process of scouring has a greater influence on the pressure distribution behind the obstacle rather than the upstream side the strong negative pressures around the rigid bed which is a major contribution to the drag force on the cylinder disappear for the case of the cylinder over the scoured bed this pattern suggests that the resistance drag of a pile placed on a rigid bed is much larger compared to that of a pile over the scoured bed another feature is that the pressure distributions exhibit a symmetrical pattern around the cylinder for these elevations in the scoured bottom case on the other hand again for the scoured bed case within the mid depth i e z 15 5 cm and close to the surface regions i e z 28 5 cm presumably the asymmetrically occurring lscsv figs 8 and 9 bring about asymmetry in distributed pressure around the cylinder it can also be seen clearly from fig 14 that the pressure values take the lowest values around 80 for the cases of rigid bed regardless of the elevation according to the study by achenbach 1968 the separation occurs around the angle of 80 around the reynolds number of 60 000 re 52 800 in the present study it is a well established fact that the phenomenon of the separation is the natural outcome of that the adverse pressure gradient prevails over the favourable pressure gradient around the cylinder viewed in this way it is physically expected that the minima of the pressure distribution emerge around 80 for the rigid bed case in fig 15 pressure distributions for various elevations within the scour hole were given whereas fig 16 shows the pressure distributions around the cylinders for those levels as a function of the bearing angle θ it is seen from fig 15 that towards the bottom within the scour hole the complexity in the pressure distribution pattern decreases furthermore both the strength and the extent of the negative pressure field diminish while getting close to the bottom surface within the scour hole it can also be concluded from fig 15 that within the zone of z 10 5 cm and z 15 5 cm the pressure values predominantly take positive values from fig 16 one can clearly see that the pressure distribution around the pile tends to generate less drag force as one gets closer to the bottom of the pile this is not surprising since the flow velocity gets smaller in the scour hole towards the bottommost point it is worth highlighting a very important conclusion that can be deduced from the results presented in figs 13 16 although the projection area of the pile exposed to flow depth increases in the case of the scoured bed the altered pressure distribution around the pile generates a much smaller drag force per unit length of the pile compared to the rigid bed case such that even the total drag measured along the entire vertical extent of the pile over the scour bed is much less compared to the total drag is acting on the pile over the rigid bed case this finding together with the other results of the study very clearly shows that the presence of the scour hole renders the pile significantly more streamlined against the flow 3 5 influence of scour hole on drag force the impact of the presence of the scour hole on the drag force was also examined within the study drag force f d can be defined as 7 f d 0 2 π p p o r c o s θ d θ where p is the time averaged surface pressure p o is free stream static pressure r is the radius of the pile 0 08 m and θ is the angle drag coefficient c d is the function of the drag force f d eq 8 where ρ is the density of the fluid d is the diameter of the pile 0 16 m and u is free stream velocity 0 33 m s 8 c d f d 1 2 ρ d u 2 during the analysis the variations of drag coefficients were calculated based on the formulas given in eqs 7 and 8 based on these calculations for direct comparative analysis the vertical distributions of drag force coefficients along the depth were given on the same chart for both the rigid bed and the scoured bottom cases as can be clearly deduced from fig 17 the presence of scour hole dramatically drops the drag coefficient compared to that of the case of rigid bed more specifically while for the rigid bed case the drag coefficient takes values around 1 6 for the scoured bottom case drag coefficient varies within the range of 0 6 1 0 it is also worth highlighting that the drag coefficient takes the highest value along with the depth for the scoured bottom case where the coherent structure of lscsv arises this implies that the presence of the coherent structure of lscsv adds further drag for the body therefore while the drag coefficient varies along with the depth uniformly for the rigid bed case it varies erratically along with the depth due to this fact for the scoured bottom case 4 conclusion when a cylinder located on an erodible bed is exposed to flow scour deposition processes take place around the body the alteration of the bottom morphology i e presence of scour hole and deposition mound around the structure significantly affects the patterns of coherent flow structures that emerge around the cylinder in this study a comparative analysis of flow fields around a pile placed over the case of rigid bed and that over scoured bottom were presented based on cfd calculations a high resolution dem i e denser than 1 mm 1 mm data belonging to a scoured bottom which was previously obtained by means of a pulsed laser scanner was incorporated into a calibrated cfd model this comparative analysis revealed the following findings in the rigid bed case when a cylinder is exposed to flow lee wake vortices are typically produced behind the obstacle yet in the scoured bottom case it is seen that due to the alteration of bottom morphometry i e presence of scour hole and deposited mound the lee wake vortices behind the cylinder disappear instead a well defined secondary flow structure lscsv intensively dominates the flow field behind the obstacle for the rigid bed case abrupt streamwise mean velocity transitions are detected behind the obstacle the circulation zone with negative streamwise velocity due to stark lateral shear stress i e severe momentum transfer the decay of lee wake vortices in a short distance can be regarded as the natural consequence of the strong lateral shear stress which is a well known mechanism of pile flow interaction on the other hand in the case of scoured bottom the drop of u u in the wake region exhibits quite gradually varying patterns due to the presence of the scour hole hence the circulation region with negative streamwise velocity vanishes this could be explained by the fact that the existence of the scour hole markedly reduces the contraction effect at the edges of the obstacle in the scoured bottom condition streamwise time averaged velocity values significantly increase over the deposited mound due to the contraction effect on the vertical plane this accelerated flow zone spreads over quite a large zone towards downstream of the obstacle in this zone velocity values near the bed and near the water surface are prominently lower compared to that of the mid depth region in an unusual manner the presence of scour hole amends vertical time averaged velocity at the upstream of the cylinder within the scour hole negative vertical mean velocity is seen to dominate the entire scour hole the strength of this downflow near the bottom i e particularly in the scour hole is significantly higher for the scoured bottom case compared to that of the rigid bed at the downstream of the body while for the scoured bottom case no negative vertical velocity values are observed in the rigid bed case two vertical recirculation cells are detected due to the presence of the scour hole differing from the rigid bed case near the bottom region negative dynamic pressure values behind the cylinder turn into positive values possibly due to the absence of lee wake vortices this situation can be interpreted as that adverse pressure gradient around the body dramatically weakens due to the presence of the scour hole nevertheless the influence of the scour hole on the adverse pressure gradient diminishes towards the water surface consequently negative pressure fields arise behind the obstacle within the mid depth and water surface regions despite it is quite weak although the projection area of the pile exposed to flow depth increases in the case of the scoured bed the altered pressure distribution around the pile generates a much smaller drag force per unit length of the pile compared to the rigid bed case such that even the total drag measured along the entire vertical extent of the pile over the scour bed is much less compared to the total drag is acting on the pile over the rigid bed case this finding together with the other results of the study very clearly shows that the presence of the scour hole renders the pile significantly more streamlined against the flow the results also revealed that the presence of lscsv brings about an increase in the drag coefficient locally while drag coefficient changes uniformly along with the depth for the case of rigid bed in scoured bottom case a local increase in drag coefficient was monitored due to the presence of lscsv in an overall assessment all the findings presented above clearly demonstrated that the process of scouring is an efficient self defence mechanism in nature this reduces the drag force applied to the body and reconfigures the existing flow conditions in a favourable way in terms of the stability of the pile

20929,environmentally friendly piled coastal defence structures gained a particular significance in recent years given these structures do not interrupt the longshore cross shore sediment transport flow around an emergent pile is known to generate certain typical coherent flow patterns depending on the flow and boundary conditions as well as geometry when the bed is erodible the scouring process which typically takes place around the pile significantly alters these generated coherent structures the primary objective of this study is to understand the influence of the presence of a scour hole around the pile on the coherent flow structures time averaged kinematic characteristics i e mean flow and turbulence as well as dynamic pressure characteristics to achieve this objective a three dimensional numerical model was utilized the model that solves the flow around the emergent pile on rigid bed was calibrated by using a spatially and temporally high resolution experimental dataset later on high resolution dem data of a scoured bottom from flume experiments were imported into the calibrated model and the model was run with identical hydraulic conditions with the experiments then the outputs of the two models with rigid bed and with scoured bottom conditions were comparatively analysed it was seen that as a consequence of the presence of a scour hole lee wake vortices were dramatically weakened behind the cylinder instead of that a couple of pronounced large scale counter rotating streamwise vortices lscsv behind the cylinder dominate the flow domain to a great extent

this scour process the extent of the scour can be global or local depending on the surrounding conditions sumer et al 2005 this alteration in the boundary condition due to scour affects the existing

horseshoe vortex however their simulations did not incorporate the lee wake vortices the effect of lee wake vortices was evaluated in depth by baykal et al 2015 through the 3d numerical modelling for scour around a vertical cylinder according to sumer and fredsøe 1997 the cylinder reynolds number has a major effect on the characteristics of lee wake in addition the flow becomes unsteady in the lee wake region when the reynolds number is larger than 40 therefore once this threshold value is exceeded the vortex shedding starts occurring with a certain frequency baykal et al 2015 stated that these vortices at the lee side of the cylinder change over its height depending on the character of the velocity profile and the boundary layer condition also an increase in the boundary layer momentum resulting from increasing the bed roughness leads to a delay in separation sumer and fredsøe 1997 consequently the magnitude of vorticity becomes smaller near the bed and the lee wake vortices in the lower part of the cylinder are weaker than the upper part furthermore the experiments by kitsikoudis et al 2016 showed that the near bed flow begins to decelerate as a result of flow separation but the turbulence intensity suddenly rises behind the obstacle and its maximum is located in the distance about twice of the cylinder s diameter in downstream the scour around the cylinder has transient behaviour and its development is composed of various stages until the equilibrium stage is established the vortex shedding frequency as well as the generated secondary flow structures around the obstacle alters this dynamic process depending on the stage of the scour the scour depth eventually attains an equilibrium condition when the downflow originated secondary flow patterns can no longer transport the particles dey 1995 jacobsen et al 2014 petersen 2014 however it should be borne in mind that at the macroscopic scale the transportation of these particles in a scour hole is not only the consequence of time averaged secondary flow patterns but also the duration of energetic events as well as the length scale of the flow structure valyrakis et al 2013 so far it was impractical to detect such events in field studies with measurements yet the recently developed miniaturised instrumented particle by al obaidi et al 2020 became a promising device in further resolving the impact of such events in field measurements baker 1985 found that when the ratio of scour depth to the cylinder s diameter reaches 1 3 the scour process generally reaches equilibrium condition however this is not a crisp number and has a standard deviation of around 0 7 sumer and fredsøe 2002 the circulation of the horseshoe vortex increases with a decreasing rate in the scour hole and then this rate becomes constant at the equilibrium condition melville 1975 in the equilibrium scour the size of the horseshoe vortex increases and the bed shear stress decreases contrarily thus the development of the scour hole halts raudkivi and ettema 1983 the experiments by melville 1997 demonstrated that while the initial development of the scour hole is due to enhanced local shear stress near the obstacle the succeeding development is because of the strong downflow yagci et al 2017 experimentally found that the strength of the downflow increases while scouring is in progress eventually the downflow generated horseshoe vortex loses its capability to erode the bed material when the equilibrium condition is attained the occurrence stage of equilibrium conditions depends on bed material size of the obstruction flow and channel characteristics breusers et al 1977 the experimental studies by euler et al 2014 and kitsikoudis et al 2017 confirmed the effect of the inclination of a solid cylinder on flow structures they revealed that the increasing inclination of the cylinder renders the pile to be more streamlined in shape thus the scour volume decreases because the downflow at upstream gets weaker in addition due to the inclination the formation of the horseshoe vortex declines which causes less turbulence and the vortex shedding in the wake region becomes suppressed consequently inclination produces less scour volume and it decreases the scour depth and the location of maximum scour depth behind the obstacle shifts to downstream in general the higher the separation distance measured in upstream of the cylinder is the stronger the horseshoe vortex and the downflow around the obstacle are majd et al 2016 experimentally investigated the separation distance at the upstream of the cylinder which is the indicator of the strength of the primary mechanism the horseshoe vortex that drives the scour around the vertical pile they visualized this distance for various cylinder reynolds numbers and found that the separation distance tends to decrease with increasing cylinder reynolds number as aforementioned the dynamic physical processes behind the development of a scour hole is largely controlled by the obstacle flow and bottom morphometry characteristics during the scour development with the influence of the changing boundary conditions all the secondary coherent flow patterns exhibit an alternation however once the equilibrium condition is attained with the effect of stabilised new morphology around the obstacle the modified coherent structures also achieve a stable pattern the primary objective of the present study is to get a better understanding of the influence of scoured bottom around the cylinder on flow and turbulence structure in line with this perspective a direct comparison is made between the flow structures around the solid cylinder for the conditions of rigid bed and that of the scoured bottom first a 3d numerical model which focuses on the flow around the cylinder was set and validated against the intensive experimental dataset previously obtained by kitsikoudis et al 2016 under the rigid bed condition as a second step a high resolution dem data has a grid size smaller than 1 mm 1 mm of the scoured bottom case was incorporated into the calibrated model as a new bed condition this was followed by a comparative analysis of the outputs of the two numerical models run for the rigid bed and the scoured bottom conditions the primary aim of the study was to answer the following questions based on the numerical models what is the influence of the scour hole on coherent flow structures behind around the obstacle what is the effect of scour hole and deposited mound on time averaged kinematic characteristics of the flow in the vicinity of the cylinder what is the impact of the presence of scour hole on downflow upflow structures around the body how does the presence of a scour hole alter the dynamic pressure field around the obstruction inside and outside of the scour hole 2 methodology the study was designed upon the run of two consecutive numerical models in fig 1 the summary of the steps in the numerical modelling process is shown as a flow chart the primary focus of the first model was to simulate the flow field around a solid cylinder located on a rigid bed during the construction of the first numerical model as stated in fig 1 firstly the geometry of the obstacle mesh characteristics the initial and boundary conditions were defined this is followed by imposing the candidate rans turbulence closure models i e k epsilon k ω and rng into the model to replicate the turbulence characteristics in the flow field after running each turbulence model for the validation exercise the numerical model outputs from each model were compared with the experimental reference data which was originally produced by kitsikoudis et al 2016 by flume experiments this direct comparison showed that k ω was the best compatible turbulence model for this experimental data after this stage the k ω turbulence closure was utilized throughout the study unless the obtained outcomes are independent of the mesh properties the numerical outputs might be questionable or misleading therefore based on the asme standards standard for verification and validation in computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer mesh independency analyses were conducted this analysis assured that the numerical outcomes were independent of the properties of the imposed mesh after these steps the calibrated numerical model which successfully simulated the flow around a solid cylinder positioned on the rigid bottom was ready for the next step as mentioned above the primary objective of this study was to get a better understanding of the flow structure around the circular cylinder located on scoured bottom in equilibrium condition in line with the aim at the second step of this work high resolution dem data of the scoured bottom was incorporated into the calibrated model as the solid bottom condition the dem data was experimentally obtained by yagci et al 2017 fig 2 after the equilibrium bed condition was attained around a vertical emergent circular cylinder it is worth highlighting that the experiments by kitsikoudis et al 2016 and yagci et al 2017 were conducted in the same flume under identical flow conditions while undisturbed flow velocity was 0 29 m s in yagci et al 2017 this value was 0 33 m s in kitsikoudis et al 2016 these close values incidentally produce identical reynolds numbers this enabled the compatibility of incorporation of the dem data collected by yagci et al 2017 into the numerical model once the model is calibrated based on the data of kitsikoudis et al 2016 in their study yagci et al 2017 investigated clear water scour around an emergent cylinder for cohesionless sediment by employing a leica scan station c10 laser scanner for the creation of the digitised three dimensional map of the equilibrium bed they scanned the scoured bed for an approximately 1 m length of the flume across the full width the scan was repeated from six different locations for each scanning the resolution of the scanning grid was set as 1 mm 1 mm the view of the incorporated scoured bed data was given in fig 2 this high resolution dem data enables us to accurately simulate the flow structure around the scoured bottom which dictates turbulence production dissipation and total drag in the flow field once the dem data was imposed into the numerical model the mesh was regenerated accordingly the initial and boundary conditions were kept as in the previously calibrated model except the new bottom condition for which the model was run the numerical outputs were post processed and the results in terms of reynolds averaged velocity and turbulence kinetic energy profiles were validated in a typical scour hole that attained an equilibrium condition in the clear water scour regime it is expected that the sediment mobility number i e the ratio of the shields parameter to the critical shields parameter including the slope correction θ θ c r attains to a value smaller than or equal to unity as additional validation of the second numerical model the spatial distribution of θ θ c r in the vicinity of scoured bed was calculated by use of the bed shear stress values from the model and sediment characteristics from yagci et al 2017 it was seen that the model results satisfied with this fundamental condition as a consequence of these consecutive steps two numerical models which allow us to make a comparative analysis of the flow field around a solid cylinder located on the rigid bed and that of the scoured bottom were produced during this analysis the instantaneous coherent structures around the obstacles the time averaged flow quantities and the pressure distributions around the bodies were compared 2 1 description of the hydrodynamic model 2 1 1

as a wall boundary condition nikuradse type roughness for the bottom wall was selected as 0 00156 m as three times the median grain size of bed material for equivalent sand roughness marriot and jayaratne 2010 side walls were assumed as a smooth wall in line with the experimental condition as is in kitsikoudis et al 2016 the upside boundary condition was selected as a pressure type boundary condition and defined as relative pressure which is equal to zero at the inlet boundary the velocity of water was defined as 0 33 m s which corresponds to a cylinder reynolds number of 52800 this value falls within the range of the subcritical regime i e wake region is completely turbulent the boundary layer is laminar sumer and fredsøe 1997 outlet boundary was selected as a free outflow both the outlet and the inlet water levels were defined as constant the depth was set to 0 31 m as in the experiments of kitsikoudis et al 2016 2 1 5 mesh generation a quadratic type of mesh was used in the numerical models as explained above in detail two different models were run during the study the first one was on rigid bed the second one was scoured bottom in equilibrium condition during the generation of mesh the same mesh quality was maintained for both of these cases basically for these characteristic cases two different mesh resolutions were applied in a planar surface around the cylinder for refinement the growth rates and aspect ratios around the solid cylinders were set to 1 2 and 1 respectively within this condensed mesh in addition for the case of the scoured bottom model these ratios were kept constant inside the scour hole to improve the mesh quality near the bottom the characteristics of the mesh structures of these two models were briefly summarised in table 1 below the numerical model was validated against the experimental data by kitsikoudis et al 2016 in the numerical model the numerical probes were placed at identical coordinates with that of the physical probes of kitsikoudis et al fig 3 2016 to make a direct comparison the time series were extracted from the model output with a sampling frequency of 100 hz i e the same measurement frequency was used in the relevant experiments 2 2 model validation 2 2 1 selection of the turbulence closure model three different turbulence closure models were tested to see their performance in the representation of turbulence processes in the flow field behind the obstruction the candidate approximations to simulate the turbulence were k ω i e the original version developed by wilcox standard k epsilon and renormalisation group rng k epsilon closures the simulations for testing these models were run until the mass averaged kinetic energy of the model domain was stabilised once the numerical stability is attained the results of the models were then post processed and compared with the experimentally measured velocity data the numerical trials indicated that the k ω turbulence model yielded significantly better agreement with the data compared to the other tested turbulence closure models the high efficiency of the k ω closure model in the case of boundary layer flows with a strong adverse pressure gradient or flow separation has already been shown in the pertinent literature roulund et al 2005 baykal et al 2015 larsen et al 2016 with this result k ω turbulence closure was utilized throughout the numerical campaign 2 2 2 validation for the case of flow around cylinder over rigid bed as stated above the numerical model with the rigid bed condition was validated against the experimental data for the validation four different parameters were used dimensionless time averaged streamwise velocities u u streamwise and lateral turbulence intensities u r m s u v r m s u and normalized turbulence kinetic energy t k e u 2 the comparisons made between the results of the numerical model and that of the experiments were made at the described locations in the flow field the variation of time averaged velocity and turbulence quantities i e u u u r m s u v r m s u t k e u 2 at the upstream and downstream centerline of the solid cylinder y d 0 the time averaged velocity and turbulence quantities averaged across the depth i e u u u r m s u v r m s u t k e u 2 along the centerline of the flume y d 0 at upstream and downstream of the solid cylinder the variation of time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulence quantities i e u u u r m s u v r m s u t k e u 2 at the horizontal plane i e planar surface at z h 0 4 at the downstream of the solid cylinder the angle brackets denote depth averaging such as 4 u 1 h 0 h u z d z as can be seen from fig 4 a the time averaged streamwise velocity distribution along with the depth at the centerline of the cylinder obtained by the numerical model is generally in good agreement with that measured in the experiments although the numerical model yields slightly lower values for the near bed region at this region the cylinder induced turbulence has a less significant role in governing the flow domain compared to the bed generated turbulence i e at upstream and far downstream of the obstacle a probable reason for this slight difference is that due to the nature of the experimental measurements by adv in kitsikoudis et al 2016 the adv probe employed in the experiments may have presumably created a certain contraction effect near the bed region this might induce a subtle increment in time averaged velocities near the bed however at the near downstream of the cylinder due to the fact that the flow domain is largely controlled by the obstacle induced turbulence rather than adv probe induced turbulence and the inertia of the flow is reduced this adv induced contraction effect near the bottom is relatively mitigated hence in those regions numerical model outputs and experimental measurements are better in agreement as an overall assessment it can be said that the numerical model yielded a satisfactory performance in simulating the distribution of time averaged streamwise velocity and turbulence quantities across the depth at the centerline of the flume in fig 5 a the depth averaged streamwise velocities along the centerline at upstream and downstream of the solid cylinder are given this type of comparison of the data enables us to evaluate the capability of the numerical model in the simulation of flow characteristics in a broader perspective in line with the comparison given in the previous paragraph the numerical model is shown to be capable of capturing the streamwise velocity values along the centerline with high accuracy the longitudinal distribution of the depth averaged streamwise turbulence intensity along the flume centerline u r m s u is given in fig 5b when fig 5b is examined it can be seen that the numerical model output exhibited a reasonable performance in terms of representing cylinder induced streamwise turbulence intensity a similar analysis can also be made for the performance of the numerical model in simulating the depth averaged lateral turbulence intensities v r m s u and depth averaged turbulence kinetic energy t k e u 2 in fig 5c and d respectively differing from fig 5b in fig 5c and d the values slightly deviate from the experimental data at the upstream and downstream of the pile respectively these slight deviations presumably stem from the handling of the turbulence closure in k ω model such that u r m s and v r m s in the numerical model correspond to the vortex shedding induced turbulence whereas t k e corresponds to the sub grid turbulence on the other hand experimental data includes both sources of turbulence therefore the numerical model generally tends to slightly underestimate the turbulence quantities compared to that from the experiments however the outputs are in acceptable agreement in fig 6 the comparison of lateral distributions of u u u r m s u v r m s u and t k e u 2 between experimental and numerical data were given for the planar surface of z h 0 4 as can be seen from fig 6 there is a good agreement between the experiment and the numerical results in terms of u u on the other hand turbulence intensities calculated by the numerical model slightly deviate from the experimental data the same remarks can be repeated for the normalized tke t k e u 2 as well it is seen that u r m s and t k e values close to the cylinder are underestimated by the numerical model fig 6b and c the reason for this underestimation is related to the handling of the turbulence closure in the present model as explained above on the other hand the model overpredicts v r m s values close to the cylinder particularly at x 1 25d 2d this result shows that the strength of lee wake vortices at the given range is higher in the numerical model outputs compared to the experiments presumably because of the weaker turbulence dissipation estimated in the model due to the breaking up of vortices into smaller vortices a quantitative comparison of numerical model results with the experimental results presented in fig 6 shows that the relative mean error is around 15 on average if the number of the comparison sections i e lateral profiles are considered such a deviation from the experimental data can be regarded as acceptable as discussed above the accuracy of the model results was tested against the experimental data collected on a three dimensional measurement grid by kitsikoudis et al 2016 although a great number of comparison points were used during this verification process and a satisfactory agreement was obtained between the experimental data and the numerical model there were still slight deviations from experimental data in urms vrms and tke overwhelmingly within the region between 1 5d 4 0d according to the experimental data by kitsikoudis et al 2016 this region corresponds to the zone where the convective acceleration in streamwise direction takes its highest value fig 6a in kitsikoudis et al 2016 also the increase in tke is the steepest in this region along the entire wake the physical reason behind such a sudden variation of flow quantities in the wake region can be explained by the presence of shear induced lateral momentum transfer more specifically due to the velocity deficit between wake region and contraction region sudden lateral momentum transfers periodically block the pairs of vortices this sudden and periodic effect brings about the formation of macroscale and microscale coherent structures in the flow domain in a typical experiment differing from the perfectly idealized boundary conditions in the numerical model the surface roughness in surfaces fluid properties i e viscosity density temperature suspended particles are spatially or temporally variable it is obvious that the scales of these coherent structures are quite sensitive to many boundary conditions apparently the utilized rans model is not perfect in capturing some coherent structures that cause additional turbulence and thus the present numerical results deviate from experimental data at certain regions 2 2 3 validation for the case of flow around cylinder over scoured bottom as stated above the numerical model developed for the scoured bottom case was validated conceptually by means of the mobility number of the bed sediment θ θ c r which is defined as the ratio of the shields parameter to the critical shields parameter including the slope correction the shields parameter non dimensional bed shear stress is defined by 5 θ τ γ s γ d 50 where τ is the local bed shear stress d 50 is the median sediment grain size of bed material γ is the specific weight of the water and γ s is the specific weight of sediment grains θ c r is the critical shields parameter corrected for the slope effect roulund et al 2005 6 θ c r θ c r 0 cos β 1 sin 2 α tan 2 β tan 2 ϕ cos α sin β tan ϕ here θ c r 0 is the critical shields parameter for bed sediment on a flatbed ϕ is the angle of repose of bed sediment β is the local transverse slope angle and α is the angle between the local flow velocity vector and the direction of the local steepest bed slope fig 4 in roulund et al 2005 the modified critical shields parameter given in eq 6 ensures that the slope effect transverse uphill or downhill orientation is accounted for in the mobility of the bed sediment in the experiments of yagci et al 2017 undisturbed far field shields parameter was measured as θ 0 04 whereas the undisturbed critical shields parameter was θ c r 0 0 045 resulting in a clear water scour regime yagci et al 2017 reported that the equilibrium scour conditions were almost established at the end of their tests which would suggest having the θ θ c r 1 condition satisfied around the pile i e in the scour hole the sediment mobility θ θ c r was calculated over the entire domain of the numerical flume bed by use of the sediment data of yagci et al 2017 d 50 0 52 mm γ s γ 2 65 ϕ 42 with the spatial distribution of τ taken from the numerical model results the result is shown in fig 7 as can be seen the θ θ c r 1 condition is satisfied almost all over the bed with the exception of a thin crescent shaped region at the immediate upstream of the scour hole shown in brown contour this is actually not unexpected since the experimental conditions of yagci et al 2017 indicated that very slight sediment mobility was still seen given that their experiments lasted around 8 h shorter than the expected perfect equilibrium this result shows that the numerical model is capable of representing the near bed flow of the tested case 3 analysis of the results in this section the numerical outputs of the rigid bed and scoured bottom cases were presented in a comparative manner for understanding the influence of the presence of a scour hole on the flow structure around the cylinder in fig 8 the variations of instantaneous streamlines around the cylinders were presented for the two characteristic cases i e flow around the cylinder on a rigid bed and that on the scoured bottom cases respectively generally speaking the coherent flow structures taking place around an obstacle are basically dictated by the geometrical properties of the obstacle flow characteristics as well as morphological features of the bed the obstacle i e cylinder diameter surface roughness and flow characteristics initial and boundary conditions were kept constant throughout the present numerical modelling study therefore the flow structures which emerged after the scour can be regarded as the direct consequence of the altered bottom condition in other words the alteration of bed morphology due to scour creates the differences in flow characteristics around the obstacle when fig 8 is examined within this perspective it can be concluded that once the scouring process attains an equilibrium condition the coherent flow structures around the body exhibit an entirely different character compared to those of the rigid bed case owing to the modified morphometric features of the bed around the cylinder the lee wake vortices cyclic vortex shedding behind the obstacle significantly die out instead a new secondary flow structure namely large scale counter rotating streamwise vortices lscsv dominate the flow domain behind the obstacle to a great extent as can be deduced from fig 8 this characteristic flow structure i e lscsv asymmetrically distributed at the near downstream of the cylinder owing to the asymmetries of the scoured bed geometry in order to get a better understanding of the lscsv the data from four characteristic cross sections located at downstream of the body were extracted from the flow domain and given in fig 9 as can be concluded from fig 9 a couple of asymmetrically distributed lscsv significantly dominate the flow domain behind the obstacle the strength of this characteristic coherent structure is the most pronounced close to the pile e g for x 0 5d and weakens toward further downstream in a typical scour experiment the asymmetry in the scour hole is an expected natural feature given that the initial condition of the bed cannot be perfectly homogeneous or symmetric in terms of porosity and compaction this non homogeneous bottom condition inevitably produces an asymmetrical scour hole and an asymmetrical ridge as can be confirmed from fig 2 see fig 4a in yagci et al 2017 for further details based on this basic fact it can be asserted that the asymmetry of the scour hole and the ridge could be the major factor behind the occurrence of the asymmetrical lscsv observed in fig 9 another significant outcome that can be drawn from fig 9 is that as the strength of the lscsv weakens in the direction of the flow the centers of the lscsvs shift outwards for both of the vortices in addition it can be barely noticed that only the dominant lscsv still exists even at the 4d downstream of the body while the smaller lscsv vanished in a shorter extent 3 1 influence of scour hole on the streamwise velocity distribution in figs 10 and 11 the spatial distribution of time averaged streamwise velocities u u over the vertical plane along the edges and the centerline of the cylinders were presented in a normalized manner for both of the tested cases when a general comparison is made with regard to the flow structure belonging to the rigid bed fig 10 and scoured bottom fig 11 cases certain remarkable differences are seen immediately the main reason behind this dramatic difference can be considered that while the lee wake vortices dominate the wake region in the rigid bed case in the scoured bottom condition this zone is mostly dictated by the coherent flow structure of lscsv as previously discussed fig 10 points out that the recirculation zone the dark blue region with negative streamwise velocity originated due to the lee wake vortices located just downstream of the cylinder which is a severely considerable rigid bed case therefore for this case rather sudden transitions of streamwise velocity u x are observed behind the obstacle compared to that of the scoured bottom case this implies that strong vorticities emerge behind the obstacle and dissipated in a short distance a well known feature of flow behind a pile kitsikoudis et al 2017 the dissipation of lee wake vortices within a short distance can be considered as the natural consequence of the stronger lateral shear stress which takes place in the case of the pile on a rigid bed case this strong lateral shear stress i e momentum transfer is the direct consequence of the stark contraction effect fig 10a and c as well as the significant drop in velocity within the lee side region fig 10b differing from the rigid bed case for the scoured bottom case the decrease of u u in the wake region is significantly less no negative velocities and it exhibits a gradually varying pattern as can be seen from fig 11a and c the presence of scour hole significantly dampens the contraction effect at the edges of the obstacle and prevent the sudden drop of velocity behind the obstruction this situation causes the change of velocity pattern quite gradually in the flow direction 3 2 influence of deposited mound on the distribution of streamwise velocity in addition to the above analysis the increased velocity values were observed in the scoured bottom condition at the further downstream of the obstacle fig 11 high velocity values occupy a significantly larger zone in this case it can be easily noticed that this high velocity zone is located over the deposited mound where a significant contraction effect on the vertical plane is expected because of the decreased water depth i e due to the presence of the deposited mound besides it is also seen from fig 11 that multiple ripples are uniformly distributed over the deposited mound while velocities are relatively higher on those ripple crests velocities are considerably lower at the lee of the ripples in a physically consistent way it is also worth mentioning the streamwise velocity distribution over the deposited mound fig 11b the vertical velocity distribution over the deposited mound exhibits a quite unusual character in this zone the highest values occur around the mid depth while the velocity values near the water surface and near the bed take relatively lower values in an overall assessment the findings reveal that the coherent structure terms as lscsv which substitutes for the lee wake vortices due to the presence of scoured bottom brings about a more complex flow pattern 3 3 comparative analysis of the time averaged vertical velocity in fig 12 the contour plots of time averaged vertical velocity distribution at upstream and downstream of the cylinder over the vertical plane along the centerline were given for both the rigid bed and scoured bottom cases in these figures the vector plots at certain longitudinal intervals are also shown a common pattern seen from the figures of both cases is that just upstream of the obstacle there are distinct positive and negative vertical velocity regions near the surface and the bottom region respectively these patterns are clear manifestations of the two well known coherent structures 1 surface roller and 2 downflow it is also seen from fig 12b that both surface roller and downflow regions expand due to the presence of the scour hole particularly the strength of the downflow near the bottom within the scour hole is significantly augmented compared to the rigid bed case this result is consistent with the finding obtained by yagci et al 2017 who experimentally observed that the strength of downflow increases during the scouring process this is so remarkable that the negative vertical time averaged velocity covers the entire scour hole besides sudden downward negative vertical velocities are observed just at the upstream end of the scour hole probably due to the sudden expansion of the cross sectional flow area with the presence of the scour hole it is also seen from fig 12 that no negative vertical velocity values are detected for the scoured bottom case at downstream of the obstacle differing from the rigid bed case in the rigid bed case there are noticeable downward directed velocity values behind the body this situation is so clear that the vectors within this zone for the rigid bed case demonstrate two vertical recirculation cells among those two cells the one observed near the bottom is significantly smaller than the one near the surface the larger recirculation observed near the surface is the consequence of the adverse pressure gradient induced lee wake vortices as previously analysed by graf and istiarto 2002 in a detailed manner 3 4 influence of scour hole on the pressure distribution in fig 13 time averaged dynamic pressure in excess of hydrostatic pressure distributions around the cylinder over different horizontal planes are presented for certain levels above the initial bed level both for rigid bed and scoured bottom cases as can be seen from fig 12 these four characteristic levels were selected 1 in the regions near the bed located within the downflow zone 2 slightly far from the bed located within the downflow zone 3 mid depth region and 4 surface roller region it can be deduced from fig 13 that differing from the rigid bottom case for scoured bottom case dynamic pressure values behind the cylinder close to the bottom i e for z 0 5 cm and z 5 5 cm always take positive values as a consequence of the vanishing of the lee wake vortices this situation is an obvious manifestation of the diminishing of the adverse pressure gradient around the body due to the presence of the scour hole this prevents the formation of negative pressure behind the pile rendering the pile to be more streamlined however apparently this impact of the scour hole on the adverse pressure gradient decreases towards the surface as a result of this at the levels of z 15 5 cm and z 28 5 cm negative pressure fields take place behind the obstacle although they are rather faint another conclusion that can be drawn from fig 13 is that the streamwise pressure gradients p x in front of the pile near the bed i e for z 0 5 and z 5 5 are significantly steeper for scoured bottom case compared to rigid bottom cases however behind the cylinder this pattern turns the other way around this pressure gradient pattern can be linked to the fact that the bottom surface slope of the scour hole is steeper at the upstream and it is significantly less steep at the downstream compared to the rigid bed case for all the elevations the dynamic pressure calculated in the scoured bottom case takes relatively higher values compared to its counterpart points for the rigid bed case this situation can be attributed to the fact that the velocity values around the cylinder for the scoured bottom case are significantly lower compared to rigid bed cases due to the presence of the scour hole last but not least the asymmetry in pressure distribution around the cylinder for the case of the scoured bottom is quite distinguishable this obvious asymmetry can be thought of as a direct consequence of the asymmetry of the scoured bottom also it should be noted that the asymmetry in pressure distribution can also be the main reason behind the asymmetry of lscsv downstream of the obstacle in fig 14 for comparative analysis the pressure distributions around the cylinders as a function of the bearing angle θ are given for different characteristics elevations the pressure distributions obtained from the model for the rigid bed case are in very good agreement with the well known pressure distribution around a circular pile in a transcritical regime sumer and fredsøe 1997 p 41 as a general assessment the pressure distribution around the cylinder for the scoured bottom case takes significantly higher values compared to that of the rigid bed case this difference is specifically prominent behind the cylinder i e 90 θ 270 particularly for the cases of z 0 5 cm and z 5 5 cm this implies in a way that the process of scouring has a greater influence on the pressure distribution behind the obstacle rather than the upstream side the strong negative pressures around the rigid bed which is a major contribution to the drag force on the cylinder disappear for the case of the cylinder over the scoured bed this pattern suggests that the resistance drag of a pile placed on a rigid bed is much larger compared to that of a pile over the scoured bed another feature is that the pressure distributions exhibit a symmetrical pattern around the cylinder for these elevations in the scoured bottom case on the other hand again for the scoured bed case within the mid depth i e z 15 5 cm and close to the surface regions i e z 28 5 cm presumably the asymmetrically occurring lscsv figs 8 and 9 bring about asymmetry in distributed pressure around the cylinder it can also be seen clearly from fig 14 that the pressure values take the lowest values around 80 for the cases of rigid bed regardless of the elevation according to the study by achenbach 1968 the separation occurs around the angle of 80 around the reynolds number of 60 000 re 52 800 in the present study it is a well established fact that the phenomenon of the separation is the natural outcome of that the adverse pressure gradient prevails over the favourable pressure gradient around the cylinder viewed in this way it is physically expected that the minima of the pressure distribution emerge around 80 for the rigid bed case in fig 15 pressure distributions for various elevations within the scour hole were given whereas fig 16 shows the pressure distributions around the cylinders for those levels as a function of the bearing angle θ it is seen from fig 15 that towards the bottom within the scour hole the complexity in the pressure distribution pattern decreases furthermore both the strength and the extent of the negative pressure field diminish while getting close to the bottom surface within the scour hole it can also be concluded from fig 15 that within the zone of z 10 5 cm and z 15 5 cm the pressure values predominantly take positive values from fig 16 one can clearly see that the pressure distribution around the pile tends to generate less drag force as one gets closer to the bottom of the pile this is not surprising since the flow velocity gets smaller in the scour hole towards the bottommost point it is worth highlighting a very important conclusion that can be deduced from the results presented in figs 13 16 although the projection area of the pile exposed to flow depth increases in the case of the scoured bed the altered pressure distribution around the pile generates a much smaller drag force per unit length of the pile compared to the rigid bed case such that even the total drag measured along the entire vertical extent of the pile over the scour bed is much less compared to the total drag is acting on the pile over the rigid bed case this finding together with the other results of the study very clearly shows that the presence of the scour hole renders the pile significantly more streamlined against the flow 3 5 influence of scour hole on drag force the impact of the presence of the scour hole on the drag force was also examined within the study drag force f d can be defined as 7 f d 0 2 π p p o r c o s θ d θ where p is the time averaged surface pressure p o is free stream static pressure r is the radius of the pile 0 08 m and θ is the angle drag coefficient c d is the function of the drag force f d eq 8 where ρ is the density of the fluid d is the diameter of the pile 0 16 m and u is free stream velocity 0 33 m s 8 c d f d 1 2 ρ d u 2 during the analysis the variations of drag coefficients were calculated based on the formulas given in eqs 7 and 8 based on these calculations for direct comparative analysis the vertical distributions of drag force coefficients along the depth were given on the same chart for both the rigid bed and the scoured bottom cases as can be clearly deduced from fig 17 the presence of scour hole dramatically drops the drag coefficient compared to that of the case of rigid bed more specifically while for the rigid bed case the drag coefficient takes values around 1 6 for the scoured bottom case drag coefficient varies within the range of 0 6 1 0 it is also worth highlighting that the drag coefficient takes the highest value along with the depth for the scoured bottom case where the coherent structure of lscsv arises this implies that the presence of the coherent structure of lscsv adds further drag for the body therefore while the drag coefficient varies along with the depth uniformly for the rigid bed case it varies erratically along with the depth due to this fact for the scoured bottom case 4 conclusion when a cylinder located on an erodible bed is exposed to flow scour deposition processes take place around the body the alteration of the bottom morphology i e presence of scour hole and deposition mound around the structure significantly affects the patterns of coherent flow structures that emerge around the cylinder in this study a comparative analysis of flow fields around a pile placed over the case of rigid bed and that over scoured bottom were presented based on cfd calculations a high resolution dem i e denser than 1 mm 1 mm data belonging to a scoured bottom which was previously obtained by means of a pulsed laser scanner was incorporated into a calibrated cfd model this comparative analysis revealed the following findings in the rigid bed case when a cylinder is exposed to flow lee wake vortices are typically produced behind the obstacle yet in the scoured bottom case it is seen that due to the alteration of bottom morphometry i e presence of scour hole and deposited mound the lee wake vortices behind the cylinder disappear instead a well defined secondary flow structure lscsv intensively dominates the flow field behind the obstacle for the rigid bed case abrupt streamwise mean velocity transitions are detected behind the obstacle the circulation zone with negative streamwise velocity due to stark lateral shear stress i e severe momentum transfer the decay of lee wake vortices in a short distance can be regarded as the natural consequence of the strong lateral shear stress which is a well known mechanism of pile flow interaction on the other hand in the case of scoured bottom the drop of u u in the wake region exhibits quite gradually varying patterns due to the presence of the scour hole hence the circulation region with negative streamwise velocity vanishes this could be explained by the fact that the existence of the scour hole markedly reduces the contraction effect at the edges of the obstacle in the scoured bottom condition streamwise time averaged velocity values significantly increase over the deposited mound due to the contraction effect on the vertical plane this accelerated flow zone spreads over quite a large zone towards downstream of the obstacle in this zone velocity values near the bed and near the water surface are prominently lower compared to that of the mid depth region in an unusual manner the presence of scour hole amends vertical time averaged velocity at the upstream of the cylinder within the scour hole negative vertical mean velocity is seen to dominate the entire scour hole the strength of this downflow near the bottom i e particularly in the scour hole is significantly higher for the scoured bottom case compared to that of the rigid bed at the downstream of the body while for the scoured bottom case no negative vertical velocity values are observed in the rigid bed case two vertical recirculation cells are detected due to the presence of the scour hole differing from the rigid bed case near the bottom region negative dynamic pressure values behind the cylinder turn into positive values possibly due to the absence of lee wake vortices this situation can be interpreted as that adverse pressure gradient around the body dramatically weakens due to the presence of the scour hole nevertheless the influence of the scour hole on the adverse pressure gradient diminishes towards the water surface consequently negative pressure fields arise behind the obstacle within the mid depth and water surface regions despite it is quite weak although the projection area of the pile exposed to flow depth increases in the case of the scoured bed the altered pressure distribution around the pile generates a much smaller drag force per unit length of the pile compared to the rigid bed case such that even the total drag measured along the entire vertical extent of the pile over the scour bed is much less compared to the total drag is acting on the pile over the rigid bed case this finding together with the other results of the study very clearly shows that the presence of the scour hole renders the pile significantly more streamlined against the flow the results also revealed that the presence of lscsv brings about an increase in the drag coefficient locally while drag coefficient changes uniformly along with the depth for the case of rigid bed in scoured bottom case a local increase in drag coefficient was monitored due to the presence of lscsv in an overall assessment all the findings presented above clearly demonstrated that the process of scouring is an efficient self defence mechanism in nature this reduces the drag force applied to the body and reconfigures the existing flow conditions in a favourable way in terms of the stability of the pile
