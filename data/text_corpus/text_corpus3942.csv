batches of raw water to be treated are repeatedly mixed i e loaded with a given amount of the ion exchange resin the tests are simple to conduct and because of the high ratio of water to resin used the tests can be completed in 2 3 days orica 2007 the use of mlts to assess the feasibility of ion exchange resins for nom removal is particularly attractive for small and remote communities that do not have the technical and or financial resources to conduct column testing unfortunately only anecdotal evidence exists to support the use of mlts as an alternative to column tests to identify conditions required to meet treatment objectives using ion exchange resins also some studies have suggested that removal of nom during repeated loadings could change depending on the operating

2011 differences in mass transfer could affect nom removal kinetics and therefore the test outcomes times to breakthrough may also differ substantially between column tests and mlts i e weeks vs days respectively in full scale applications resins are regenerated relatively frequently to ensure continuous and effective removal of the constituents of interest however during column tests resins are not regenerated until breakthrough occurs during this time the resin could provide an environment suitable for microbial attachment and growth due to its macro porous structure containing a high surface area flemming 1987 simpson 2008 the presence of a microbial community could impact nom removal and therefore the outcomes from column tests schulz et al 2017 the present study was designed to comprehensively address the current knowledge gap the first objective was to determine if nom removal and resin capacity obtained using column tests are similar to those obtained using mlts the second objective was to quantify the impact of microbial activity on nom removal and resin capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 ion exchange resin purolite a860 a strongly basic macroporous anionic ion exchange resin particle size 0 3 1 2 mm was used in all tests for which abiotic and biotic i e with suppression of biological activity ion exchange resins were considered this resin has an exchange capacity of 0 8 meg ml and was selected because it was previously identified to be effective at removing organic material i e dissolved organic material doc from surface waters bazri and mohseni 2014 2 2 biological activated carbon wood base picabiol granular activated carbon pica carbon with an effective diameter of 1 04 mm was used in all tests for which biological activated carbon bac was considered the activated carbon was harvested from a bac column that has been in operation for more than 5 years and for which all adsorption capacity has been exhausted 2 3 raw waters two raw waters were considered jericho pond jp water vancouver bc and a model raw water containing suwannee river sr nom jp water was pre filtered with a 10 μm cartridge filter and then diluted with tap water to achieve a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 5 mg l 0 3 jp water was of interest because it contains a broad range of nom fractions biopolymers humic substances low molecular weight acids schulz et al 2017 sr nom international humic substances society usa was added to milli q water to achieve a doc concentration of 5 mg l 0 3 sodium bicarbonate was also added to achieve an alkalinity of 50 mg l as caco3 this concentration of bicarbonate corresponds to an alkalinity that is within a range typical of that present in natural source waters hincks and mackie 1997 sr nom water was of interest because it contained a narrower range of nom fractions i e no biopolymers and has been well characterized in the literature malcolm et al 1989 green et al 2015 for the tests conducted under abiotic condition sodium azide was added to the raw waters 0 01 w v to supress microbial activity note that the addition of sodium azide did not impact the instantaneous removal of organic material and was essentially fully recovered from the column i e no retention of sodium azide in the column results not presented 2 4 column tests and multiple loading tests bench scale cylindrical glass columns height 0 5 m inner diameter 0 01 m with bed depths and corresponding bed volumes bv of 0 1 m and 7 85 ml respectively operated in down flow mode were used for all column tests considering iex biex and bac the raw water flow rate was set to achieve an empty bed velocity of 0 2 m h i e 0 0175 l h which corresponds to an empty bed contact time ebct of 30 min or 2 bed volumes bv per hour the treated effluent from the columns was collected daily and stored at 4 c in the dark for subsequent analysis breakthrough was considered to have occurred when the concentration of organic material measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in the effluent c divided by the concentration of doc in the influent co was greater than 0 7 all tests were performed at room temperature 20 2 c multiple loading tests mlts were conducted according to the experimental protocol outlined by orica 2007 briefly a resin volume of 0 75 ml was placed into 150 ml of raw water i e 5 ml of resin per l of water in a 250 ml glass flask and stirred continuously at 100 revolutions per minute rpm with a magnetic stir bar for 30 min i e time equivalent to that of the empty bed contact time for the column tests after the mixing period the resin was separated from the treated water by filtering the solution through a 100 μm screen the separated resin was then transferred to a new 150 ml volume of raw water successive mlts were conducted until breakthrough i e c co 0 7 was observed all tests were performed at room temperature 20 2 c additional single loading tests slts were conducted to assess the impact of mass transfer conditions present in mlts on the removal of organic material a summary of the test conditions considered for the mlts and the additional single loading tests is presented in table 1 the conditions for the slts table 1 were selected to cover a range of set points above and below those in the experimental protocol outlined by orica 2007 a range of temperatures typical of raw waters was also considered 2 5 regeneration three in situ regeneration strategies were considered for the ion exchange resins operated in columns 1 brine 100 g nacl l 2 caustic plus brine 20 g naoh l 100 g nacl l 3 pre disinfection plus caustic plus brine 0 1 per acetic acid before 20 g naoh l 100 g nacl l additional column tests were performed over a 60 day period every regeneration strategy was performed after 30 and 60 days i e after 1300 and 2600 bed volumes to the columns treating jp water with and without suppression of biological activity the regeneration procedure was carried out according to instructions from the resin manufacturer purolite 2014 briefly the columns were first backwashed with 8 bv of previously generated filtrate at a flow equivalent to 45 bv h to remove coarse particles from the filter bed to assess the impact of disinfection on the regeneration efficiency the resin of one of the biotic and one of the abiotic column was then soaked in per acetic acid solution for 2 25 h the resins in the other columns were soaked in milli q water for the same time period regeneration was then performed by soaking the resins in either brine or caustic plus brine solutions for 4 h a new fresh solution was used every 2 h before returning to operation the columns were rinsed with 28 bv of milli q water at a flow equivalent to 2 bv h 2 6 analytical methods the organic material in the raw and treated waters was quantified and characterized using total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc analysis phoenix 8000 toc analyser dohrmann us and uv absorbance analysis at 254 nm uv254 uv300 uv vis spectrometer spectronic unicam us the ratio of uv254 to doc is defined as suva which can be used to characterize nom i e presence of aromatic compounds leenheer and croué 2003 in the discussion the organic material is quantified in terms of normalized concentration which is the ratio of the concentration of organic material after iex treatment at a given time c to the concentration of the untreated water co and in terms of normalized change in suva which is the ratio of suva after iex treatment at a given time suvat suvao to the suva at of the untreated

column hw 50s as described by huber et al 2011 as required samples were pre filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters cat 09 719 555 fisher scientific ca any samples that could not be analysed immediately were stored at 4 c adenosine triphosphate atp was used as a measure microbial activity in the raw and treated waters as well as within a resin column when quantifying the atp at different depths in a column the resins were harvested by carefully breaking the column and collecting resins at 2 cm depth increments atp was quantified using a luminultra biofilm test kit luminultra canada the removal of disinfection by products precursors was assessed on buffered samples ph 8 0 using the uniform formation conditions test ufc summers et al 1996 trihalomethanes were isolated by liquid liquid chromatography as per method 6232b standard methods while haloacetic acids extraction was done according to usepa method 552 2 quantification of haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes was performed using a varian cp3800 gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector the concentration of microcystin lr was determined by solid phase extraction waters sep pak tc18 cartridges mississauga canada followed by high performance liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 usa with a uv detector at 238 nm and a c18 analytical column waters mississauga canada the hplc was operated under isocratic conditions using a mobile phase consisting of 50 methanol and 50 phosphate buffer adjusted to a ph of 2 8 at a flow rate of 1 ml min with 100 μl injections the retention times for nom and microcystin lr were 3 min and 17 5 min respectively indicating a good peak separation which avoided nom interference the intrinsic exchange capacity of virgin and regenerated resins was measured by replacing the counter ions cl of a defined mass of resin by washing the resins with a concentrated sodium nitrate solution 26 g l following this the cl concentration in the solution was determined by titration mohr method and capacity was calculated awwa 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of column tests and mlts abiotic conditions a side by side comparison of column tests and mlts was performed to assess the removal efficiency and resin capacity with these test approaches the tests were performed over a period equivalent to that corresponding to the treatment of approximately 3000 bed volumes which corresponded to approximately 2 months of operation for the column tests and 15 consecutive loadings for the mlt to consider the impact of raw water characteristics test were conducted with jp and sr nom water because of the relatively long duration of the column tests sodium azide 0 01 w v was added to the raw water to supress microbial growth for the column tests fig 1 approximately 60 70 of the organic material in the sr and jp waters could initially be removed the removal efficiency decreased over time and breakthrough c c0 0 7 was observed after approximately 1800 bv i e approximately 37 days breakthrough was considered to have occurred when c c0 exceeded 0 7 i e effluent doc 2 mg l note that based on the charge density of srnom of 10 meq g and the exchange capacity of the resin of 0 8 meg ml bazri 2016 the resin was expected to have been exhausted after approximately 400 450 days i e approximately 19 000 to 22 000 bvs earlier breakthrough likely resulted from the blockage of resin pores and channels by higher molecular weight nom fractions which reduced the effective exchange capacity bazri and mohseni 2016 for the mlts fig 1 approximately 40 50 of the organic material in the sr and jp waters could initially be removed the removal of organic material also decreased over time but at a relatively slower rate than observed for the column tests and breakthrough was observed after approximately 2400 bv i e 12 cycles which is equivalent to approximately 48 days of column operation the decrease in the removal of organic matter over time is consistent with observations reported by bazri and mohseni 2015 who reported a slight decrease in the removal of organic material for sr water during successive cycles of a mlt using the same resin as that used in the present study although a consistent trend of initially higher organic matter removal and of shorter times to breakthrough was observed for the column tests compared to the mlts the difference in time to breakthrough observed for column tests and mlts was not statistically significant i e based on a linear regression of the data to breakthrough conditions with p 0 05 as previously discussed mass transfer conditions can differ substantially between column tests i e pack beds and mlts i e fluidized beds garic gruvolic et al 2011 to gain insight into the impact of mass transfer on the removal of organic material single loading tests were performed for a range of loading rates i e resin concentration and initial dissolved organic carbon concentration hydrodynamic conditions i e mixing intensity and temperatures table 1 because of the large number of conditions considered the tests were only performed using jp water which was readily available the rate of removal of organic material was significantly impacted by the mass transfer conditions fig 2 a although the removal rates varied substantially depending on the conditions investigated it could modeled r2 0 88 using a pseudo first order relationship as presented in equation 1 boyd et al 1947 qiu et al 2009 with a rate constant normalized to account for differences in resin concentration mixing intensity and temperature for each condition investigated equation 2 bazri 2016 also reported that the removal of nom from various waters using the same ion exchange resin as used in the present study could be approximated using a pseudo first order relationship 1 c c 0 1 c e c 0 e x p k t c e c 0 2 k k r r p m 1 8 θ t 20 where k is the normalized rate constant 1 minute k is the absolute rate constant 1 minute r is the resin concentration ml of resin per l of water rpm is the mixing speed revolutions per minute θ is the temperature correction factor estimated to be 1 02 t is the test temperature oc t is the time s c is the dissolved organic carbon concentration mg l and subscripts 0 and e correspond to initial and equilibrium i e residual concentrations ce c0 corresponds to the fraction of doc that cannot be removed using ion exchange under turbulent conditions mass transfer is proportional to the mixer revolutions per minute rpm to the power of 1 8 garcia ochoa and gomez 1998 metcalf and eddy 1991 and the impact of temperature on mass transfer can generally be described using the arrhenius equation which over a relatively narrow range of temperatures as used in the present study and when referenced to a given temperature e g 20 c is proportional to a temperature correction factor θ to the power of the temperature being considered and the reference temperature e g t 20 to which the rate constant is normalized metcalf and eddy 1991 note that to simplify the analysis the product of r r p m 1 8 θ t 20 was assumed to be unitless the above results suggest that it may be possible to adjust the mass transfer conditions in mlts by selecting an appropriate resin loading mixing intensity temperature and or contact time to mimic the performance expected in column tests this is consistent with observations by garic gruvolic et al 2011 who reported that similar mass transfer conditions can be achieved in packed and fluidized beds depending on the hydrodynamic conditions selected however the investigative effort required to do so may defeat the purpose of using mlt as a simpler and faster alternative to column tests nonetheless mlts could be used as an effective tool to screen different ion exchange resins in terms of their ability to remove various contaminants of interest from different raw waters mlts are also easier to perform than isotherms studies and provide more realistic loading conditions than slts at equilibrium c c0 was 0 35 0 02 p 0 05 indicating that mass transfer conditions did not impact the residual i e equilibrium dissolved organic carbon concentration fig 2b these results suggest that the overall mass of organic material retained by the resin prior to breakthrough is not affected by mass transfer conditions hence the overall resin capacity is expected to be the same for both mlts and column tests 3 2 impact of biological activity in ion exchange columns on nom removal because of the relatively long duration of column tests and the favourable growth conditions it might be possible that a microbial community could establish itself in the column packed resin beds to assess the potential impact of a biological activity on the removal efficiencies and resin capacities determined using column tests tests without suppression of biological activity i e biotic conditions were performed in parallel to those discussed in section 3 1 i e tests with suppression of biological activity abiotic conditions the tests without suppression of biological activity were performed over a period of 3 months which corresponds to approximately 4300 bed volumes two source waters were considered jp and sr water note that parallel tests were also performed for the mlts without biomass suppression however the outcomes of these parallel tests were similar to those with biomass suppression results not presented this was expected because of the relatively short duration of the mlts i e performed over 2 days for this reason the impact of biological activity on outcomes from mlts was not further investigated significant differences in the removal of organic material was observed for the column tests performed with and without suppression of biological activity fig 3 a and b as previously reported section 3 1 for columns in which biological activity was supressed abiotic columns the removal of organic material gradually decreased over time until breakthrough was observed at approximately 1800 bv i e approximately 37 days for sr water and jp waters results similar to those observed in the abiotic columns were observed for the first 1 3 weeks of operation when the biological activity was not supressed biotic columns however in contrast to the observation made for the abiotic columns after the initial 1 3 week period the removal of organic material in the biotic columns remained constant based on slope of regression line fitted to data p 0 05 for the jp water the removal efficiency remained constant until the end of the 3 month test period fig 3a based on slope of regression line fitted to data p 0 05 as discussed in section 3 3 even after 11 months of operation approximately 16000 bed volumes breakthrough was not observed for jp water indicating that biotic ion exchange hereafter referred to as biological ion exchange or biex can be used without the need for frequent regeneration over extended periods however for the sr water the removal efficiency remained relatively constant for approximately 7 8 weeks i e approximately 3300 bv or 70 days after which it decreased and breakthrough was observed after 94 days approximately 4400 bed volumes fig 3b after 60 days of operation resins from the abiotic column and one of the biotic columns were harvested as expected atp concentrations were higher in the biotic columns fig 4 the concentration of atp in the biotic columns ranged from approximately 10 to over 190 ng g resin while that in the abiotic columns ranged from approximately 1 to 10 ng g resin atp concentrations were greatest at the top of the packed beds where the most biodegradable nom fraction was likely degraded and decreased along the bed depth in the direction of the raw water flow as substrate likely became limiting atp concentrations were also greater for the column treating jp water than sr water no standard criterion exists to correlate atp concentrations to level of microbial activity however previous studies performed using biological activated carbon bac considered a column to be highly biologically active when the atp concentration exceeded approximately 100 ng g carbon pharand et al 2014 however the atp concentrations observed in the surface layer of the biological active ion exchange resins columns were consistent with those reported for anthracite and bac biofilters 102 103 ng atp cm3 media pharand et al 2014 hence the top 2 cm of the columns were considered biologically active 196 and 96 ng atp g of resin for jp and sr waters respectively these results indicate that once established the microbial community contributed to the removal of organic material enabling greater removal of organic material and operation beyond the point when the resin capacity would have otherwise been exhausted i e with suppression of biological activity it was hypothesized that the relative early breakthrough when filtering sr water was either related to limitations with respect to micronutrients or to the characteristics of sr nom it is possible that the broader range of nom fractions present in jp water enhanced the activity of microbial community enabling longer term operation without requiring regeneration however more research is required to confirm these hypotheses 3 3 comparison of biex and bac for nom removal the performance of biex was compared to that of bac prior to these tests biex had been acclimatized for 3 months and bac was harvested from a column that had been in operation for more than 5 years bac is currently considered to be the most effective biofiltration approach for drinking water treatment basu et al 2015 parallel column tests were performed over a period of 11 months which corresponds to approximately 16000 bed volumes because of the relatively long duration of the column tests they were only performed using jp water which is readily available as illustrated in fig 5 significantly more organic material could be consistently removed using biex than bac when operated at similar loading rates i e 56 7 vs 15 5 respectively in addition to the extent of removal the fraction of organic material removed during treatment differed for biex and bac the relative change in suva was positive for bac this is consistent with results from previous studies and indicates that bac predominantly removes organic material that does not adsorb light at 254 nm e g biopolymers zheng et al 2010 winter et al 2013 in contrast the relative change in suva was negative for biex indicating that organic material that adsorbs light at 254 nm was preferentially removed this is consistent with the results presented in section 3 4 fig 8 which indicate that biex could effectively remove the humic material but not biopolymers low molecular weight neutral and building block fractions of the nom present in the raw water the results also suggest that the pathway for the removal of organic material differs for biex and bac biex was also more effective at removing disinfection by product dbp precursors than bac fig 6 the effluent of the biex system would have reliably met the canadian drinking water guidelines for trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids i e 100 μg l and 80 μg l respectively both bac and biex were highly effective at decreasing the concentration of the algal toxin microcystin lr however again the performance of biex was superior when spiking microcystin lr to the raw water i e jpw at a concentration of 80 μg l the concentrations of microcystin lr in the effluents of the bac and biex columns were 3 3 1 6 μg l n 2 and below 0 4 μg l i e below detection limit n 2 respectively the results suggest that depending on the raw water characteristics biex could replace bac as the technology of choice for the removal of organic material 3 4 regeneration of resins the results presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 indicate that once established the microbial community enabled operation beyond the point when the resin capacity would have otherwise i e with suppression of biological activity been exhausted however depending on the raw water characteristics regeneration may still be infrequently required to assess the potential impact of the presence of a microbial community on the regeneration of packed ion exchange resin beds a separate series of column tests were performed over a 60 day period with regeneration being conducted after 30 and 60 days i e after 1300 and 2600 bed volumes after the second regeneration i e after 60 days or 2600 bed volumes the resin was harvested for atp analysis hence no nom removal data is available for the period following the second regeneration three strategies were considered to regenerate the resins in both the biex i e biotic and iex i e abiotic columns regeneration with brine and caustic plus brine solutions were considered because these are commonly used with the type of resin considered in the present study i e strongly basic anionic ion exchange resin purolite 2014 a disinfection step using a solution of per acetic acid was also considered prior to regeneration using a brine solution because of the large number of conditions considered the tests were only performed using jp water which is readily available a 5 10 loss of the exchange capacity based on a chloride mass balance was observed when comparing virgin and regenerated resins for all strategies investigated in biotic as well as in abiotic columns results not presented incomplete recovery of the exchange capacity is common and attributed to the regeneration solution failing to access deeply embedded resin pores bolto et al 2004 the similar exchange capacity based on a chlorine mass balance for the biex and iex columns after regeneration for all strategies investigated suggests that biological activity in the packed resin bed did not negatively impact regeneration the removal of organic material using virgin and regenerated resins were similar both for the biex and iex columns fig 7 for all regeneration approaches considered indicating that a simple regeneration using brine was effective at regenerating the resins these results again suggest that biological activity in the packed resin bed did not negatively impact regeneration to gain further insight into the removal of organic material size exclusion chromatography was performed on the influent and effluent of the biex and iex columns that were regenerated fig 8 the definition of the nom fractions discussed below i e biopolymers humic substances and building blocks and identified using size exclusion chromatography are described in more detail elsewhere huber et al 2011 the removal of biopolymers peak at approximately 38 min in fig 8 was similar for biex and iex indicating that microbial activity did not impact the removal of this nom fraction also biopolymers were only effectively removed when using virgin resins indicating that the capacity to remove this fraction was rapidly exhausted and could not be recovered with resin regeneration fabris et al 2007 and huang et al 2012 also reported poor removal of biopolymers when using ion exchange it is likely that the low or non ionic character huber et al 2011 and the large size of this fraction limited diffusion into the porous structure of the resins cornelissen et al 2008 the removal of humic substances peak at approximately 52 min in fig 8 was initially similar for biex and iex however the removal of this fraction especially the smaller humic substances rapidly decreased in the absence of biological activity indicating that the capacity to remove smaller humic substances was rapidly exhausted for iex the larger humic substances were consistently removed throughout the duration of the tests indicating that the capacity to remove this fraction was not exhausted within a 30 day period building blocks peak at approximately 58 min in fig 8 were initially i e for virgin and regenerated resins partially removed for biex and to a lesser extent for iex the removal of this fraction rapidly decreased in the absence of biological activity indicating that the capacity to remove this fraction was rapidly exhausted for iex in contrast building blocks were consistently partially removed throughout the duration of the tests for biex indicating that microbial activity positively impacted the removal of this nom fraction some removal of low molecular weight acids and humic substances peak at 64 min in fig 8 was achieved for biex while none of this fraction could be removed for iex indicating that the microbial activity positively impacted the removal of these nom fractions these results indicate that once established the microbial community contributed to the removal of organic material in particular to the removal of humic substances building blocks and low molecular weight acids in addition the removal of some nom fractions e g biopolymers could not be effectively recovered with regeneration using brine and caustic solutions atp analyses were performed on the effluent of the biex and iex columns immediately prior to and immediately after regeneration at 2600 bv as expected the atp concentration in the iex columns was generally low for biex a substantial decrease in biological activity was observed following regeneration for all strategies considered fig 9 only the approach including disinfection using per acetic acid decreased the concentration of atp to levels equivalent to those observed in the iex columns however as previously discussed all of the regeneration strategies were effective at restoring the removal of organic material for the biex columns note that the atp concentrations presented in fig 9 for conditions prior to regeneration for the biotic columns are lower than would be expected based on a composite of the results for different resin bed depth presented in section 3 2 fig 4 the lower atp concentration was attributed to the lower number of days of operation prior to harvesting i e 30 vs 60 days 4 conclusions the overall trends for the removal and the time to breakthrough of organic material estimated using mlts differed from those estimated using column tests the differences were attributed to different loading approaches and microbial activity similar mass transfer conditions can likely be achieved in packed and fluidized beds however further work beyond the scope of the present research would be required the results indicate that mlts could be used as an effective tool to screen different ion exchange resins in terms of their ability to remove various contaminants of interest from different raw waters in the absence of regeneration and without suppression of biological activity a microbial community established itself in ion exchange columns the microbial community contributed to the removal of organic material enabling greater removal of organic material in particular the removal of humic substances building blocks and low molecular weight acids and operation beyond the point when the resin capacity would have otherwise been exhausted in the absence of a microbial community the long term stability of the biological ion exchange columns biex was impacted by the raw water for jericho pond water no decrease in nom removal efficiency was observed even after approximately 11 months of operation while for water containing suwannee river nom breakthrough was observed after approximately one month of operation it is likely that differences in nom characteristics and or limitations with respect to micronutrients affected the long term stability of biex if required biex columns could be regenerated using standard regeneration approaches significantly greater removal of organic matter could also be achieved with biex than biological activated carbon bac i e 56 7 vs 15 5 respectively when operated at similar loading rates the results suggest that for some raw waters biex could replace bac as the technology of choice for the removal of organic material acknowledgements the authors would like to thank fuhar dixit from the university of british columbia vancouver bc and julie philibert from polytechnique montreal for conducting the algal toxins analyses and the disinfection by product formation potential tests respectively the authors also wish to thank res eau waternet for providing funding for this project 
19710,the present study investigated the impact of different loading approaches and microbial activity on the natural organic matter nom removal efficiency and capacity of ion exchange resins gaining

batches of raw water to be treated are repeatedly mixed i e loaded with a given amount of the ion exchange resin the tests are simple to conduct and because of the high ratio of water to resin used the tests can be completed in 2 3 days orica 2007 the use of mlts to assess the feasibility of ion exchange resins for nom removal is particularly attractive for small and remote communities that do not have the technical and or financial resources to conduct column testing unfortunately only anecdotal evidence exists to support the use of mlts as an alternative to column tests to identify conditions required to meet treatment objectives using ion exchange resins also some studies have suggested that removal of nom during repeated loadings could change depending on the operating conditions drikas et al 2011 mergen et al 2008 walker and boyer 2011 mass transfer conditions could differ substantially in column tests i e pack beds and mlts i e fluidized beds garic gruvolic et al 2011 differences in mass transfer could affect nom removal kinetics and therefore the test outcomes times to breakthrough may also differ substantially between column tests and mlts i e weeks vs days respectively in full scale applications resins are regenerated relatively frequently to ensure continuous and effective removal of the constituents of interest however during column tests resins are not regenerated until breakthrough occurs during this time the resin could provide an environment suitable for microbial attachment and growth due to its macro porous structure containing a high surface area flemming 1987 simpson 2008 the presence of a microbial community could impact nom removal and therefore the outcomes from column tests schulz et al 2017 the present study was designed to comprehensively address the current knowledge gap the first objective was to determine if nom removal and resin capacity obtained using column tests are similar to those obtained using mlts the second objective was to quantify the impact of microbial activity on nom removal and resin capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 ion exchange resin purolite a860 a strongly basic macroporous anionic ion exchange resin particle size 0 3 1 2 mm was used in all tests for which abiotic and biotic i e with suppression of biological activity ion exchange resins were considered this resin has an exchange capacity of 0 8 meg ml and was selected because it was previously identified to be effective at removing organic material i e dissolved organic material doc from surface waters bazri and mohseni 2014 2 2 biological activated carbon wood base picabiol granular activated carbon pica carbon with an effective diameter of 1 04 mm was used in all tests for which biological activated carbon bac was considered the activated carbon was harvested from a bac column that has been in operation for more than 5 years and for which all adsorption capacity has been exhausted 2 3 raw waters two raw waters were considered jericho pond jp water vancouver bc and a model raw water containing suwannee river sr nom jp water was pre filtered with a 10 μm cartridge filter and then diluted with tap water to achieve a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 5 mg l 0 3 jp water was of interest because it contains a broad range of nom fractions biopolymers humic substances low molecular weight acids schulz et al 2017 sr nom international humic substances society usa was added to milli q water to achieve a doc concentration of 5 mg l 0 3 sodium bicarbonate was also added to achieve an alkalinity of 50 mg l as caco3 this concentration of bicarbonate corresponds to an alkalinity that is within a range typical of that present in natural source waters hincks and mackie 1997 sr nom water was of interest because it contained a narrower range of nom fractions i e no biopolymers and has been well characterized in the literature malcolm et al 1989 green et al 2015 for the tests conducted under abiotic condition sodium azide was added to the raw waters 0 01 w v to supress microbial activity note that the addition of sodium azide did not impact the instantaneous removal of organic material and was essentially fully recovered from the column i e no retention of sodium azide in the column results not presented 2 4 column tests and multiple loading tests bench scale cylindrical glass columns height 0 5 m inner diameter 0 01 m with bed depths and corresponding bed volumes bv of 0 1 m and 7 85 ml respectively operated in down flow mode were used for all column tests considering iex biex and bac the raw water flow rate was set to achieve an empty bed velocity of 0 2 m h i e 0 0175 l h which corresponds to an empty bed contact time ebct of 30 min or 2 bed volumes bv per hour the treated effluent from the columns was collected daily and stored at 4 c in the dark for subsequent analysis breakthrough was considered to have occurred when the concentration of organic material measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in the effluent c divided by the concentration of doc in the influent co was greater than 0 7 all tests were performed at room temperature 20 2 c multiple loading tests mlts were conducted according to the experimental protocol outlined by orica 2007 briefly a resin volume of 0 75 ml was placed into 150 ml of raw water i e 5 ml of resin per l of water in a 250 ml glass flask and stirred continuously at 100 revolutions per minute rpm with a magnetic stir bar for 30 min i e time equivalent to that of the empty bed contact time for the column tests after the mixing period the resin was separated from the treated water by filtering the solution through a 100 μm screen the separated resin was then transferred to a new 150 ml volume of raw water successive mlts were conducted until breakthrough i e c co 0 7 was observed all tests were performed at room temperature 20 2 c additional single loading tests slts were conducted to assess the impact of mass transfer conditions present in mlts on the removal of organic material a summary of the test conditions considered for the mlts and the additional single loading tests is presented in table 1 the conditions for the slts table 1 were selected to cover a range of set points above and below those in the experimental protocol outlined by orica 2007 a range of temperatures typical of raw waters was also considered 2 5 regeneration three in situ regeneration strategies were considered for the ion exchange resins operated in columns 1 brine 100 g nacl l 2 caustic plus brine 20 g naoh l 100 g nacl l 3 pre disinfection plus caustic plus brine 0 1 per acetic acid before 20 g naoh l 100 g nacl l additional column tests were performed over a 60 day period every regeneration strategy was performed after 30 and 60 days i e after 1300 and 2600 bed volumes to the columns treating jp water with and without suppression of biological activity the regeneration procedure was carried out according to instructions from the resin manufacturer purolite 2014 briefly the columns were first backwashed with 8 bv of previously generated filtrate at a flow equivalent to 45 bv h to remove coarse particles from the filter bed to assess the impact of disinfection on the regeneration efficiency the resin of one of the biotic and one of the abiotic column was then soaked in per acetic acid solution for 2 25 h the resins in the other columns were soaked in milli q water for the same time period regeneration was then performed by soaking the resins in either brine or caustic plus brine solutions for 4 h a new fresh solution was used every 2 h before returning to operation the columns were rinsed with 28 bv of milli q water at a flow equivalent to 2 bv h 2 6 analytical methods the organic material in the raw and treated waters was quantified and characterized using total and dissolved organic carbon toc and doc analysis phoenix 8000 toc analyser dohrmann us and uv absorbance analysis at 254 nm uv254 uv300 uv vis spectrometer spectronic unicam us the ratio of uv254 to doc is defined as suva which can be used to characterize nom i e presence of aromatic compounds leenheer

column hw 50s as described by huber et al 2011 as required samples were pre filtered using 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters cat 09 719 555 fisher scientific ca any samples that could not be analysed immediately were stored at 4 c adenosine triphosphate atp was used as a measure microbial activity in the raw and treated waters as well as within a resin column when quantifying the atp at different depths in a column the resins were harvested by carefully breaking the column and collecting resins at 2 cm depth increments atp was quantified using a luminultra biofilm test kit luminultra canada the removal of disinfection by products precursors was assessed on buffered samples ph 8 0 using the uniform formation conditions test ufc summers et al 1996 trihalomethanes were isolated by liquid liquid chromatography as per method 6232b standard methods while haloacetic acids extraction was done according to usepa method 552 2 quantification of haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes was performed using a varian cp3800 gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector the concentration of microcystin lr was determined by solid phase extraction waters sep pak tc18 cartridges mississauga canada followed by high performance liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 usa with a uv detector at 238 nm and a c18 analytical column waters mississauga canada the hplc was operated under isocratic conditions using a mobile phase consisting of 50 methanol and 50 phosphate buffer adjusted to a ph of 2 8 at a flow rate of 1 ml min with 100 μl injections the retention times for nom and microcystin lr were 3 min and 17 5 min respectively indicating a good peak separation which avoided nom interference the intrinsic exchange capacity of virgin and regenerated resins was measured by replacing the counter ions cl of a defined mass of resin by washing the resins with a concentrated sodium nitrate solution 26 g l following this the cl concentration in the solution was determined by titration mohr method and capacity was calculated awwa 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of column tests and mlts abiotic conditions a side by side comparison of column tests and mlts was performed to assess the removal efficiency and resin capacity with these test approaches the tests were performed over a period equivalent to that corresponding to the treatment of approximately 3000 bed volumes which corresponded to approximately 2 months of operation for the column tests and 15 consecutive loadings for the mlt to consider the impact of raw water characteristics test were conducted with jp and sr nom water because of the relatively long duration of the column tests sodium azide 0 01 w v was added to the raw water to supress microbial growth for the column tests fig 1 approximately 60 70 of the organic material in the sr and jp waters could initially be removed the removal efficiency decreased over time and breakthrough c c0 0 7 was observed after approximately 1800 bv i e approximately 37 days breakthrough was considered to have occurred when c c0 exceeded 0 7 i e effluent doc 2 mg l note that based on the charge density of srnom of 10 meq g and the exchange capacity of the resin of 0 8 meg ml bazri 2016 the resin was expected to have been exhausted after approximately 400 450 days i e approximately 19 000 to 22 000 bvs earlier breakthrough likely resulted from the blockage of resin pores and channels by higher molecular weight nom fractions which reduced the effective exchange capacity bazri and mohseni 2016 for the mlts fig 1 approximately 40 50 of the organic material in the sr and jp waters could initially be removed the removal of organic material also decreased over time but at a relatively slower rate than observed for the column tests and breakthrough was observed after approximately 2400 bv i e 12 cycles which is equivalent to approximately 48 days of column operation the decrease in the removal of organic matter over time is consistent with observations reported by bazri and mohseni 2015 who reported a slight decrease in the removal of organic material for sr water during successive cycles of a mlt using the same resin as that used in the present study although a consistent trend of initially higher organic matter removal and of shorter times to breakthrough was observed for the column tests compared to the mlts the difference in time to breakthrough observed for column tests and mlts was not statistically significant i e based on a linear regression of the data to breakthrough conditions with p 0 05 as previously discussed mass transfer conditions can differ substantially between column tests i e pack beds and mlts i e fluidized beds garic gruvolic et al 2011 to gain insight into the impact of mass transfer on the removal of organic material single loading tests were performed for a range of loading rates i e resin concentration and initial dissolved organic carbon concentration hydrodynamic conditions i e mixing intensity and temperatures table 1 because of the large number of conditions considered the tests were only performed using jp water which was readily available the rate of removal of organic material was significantly impacted by the mass transfer conditions fig 2 a although the removal rates varied substantially depending on the conditions investigated it could modeled r2 0 88 using a pseudo first order relationship as presented in equation 1 boyd et al 1947 qiu et al 2009 with a rate constant normalized to account for differences in resin concentration mixing intensity and temperature for each condition investigated equation 2 bazri 2016 also reported that the removal of nom from various waters using the same ion exchange resin as used in the present study could be approximated using a pseudo first order relationship 1 c c 0 1 c e c 0 e x p k t c e c 0 2 k k r r p m 1 8 θ t 20 where k is the normalized rate constant 1 minute k is the absolute rate constant 1 minute r is the resin concentration ml of resin per l of water rpm is the mixing speed revolutions per minute θ is the temperature correction factor estimated to be 1 02 t is the test temperature oc t is the time s c is the dissolved organic carbon concentration mg l and subscripts 0 and e correspond to initial and equilibrium i e residual concentrations ce c0 corresponds to the fraction of doc that cannot be removed using ion exchange under turbulent conditions mass transfer is proportional to the mixer revolutions per minute rpm to the power of 1 8 garcia ochoa and gomez 1998 metcalf and eddy 1991 and the impact of temperature on mass transfer can generally be described using the arrhenius equation which over a relatively narrow range of temperatures as used in the present study and when referenced to a given temperature e g 20 c is proportional to a temperature correction factor θ to the power of the temperature being considered and the reference temperature e g t 20 to which the rate constant is normalized metcalf and eddy 1991 note that to simplify the analysis the product of r r p m 1 8 θ t 20 was assumed to be unitless the above results suggest that it may be possible to adjust the mass transfer conditions in mlts by selecting an appropriate resin loading mixing intensity temperature and or contact time to mimic the performance expected in column tests this is consistent with observations by garic gruvolic et al 2011 who reported that similar mass transfer conditions can be achieved in packed and fluidized beds depending on the hydrodynamic conditions selected however the investigative effort required to do so may defeat the purpose of using mlt as a simpler and faster alternative to column tests nonetheless mlts could be used as an effective tool to screen different ion exchange resins in terms of their ability to remove various contaminants of interest from different raw waters mlts are also easier to perform than isotherms studies and provide more realistic loading conditions than slts at equilibrium c c0 was 0 35 0 02 p 0 05 indicating that mass transfer conditions did not impact the residual i e equilibrium dissolved organic carbon concentration fig 2b these results suggest that the overall mass of organic material retained by the resin prior to breakthrough is not affected by mass transfer conditions hence the overall resin capacity is expected to be the same for both mlts and column tests 3 2 impact of biological activity in ion exchange columns on nom removal because of the relatively long duration of column tests and the favourable growth conditions it might be possible that a microbial community could establish itself in the column packed resin beds to assess the potential impact of a biological activity on the removal efficiencies and resin capacities determined using column tests tests without suppression of biological activity i e biotic conditions were performed in parallel to those discussed in section 3 1 i e tests with suppression of biological activity abiotic conditions the tests without suppression of biological activity were performed over a period of 3 months which corresponds to approximately 4300 bed volumes two source waters were considered jp and sr water note that parallel tests were also performed for the mlts without biomass suppression however the outcomes of these parallel tests were similar to those with biomass suppression results not presented this was expected because of the relatively short duration of the mlts i e performed over 2 days for this reason the impact of biological activity on outcomes from mlts was not further investigated significant differences in the removal of organic material was observed for the column tests performed with and without suppression of biological activity fig 3 a and b as previously reported section 3 1 for columns in which biological activity was supressed abiotic columns the removal of organic material gradually decreased over time until breakthrough was observed at approximately 1800 bv i e approximately 37 days for sr water and jp waters results similar to those observed in the abiotic columns were observed for the first 1 3 weeks of operation when the biological activity was not supressed biotic columns however in contrast to the observation made for the abiotic columns after the initial 1 3 week period the removal of organic material in the biotic columns remained constant based on slope of regression line fitted to data p 0 05 for the jp water the removal efficiency remained constant until the end of the 3 month test period fig 3a based on slope of regression line fitted to data p 0 05 as discussed in section 3 3 even after 11 months of operation approximately 16000 bed volumes breakthrough was not observed for jp water indicating that biotic ion exchange hereafter referred to as biological ion exchange or biex can be used without the need for frequent regeneration over extended periods however for the sr water the removal efficiency remained relatively constant for approximately 7 8 weeks i e approximately 3300 bv or 70 days after which it decreased and breakthrough was observed after 94 days approximately 4400 bed volumes fig 3b after 60 days of operation resins from the abiotic column and one of the biotic columns were harvested as expected atp concentrations were higher in the biotic columns fig 4 the concentration of atp in the biotic columns ranged from approximately 10 to over 190 ng g resin while that in the abiotic columns ranged from approximately 1 to 10 ng g resin atp concentrations were greatest at the top of the packed beds where the most biodegradable nom fraction was likely degraded and decreased along the bed depth in the direction of the raw water flow as substrate likely became limiting atp concentrations were also greater for the column treating jp water than sr water no standard criterion exists to correlate atp concentrations to level of microbial activity however previous studies performed using biological activated carbon bac considered a column to be highly biologically active when the atp concentration exceeded approximately 100 ng g carbon pharand et al 2014 however the atp concentrations observed in the surface layer of the biological active ion exchange resins columns were consistent with those reported for anthracite and bac biofilters 102 103 ng atp cm3 media pharand et al 2014 hence the top 2 cm of the columns were considered biologically active 196 and 96 ng atp g of resin for jp and sr waters respectively these results indicate that once established the microbial community contributed to the removal of organic material enabling greater removal of organic material and operation beyond the point when the resin capacity would have otherwise been exhausted i e with suppression of biological activity it was hypothesized that the relative early breakthrough when filtering sr water was either related to limitations with respect to micronutrients or to the characteristics of sr nom it is possible that the broader range of nom fractions present in jp water enhanced the activity of microbial community enabling longer term operation without requiring regeneration however more research is required to confirm these hypotheses 3 3 comparison of biex and bac for nom removal the performance of biex was compared to that of bac prior to these tests biex had been acclimatized for 3 months and bac was harvested from a column that had been in operation for more than 5 years bac is currently considered to be the most effective biofiltration approach for drinking water treatment basu et al 2015 parallel column tests were performed over a period of 11 months which corresponds to approximately 16000 bed volumes because of the relatively long duration of the column tests they were only performed using jp water which is readily available as illustrated in fig 5 significantly more organic material could be consistently removed using biex than bac when operated at similar loading rates i e 56 7 vs 15 5 respectively in addition to the extent of removal the fraction of organic material removed during treatment differed for biex and bac the relative change in suva was positive for bac this is consistent with results from previous studies and indicates that bac predominantly removes organic material that does not adsorb light at 254 nm e g biopolymers zheng et al 2010 winter et al 2013 in contrast the relative change in suva was negative for biex indicating that organic material that adsorbs light at 254 nm was preferentially removed this is consistent with the results presented in section 3 4 fig 8 which indicate that biex could effectively remove the humic material but not biopolymers low molecular weight neutral and building block fractions of the nom present in the raw water the results also suggest that the pathway for the removal of organic material differs for biex and bac biex was also more effective at removing disinfection by product dbp precursors than bac fig 6 the effluent of the biex system would have reliably met the canadian drinking water guidelines for trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids i e 100 μg l and 80 μg l respectively both bac and biex were highly effective at decreasing the concentration of the algal toxin microcystin lr however again the performance of biex was superior when spiking microcystin lr to the raw water i e jpw at a concentration of 80 μg l the concentrations of microcystin lr in the effluents of the bac and biex columns were 3 3 1 6 μg l n 2 and below 0 4 μg l i e below detection limit n 2 respectively the results suggest that depending on the raw water characteristics biex could replace bac as the technology of choice for the removal of organic material 3 4 regeneration of resins the results presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 indicate that once established the microbial community enabled operation beyond the point when the resin capacity would have otherwise i e with suppression of biological activity been exhausted however depending on the raw water characteristics regeneration may still be infrequently required to assess the potential impact of the presence of a microbial community on the regeneration of packed ion exchange resin beds a separate series of column tests were performed over a 60 day period with regeneration being conducted after 30 and 60 days i e after 1300 and 2600 bed volumes after the second regeneration i e after 60 days or 2600 bed volumes the resin was harvested for atp analysis hence no nom removal data is available for the period following the second regeneration three strategies were considered to regenerate the resins in both the biex i e biotic and iex i e abiotic columns regeneration with brine and caustic plus brine solutions were considered because these are commonly used with the type of resin considered in the present study i e strongly basic anionic ion exchange resin purolite 2014 a disinfection step using a solution of per acetic acid was also considered prior to regeneration using a brine solution because of the large number of conditions considered the tests were only performed using jp water which is readily available a 5 10 loss of the exchange capacity based on a chloride mass balance was observed when comparing virgin and regenerated resins for all strategies investigated in biotic as well as in abiotic columns results not presented incomplete recovery of the exchange capacity is common and attributed to the regeneration solution failing to access deeply embedded resin pores bolto et al 2004 the similar exchange capacity based on a chlorine mass balance for the biex and iex columns after regeneration for all strategies investigated suggests that biological activity in the packed resin bed did not negatively impact regeneration the removal of organic material using virgin and regenerated resins were similar both for the biex and iex columns fig 7 for all regeneration approaches considered indicating that a simple regeneration using brine was effective at regenerating the resins these results again suggest that biological activity in the packed resin bed did not negatively impact regeneration to gain further insight into the removal of organic material size exclusion chromatography was performed on the influent and effluent of the biex and iex columns that were regenerated fig 8 the definition of the nom fractions discussed below i e biopolymers humic substances and building blocks and identified using size exclusion chromatography are described in more detail elsewhere huber et al 2011 the removal of biopolymers peak at approximately 38 min in fig 8 was similar for biex and iex indicating that microbial activity did not impact the removal of this nom fraction also biopolymers were only effectively removed when using virgin resins indicating that the capacity to remove this fraction was rapidly exhausted and could not be recovered with resin regeneration fabris et al 2007 and huang et al 2012 also reported poor removal of biopolymers when using ion exchange it is likely that the low or non ionic character huber et al 2011 and the large size of this fraction limited diffusion into the porous structure of the resins cornelissen et al 2008 the removal of humic substances peak at approximately 52 min in fig 8 was initially similar for biex and iex however the removal of this fraction especially the smaller humic substances rapidly decreased in the absence of biological activity indicating that the capacity to remove smaller humic substances was rapidly exhausted for iex the larger humic substances were consistently removed throughout the duration of the tests indicating that the capacity to remove this fraction was not exhausted within a 30 day period building blocks peak at approximately 58 min in fig 8 were initially i e for virgin and regenerated resins partially removed for biex and to a lesser extent for iex the removal of this fraction rapidly decreased in the absence of biological activity indicating that the capacity to remove this fraction was rapidly exhausted for iex in contrast building blocks were consistently partially removed throughout the duration of the tests for biex indicating that microbial activity positively impacted the removal of this nom fraction some removal of low molecular weight acids and humic substances peak at 64 min in fig 8 was achieved for biex while none of this fraction could be removed for iex indicating that the microbial activity positively impacted the removal of these nom fractions these results indicate that once established the microbial community contributed to the removal of organic material in particular to the removal of humic substances building blocks and low molecular weight acids in addition the removal of some nom fractions e g biopolymers could not be effectively recovered with regeneration using brine and caustic solutions atp analyses were performed on the effluent of the biex and iex columns immediately prior to and immediately after regeneration at 2600 bv as expected the atp concentration in the iex columns was generally low for biex a substantial decrease in biological activity was observed following regeneration for all strategies considered fig 9 only the approach including disinfection using per acetic acid decreased the concentration of atp to levels equivalent to those observed in the iex columns however as previously discussed all of the regeneration strategies were effective at restoring the removal of organic material for the biex columns note that the atp concentrations presented in fig 9 for conditions prior to regeneration for the biotic columns are lower than would be expected based on a composite of the results for different resin bed depth presented in section 3 2 fig 4 the lower atp concentration was attributed to the lower number of days of operation prior to harvesting i e 30 vs 60 days 4 conclusions the overall trends for the removal and the time to breakthrough of organic material estimated using mlts differed from those estimated using column tests the differences were attributed to different loading approaches and microbial activity similar mass transfer conditions can likely be achieved in packed and fluidized beds however further work beyond the scope of the present research would be required the results indicate that mlts could be used as an effective tool to screen different ion exchange resins in terms of their ability to remove various contaminants of interest from different raw waters in the absence of regeneration and without suppression of biological activity a microbial community established itself in ion exchange columns the microbial community contributed to the removal of organic material enabling greater removal of organic material in particular the removal of humic substances building blocks and low molecular weight acids and operation beyond the point when the resin capacity would have otherwise been exhausted in the absence of a microbial community the long term stability of the biological ion exchange columns biex was impacted by the raw water for jericho pond water no decrease in nom removal efficiency was observed even after approximately 11 months of operation while for water containing suwannee river nom breakthrough was observed after approximately one month of operation it is likely that differences in nom characteristics and or limitations with respect to micronutrients affected the long term stability of biex if required biex columns could be regenerated using standard regeneration approaches significantly greater removal of organic matter could also be achieved with biex than biological activated carbon bac i e 56 7 vs 15 5 respectively when operated at similar loading rates the results suggest that for some raw waters biex could replace bac as the technology of choice for the removal of organic material acknowledgements the authors would like to thank fuhar dixit from the university

aggregation of fdom1 and fdom2 contributed major roles to tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products meanwhile the hydrolysis of certain parts of fdom1 and fdom2 led to the aqueous tcs re partition among various dom constituents which presented a false appearance that fdom4 with smaller molecular weight posed significant influences on tcs transport increasing ph values from 8 5 to

yearbook 2016 more than 450 million pigs are produced annually in china nbsprc 2016 consequently a large number of intensive livestock farms are emerging and dramatic increases of phosphorus and ammonium are discharged from swine wastewater which has been arisen public concern worldwide from another aspect such numerous discharge of phosphorus and nitrogen poses great potential for nutrient

pall life sciences co usa was used for dom fractionation in the present study three types of pall omega membranes with different molecular weight cut off i e 30 kda 5 kda and 1 kda were selected which was referenced to the particle size distribution of dom in wastewater wang et al 2006 ma et al 2013 before dom fractionation swine wastewater was filtrated with 0 45 μm pore size of glass fiber filters which were previously calcinated for 4 h at 450 c then the filtrate was filtrate through the membranes in series where larger pore size membranes were prior to smaller pore size ones fig 1 to fractionate four dom size fractions i e fdom1 30 kda 0 45 μm fdom2 5 kda 30 kda fdom3 1 kda 5 kda and fdom4 1 kda after each fractionation the volume of the retentate and filtrate were measured and dom recovery as doc was calculated so as to evaluate the fractionation process doc was calculated as the sum of doc mass in the retentate and filtrate divided by the doc mass in the original unfractionated wastewater during the fractionation process the dom recovery values ranged from 92 to 111 2 3 experimental setup before the investigation of dom influences on tcs transport in struvite recovery a blank experiment without dom was performed stock solutions containing nh4 po4 3 mg2 and tcs were prepared by dissolving nh4 2hpo4 mgcl2 6h2o and tcs into the ultrapure water respectively for struvite precipitation 500 ml beakers with 300 ml working volume were used stock solutions were mixed with the agitation of 250 rpm and nh4 and po4 3 concentrations were referenced to table 1 where tcs concentrations were adjusted to the levels detected in the real wastewater desired volume of mg2 solution was dosed into the liquor to control mg p molar ratio at 1 2 1 and the ph value was set at 8 5 by dosing 2 mol l naoh to achieve struvite precipitation all the experiments were conducted at the ambient temperature of 22 25 c after 60 min agitation the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min and aqueous and solid samples were withdrawn prior to analyses as to the solid samples they were dried at 40 c in an air oven for 24 h in order to evaluate the effects of total dom on tcs transport real wastewater without dom fractionation was used and struvite precipitation was conducted by setting the same operation conditions as those in the blank experiment at the end of experiment the supernatant was subjected to dom fractionation as described in section 2 2 the concentrations of tcs and dissolved organic carbon doc in all fdoms before and after struvite precipitation were analyzed and compared struvite recovery in each fractional doms fdoms original from the real wastewater were further conducted in order to keep struvite precipitation occur at the same conditions desired volume of po4 3 solution was added into every fdoms solution to control initial po4 3 p at 100 mg l and a certain amount of mg2 solution was dosed to maitain the mg p molar ratio at 1 2 1 before the experiments every fdom in each solution was adjusted to 25 mg l by mini q pure water initial tcs concentration in each fdoms was allowed to 200 μg l before struvite precipitation during struvite precipitation the ph value was set at 8 5 by dosing 2 mol l naoh after struvite precipitation the variations of tcs and doc in the solutions were examined and the contribution of individual fdoms on tcs transport was evaluated according to the previous research the suitable ph range for struvite recovery in wastewater was 8 5 10 5 ye et al 2011 meanwhile the dissociation of tcs is ph dependent ye et al 2017 hence a series of experiments were carried out to examine ph influence and the ph values in struvite precipitation were set at 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 and 10 5 respectively after experiments solid and liquid samples were withdrawn for further analyses 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 tetracyclines assay for both solid and liquid samples they were firstly diluted to approximately 200 ml with milli q pure water and acidified to ph 3 0 by dosing 0 1 mol l hcl solid phase extraction method was used to concentrate tcs from the samples huang et al 2013 tcs extraction was conducted by using oasis hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml waters milliford usa after that the concentrates were subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms abi3200

esi source was operated in the positive mode with the desolvation temperature at 300 c and capillary voltage 5 5 kv the determination of tcs with lc ms ms was evaluated for recovery rate detection limits and the quantification for instrument were decided by using calibration curves zhao et al 2010 xia et al 2016 2 4 2 spectrum analyses three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem spectroscopy was obtained by using a fluorescence spectrofluorometer f 4600 hitachi co japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp as the light source the excitation emission matrix spectra were collected with subsequently scanning the emission spectra form 200 600 nm by increasing the excitation wavelength at 0 5 nm increments from 200 to 500 nm the 3deem spectrogram was further evaluated by the fluorescence region index fri a quantitative method applied to integrate the volume beneath the 3deem described by korak et al 2015 generally 3deem was defined into five excitation emission regions depending on the fluorescence of model compounds i aromatic protein i λexcitation λemission λex λem 220 250 nm 280 330 nm ii aromatic protein ii λex λem 220 250 nm 330 380 nm iii fulvic acid like λex λem 220 250 nm 380 480 nm iv soluble microbial by product like λex λem 250 280 nm 290 380 nm v humic acid like λex λem 250 nm 380 nm the collected data were addressed by origin 8 0 origin lab inc usa a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir is10 thermo fisher scientific co usa were used to analyze the functional groups of freeze dried dom uv vis absorbance measurement was carried out by a dr5000 spectrophotometer hach usa between 200 and 400 nm with pure water as the blank suva254 as a parameter of representing the relative contents of aromatic structures in dom was determined by dividing the uv absorbance at λ 254 nm uv254 by the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration mao et al 2017 2 4 3 other analytical methods according to the standards methods apha 1998 ammonium nh4 n phosphorus po4 3 p total nitrogen and phosphorus were respectively assayed by nessler s reagent and phosphorus molybdenum blue spectrophotometries for the determination of total nitrogen and phosphorus the samples were subjected to digestion before the measurement ph was measured by a phs 3c probe sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 and chloride cl ions were detected by ion chromatograph aquion ics thermo fisher usa doc was determined performed by a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotic residue in the recovered products tcs residues in the struvite solids under synthetic and real wastewater were compared as shown in fig 2 the precipitates obtained under real wastewater possessed 360 742 μg g tcs significantly higher than those 1 49 2 16 μg g tcs recovered from synthetic wastewater hence it was obvious that the existence of dom in the wastewater greatly promoted tcs transport from the wastewater to the recovered products the discrepancies of dom fluorescence spectra in the wastewater before and after struvite precipitation were illustrated in fig 3 despite of intensity difference two main peaks were detected in both samples the first main peak was located at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em approximate 330 440 nm peak i where the second main peak was observed at the ex em approximate 270 440 nm peak ii according to the literature li et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 these two peaks belonged to humic acid like substances further investigation on the properties of fluorescence peaks including peak locations fluorescence intensity and peak intensity ratios were conducted as summarized in table 2 peak shifts of dom fluorescence spectra were observed after struvite precipitation peak i after struvite precipitation possessed a blue shift 10 nm along the emission axis to shorter wavelengths coupling with a red shift 10 nm along the excitation axis to longer wavelengths fig 3 as to peak ii it demonstrated a red shift of 20 nm displacement along the emission axis it has been reported that blue shifts in the fluorescence spectra are associated with the decomposition of condensed aromatic moieties including the disintegration of π electron system number reduction of aromatic rings disassembling of conjugated bonds in carbon chain structures lavonen et al 2015 wei et al 2016 as to the wavelength shifts of excitation and emission from lower to higher values red shift they were considered as to the generation of functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl alkoxyl amino and carboxyl constituents helms et al 2013 lavonen et al 2015 hence the peak shifts of fluorescence spectra indicated that during struvite crystallization parts of dom hydrolyzed and resulted with some kinds of functional groups released such outcomes were also verified by the changes of peak intensity ratios of the 3deem fluorescence spectra as presented in table 2 where the structural differences in the dom compounds could be represented by the transformation of dom fluorescence characteristics helms et al 2013 lavonen et al 2015 it should be pointed out that there were several peaks with relatively low fluorescent intensity which could not be significantly detected fig 3 those peaks mainly appeared in the region of ex 200 250 nm and em 380 nm which could be ascribed as fulvic acid materials guo et al 2012 in order to clarify the changes of dom components before and after struvite precipitation the fluorescence regional integration fri method korak et al 2015 was employed to analyze the differences of five excitation emission fluorescent regions of dom as illustrated in fig 4 struvite precipitation resulted with 136 0 mg l doc lost in the aqueous phase besides distinct reductions of fulvic acid like region iii materials with 81 4 mg l doc and humic acid like region v materials with 75 5 mg l doc coupling with slight increments of aromatic protein i region i with 1 7 mg l doc aromatic protein region ii materials with 16 6 mg l doc and soluble microbial by product like region iv materials with 6 0 mg l doc were detected these results revealed that during struvite precipitation significant parts of dom destabilized and co precipitated with struvite crystals while a certain amount of dom disintegrated hence investigating the relationship between the changes of dom constituents and the antibiotic transport was necessary further examination on the concentration changes of fractionating doms with different molecular weight cut off i e fdom1 30 kda 0 45 μm fdom2 5 30 kda fdom3 1 5 kda and fdom4 1 kda and the affinity variation between individual fdoms and the antibiotics during struvite precipitation were conducted as shown in fig 5 a fdom1 and fdom3 possessed obvious reduction with their concentrations decreasing from 162 5 to 12 1 mg l and from 63 4 to 39 4 mg l respectively regarding fdom2 and fdom4 slight concentration increases of 27 0 for fdom2 and 10 8 mg l for fdom4 were observed by referencing the data in fig 4 it could be seen that humic acid like and fulvic acid like materials with higher molecular weight fdom1 30 kda 0 45 μm contributed the major parts of dom co precipitating with struvite crystals further investigation on tcs complexation with different fdoms fig 5b and c revealed that the destabilization and precipitation of fdom1 played a significant role on the aqueous tcs reduction nevertheless the changes of tcs partitioning in fdoms fig 5b and c did not entirely match the profiles of fdoms concentration variation fig 5a where significant tcs reductions from 161 97 μg l to 1 02 μg l were detected in other fdoms including fdom2 fdom3 and fdom4 such phenomena indicated that in addition to dom co precipitation other factors might play important roles on tcs migration behavior from the aqueous phase to the recovered solids 3 2 effects of individual fdoms struvite recovery under differently fractionational doms fdoms was respectively investigated the concentrations of organic matters in the recovered solids coupling with the variation of organic constituents in the aqueous phase were examined as shown in fig 6 precipitated organic matters were detected in all experimental runs fdom1 and fdom4 did precipitate more than two other fdoms and the sequence was fdom1 fdom4 fdom3 fdom2 with their contents in the recovered solids at 86 2 76 1 60 9 and 45 7 mg g respectively fig 6a different from the data in fig 5a where fdom2 and fdom4 concentrations did slightly increase after struvite precipitation these results indicated that certain parts of fdom1 and fdom3 were disintegrated to fdom2 and fdom4 in addition the analyses on the fri distribution fig 6b displayed that the concentrations of different organic components especially humic acid like region v and fulvic acid like region iii materials decreased significantly after struvite precipitation hence it was conclusive that during struvite recovery the changes of dom underwent two steps i e co precipitation and hydrolysis in the co precipitation step a certain amount of individual fdom co precipitated with struvite crystals where in the second step significant parts of organic matters with higher molecular weight fdom1 and fdom3 were hydrolyzed to supplement the loss of organic matters with lower molecular weight fdom2 and fdom4 this clarification on dom transformation steps was helpful for understanding tcs transport in the process of struvite precipitation the occurrence of tcs in the recovered solids was examined as illustrated in fig 7 a the solids recovered respectively from fdom1 and fdom2 liquors possessed higher tcs contents than those obtained from fdom3 and fdom4 for instance tcs in the solids recovered under fdom1 existence contained tc 480 49 μg g ctc 422 09 μg g and otc 484 17 μg g where tc 31 88 μg g ctc 160 51 μg g and otc 114 78 μg g were respectively detected under fdom3 existence besides the removal efficiencies of aqueous antibiotics fig 7b indicated that small amounts of tcs 4 55 26 02 were removed from the fdom3 and fdom4 liquors such results suggested that compared to fdom3 and fdom4 fdom1 and fdom2 with larger molecular weight played important roles on tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products during struvite recovery from wastewater it should be noted that these outcomes was distinctly different from the profiles in fig 5 where fdoms with smaller molecular weight fdom3 and fdom4 presented a false appearance by displaying their significant contribution on tcs removal from the aqueous phase after analyzing the discrepancy of fdoms concentrations in figs 5 and 6 it could be indicative that the variation of fdoms components and tcs re partitioning among various fdoms were the key factors for the difference of tcs transportation behaviors 3 3 ph influence to investigate ph influence on tcs residue in the final products ph values were set at the range of 8 5 10 5 for the experiments fig 8 demonstrated the variation of antibiotic contents and organic matters in the recovered solids steady increases were observed for both tcs and toc an increment of toc from 168 7 mg g to 207 5 mg g was detected when ph values were enhanced from 8 5 to 10 5 regarding tcs concentrations the minimum values tc 94 5 μg g otc 65 2 μg g and ctc 292 4 μg g at ph 8 5 and the maximum values tc 825 0 μg g otc 627 2 μg g and ctc 688 0 μg g at ph 10 5 were obtained respectively a mathematical regression was employed to track the roles of toc on tcs residue in the solids linear relationships were observed for tcs and toc with the determination coefficient at 0 884 0 956 as illustrated in table 3 these results indicated that the precipitated dom fractions exhibited direct influences on tcs transport to the recovered products 4 discussion for tcs with the property of polar ionic and highly hydrophilic significant non hydrophobic interactions such as cation exchange ligand exchange surface complexation and hydrogen bonding can be predominant zhang et al 2012 the affinities of tcs with dom and thus tcs phase distribution are not only dependent on the physicochemical properties of dom including aromaticity polarity abundance and types of functional groups sun et al 2010 but also complicated by the specific interactions under different operations christl et al 2016 for struvite recovery it consisted of chemical reaction and struvite crystallite formation stages in which the wastewater underwent the ph increase to the alkaline conditions the dramatic reduction of ion strength and the formation of solid products under these circumstances three mixing property changes of dom could be distinguished 1 the surface charge characteristics of dom were altered 2 subsequently certain parts of dom constituents aggregated fig 6 and formed both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains due to the reducing repulsive interactions between negatively charged molecules gu et al 2007 carmosini and lee 2009 3 simultaneously the alkaline solution was in favor of hydrolysis of dom with high molecular weight into low molecular weight li et al 2016 chen et al 2017 by referencing the results from synthetic wastewater fig 2 these changes of dom properties led to the transformation of tcs partition in dom phase and hence promoted tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products previous studies revealed that dom exhibited relatively high complexation on antibiotics especially for tcs groups luo et al 2011 ding et al 2013 their interaction mechanisms included cation exchange ligand exchange surface complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attractive force zhang et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 for the alkaline conditions in struvite recovery the surface complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction were predominant zhao et al 2012 lou et al 2017 besides the chemical reaction of struvite precipitation brought about significant changes of electric potential ion concentration and struvite formation in the wastewater which led to the destabilization aggregation and co precipitation of dom components thereby certain amounts of organic matters were precipitated in the final solids as illustrated in fig 6 the aggregated dom would enhance tcs adsorption through the aggregated hydrophobic dom regions pan et al 2008 this was why high tcs contents were detected in the recovered products figs 2 and 7a compared to those in the solids recovered from synthetic wastewater fig 2 increasing ph values would promote the compression on the electrical layer of dom molecules and result with more dom precipitation as shown in fig 8b therefore a steady increase of tcs contents coupling with ph enhancement was observed in the recovered products fig 8a dom with higher molecular weights had higher aromaticity with more acidic groups polysaccharides fatty acids and long aliphatic side chains which would complex with tcs more easily kulshrestha et al 2004 ma et al 2013 in the present study all the fdoms were subjected to the ftir spectra fig 9 analyses to analyze the functional groups involved in complexation the main features of these spectra and their corresponding assignments were identified as described elsewhere ng and mintova 2011 song et al 2014 guo et al 2012 bai et al 2017 a a series shoulders at about 2920 and 2850 cm 1 resulted from asymmetric and symmetric stretching of aliphatic methyl and methylene groups such as fatty acids waxes and various other aliphatic b the bands at 1460 1420 and 1400 1390 cm 1 are attributed to c h deformation of aliphatic and ch3 groups respectively c an bond at 1400 cm 1 preferentially attributed to o h deformation and c o stretching of phenolic oh d the absorption at about 1030 cm 1 and 1645 cm 1 can be assigned to the c o stretching of secondary alcohols and or ethers e a small peak at 870 cm 1 is attributed to oh stretching vibration of carboxylic groups f two sharp bands at 835 and 700 cm 1 are due to the n h vibration of primary amine group and secondary amine group respectively g a series shoulders at 580 660 cm 1 possibly result from sulfate furthermore the uv vis spectra analyses and suva254 measurement to determine the aromatic moiety present in the fdoms massicotte et al 2017 as shown in fig 10 fdom1 had the highest suva254 of 8 5 l mg m followed by fdom2 6 1 l mg m fdom3 2 0 l mg m and fdom4 2 1 l mg m respectively according to the previous claims kulshrestha et al 2004 the sequence of complexation capacity of every fdoms unit mass with tcs was fdom1 fdom2 fdom4 fdom3 therefore the solids recovered from fdom1 and fdom2 liquors possessed higher tcs contents than those obtained from fdom3 and fdom4 liquors fig 7 it should be noted that fdom1 and fdom4 showed totally different behaviors on tcs transport under different experiment conditions as shown in fig 5d fdom1 and fdom4 made important contributions on the aqueous tcs removal in case of total dom as the media while they displayed minor effects on tcs transport in case of each fdom as the media fig 7b this discrepancy could be ascribed to the changes of fdoms constituents and tcs re partitioning in the process of struvite recovery as shown in figs 4 and 6 dom contained various constituents including aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humic acid like materials in the present study struvite recovery led to certain parts of fdom1 hydrolyze into organic matters with lower molecular weight fig 5a and the proportion of different organic components in the total dom changed as presented in fig 4 among the organic components protein like substances possessed the stronger binding with tcs than humic acid like materials whereas fulvic acid like component made a greater contribution than protein like component to the interaction of antibiotics bai et al 2017 these complexation differences indicated that under the circumstances of struvite recovery tcs dissociated from the humic acids more easily and the partition of tcs between the dom phase and the aqueous phase was altered correspondingly this was because under the alkaline conditions the repulsion between predominantly deprotonated carboxylic and phenolic groups in the humic acids and the anionic tcs increased kulshrestha et al 2004 christl et al 2016 hence the proportion of tcs complexation with fdom3 or fdom4 declined this was why they displayed minor effects on tcs transport in case of each fdom as the media such phenomena was confirmed previously when ph increased from 7 0 to 11 0 17 2 44 7 tcs was desorbed from dissolved humic acid kulshrestha et al 2004 5 conclusion this study gave information about the influences of dom on tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater which had practical interest because tcs exerted the pharmacological impacts on the recovered struvite utilization the struvite products recovered under real wastewater contained 360 742 μg g tcs significantly higher than those 1 49 2 16 μg g tcs obtained from synthetic wastewater during the recovery process the transformation of dom underwent two steps i e co precipitation and hydrolysis in the co precipitation stage significant amounts of tcs binding with dom precipitated and transported to the solids whereas in the hydrolysis stage the residual tcs in the aqueous phase re partitioned among various dom constituents results revealed that compared to fdom3 and fdom4 fdom1 and fdom2 with larger molecular weight played important roles on tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products enhancing ph values from 8 5 to 10 5 resulted with the increase of tcs contents in the solids the outcomes are practical to understand tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater which will undoubtedly do help to the technology application of phosphate recovery and develop methods to control the pharmacological impacts acknowledgements this work was supported by the china japanese research cooperative program no 2016yfe0118000 and the

19711,due to the extensive existence of tetracyclines tcs struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovery from swine wastewater will pose tcs pharmacological threats to the agricultural planting and environment this study investigated the influences of dissolved organic matters dom as an important medium in the wastewater on tcs transport during struvite recovery from swine wastewater compared to tcs concentrations of 1 49 2 16 μg g in the solids obtained from synthetic wastewater the existence of dom significantly enhanced tcs contents in the products with the values of 360 742 μg g dom was fractionated into four size fractions with different molecular weight cut off i e fdom1 30 kda 0 45 μm fdom2 5 30 kda fdom3 1 5 kda and fdom4 1 kda results revealed that the destabilization and aggregation of fdom1 and fdom2 contributed major roles to tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products meanwhile the hydrolysis of certain parts of fdom1 and fdom2 led to the aqueous tcs re partition among various dom constituents which presented a false appearance that fdom4 with smaller molecular weight posed significant influences on tcs transport increasing ph values from 8 5 to 10 5 resulted with a stepwise increase of precipitated dom thereby enhancing tcs concentrations from 94 5 to 292 4 μg g to 627 2 825 0 μg g in the recovered solids the outcomes provide a better understanding on the capability of dom on tcs transport and abatement in the phosphate recovery process graphical abstract image keywords antibiotic struvite phosphorus recovery dissolved organic matter wastewater 1 introduction quick economic growth and urban expansion in the developing countries has triggered a numerous demand on pig farming for instance according to the china statistical yearbook 2016 more than 450 million pigs are produced annually in china nbsprc 2016 consequently a large number of intensive livestock farms are emerging and dramatic increases of phosphorus and ammonium are discharged from swine wastewater which has been arisen public concern worldwide from another aspect such numerous discharge of phosphorus and nitrogen poses great potential for nutrient recovery especially for struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o recovery which has gained extensive attention today piveteau et al 2017 the recovered products can be utilized as a slow release fertilizer and used directly in agriculture merino jimenez et al 2017 veterinary antibiotics are commonly used for animal therapy and growth promotor since antibiotics are poorly absorbed in the animal gut approximately 40 90 are excreted as parent compounds or metabolites pei et al 2016 consequently the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment poses potent pollution danger to the animal and human health by triggering the increase of resistant bacteria and spreading the antibiotic resistance genes zhu et al 2013 tetracyclines tcs as the most broad spectrum and important type of antibiotics are extensively used for treating animal diseases and promoting growth in livestock and aquaculture tcs have been frequently detected in surface water groundwater and treated wastewater effluent at ng l to μg l levels li and hu 2016 tcs are amphoteric molecules with multiple ionized groups including tricarbonyl group phenolic diketone moiety and dimethylamino group ye et al 2017 accordingly tcs can complex with organic matters and cations by different interactions including electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding formation cation exchange electron donor acceptor and π π dispersion which are also determined by ph variation martins et al 2015 according to our previous works struvite recovery from synthetic swine wastewater will lead to tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals with the maximum capacities of oxytetracycline otc 1494 7 μg kg tc 2094 0 μg kg and chlortetracycline ctc 1771 0 μg k respectively ye et al 2017 for the real wastewater it contains a certain amount of dissolved organic matters dom which will influence tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the recovered products however little literature has been reported on the relevant issues as an important composition of wastewater dom is a complex and heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds which contains various functional groups dom can bond with many pollutants such as antibiotics and estrogens and pose effects on their environmental behaviors lei et al 2014 nie et al 2014 the interactions between dom and tcs and relative mechanisms such as ion exchange cation bridging and hydrogen bonding have been examined and the alterations on tcs sorption mobility bioavailability and environmental risks have been evaluated leminh et al 2010 sun et al 2010 li et al 2016 the influences of ph cations dom constituents including humic substances polysaccharides and proteins etc were also investigated zhao et al 2011 christl et al 2016 bai et al 2017 as for struvite recovery from wastewater it consists of chemical reaction and struvite crystallite formation stages in which the wastewater will undergo ph increase to the alkaline values the reduction of ion strength and the formation of struvite crystals under such circumstance the properties of dom will be changed forcedly and go into the subsequent processes i e aggregation and hydrolysis at present few works has been reported on the relative works and the processes and interactions governing tcs transport should be understood therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the influences of dom on tcs transport during struvite recovery from swine wastewater the variation of dom properties including constituents fractional parts with molecular weight cut off evolution stage corresponding to the transformation of tcs partition was analyzed the main dom constituents contributing tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the recovered products and the relevant interactions were analyzed in addition the effects of ph on tcs transport were also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and standards tetracyclines tcs including tetracycline tc oxytetracycline otc and chlortetracycline ctc were obtained from the

pall life sciences co usa was used for dom fractionation in the present study three types of pall omega membranes with different molecular weight cut off i e 30 kda 5 kda and 1 kda were selected which was referenced to the particle size distribution of dom in wastewater wang et al 2006 ma et al 2013 before dom fractionation swine wastewater was filtrated with 0 45 μm pore size of glass fiber filters which were previously calcinated for 4 h at 450 c then the filtrate was filtrate through the membranes in series where larger pore size membranes were prior to smaller pore size ones fig 1 to

dom recovery as doc was calculated so as to evaluate the fractionation process doc was calculated as the sum of doc mass in the retentate and filtrate divided by the doc mass in the original unfractionated wastewater during the fractionation process the dom recovery values ranged from 92 to 111 2 3 experimental setup before the investigation of dom influences on tcs transport in struvite recovery a blank experiment without dom was performed stock solutions containing nh4 po4 3 mg2 and tcs were prepared by dissolving nh4 2hpo4 mgcl2 6h2o and tcs into the ultrapure water respectively for struvite precipitation 500 ml beakers with 300 ml working volume were used stock solutions were mixed with the agitation of 250 rpm and nh4 and po4 3 concentrations were referenced to table 1 where tcs concentrations were adjusted to the levels detected in the real wastewater desired volume of mg2 solution was dosed into the liquor to control mg p molar ratio at 1 2 1 and the ph value was set at 8 5 by dosing 2 mol l naoh to achieve struvite precipitation all the experiments were conducted at the ambient temperature of 22 25 c after 60 min agitation the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min and aqueous and solid samples were withdrawn prior to analyses as to the solid samples they were dried at 40 c in an air oven for 24 h in order to evaluate the effects of total dom on tcs transport real wastewater without dom fractionation was used and struvite precipitation was conducted by setting the same operation conditions as those in the blank experiment at the end of experiment the supernatant was subjected to dom fractionation as described in section 2 2 the concentrations of tcs and dissolved organic carbon doc in all fdoms before and after struvite precipitation were analyzed and compared struvite recovery in each fractional doms fdoms original from the real wastewater were further conducted in order to keep struvite precipitation occur at the same conditions desired volume of po4 3 solution was added into every fdoms solution to control initial po4 3 p at 100 mg l and a certain amount of mg2 solution was dosed to maitain the mg p molar ratio at 1 2 1 before the experiments every fdom in each solution was adjusted to 25 mg l by mini q pure water initial tcs concentration in each fdoms was allowed to 200 μg l before struvite precipitation during struvite precipitation the ph value was set at 8 5 by dosing 2 mol l naoh after struvite precipitation the variations of tcs and doc in the solutions were examined and the contribution of individual fdoms on tcs transport was evaluated according to the previous research the suitable ph range for struvite recovery in wastewater was 8 5 10 5 ye et al 2011 meanwhile the dissociation of tcs is ph dependent ye et al 2017 hence a series of experiments were carried out to examine ph influence and the ph values in struvite precipitation were set at 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 and 10 5 respectively after experiments solid and liquid samples were withdrawn for further analyses 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 tetracyclines assay for both solid and liquid samples they were firstly diluted to approximately 200 ml with milli q pure water and acidified to ph 3 0 by dosing 0 1 mol l hcl solid phase extraction method was used to concentrate tcs from the samples huang et al 2013 tcs

limits and the quantification for instrument were decided by using calibration curves zhao et al 2010 xia et al 2016 2 4 2 spectrum analyses three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem spectroscopy was obtained by using a fluorescence spectrofluorometer f 4600 hitachi co japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp as the light source the excitation emission matrix spectra were collected with subsequently scanning the emission spectra form 200 600 nm by increasing the excitation wavelength at 0 5 nm increments from 200 to 500 nm the 3deem spectrogram was further evaluated by the fluorescence region index fri a quantitative method applied to integrate the volume beneath the 3deem described by korak et al 2015 generally 3deem was defined into five excitation emission regions depending on the fluorescence of model compounds i aromatic protein i λexcitation λemission λex λem 220 250 nm 280 330 nm ii aromatic protein ii λex λem 220 250 nm 330 380 nm iii

in the struvite solids under synthetic and real wastewater were compared as shown in fig 2 the precipitates obtained under real wastewater possessed 360 742 μg g tcs significantly higher than those 1 49 2 16 μg g tcs recovered from synthetic wastewater hence it was obvious that the existence of dom in the wastewater greatly promoted tcs transport from the wastewater to the recovered products the discrepancies of dom fluorescence spectra in the wastewater before and after struvite precipitation were illustrated in fig 3 despite of intensity difference two main peaks were detected in both samples the first main peak was located at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em approximate 330 440 nm peak i where the second main peak was observed at the ex em approximate 270 440 nm peak ii according to the literature li et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 these two peaks belonged to humic acid like substances further investigation on the properties of fluorescence peaks including peak locations fluorescence intensity and peak intensity ratios were conducted as summarized in table 2 peak shifts of dom fluorescence spectra were observed after struvite precipitation peak i after struvite precipitation possessed a blue shift 10 nm along the emission axis to shorter wavelengths coupling with a red shift 10 nm along the excitation axis to longer wavelengths fig 3 as to peak ii it demonstrated a red shift of 20 nm displacement along the emission axis it has been reported that blue shifts in the fluorescence spectra are associated with the decomposition of condensed aromatic moieties including the disintegration of π electron system number reduction of aromatic rings disassembling of conjugated bonds in carbon chain structures lavonen et al 2015 wei et al 2016 as to the wavelength shifts of excitation and emission from lower to higher values red shift they were considered as to the generation of functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl alkoxyl amino and carboxyl constituents helms et al 2013 lavonen et al 2015 hence the peak shifts of fluorescence spectra indicated that during struvite crystallization parts of dom hydrolyzed and resulted with some kinds of functional groups released such outcomes were also verified by the changes of peak intensity ratios of the 3deem fluorescence spectra as presented in table 2 where the structural differences in the dom compounds could be represented by the transformation of dom fluorescence characteristics helms et al 2013 lavonen et al 2015 it should be pointed out that there were several peaks with relatively low fluorescent intensity which could not be significantly detected fig 3 those peaks mainly appeared in the region of ex 200 250 nm and em 380 nm which could be ascribed as fulvic acid materials guo et al 2012 in order to clarify the changes of dom components before and after struvite precipitation the fluorescence regional integration fri method korak et al 2015 was employed to analyze the differences of five excitation emission fluorescent regions of dom as illustrated in fig 4 struvite precipitation resulted with 136 0 mg l doc lost in the aqueous phase besides distinct reductions of fulvic acid like region iii materials with 81 4 mg l doc and humic acid like region v materials with 75 5 mg l doc coupling with slight increments of aromatic protein i region i with 1 7 mg l doc aromatic protein region ii materials with 16 6 mg l doc and soluble microbial by product like region iv materials with 6 0 mg l doc were detected these results revealed that during struvite precipitation significant parts of dom destabilized and co precipitated with struvite crystals while a certain amount of dom disintegrated hence investigating the relationship between the changes of dom constituents and the antibiotic transport was necessary further examination on the concentration changes of fractionating doms with different molecular weight cut off i e fdom1 30 kda 0 45 μm fdom2 5 30 kda fdom3 1 5 kda and fdom4 1 kda and the affinity variation between individual fdoms and the antibiotics during struvite precipitation were conducted as shown in fig 5 a fdom1 and fdom3 possessed obvious reduction with their concentrations decreasing from 162 5 to 12 1 mg l and from 63 4 to 39 4 mg l respectively regarding fdom2 and fdom4 slight concentration increases of 27 0 for fdom2 and 10 8 mg l for fdom4 were observed by referencing the data in fig 4 it could be seen that humic acid like and fulvic acid like materials with higher molecular weight fdom1 30 kda 0 45 μm contributed the major parts of dom co precipitating with struvite crystals further investigation on tcs complexation with different fdoms fig 5b and c revealed that the destabilization and precipitation of fdom1 played a significant role on the aqueous tcs reduction nevertheless the changes of tcs partitioning in fdoms fig 5b and c did not entirely match the profiles of fdoms concentration variation fig 5a where significant tcs reductions from 161 97 μg l to 1 02 μg l were detected in other fdoms including fdom2 fdom3 and fdom4 such phenomena indicated that in addition to dom co precipitation other factors might play important roles on tcs migration behavior from the aqueous phase to the recovered solids 3 2 effects of individual fdoms struvite recovery under differently fractionational doms fdoms was respectively investigated the concentrations of organic matters in the recovered solids coupling with the variation of organic constituents in the aqueous phase were examined as shown in fig 6 precipitated organic matters were detected in all experimental runs fdom1 and fdom4 did precipitate more than two other fdoms and the sequence was fdom1 fdom4 fdom3 fdom2 with their contents in the recovered solids at 86 2 76 1 60 9 and 45 7 mg g respectively fig 6a different from the data in fig 5a where fdom2 and fdom4 concentrations did slightly increase after struvite precipitation these results indicated that certain parts of fdom1 and fdom3 were disintegrated to fdom2 and fdom4 in addition the analyses on the fri distribution fig 6b displayed that the concentrations of different organic components especially humic acid like region v and fulvic acid like region iii materials decreased significantly after struvite precipitation hence it was conclusive that during struvite recovery the changes of dom underwent two steps i e co precipitation and hydrolysis in the co precipitation step a certain amount of individual fdom co precipitated with struvite crystals where in the second step significant parts of organic matters with higher molecular weight fdom1 and fdom3 were hydrolyzed to supplement the loss of organic matters with lower molecular weight fdom2 and fdom4 this clarification on dom transformation steps was helpful for understanding tcs transport in the process of struvite precipitation the occurrence of tcs in the recovered solids was examined as illustrated in fig 7 a the solids recovered respectively from fdom1 and fdom2 liquors possessed higher tcs contents than those obtained from fdom3 and fdom4 for instance tcs in the solids recovered under fdom1 existence contained tc 480 49 μg g ctc 422 09 μg g and otc 484 17 μg g where tc 31 88 μg g ctc 160 51 μg g and otc 114 78 μg g were respectively detected under fdom3 existence besides the removal efficiencies of aqueous antibiotics fig 7b indicated that small amounts of tcs 4 55 26 02 were removed from the fdom3 and fdom4 liquors such results suggested that compared to fdom3 and fdom4 fdom1 and fdom2 with larger molecular weight played important roles on tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products during struvite recovery from wastewater it should be noted that these outcomes was distinctly different from the profiles in fig 5 where fdoms with smaller molecular weight fdom3 and fdom4 presented a false appearance by displaying their significant contribution on tcs removal from the aqueous phase after analyzing the discrepancy of fdoms concentrations in figs 5 and 6 it could be indicative that the variation of fdoms components and tcs re partitioning among various fdoms were the key factors for the difference of tcs transportation behaviors 3 3 ph influence to investigate ph influence on tcs residue in the final products ph values were set at the range of 8 5 10 5 for the experiments fig 8 demonstrated the variation of antibiotic contents and organic matters in the recovered solids steady increases were observed for both tcs and toc an increment of toc from 168 7 mg g to 207 5 mg g was detected when ph values were enhanced from 8 5 to 10 5 regarding tcs concentrations the minimum values tc 94 5 μg g otc 65 2 μg g and ctc 292 4 μg g at ph 8 5 and the maximum values tc 825 0 μg g otc 627 2 μg g and ctc 688 0 μg g at ph 10 5 were obtained respectively a mathematical regression was employed to track the roles of toc on tcs residue in the solids linear relationships were observed for tcs and toc with the determination coefficient at 0 884 0 956 as illustrated in table 3 these results indicated that the precipitated dom fractions exhibited direct influences on tcs transport to the recovered products 4 discussion for tcs with the property of polar ionic and highly hydrophilic significant non hydrophobic interactions such as cation exchange ligand exchange surface complexation and hydrogen bonding can be predominant zhang et al 2012 the affinities of tcs with dom and thus tcs phase distribution are not only dependent on the physicochemical properties of dom including aromaticity polarity abundance and types of functional groups sun et al 2010 but also complicated by the specific interactions under different operations christl et al 2016 for struvite recovery it consisted of chemical reaction and struvite crystallite formation stages in which the wastewater underwent the ph increase to the alkaline conditions the dramatic reduction of ion strength and the formation of solid products under these circumstances three mixing property changes of dom could be distinguished 1 the surface charge characteristics of dom were altered 2 subsequently certain parts of dom constituents aggregated fig 6 and formed both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains due to the reducing repulsive interactions between negatively charged molecules gu et al 2007 carmosini and lee 2009 3 simultaneously the alkaline solution was in favor of hydrolysis of dom with high molecular weight into low molecular weight li et al 2016 chen et al 2017 by referencing the results from synthetic wastewater fig 2 these changes of dom properties led to the transformation of tcs partition in dom phase and hence promoted tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products previous studies revealed that dom exhibited relatively high complexation on antibiotics especially for tcs groups luo et al 2011 ding et al 2013 their interaction mechanisms included cation exchange ligand exchange surface complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attractive force zhang et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 for the alkaline conditions in struvite recovery the surface complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction were predominant zhao et al 2012 lou et al 2017 besides the chemical reaction of struvite precipitation brought about significant changes of electric potential ion concentration and struvite formation in the wastewater which led to the destabilization aggregation and co precipitation of dom components thereby certain amounts of organic matters were precipitated in the final solids as illustrated in fig 6 the aggregated dom would enhance tcs adsorption through the aggregated hydrophobic dom regions pan et al 2008 this was why high tcs contents were detected in the recovered products figs 2 and 7a compared to those in the solids recovered from synthetic wastewater fig 2 increasing ph values would promote the compression on the electrical layer of dom molecules and result with more dom precipitation as shown in fig 8b therefore a steady increase of tcs contents coupling with ph enhancement was observed in the recovered products fig 8a dom with higher molecular weights had higher aromaticity with more acidic groups polysaccharides fatty acids and long aliphatic side chains which would complex with tcs more easily kulshrestha et al 2004 ma et al 2013 in the present study all the fdoms were subjected to the ftir spectra fig 9 analyses to analyze the functional groups involved in complexation the main features of these spectra and their corresponding assignments were identified as described elsewhere ng and mintova 2011 song et al 2014 guo et al 2012 bai et al 2017 a a series shoulders at about 2920 and 2850 cm 1 resulted from asymmetric and symmetric stretching of aliphatic methyl and methylene groups such as fatty acids waxes and various other aliphatic b the bands at 1460 1420 and 1400 1390 cm 1 are attributed to c h deformation of aliphatic and ch3 groups respectively c an bond at 1400 cm 1 preferentially attributed to o h deformation and c o stretching of phenolic oh d the absorption at about 1030 cm 1 and 1645 cm 1 can be assigned to the c o stretching of secondary alcohols and or ethers e a small peak at 870 cm 1 is attributed to oh stretching vibration of carboxylic groups f two sharp bands at 835 and 700 cm 1 are due to the n h vibration of primary amine group and secondary amine group respectively g a series shoulders at 580 660 cm 1 possibly result from sulfate furthermore the uv vis spectra analyses and suva254 measurement to determine the aromatic moiety present in the fdoms massicotte et al 2017 as shown in fig 10 fdom1 had the highest suva254 of 8 5 l mg m followed by fdom2 6 1 l mg m fdom3 2 0 l mg m and fdom4 2 1 l mg m respectively according to the previous claims kulshrestha et al 2004 the sequence of complexation capacity of every fdoms unit mass with tcs was fdom1 fdom2 fdom4 fdom3 therefore the solids recovered from fdom1 and fdom2 liquors possessed higher tcs contents than those obtained from fdom3 and fdom4 liquors fig 7 it should be noted that fdom1 and fdom4 showed totally different behaviors on tcs transport under different experiment conditions as shown in fig 5d fdom1 and fdom4 made important contributions on the aqueous tcs removal in case of total dom as the media while they displayed minor effects on tcs transport in case of each fdom as the media fig 7b this discrepancy could be ascribed to the changes of fdoms constituents and tcs re partitioning in the process of struvite recovery as shown in figs 4 and 6 dom contained various constituents including aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humic acid like materials in the present study struvite recovery led to certain parts of fdom1 hydrolyze into organic matters with lower molecular weight fig 5a and the proportion of different organic components in the total dom changed as presented in fig 4 among the organic components protein like substances possessed the stronger binding with tcs than humic acid like materials whereas fulvic acid like component made a greater contribution than protein like component to the interaction of antibiotics bai et al 2017 these complexation differences indicated that under the circumstances of struvite recovery tcs dissociated from the humic acids more easily and the partition of tcs between the dom phase and the aqueous phase was altered correspondingly this was because under the alkaline conditions the repulsion between predominantly deprotonated carboxylic and phenolic groups in the humic acids and the anionic tcs increased kulshrestha et al 2004 christl et al 2016 hence the proportion of tcs complexation with fdom3 or fdom4 declined this was why they displayed minor effects on tcs transport in case of each fdom as the media such phenomena was confirmed previously when ph increased from 7 0 to 11 0 17 2 44 7 tcs was desorbed from dissolved humic acid kulshrestha et al 2004 5 conclusion this study gave information about the influences of dom on tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater which had practical interest because tcs exerted the pharmacological impacts on the recovered struvite utilization the struvite products recovered under real wastewater contained 360 742 μg g tcs significantly higher than those 1 49 2 16 μg g tcs obtained from synthetic wastewater during the recovery process the transformation of dom underwent two steps i e co precipitation and hydrolysis in the co precipitation stage significant amounts of tcs binding with dom precipitated and transported to the solids whereas in the hydrolysis stage the residual tcs in the aqueous phase re partitioned among various dom constituents results revealed that compared to fdom3 and fdom4 fdom1 and fdom2 with larger molecular weight played important roles on tcs transport from the aqueous phase to the solid products enhancing ph values from 8 5 to 10 5 resulted with the increase of tcs contents in the solids the outcomes are practical to understand tcs transport during struvite recovery from wastewater which will undoubtedly do help to the technology application of phosphate recovery and develop methods to control the pharmacological impacts acknowledgements this work was supported by the china japanese research cooperative program no 2016yfe0118000 and the

19712,sediment bacterial communities play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling in lotic ecosystems despite their ecological significance the effects of urban discharge on spatiotemporal distribution of bacterial communities are understudied in this study we examined the effect of urban discharge on the spatiotemporal distribution of stream sediment bacteria in a northeast ohio stream water and sediment samples were collected after large storm events discharge 100 m from sites along a highly impacted stream tinkers creek cuyahoga river watershed ohio usa and two reference streams although alpha α diversity was relatively constant spatially multivariate analysis of bacterial community 16s rdna profiles revealed significant spatial and temporal effects on beta β diversity and community composition and identified a number of significant correlative abiotic parameters clustering of upstream and reference sites from downstream sites of tinkers creek combined with the dominant families observed in specific locales suggests that environmentally induced species sorting had a strong impact on the composition of sediment bacterial communities distinct groupings of bacterial families that are often associated with nutrient pollution i e comamonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and pirellulaceae and other contaminants i e sphingomonadaceae and phyllobacteriaceae were more prominent at sites experiencing higher degrees of discharge associated with urbanization additionally there were marked seasonal changes in community composition with individual taxa exhibiting different seasonal abundance patterns however spatiotemporal variation in stream conditions did not affect bacterial community functional profiles together these results suggest that local environmental drivers and niche filtering from discharge events associated with urbanization shape the bacterial community structure however dispersal limitations and interactions among other species likely play a role as

environmental drivers were examined in tinkers creek a tributary of the cuyahoga river in northeast ohio usa effluent from wwtps constitutes up to 80 of streamflow in tinkers creek tertuliani et al 2008 and input from nonpoint sources causes increased turbidity and sedimentation after heavy rain events ohio epa 2003 as a result the stream is exposed to a wide range of physicochemical variation and various sources of inorganic and organic contamination along the length of tinkers creek the extent of urban land use and the number of wwtps increases with distance from the headwaters physiochemical conditions were expected to reflect this pattern through higher nutrient loads and greater conductivity downstream tertuliani et al 2008 we hypothesized there would be a longitudinal decrease in bacterial richness α diversity concurrently with the urban gradient and that there would be high compositional dissimilarity β diversity between tinkers creek and two reference streams further we hypothesized that the urbanization gradient reflected in tinkers creek physicochemistry would result in increased compositional dissimilarity between upstream and downstream sites and that these changes would be reflected by fluctuations in specific functional traits additionally we anticipated that seasonal variability in stream physicochemical parameters would result in a successional change in community composition over the course of the sampling season specifically prior studies have shown seasonal fluctuations in temperature boyero et al 2011 sliva and williams 2005 zhang et al

statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using r statistical software version 3 2 0 r development core team 2014 grubb s tests package outliers lukasz 2015 were used to identify outliers in stream physicochemical data which were removed before further analysis physicochemical data failed to meet assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity and attempts at data transformation were not successful consequently spearman s rank correlations were used to explore general spatial trends in environmental conditions within tinkers creek and to identify seasonal patterns in addition permutational one way analysis of variance permanova coin package hothorn et al 2008 followed by permutational multiple comparison tests nparcomp package maintainer and konietschke 2015 were used to identify site specific differences in environmental conditions between tinkers creek and reference streams all univariate p values were corrected following the benjamini hochberg b h procedure for reducing false discovery rates hochberg and benjamini 1995 to evaluate differences in community composition among sampling sites and dates relative abundance data from t rflp profiles were hellinger transformed and measures associated with α richness evenness shannon s entropy and inverse simpson s index and β diversity as bray curtis distances were calculated using the vegan package oksanen et

package hothorn et al 2008 followed by permutational multiple comparison tests nparcomp package maintainer and konietschke 2015 were used to identify site specific or month specific differences all univariate p values were corrected following the benjamini hochberg procedure for reducing false discovery rates hochberg and benjamini 1995 nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to compare and

sample diversity from rarefied sequences a bray curtis distance matrix was generated and used to generate multidimensional scaling axes to visualize trends in communities over time and among sampling

each site it was difficult to discern clear spatial patterns in β diversity fig 1 a seasonal effects on β diversity were much more apparent with a clear separation of october and november from other

partitioning out the effects of sampling date ordination of the significant rda axes showed most of the sites clustered relatively close to one another except for the most upstream site in tinkers creek tc1 and reference site 2 furnace run fig 2a despite this clustering there was little overlap in ordination space as demonstrated by standard errors of community profile means indicating significant compositional dissimilarity among sites of the environmental variables examined bom dissolved and sediment nutrients conductivity ph redox do and discharge rates were all strong predictors of bacterial community composition table 2 p 0 05 analysis of the community ko profiles revealed that there was no significant difference in functional groups regardless of functional resolution e g levels 1 fig 3 2 or 3 data not shown between sampling locations however the majority 51 of functional genes were related to metabolic function sampling date accounted for a greater percentage of described variance 14 5 in community composition than did study site this was apparent in the lack of overlap in community profiles by month and clear clustering that reflected seasonal environmental differences fig 2b for example spring and summer months clustered near one another while mid to late fall communities october and november clustered together these patterns were significantly correlated with seasonal changes in environmental conditions i e dissolved nh4 no2 sediment no3 conductivity temperature do turbidity flow and discharge table 2 p 0 05 september exhibited the greatest

plantomyetia pirellulales pirellulaceae and verrucomicrobiae verrucomicrobia verrucomicrobiae 7 1 and 6 9 of the reads respectively and alphaproteobacteria rhodobacterales rhodobacteraceae and

comamonadaceae fig 5b reference streams had similar community makeup as upstream sites in tinkers creek however several families were either only present in reference streams or had greater relative

seasonal differences were also apparent at all taxonomic levels figs s2b and s3b fig 4b although dissolved nh4 was the only abiotic parameter to correlate with july community composition fig 4b significant correlations were apparent with specific family groups tables s6a and s6b specifically dissolved and sediment extracted nutrients positively and negatively respectively correlated with

nitrospiraceae abundance seasonal differences in the prevalence of dominant families abundances 3 of sequence reads were apparent for the chitinophagaceae pirellulaceae verrucomicrobiaceae fig 6 a rhodobacteraceae and comamonadaceae fig 6 b the comamonadaceae was the most dominant sediment community member over the course of this study except during october with abundances peaking in june at 10 3 of sequencing reads in october verrucomicrobiaceae and rhodobacteraceae were the most prevalent groups making up 10 of the reads both families peaked again in abundance 7 4 and 4 6 of reads respectively during spring april similarly chitinopagaceae made up a large proportion 7 3 of the sequence reads of the community in july chitinopagaceae was the most prevalent sediment community member making up 8 2 of the sequence read pirellulaceaea taxa demonstrated a cyclic peaking pattern with increases in abundance in october may and july followed by decreases in abundance in november june and august less prominent families also demonstrated peaks in abundance over the course of the study acidobacteria peaked in abundance during april and july making up 4 5 and 5 7 of sequencing reads respectively fig 6a the bacteroidia cytophagales and deltaproteobacteria taxa peaked in abundance in may making up 8 and 4 7 of sequence reads however seasonal changes in community composition did not result in distinct changes in community function as redundancy analysis of picrust results showed no differences in major functional profiles over time fig 7 the majority 51 of functional genes were related to metabolic function followed my genetic information processing 20 4 discussion urban discharge is a primary source of stream degradation in urban areas parr et al 2015 alterations in microbial mediated nutrient cycling processes merbt et al 2015 and increases in fecal bacterial indicator contamination baudart et al 2000 cha et al 2010 chigbu et al 2004 chu et al 2014 as a result of urban discharge have been widely documented however there are few reports detailing spatiotemporal variations in bacterial sediment assemblages in streams dominated by urban discharge staley et al 2013 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 by analyzing the sediments of tinkers creek and two references streams we demonstrated that bacterial community composition was correlated with local environmental conditions e g conductivity and nutrient concentrations which were directly influenced by surrounding sub watershed land use suggesting that land use and local stream properties influence bacterial sediment communities the impacts of the urban discharge on physicochemical variables were evident in downstream sites along tinkers creek and were hypothesized to result in a longitudinal decrease in bacterial species richness however despite large longitudinal differences in water and sediment physicochemical properties bacterial communities exposed to higher urban drainage in tinkers creek did not differ in species richness or evenness relative to upstream and reference stream communities these results are inconsistent with other studies that have shown that higher concentrations of organic and inorganic nutrients associated with anthropogenic activity may either increase staley et al 2014 marti and balcázar 2014 wakelin et al 2008 or decrease lu and lu 2014 drury et al 2013 species richness in stream sediment bacterial assemblages the observed similarity in species richness and evenness may imply that many of the taxa are generalists capable of utilizing a wide variety of nutrients wittebolle et al 2009 and or capable of withstanding non extreme environmental perturbations staley et al 2014 wittebolle et al 2009 along the same lines staley et al 2014 observed a significant difference in diversity between forested and urban sites but not between agricultural and urban sites and suggested that the lack of differences was attributable to the similarity in anthropogenic disturbance between the sites i e similar nutrient and contaminant loads alternatively our results may reflect the large number of dormant cells within these communities which has been documented to affect species richness as dormant individuals are capable of withstanding environmental perturbations lennon and jones 2011 in spite of similarities in species richness among sites bacterial community composition differed among sites longitudinal differences in composition in tinkers creek were strongly connected to environmental conditions including nutrient concentrations do conductivity redox and discharge this suggests that species sorting had a strong impact on sediment bacterial communities with local habitat conditions selecting for specific groups of bacteria gibbons et al 2014 heino et al 2014 staley et al 2013 the degree of connectivity between lotic systems and adjacent terrestrial systems are influenced by drainage density and hydrological exchange which can have a direct impact on microbial communities in streams hullar et al 2006 the bacterial communities in our study encompassed microbes of terrestrial aquatic and human origins with the mixture of bacteria from different putative sources varying among sampling locations more urbanized sites tc 3 5 included taxa associated with nutrient pollution and other anthropogenic disturbance the families comamonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and pirellulaceae were among the most dominant groups at downstream sites accounting for up to 29 of sequence reads at these sites members of these families are commonly found in freshwater environments pujalte et al 2014 willems 2014 youssef and elshahed 2014 but are most known for being dominant groups in nutrient rich environments rosenberg et al 2013 tang et al 2017 vetterli et al 2015 yu et al 2017 youssef and elshahed 2014 other taxa with elevated abundance at sites with more urban impact included phyllobacteriaceae 5 7 of sequences and sphingomonadaceae 6 13 of sequences phyllobacteriaceae taxa have most commonly been studied with regard to degradation of xenobiotic and recalcitrant compounds such as thiophene bambauer et al 1998 phenols fritsche et al 1999 naphthalenesulfonates ghosh and dam 2009 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid doronina et al 2010 and thiophene 2 carboxylate bambauer et al 1998 likewise sphingomonadaceae are often found in high proportions in habitats contaminated with recalcitrant poly aromatic compounds of natural glaeser et al 2010 rosenberg et al 2013 or anthropogenic origin basta et al 2005 romine et al 1999 sprenger 1993 rosenberg et al 2013 the relative dominance of these two families in downstream sites may reflect increased industrial contaminants present in wwtp effluent as the treatment facilities receive chemicals and other wastes from industrial sources alternatively these taxa may serve as an indicator of the degree of urbanization occurring upstream of these sites as stormwater runoff from street drains enters this stream from a variety of locations other families that were prevalent at downstream sites are not well characterized in terms of their ecological role in aquatic systems including ellin 6077 rb411 chloracidobacteria mb2424 acidobacteria 6 iii1 15 cryomorphaceae and chitinophagaceae taxa within the phylum acidobacteria are known for their resistance to pollutants like petroleum compounds abed et al 2002 p nitrophenol paul et al 2006 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate sánchez peinado et al 2010 and uranium ellis et al 2003 gremion et al 2003 barns et al 2007 whereas bacteroidetes are prevalent in organic rich systems crump and hobbie 2005 huang et al 2008 obernosterer et al 2011 wang et al 2011 therefore the dominance of acidobacteria and bacteroidetes in more urbanized sites may indicate the prevalence of organic wastewater compounds within tinkers creek tertuliani et al 2008 in general the variety of taxa found in high abundance in downstream sites of tinkers creek suggests that effluent from the wwtps plays a strong role in shaping the stream bacterial communities as different contaminants from these wwtps may have different selective forces on community composition in contrast to the more urbanized sites a large percentage 32 of the taxa prevalent in the less urbanized sites tinkers creek 1 and 2 ref 1 and 2 has syntrophic and fermentative lifestyles members of the family sytrophaceae are commonly found in anaerobic freshwater sediments jackson et al 1999 shelton and tiedje 1984 wallrabenstein and schink 1994 and are capable of fermenting substrates that are utilized by h2 formate utilizing partners kuever et al 2005 schink 1997 the desulfobulbaceae syntrophobacteraceae and geobacteraceae are sulfate sulfur reducing bacteria kuever et al 2005 muyzer and stams 2008 and or other metal reducing bacteria holmes et al 2004 2004a 2004b kuever 2005 röling 2014 respectively although mostly known for their ability to utilize sulfur or other metal compounds as their terminal electron acceptors genera in these families have an important role in the anaerobic fermentation oxidation of organic compounds aklujkar et al 2012 reviewed in muyzer and stams 2008 röling 2014 thermodesulfovibrionaceae such as deltaproteobacteria detected in this study are sulfate reducers with chemoorganoheterotrophic or chemolithoheterotrophic lifestyles during chemolithoheterotrophic growth genera of this family use h2 as electron donor and acetate as a carbon source henry et al 1994 additionally crenotrichaceae gammaproteobacteria which was only found in upstream sites of tinkers is a type ib methanotroph group these organisms are facultative aerobes that utilize methane and methanol or other c1 compounds as substrates bowman 2014 stein et al 2012 stoecker et al 2006 when considering the relatively high diversity of fermenters and sulfur sulfate reducing taxa found in the upstream sites and reference streams the microbial communities may be structured by inputs from groundwater and the hyporheic zone griebler and lueders 2009 storey et al 1999 although we lack data on the source of water at the different sites the difference in community composition and the differences in sediment composition with fine sediment at upstream sites and pebbles cobblestones at downstream sites suggests a switch from deep to shallow water flow paths longitudinally thus supporting the notion that local sampling environment can influence the structure of the microbial community within the stream heino et al 2014 cloutier et al 2015 overall the dissimilarities in bacterial community composition among upstream downstream and reference sites reflect otu specific environmental tolerances to local conditions comte et al 2014 comte and del giorgio 2009 newton et al 2011 philippot et al 2010 wang et al 2011 however it is difficult to ascertain how much of these differences are due to site characteristics land use and or physical chemical that differ along the longitudinal gradients in and among these streams and how much is due to dispersal limitations crump et al 1999 astorga et al 2012 lindström and langenheder 2012 interactions among species fortunato and crump 2011 glibert et al 2012 or some combination of the three astorga et al 2012 future work to tease apart the contributions of spatial proximity and shared environmental characteristics will be required nevertheless these results suggest that differences in water chemistry attributable to urban discharge served as a selective force on bacterial taxa in these streams astorga et al 2012 beier et al 2008 mcarthur and richardson 2002 seasonal changes in the dominant sediment bacterial populations were correlated with changes in aqueous physicochemistry across all sites as predicted these results are consistent with previous studies that have discovered shifts in microbial composition linked to seasonal variation of water physicochemical properties duarte et al 2016 moss et al 2006 yannarell et al 2003 and allochthonous inputs dann et al 2017 alterations in stream temperature light penetration organic and inorganic concentrations in the water column and sediments over the annual period may have shaped the changes observed in the community composition of sediment bacteria in these systems distinct groupings of bacterial families became more prominent on particular dates revealing the highly dynamic nature of the bacteria in these streams fall dominant families contained known degraders of recalcitrant litter verrucomicrobia stevenson et al 2004 wymore et al 2016 and humic substances sphingomonadaceae glaeser et al 2010 glaeser and kämpfer 2014 specifically these groups are important for their utilization of humic substances and ability to degrade recalcitrant high molecular weight compounds glaeser et al 2010 wymore et al 2016 suggesting that these organisms play an important role in carbon cycling in our streams spring dominant families belonged to phyla that are often found associated with algae planctomycetes bengtsson and øvreås 2010 bohórquez et al 2017 and microbial mats allen et al 2009 baumgartner et al 2009 or biofilms bacteroidetes bartrons et al 2012 bohórquez et al 2017 during high levels of algal activity taxa within planctomycetes have the ability to degrade sulfated polysaccharides of algal origin kim et al 2016 lage and bondoso 2014 whereas members of bacteroidetes can degrade organic compounds that may be released from algae thus suggesting that they have an ecological role in the degradation of polysaccharides produced by algae in streams alternatively the high prevalence of bacteroidetes and phyllobacteriaceae may indicate a higher prevalence of discharge from wwtps or runoff during the rainy season bambauer et al 1998 drury et al 2013 doronina et al 2010 eichmiller et al 2013 fritsche et al 1999 kämpfer 1999 in comparison summer was dominated by taxa in families that have wide genetic diversity such as comamonadaceae taxa within this group are known denitrifiers adav et al 2010 etchebehere et al 2001 khan et al 2002 wu et al 2013 fermenters chen et al 2013 finneran et al 2003 kim et al 2012 aerobic organotrophs kim et al 2012 liang et al 2011 photoheterotrophs hiraishi et al 1991 madigan et al 2000 and photoautotrophs zeng et al 2012 which suggests that these organisms are involved in a variety of biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems reviewed by willems 2014 it should be noted however that more detailed phylogenetic work needs to be done to link function with phylogeny especially with largely uncultured groups such as verrucomicrobia or for groups with unknown ecologies i e chitinophagaceae however our results suggest that in stream systems seasonal changes allow for different and distinct combinations of bacterial populations to become prominent members of the community at different times of the year gilbert et al 2012 2009 shade et al 2013 portillo et al 2012 although site and date differences were observed in sediment bacterial community composition we did not see any significant differences in functional profiles over space or time functional resilience to disturbance is possible if the microbial community contains individuals that have versatile physiologies evans and hofmann 2012 core communities found in these systems were comprised of families that had a vast network of genera capable of performing a wide array of biogeochemical cycles for example genera in the family comamonadaceae and rhodocateraceae have metabolic capabilities that span a wide variety of cycles such as organotrophs denitrifiers hydrogen oxidizers photoheterotrophs photoautotrophs fermenters fe3 reducers baldani et al 2014 willems 2014 pujalte et al 2014 most genera in these families have an aerobic heterotrophic metabolism but are capable of switching to other metabolic forms depending on the substrate or electron acceptor availability willems 2014 one such group purple nonsulfur bacteria can be heterotrophic under aerobic conditions and phototrophs under anoxic conditions hiraishi and imhoff 2005 pujalte et al 2014 through altering metabolic capabilities meyer et al 2004 swingley et al 2007 or genetic change evans and hofmann 2012 lenski 2017 de meester et al 2016 bacteria can often overcome detrimental environmental change by exploiting previously unavailable resources thus changes in community composition may not correspond with the response or the lack thereof in community functional profiles allison and martiny 2008 alternatively a large fraction of the community may be dormant lennon and jones 2011 which is common among communities living in temporally and spatially dynamic environments lennon and jones 2011 pedrós alió 2006 rehman et al 2010 in fact dormant individuals of bacterial communities directly affect species diversity chesson 2000 by acting as seed banks seed banks can contribute to the stability of ecosystem processes through the facilitation of niche complementation and or functional redundancy loreau et al 2001 petchey and gaston 2002 this can occur as previously dormant groups become more prevalent under certain conditions while functionally complimentary groups or those functionally similar but less tolerant to current environmental conditions revert to dormancy however compensatory growth of these groups may result in minimal change in ecological processes fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 frost et al 1995 schindler 1990 in general the functional attributes of stream sediment bacteria in this study appear to be similar across a board range of land uses suggesting that there is a high degree of functional gene redundancy qu et al 2017 and a reduction of functional diversity cardinale et al 2012 elmqvist et al 2003 jung et al 2016 as such adaptation of local communities to changing environmental patterns can be independent of functional change in communities bier et al 2015 frost et al 1995 fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 östman et al 2010 reiss et al 2009 overall the predicted functional profile of the microbial community as determined by picruste s algorithm provides a coarse overview of the functional potential present within the community however these results must be interpreted with caution rarefaction of pooled dna samples fails to capture the full extent of diversity present within the system which is likely reflected in the predicted functional profile additionally individual functional genes may not necessarily be correlated with community structure fierer et al 2012 as the placement of novel diversity cannot accurately be mapped into a phylogenetic context due to the fact that a large proportion of bacterial phylogeny is poorly identified harris et al 2013 to adequately assess gene categories deeper sequencing would be required fierer et al 2012 picrust can neither preclude or outperform deep metagenomic sequencing langille et al 2013 the algorithm is significantly affected by the phylogenetic dissimilarity among environmental samples and sequenced genomes langille et al 2013 thus we suggest that further studies that utilize both metagenomic sequencing and marker gene studies are needed in this system and that more samples are required to adequately assess intra and inter stream variability 5 conclusion although α diversity was relatively constant both spatially we found that urban drainage impacts bacterial community structure in streams with greater prevalence of bacteria associated with urban discharge in downstream sites in tinkers creek moreover we found evidence for indirect seasonal effects as nutrient and hydrologic characteristics influenced bacterial community assemblage within our streams however there were no spatial or temporal effects on the core community function our results suggest that deterministic forces are important for community assembly and that differences in β diversity between sites and over time are predominantly due to changes in the relative abundance of a core community this work demonstrates that urban drainage has a marked impact on shaping benthic bacterial communities yet these changes seem not to have an impact on sediment bacteria function this suggests that communities in urban environments may be more resilient to disturbance via versatile physiologies and or functional redundancy although there were no changes in the sediment bacteria functional profiles changes in the composition of microbial communities may affect the energy requirements and expenditures of the communities bier et al 2015 cañedo argüelles et al 2014 nieuwdorp et al 2014 de ruiter et al 1995 which in turn may affect the trophic transfer of energy in stream food webs declaration of interest all authors have seen and approved the final version

19712,sediment bacterial communities play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling in lotic ecosystems despite their ecological significance the effects of urban discharge on spatiotemporal distribution of bacterial communities are understudied in this study we examined the effect of urban discharge on the spatiotemporal distribution of stream sediment bacteria in a northeast ohio stream water and sediment samples were collected after large storm events discharge 100 m from sites along a highly impacted stream tinkers creek cuyahoga river watershed ohio usa and two reference streams although alpha α diversity was relatively constant spatially multivariate analysis of bacterial community 16s rdna profiles revealed significant spatial and temporal effects on beta β diversity and community composition and identified a number of significant correlative abiotic parameters clustering of upstream and reference sites from downstream sites of tinkers creek combined with the dominant families observed in specific locales suggests that environmentally induced species sorting had a strong impact on the composition of sediment bacterial communities distinct groupings of bacterial families that are often associated with nutrient pollution i e comamonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and pirellulaceae and other contaminants i e sphingomonadaceae and phyllobacteriaceae were more prominent at sites experiencing higher degrees of discharge associated with urbanization additionally there were marked seasonal changes in community composition with individual taxa exhibiting different seasonal abundance patterns however spatiotemporal variation in stream conditions did not affect bacterial community functional profiles together these results suggest that local environmental drivers and niche filtering from discharge events associated with urbanization shape the bacterial community structure however dispersal limitations and interactions among other species likely play a role as

bodies can have a negative effect on lotic ecosystem function resulting in reduced nutrient retention efficiency decreased biological diversity and increased dominance of pollution tolerant species reviewed by house et al 1993 roy et al 2014 additionally the altered hydrological regime and geomorphic adjustment from wwtps and swr can scour streambeds and increase erosion walsh et al 2005 reducing habitat quality and altering ecosystem dynamics konrad et al 2005 roy et al 2008 although the severity of hydrogeomorphic fitzpatrick and peppler 2010 chemical beaulieu et al 2014 and biological bryant and carlisle 2012 alterations from urban discharge depends on spatial and temporal differences within catchments the overall effects on aquatic ecosystems are well documented coles et al 2004 cuffney et al 2005 paul and meyer 2001 walker and pan 2006 wenger et al 2009 thus urban discharge can constitute as an environmental filter that potentially impacts benthic bacterial communities benthic bacterial communities perform important functions in lotic ecosystems such as biodegradation and biogeochemical cycling zeglin 2015 and thus are ideal candidates for monitoring ecological effects of urban discharge on functional characteristics of aquatic environments lear et al 2009 additionally stream benthic bacteria are highly responsive to changes in the environment they are the first to interact with dissolved substances and can be severely impacted by perturbations ancion et al 2010 beaulieu et al 2014 paerl et al 2014 as a result of their fast growth rates and responses to small physical and chemical changes schwermer et al 2008 paerl et al 2014 benthic bacterial community composition may differ temporally and spatially i e longitudinally within a stream or among different streams in response to environmental stimuli from urban discharge overall urban discharge impacts sediment bacterial communities in lotic ecosystems and these impacts are

on native bacterial communities have largely been ignored gosset et al 2016 in this study urban discharge impacts on spatiotemporal variation in benthic bacterial community composition and environmental drivers were examined in tinkers creek a tributary of the cuyahoga river in northeast ohio usa effluent from wwtps constitutes up to 80 of streamflow in tinkers creek tertuliani et al 2008 and input from nonpoint sources causes increased turbidity and sedimentation after heavy rain events ohio epa 2003 as a result the stream is exposed to a wide range of physicochemical variation and various sources of inorganic and organic contamination along the length of tinkers creek the extent of urban land use and the number of wwtps increases with distance from the headwaters physiochemical conditions were expected to reflect this pattern through higher nutrient loads and greater conductivity downstream tertuliani et al 2008 we hypothesized there would be a longitudinal decrease in bacterial richness α diversity concurrently with the urban gradient and that there would be high compositional dissimilarity β diversity between tinkers creek and two reference streams further we hypothesized that the urbanization gradient reflected in tinkers creek physicochemistry would result in increased compositional dissimilarity between upstream and downstream sites and that these changes would be reflected by fluctuations in specific functional traits additionally we anticipated that seasonal variability in stream physicochemical parameters would result in a successional change in community composition over the course of the sampling season specifically prior studies have shown seasonal fluctuations in temperature boyero et al 2011 sliva and williams 2005 zhang et al

wwtps fig s1 and stormwater run off the five sites selected for sampling were chosen to represent a wide range of physicochemical parameters and various sources of inorganic and organic contamination tertuliani et al 2008 with only the most upstream site not receiving wwtp effluent qualitatively substrate composition differed along tinkers creek with silt sand occurring at the most upstream locations which shifted to peddles cobbles at downstream sampling locations additionally single sampling sites were established in furnace run and yellow creek 4th and 3rd order tributaries of the cuyahoga river respectively to serve as reference sites both streams are tributaries of the cuyahoga river and their watersheds are less developed compared to that of tinkers creek and they lack wwtps tertuliani et al 2008 table s1 both streams meet biocriteria for attainment as specified by the ohio water quality standards wqs ohio administrative code chapter 3745 1 and ohio epa biological criteria oac rule 3745 1 07 ohio environmental protection agency 2003 in contrast tinkers creek is impaired based on these metrics with significant departures from biocriteria for fish and

microbe genomics facility to produce a community profile analysis of t rflp reads generated was performed with t rex software culman et al 2009 t rflps were processed to remove peak noise and to align fragments before further analysis in r see below given that redundancy analysis of t rflps revealed spatial and temporal differences but no interaction effect in bacterial communities samples were pooled and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing dna concentrations were standardized 10 ng ul 1 and pooled by sampling location samples were pooled across sampling dates for each site and sampling date samples were pooled across sites for each date the v4 v5 hypervariable region of 16s rrna genes was sequenced at the ohio state molecular and cellular imaging center via illumina miseq sequencing technology itags generated were processed in the qiime pipeline v1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 paired forward and reverse reads with ambiguities homopolymers as well as low quality scores were removed using qcing in qiime reads were then assembled into single contigs or itags via pandaseq masella et al 2012 itag primer sequences and barcodes were subsequently eliminated contigs were edited to a uniform length of 250 bp and then chimeric reads detected and removed with usearch v 6 1 edgar 2010 quality filtered contigs were then processed using the de novo and reference based otu clustering platforms in qiime and based on a 97 similarity to 16srrna sequences in the greengenes reference database version 13 8 were assigned to operational taxonomic units otus singletons were removed and results were summarized at the phylum and family levels reads occurring in more than two samples with relative abundances greater than 1 were retained for α and β diversity analyses reads were then rarefied to 14 648 sequences per sample and used in further analysis picrust langille et al 2013 was used to predict functional characteristics of stream bacterial populations picrust utilized associations between 16s rrna gene markers found in the greengenes database and functional genes found in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database to reconstruct potential functional gene families present in the sampled communities de novo otus were removed and the remaining otus were normalized to create a closed reference otu table consisting of samples with greengenes ids which were then used to predict metagenomics functional profiles to compare differences in the functional profiles of communities among sampling sites and dates the relative abundance of predicted kegg

statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using r statistical software version 3 2 0 r development core team 2014 grubb s tests package outliers lukasz 2015 were used to identify outliers in stream physicochemical data which were removed before further analysis physicochemical data failed to meet assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity and attempts at data transformation were not successful consequently spearman s rank correlations were used to explore general spatial trends in environmental conditions within tinkers creek and to identify seasonal patterns in addition permutational one way analysis of variance permanova coin package hothorn et al 2008 followed by permutational multiple comparison tests nparcomp package maintainer and konietschke 2015 were used to identify site specific differences in environmental conditions between tinkers creek and reference streams all univariate p values were corrected following the benjamini hochberg b h procedure for reducing false discovery rates hochberg and benjamini 1995 to evaluate differences in community composition among sampling sites and dates relative abundance data from t rflp profiles were hellinger transformed and measures associated with α richness evenness shannon s entropy and inverse simpson s index and β diversity as bray curtis distances were calculated using the vegan package oksanen et al 2007 measures of α diversity were log transformed to reduce homoscedasticity and both α and β diversity data were tested using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova coin package hothorn et al 2008 followed by permutational multiple comparison tests nparcomp package maintainer and konietschke 2015 were used to identify site specific or month specific differences all univariate p values were corrected following the benjamini hochberg procedure for reducing false discovery rates hochberg and benjamini 1995 nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to compare and visualize β diversity data ggplot2 package wickham et al 2016 partial redundancy analysis vegan package oksanen et al 2007 was then performed on hellinger transformed community t rflp relative abundance data to assess effects of sampling site and month on community composition additionally α diversity indices chao 1 richness and shannon diversity index were calculated to determine within sample diversity from rarefied sequences a bray curtis distance matrix was generated and used to generate multidimensional scaling axes to visualize trends in communities over time and among sampling sites finally partial redundancy analyses were used to compare community ko profiles between sampling locations and between sampling months 3 results several significant spearman rank test p 0 05

stable values until a sharp significant increase in august although there was a 5 month lag between the november and april sampling dates the increase in diversity coincided with increased nutrient concentrations data not shown sampling location and date significantly p 0 025 and p 0 001 respectively affected community β diversity based on t rflp profiles however due to considerable variance at each site it was difficult to discern clear spatial patterns in β diversity fig 1 a seasonal effects on β diversity were much more apparent with a clear separation of october and november from other

partitioning out the effects of sampling date ordination of the significant rda axes showed most of the sites clustered relatively close to one another except for the most upstream site in tinkers creek tc1 and reference site 2 furnace run fig 2a despite this clustering there was little overlap in ordination space as demonstrated by standard errors of community profile means indicating significant compositional dissimilarity among sites of the environmental variables examined bom dissolved and sediment nutrients conductivity ph redox do and discharge rates were all strong predictors of bacterial community composition table 2 p 0 05 analysis of the community ko profiles revealed that there was no significant difference in functional groups regardless of functional resolution e g levels 1 fig 3 2 or 3 data not shown between sampling locations however the majority 51 of functional genes were related to metabolic function sampling date accounted for a greater percentage of described variance 14 5 in community composition than did study site this was apparent in the lack of overlap in community profiles by month and clear clustering that reflected seasonal environmental differences fig 2b for example spring and summer months clustered near one another while mid to late fall communities october and november clustered together these patterns were significantly correlated with seasonal changes in environmental conditions i e dissolved nh4 no2 sediment no3 conductivity temperature do turbidity flow and discharge table 2 p 0 05 september exhibited the greatest

classified as a members of the betaproteobacteria burkholderiales comamonadaceae which made up 16 4 of the sequencing reads followed by and bacteriodia saprospirales chitinophagaceae 10 9 of the reads plantomyetia pirellulales pirellulaceae and verrucomicrobiae verrucomicrobia verrucomicrobiae 7 1 and 6 9 of the reads respectively and alphaproteobacteria rhodobacterales rhodobacteraceae and rhizobiales phyllobacteriaceae 6 8 and 4 7 of the reads respectively communities in tinkers creek were more similar among sites with greater spatial proximity to each other e g site 1 was more similar

comamonadaceae fig 5b reference streams had similar community makeup as upstream sites in tinkers creek however several families were either only present in reference streams or had greater relative abundance compared to upstream sites including bacteroidia bacteroidales sb 1 flavobacteriia flavobacteriales flavobacteriaceae fig 5a and betaproteobacteria rhodocyclales rhodocyclaceae fig 5b seasonal differences were also apparent at all taxonomic levels figs s2b and s3b fig 4b although dissolved nh4 was the only abiotic parameter to correlate with july community composition fig 4b significant correlations were apparent with specific family groups tables s6a and s6b specifically dissolved and sediment extracted nutrients positively and negatively respectively correlated with

nutrients table s6a additionally all non nutrient stream measurements table s6b positively correlated with different taxa over time except for do concentration which was negatively correlated to nitrospiraceae abundance seasonal differences in the prevalence of dominant families abundances 3 of sequence reads were apparent for the chitinophagaceae pirellulaceae verrucomicrobiaceae fig 6 a rhodobacteraceae and comamonadaceae fig 6 b the comamonadaceae was the most dominant sediment community member over the course of this study except during october with abundances peaking in june at 10 3 of sequencing reads in october verrucomicrobiaceae and rhodobacteraceae were the most prevalent groups making up 10 of the reads both families peaked again in abundance 7 4 and 4 6 of reads respectively during spring april similarly chitinopagaceae made up a large proportion 7 3 of the sequence reads of the community in july chitinopagaceae was the most prevalent sediment community member making up 8 2 of the sequence read pirellulaceaea taxa demonstrated a cyclic peaking pattern with increases in abundance in october may and july followed by decreases in abundance in november june and august less prominent families also demonstrated peaks in abundance over the course of the study acidobacteria peaked in abundance during april and july making up 4 5 and 5 7 of sequencing reads respectively fig 6a the bacteroidia cytophagales and deltaproteobacteria taxa peaked in abundance in may making up 8 and 4 7 of sequence reads however seasonal changes in community composition did not result in distinct changes in community function as redundancy analysis of picrust results showed no differences in major functional profiles over time fig 7 the majority 51 of functional genes were related to metabolic function followed my genetic information processing 20 4 discussion urban discharge is a primary source of stream degradation in urban areas parr et al 2015 alterations in microbial mediated nutrient cycling processes merbt et al 2015 and increases in fecal bacterial indicator contamination baudart et al 2000 cha et al 2010 chigbu et al 2004 chu et al 2014 as a result of urban discharge have been widely documented however there are few reports detailing spatiotemporal variations in bacterial sediment assemblages in streams dominated by urban discharge staley et al 2013 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 by analyzing the sediments of tinkers creek and two references streams we demonstrated that bacterial community composition was correlated with local environmental conditions e g conductivity and nutrient concentrations which were directly influenced by surrounding sub watershed land use suggesting that land use and local stream properties influence bacterial sediment communities the impacts of the urban discharge on physicochemical variables were evident in downstream sites along tinkers creek and were hypothesized to result in a longitudinal decrease in bacterial species richness however despite large longitudinal differences in water and sediment physicochemical properties bacterial communities exposed to higher urban drainage in tinkers creek did not differ in species richness or evenness relative to upstream and reference stream communities these results are inconsistent with other studies that have shown that higher concentrations of organic and inorganic nutrients associated with anthropogenic activity may either increase staley et al 2014 marti and balcázar 2014 wakelin et al 2008 or decrease lu and lu 2014 drury et al 2013 species richness in stream sediment bacterial assemblages the observed similarity in species richness and evenness may imply that many of the taxa are generalists capable of utilizing a wide variety of nutrients wittebolle et al 2009 and or capable of withstanding non extreme environmental perturbations staley et al 2014 wittebolle et al 2009 along the same lines staley et al 2014 observed a significant difference in diversity between forested and urban sites but not between agricultural and urban sites and suggested that the lack of differences was attributable to the similarity in anthropogenic disturbance between the sites i e similar nutrient and contaminant loads alternatively our results may reflect the large number of dormant cells within these communities which has been documented to affect species richness as dormant individuals are capable of withstanding environmental perturbations lennon and jones 2011 in spite of similarities in species richness among sites bacterial community composition differed among sites longitudinal differences in composition in tinkers creek were strongly connected to environmental conditions including nutrient concentrations do conductivity redox and discharge this suggests that species sorting had a strong impact on sediment bacterial communities with local habitat conditions selecting for specific groups of bacteria gibbons et al 2014 heino et al 2014 staley et al 2013 the degree of connectivity between lotic systems and adjacent terrestrial systems are influenced by drainage density and hydrological exchange which can have a direct impact on microbial communities in streams hullar et al 2006 the bacterial communities in our study encompassed microbes of terrestrial aquatic and human origins with the mixture of bacteria from different putative sources varying among sampling locations more urbanized sites tc 3 5 included taxa associated with nutrient pollution and other anthropogenic disturbance the families comamonadaceae rhodobacteraceae and pirellulaceae were among the most dominant groups at downstream sites accounting for up to 29 of sequence reads at these sites members of these families are commonly found in freshwater environments pujalte et al 2014 willems 2014 youssef and elshahed 2014 but are most known for being dominant groups in nutrient rich environments rosenberg et al 2013 tang et al 2017 vetterli et al 2015 yu et al 2017 youssef and elshahed 2014 other taxa with elevated abundance at sites with more urban impact included phyllobacteriaceae 5 7 of sequences and sphingomonadaceae 6 13 of sequences phyllobacteriaceae taxa have most commonly been studied with regard to degradation of xenobiotic and recalcitrant compounds such as thiophene bambauer et al 1998 phenols fritsche et al 1999 naphthalenesulfonates ghosh and dam 2009 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid doronina et al 2010 and thiophene 2 carboxylate bambauer et al 1998 likewise sphingomonadaceae are often found in high proportions in habitats contaminated with recalcitrant poly aromatic compounds of natural glaeser et al 2010 rosenberg et al 2013 or anthropogenic origin basta et al 2005 romine et al 1999 sprenger 1993 rosenberg et al 2013 the relative dominance of these two families in downstream sites may reflect increased industrial contaminants present in wwtp effluent as the treatment facilities receive chemicals and other wastes from industrial sources alternatively these taxa may serve as an indicator of the degree of urbanization occurring upstream of these sites as stormwater runoff from street drains enters this stream from a variety of locations other families that were prevalent at downstream sites are not well characterized in terms of their ecological role in aquatic systems including ellin 6077 rb411 chloracidobacteria mb2424 acidobacteria 6 iii1 15 cryomorphaceae and chitinophagaceae taxa within the phylum acidobacteria are known for their resistance to pollutants like petroleum compounds abed et al 2002 p nitrophenol paul et al 2006 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate sánchez peinado et al 2010 and uranium ellis et al 2003 gremion et al 2003 barns et al 2007 whereas bacteroidetes are prevalent in organic rich systems crump and hobbie 2005 huang et al 2008 obernosterer et al 2011 wang et al 2011 therefore the dominance of acidobacteria and bacteroidetes in more urbanized sites may indicate the prevalence of organic wastewater compounds within tinkers creek tertuliani et al 2008 in general the variety of taxa found in high abundance in downstream sites of tinkers creek suggests that effluent from the wwtps plays a strong role in shaping the stream bacterial communities as different contaminants from these wwtps may have different selective forces on community composition in contrast to the more urbanized sites a large percentage 32 of the taxa prevalent in the less urbanized sites tinkers creek 1 and 2 ref 1 and 2 has syntrophic and fermentative lifestyles members of the family sytrophaceae are commonly found in anaerobic freshwater sediments jackson et al 1999 shelton and tiedje 1984 wallrabenstein and schink 1994 and are capable of fermenting substrates that are utilized by h2 formate utilizing partners kuever et al 2005 schink 1997 the desulfobulbaceae syntrophobacteraceae and geobacteraceae are sulfate sulfur reducing bacteria kuever et al 2005 muyzer and stams 2008 and or other metal reducing bacteria holmes et al 2004 2004a 2004b kuever 2005 röling 2014 respectively although mostly known for their ability to utilize sulfur or other metal compounds as their terminal electron acceptors genera in these families have an important role in the anaerobic fermentation oxidation of organic compounds aklujkar et al 2012 reviewed in muyzer and stams 2008 röling 2014 thermodesulfovibrionaceae such as deltaproteobacteria detected in this study are sulfate reducers with chemoorganoheterotrophic or chemolithoheterotrophic lifestyles during chemolithoheterotrophic growth genera of this family use h2 as electron donor and acetate as a carbon source henry et al 1994 additionally crenotrichaceae gammaproteobacteria which was only found in upstream sites of tinkers is a type ib methanotroph group these organisms are facultative aerobes that utilize methane and methanol or other c1 compounds as substrates bowman 2014 stein et al 2012 stoecker et al 2006 when considering the relatively high diversity of fermenters and sulfur sulfate reducing taxa found in the upstream sites and reference streams the microbial communities may be structured by inputs from groundwater and the hyporheic zone griebler and lueders 2009 storey et al 1999 although we lack data on the source of water at the different sites the difference in community composition and the differences in sediment composition with fine sediment at upstream sites and pebbles cobblestones at downstream sites suggests a switch from deep to shallow water flow paths longitudinally thus supporting the notion that local sampling environment can influence the structure of the microbial community within the stream heino et al 2014 cloutier et al 2015 overall the dissimilarities in bacterial community composition among upstream downstream and reference sites reflect otu specific environmental tolerances to local conditions comte et al 2014 comte and del giorgio 2009 newton et al 2011 philippot et al 2010 wang et al 2011 however it is difficult to ascertain how much of these differences are due to site characteristics land use and or physical chemical that differ along the longitudinal gradients in and among these streams and how much is due to dispersal limitations crump et al 1999 astorga et al 2012 lindström and langenheder 2012 interactions among species fortunato and crump 2011 glibert et al 2012 or some combination of the three astorga et al 2012 future work to tease apart the contributions of spatial proximity and shared environmental characteristics will be required nevertheless these results suggest that differences in water chemistry attributable to urban discharge served as a selective force on bacterial taxa in these streams astorga et al 2012 beier et al 2008 mcarthur and richardson 2002 seasonal changes in the dominant sediment bacterial populations were correlated with changes in aqueous physicochemistry across all sites as predicted these results are consistent with previous studies that have discovered shifts in microbial composition linked to seasonal variation of water physicochemical properties duarte et al 2016 moss et al 2006 yannarell et al 2003 and allochthonous inputs dann et al 2017 alterations in stream temperature light penetration organic and inorganic concentrations in the water column and sediments over the annual period may have shaped the changes observed in the community composition of sediment bacteria in these systems distinct groupings of bacterial families became more prominent on particular dates revealing the highly dynamic nature of the bacteria in these streams fall dominant families contained known degraders of recalcitrant litter verrucomicrobia stevenson et al 2004 wymore et al 2016 and humic substances sphingomonadaceae glaeser et al 2010 glaeser and kämpfer 2014 specifically these groups are important for their utilization of humic substances and ability to degrade recalcitrant high molecular weight compounds glaeser et al 2010 wymore et al 2016 suggesting that these organisms play an important role in carbon cycling in our streams spring dominant families belonged to phyla that are often found associated with algae planctomycetes bengtsson and øvreås 2010 bohórquez et al 2017 and microbial mats allen et al 2009 baumgartner et al 2009 or biofilms bacteroidetes bartrons et al 2012 bohórquez et al 2017 during high levels of algal activity taxa within planctomycetes have the ability to degrade sulfated polysaccharides of algal origin kim et al 2016 lage and bondoso 2014 whereas members of bacteroidetes can degrade organic compounds that may be released from algae thus suggesting that they have an ecological role in the degradation of polysaccharides produced by algae in streams alternatively the high prevalence of bacteroidetes and phyllobacteriaceae may indicate a higher prevalence of discharge from wwtps or runoff during the rainy season bambauer et al 1998 drury et al 2013 doronina et al 2010 eichmiller et al 2013 fritsche et al 1999 kämpfer 1999 in comparison summer was dominated by taxa in families that have wide genetic diversity such as comamonadaceae taxa within this group are known denitrifiers adav et al 2010 etchebehere et al 2001 khan et al 2002 wu et al 2013 fermenters chen et al 2013 finneran et al 2003 kim et al 2012 aerobic organotrophs kim et al 2012 liang et al 2011 photoheterotrophs hiraishi et al 1991 madigan et al 2000 and photoautotrophs zeng et al 2012 which suggests that these organisms are involved in a variety of biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems reviewed by willems 2014 it should be noted however that more detailed phylogenetic work needs to be done to link function with phylogeny especially with largely uncultured groups such as verrucomicrobia or for groups with unknown ecologies i e chitinophagaceae however our results suggest that in stream systems seasonal changes allow for different and distinct combinations of bacterial populations to become prominent members of the community at different times of the year gilbert et al 2012 2009 shade et al 2013 portillo et al 2012 although site and date differences were observed in sediment bacterial community composition we did not see any significant differences in functional profiles over space or time functional resilience to disturbance is possible if the microbial community contains individuals that have versatile physiologies evans and hofmann 2012 core communities found in these systems were comprised of families that had a vast network of genera capable of performing a wide array of biogeochemical cycles for example genera in the family comamonadaceae and rhodocateraceae have metabolic capabilities that span a wide variety of cycles such as organotrophs denitrifiers hydrogen oxidizers photoheterotrophs photoautotrophs fermenters fe3 reducers baldani et al 2014 willems 2014 pujalte et al 2014 most genera in these families have an aerobic heterotrophic metabolism but are capable of switching to other metabolic forms depending on the substrate or electron acceptor availability willems 2014 one such group purple nonsulfur bacteria can be heterotrophic under aerobic conditions and phototrophs under anoxic conditions hiraishi and imhoff 2005 pujalte et al 2014 through altering metabolic capabilities meyer et al 2004 swingley et al 2007 or genetic change evans and hofmann 2012 lenski 2017 de meester et al 2016 bacteria can often overcome detrimental environmental change by exploiting previously unavailable resources thus changes in community composition may not correspond with the response or the lack thereof in community functional profiles allison and martiny 2008 alternatively a large fraction of the community may be dormant lennon and jones 2011 which is common among communities living in temporally and spatially dynamic environments lennon and jones 2011 pedrós alió 2006 rehman et al 2010 in fact dormant individuals of bacterial communities directly affect species diversity chesson 2000 by acting as seed banks seed banks can contribute to the stability of ecosystem processes through the facilitation of niche complementation and or functional redundancy loreau et al 2001 petchey and gaston 2002 this can occur as previously dormant groups become more prevalent under certain conditions while functionally complimentary groups or those functionally similar but less tolerant to current environmental conditions revert to dormancy however compensatory growth of these groups may result in minimal change in ecological processes fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 frost et al 1995 schindler 1990 in general the functional attributes of stream sediment bacteria in this study appear to be similar across a board range of land uses suggesting that there is a high degree of functional gene redundancy qu et al 2017 and a reduction of functional diversity cardinale et al 2012 elmqvist et al 2003 jung et al 2016 as such adaptation of local communities to changing environmental patterns can be independent of functional change in communities bier et al 2015 frost et al 1995 fernandez gonzalez et al 2016 östman et al 2010 reiss et al 2009 overall the predicted functional profile of the microbial community as determined by picruste s algorithm provides a coarse overview of the functional potential present within the community however these results must be interpreted with caution rarefaction of pooled dna samples fails to capture the full extent of diversity present within the system which is likely reflected in the predicted functional profile additionally individual functional genes may not necessarily be correlated with community structure fierer et al 2012 as the placement of novel diversity cannot accurately be mapped into a phylogenetic context due to the fact that a large proportion of bacterial phylogeny is poorly identified harris et al 2013 to adequately assess gene categories deeper sequencing would be required fierer et al 2012 picrust can neither preclude or outperform deep metagenomic sequencing langille et al 2013 the algorithm is significantly affected by the phylogenetic dissimilarity among environmental samples and sequenced genomes langille et al 2013 thus we suggest that further studies that utilize both metagenomic sequencing and marker gene studies are needed in this system and that more samples are required to adequately assess intra and inter stream variability 5 conclusion although α diversity was relatively constant both spatially we found that urban drainage impacts bacterial community structure in streams with greater prevalence of bacteria associated with urban discharge in downstream sites in tinkers creek moreover we found evidence for indirect seasonal effects as nutrient and hydrologic characteristics influenced bacterial community assemblage within our streams however there were no spatial or temporal effects on the core community function our results suggest that deterministic forces are important for community assembly and that differences in β diversity between sites and over time are predominantly due to changes in the relative abundance of a core community this work demonstrates that urban drainage has a marked impact on shaping benthic bacterial communities yet these changes seem not to have an impact on sediment bacteria function this suggests that communities in urban environments may be more resilient to disturbance via versatile physiologies and or functional redundancy although there were no changes in the sediment bacteria functional profiles changes in the composition of microbial communities may affect the energy requirements and expenditures of the communities bier et al 2015 cañedo argüelles et al 2014 nieuwdorp et al 2014 de ruiter et al 1995 which in turn may affect the trophic transfer of energy in stream food webs declaration of interest all authors have seen and approved the final version

19713,arsenic contamination in groundwater is a critical issue and one that raises great concern around the world as the cause of many negative health impacts on the human body including internal and external cancers there are many ways to remove or immobilize arsenic including membrane technologies adsorption sand filtration ion exchange and capacitive deionization these exhibit many different advantages and disadvantages among these methods in situ subsurface arsenic immobilization by aeration and the subsequent removal of arsenic from the aqueous phase has shown to be very a promising convenient technology with high treatment efficiency in contrast to most of other as remediation technologies in situ subsurface immobilization offers the advantage of negligible waste production and hence has the potential of being a sustainable treatment option this paper reviews the application of subsurface arsenic removal sar technologies as well as current modeling approaches unlike subsurface iron removal sir which has proven to be technically feasible in a variety of hydrogeochemical settings for many years sar is not yet an established solution since it shows vulnerability to diverse geochemical conditions such as ph fe as ratio and the presence of co ions in some situations this makes it difficult to comply with the stringent guideline value for drinking water recommended by the who 10 μg l 1 in order to overcome its limitations more theoretical and experimental studies are needed to show long term application achievements and help the development of sar processes into state of the art technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords subsurface arsenic removal sar in situ remediation arsenic adsorption aeration arsenic contamination 1 introduction arsenic as is considered to be one of the most serious inorganic contaminants in groundwater and it is recognized as a significant environmental cause of cancer mortality globally martinez et al 2011 van halem et al 2009a who 2011a inorganic arsenic occurs naturally at high levels in groundwater in many countries around the world including mostly south america and southeast asia amini et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2014 in reducing environments arsenic exists in the natural ph range of groundwater primarily as an oxyanion of trivalent arsenite as iii that is neutral in charge h3aso3 in oxidizing environments it exists as pentavalent arsenate as v which is negatively charged h 2 a s o 4 h a s o 4 2 smedley et al 2002 the current limit of arsenic in drinking water recommended by the world health organization who is 10 μg l 1 who 2011b the sources of exposure are drinking water crops irrigated with contaminated water and food prepared with polluted water after long term exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic the first visible symptoms are usually observed in the skin and include pigmentation changes skin lesions and hard patches on the palms and soles of the feet hyperkeratosis generally these occur after a minimum exposure of approximately five years and may be a precursor to skin cancer james et al 2017 who 2012 a variety of ex situ and in situ treatment technologies for arsenic removal from water including immobilization has been implemented over the last two decades ex situ processes include precipitation flocculation ion exchange membrane technologies figoli et al 2016 and adsorption with adsorption technologies using multiple materials being the most common jadhav et al 2015 jain and singh 2012 mondal et al 2013 nicomel et al 2015 singh et al 2015 in situ treatment comprises an array of relatively novel methods typically including technologies such as chemical oxidation arsenic immobilization by sorption and bioremediation techniques including arsenic biotransformation phytostabilization and hyperaccumulation in plants bundschuh et al 2014 xie et al 2015 other alternative in situ technologies permeable reactive barriers prb electrokinetics nanoparticles zero valent iron natural attenuation etc might be suitable for groundwater and or soil treatment as they have the overall advantage of being environmental friendly and less expensive compared with conventional technologies but some disadvantages arise due to the novelty of these technologies and the overall lack of long term experience using these techniques litter et al 2014 table 1 shows an overview of the most common ex situ and in situ arsenic removal techniques and their most prominent advantages and disadvantages fe iii hydr oxides also referred to as amorphous hydrous ferric oxides or hfo are known as the most important arsenic sorption materials due to their high specific surface area and ability to adsorb total as in large capacities it is well known that dissolved fe ii in groundwater that is exposed to air is oxidized to fe iii and subsequently forms sparingly dissolvable hfo appelo and de vet 2003 omoregie et al 2013 welch et al 2008 through this process some part of the total dissolved arsenic is also removed by co precipitation with the oxidized fe through different mechanisms such as surface ionization surface complexation and ligand exchange buamah et al 2008 farrell and chaudhary 2013 van der laan 2009 in ex situ treatment this can be used as pre treatment for e g subsequent membrane filtration schmidt et al 2016 the most salient advantage of the sar process over ex situ and other in situ technologies is its negligible waste production low maintenance costs and simple operation without additives or chemicals making it especially suitable for remote and undeveloped rural areas shan et al 2013 van halem et al 2010a with the potential to become a sustainable long term treatment option it should be noted that arsenic laden water is not eliminated by the sar treatment of arsenic the arsenic is just transferred from a soluble phase to a less readily immobile phase arsenic waste is hereby bound into the aquifer layer and no waste stream is produced for the user in ex situ processes on the other hand toxic sludge and or arsenic laden concentrate streams are produced which may require costly methods for treating and proper disposal for example the disposal of used adsorption media from ex situ processes poses a threat to the environment and specific recommendations for the arsenic waste disposal are often omitted or mentioned as an area for future research therefore the proper disposal and stabilization of arsenic laden waste remains a barrier to the successful and economic implementation of arsenic removal technologies clancy et al 2013 litter et al 2014 on a household level several low cost and easily applicable techniques have been applied using different arsenic removal technologies such as precipitation with aluminum or iron hydroxide flocs and subsequent filtration adsorption on artificial and natural sorbents water softening with lime ion exchange and bioremediation berg et al 2006 pokhrel et al 2009b in aquifers with high ferrous iron concentrations fe ii the arsenic removal by using sand filters is also suitable berg et al 2006 the in situ chemical treatment is also an alternative involving the injection of oxidants into the soil and aquifer kmno4 h2o2 to promote the oxidation of arsenic and coagulants to enhance the sorption and coprecipitation fecl3 litter et al 2014 recently a few studies have also looked into in situ immobilization of arsenic under reducing conditions by forming subsurface fe sulfides coatings kirk et al 2004 omoregie et al 2013 pi et al 2017 the electrolytic oxidation and subsequent removal of arsenic through electrocoagulation has also been studied in detail recently nidheesh and singh 2017 song et al 2017 the purpose of this paper is to review subsurface arsenic removal sar by aeration as a promising in situ technology with the advantage of negligible waste production since the arsenic is kept subsurface in the aquifer furthermore sar technology has proven to be relatively simple and less expensive compared with conventional above ground and ex situ treatment methods to date this technology has been tested within a variety of small and large pilot trials mostly in india and bangladesh in this paper sar technology will be evaluated for its application on a global scale 2 subsurface arsenic removal sar technology based on subsurface iron removal sir subsurface arsenic removal sar is a simple in situ technology that relies on subsurface removal by adsorption and co precipitation with iron hydr oxides through mechanisms such as surface complexation and ligand exchange in europe subsurface iron sir and manganese removal has been successfully used for many decades however subsurface removal of arsenic is a relatively new technique rott et al 2002 the in situ remediation of arsenic is based on the underground precipitation and adsorption onto ferric oxides and consists primarily of three main steps 1 water is extracted from the aquifer and oxygenated via an aeration system 2 the oxygen enriched water is infiltrated back into the aquifer through an infiltration well forming large oxidation zones in the aquifer aqueous fe ii is oxidized to solid fe iii hydroxides fomenting the removal of aqueous arsenic onto into solid phases finally 3 water around the well with low iron and arsenic can be extracted from the aquifer by periodically extracting anoxic groundwater and injecting aerated water into the aquifer through the tube well alternate oxidizing and adsorbing phases of iron and arsenic are induced so that larger water volumes with reduced arsenic levels can be subsequently extracted grischek et al 2015 two types of technological sar systems can be differentiated 1 one or two wells being operated alternately by injection extraction for small scale application and 2 extraction well surrounded by infiltration wells for large scale application fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of a typical sar unit consisting of an aeration system with storage tank and one tube well for the infiltration and the extraction of the groundwater under natural reducing conditions of an aquifer eh 0 iron ii manganese ii and arsenic iii can be found in dissolved form with the input of oxygen during the infiltration oxidation phase fig 1 left the redox potential of the aquifer increases eh 0 and aqueous fe ii will be oxidized to solid iron hydroxide the oxidation of manganese takes place after iron ii oxidation is completed in the course of time solid iron and manganese oxidation products will build up a coating around the soil grains in groundwater enhancing adsorptive places henning and rott 2003 during the adsorption or delivery phase fig 1 right contaminated groundwater flows through the formed adsorption zones where iron manganese and arsenic species can be adsorbed and then co precipitated through different mechanisms when more water is extracted dissolved fe ii is adsorbed onto the fe iii coated soil grains jeon et al 2003 the adsorbed fe ii will be oxidized during the next oxidation phase resulting in an enhanced adsorptive surface area of hfo which has the ability to adsorb both as iii dzombak and morel 1990 and as v suthersan et al 2017 the main chemical oxidation reactions occurring can be written as 1 2fe 2 ½o 2 x 2 h 2 o fe 2 o 3 xh 2 o 4h 2 2fe 2 ½o 2 3h 2 o 2feo oh 4h 3 mn 2 ½o 2 h 2 o mno 2 2h 4 h 3 a s o 3 1 2 o 2 h 2 a s o 4 h in general the oxidation of mn2 requires a redox potential eh 800 mv as shown in fig 2 which is higher than those needed for the oxidation of iron hence oxidation of manganese takes place after the oxidation of iron kim and nriagu 2000 despite the lower redox potential compared to fe and mn required for the oxidation of as iii to as v fig 2 oxidation by oxygen in water occurs very slowly making it generally not relevant for in situ as removal some studies e g kim and nriagu 2000 showed that the half lifetime of naturally occurring as iii was four to nine days when saturated with air and two to five days with pure oxygen however the oxidation process can be accelerated for example by the presence of manganese oxides mno2 which act under various conditions as a solid oxidizing media for both as iii as shown in eq 5 and fe ii driehaus et al 1995 wu et al 2015 5 m n o 2 h 3 a s o 3 m n 2 h a s o 4 2 h 2 o this process contributes to the abiotic as iii oxidation what on the one side reduces the concentrations of the more toxic arsenite species compared to arsenate on the other side the formation of manganese oxides also enhances the immobilization of as v by sorption onto fe oxides and its precipitation as manganese arsenate compounds cheng et al 2008 huang and kretzschmar 2010 nitzsche et al 2015b if ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 methane ch4 or other oxygen demanding substances are present in the groundwater the economic efficiency of the sar process can be significantly lowered as more oxygen needs to be delivered by the system the oxidation of nh4 to nitrate no3 over no2 can be summarized according to following equation 6 n h 4 2 o 2 n o 3 h 2 o 2 h although the oxidation processes occurring in the groundwater are both chemical and microbial driven mn oxidation does not occur in the presence of nh4 and no2 the chemical oxidation of mn2 by oxygen at neutral ph is rather slow as it occurs optimally at a very high redox potential cf fig 2 so that microbial catalysis is needed for the effective manganese removal with sar farnsworth et al 2012 nitzsche et al 2015a however the oxidation of n h 4 and no2 through nitrification is energetically more favorable than mn oxidation so that manganese removal through sar will take place only after ammonium is completely oxidized gouzinis et al 1998 nitzsche et al 2015b vandenabeele et al 1995 furthermore processes with high oxygen demand such as the oxidation of ammonium or methane can lower the oxygen availability and thus slow the microbial activity for the manganese oxidation it is therefore important to assess the quality of the raw water for each sar application i e when nh4 might be present nonetheless the successful removal of both manganese in the presence of ammonium has been observed in different case studies kellner et al 2016 rott et al 2002 it must also be considered that seasonal fluctuations in the concentrations of ammonium might occur in places close to surface water sources this indicates that the interaction between groundwater and surface waters have an effect on redox conditions throughout seasonal changes which might have an impact on the sar process throughout the year richards et al 2017 changes in redox potential also have an influence on arsenic remobilization in the aquifer due to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides the key factors controlling this process are still poorly understood zhang et al 2017b the transformation of the fe oxides under reducing conditions is presumably controlled by biochemical processes and may cause pronounced changes in the as adsorption potential over time neidhardt et al 2014 generally the transformation of less crystalline phases into more crystalline ones increases the potential for arsenic mobilization and it can occur spontaneously or can be driven by changing redox conditions campbell and nordstrom 2014 reductive conditions within the aquifer can be caused by the biogenic decomposition of buried organic material and leads to the microbial reduction of iron hydr oxides and the subsequent release of the adsorbed arsenic berg et al 2007 2001 frising 2014 zhang et al 2017a however adsorbed arsenic can also retard or inhibit the transformation of ferrihydrites by blocking surface sites and thus preventing its reductive dissolution and recrystallization stabilizing the less crystalline phases with higher adsorptive capacity campbell and nordstrom 2014 unstable redox conditions may also increase the remobilization of arsenic so that maintaining controlled redox conditions is crucial to avoid the long term arsenic mobility bissacot and ciminelli 2014 overall the long term study of the adsorption desorption process on the sediment surface is a key aspect needed for the understanding of the migration and transformation of arsenic zhang et al 2017b besides redox condition the chemical stability over time of the different mineral complexes and desorption kinetics of arsenic are affected by various geochemical factors including most importantly ph natural organic matter content and microbial oxidation reactions datta et al 2014 leiva et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b studies also show the effect of surface site competition e g hco3 phosphates silicates etc gao et al 2013 jeon et al 2003 kanematsu et al 2013 norrman et al 2008 thi hoa mai et al 2014 on arsenic mobilization the type of mineral deposits plays also an important role iron iii arsenate minerals e g scorodite eq 7 shows a release of as under acidic and reducing conditions whereas the stability of fe s as minerals e g arsenopyrite is favored for example in reduced aquifers ciminelli 2014 at higher ph other mechanisms might contribute to as release for example from desorption from iron hydr oxides coatings and dissolution of arsenopyrite bia et al 2014 ciminelli 2014 under most natural ph conditions in groundwater as v adsorbs more strongly on fe iii hydr oxides than as iii pierce and moore 1982 the dominant mechanism for the proposed arsenic removal is an adsorption oxidation reaction non ionic arsenite as iii can be adsorbed by hfo through lewis acid base interactions whereas ionic arsenate as v is adsorbed by both lewis acid base and coulombic electrostatic interactions huling et al 2017 at lower ph conditions where amphoteric hfo is positively charged and hence can be more readily adsorbed suthersan et al 2017 thus arsenite has a weaker adsorption on mineral phases as it is uncharged below ph 9 2 ladeira and ciminelli 2004 yet some studies state that process regarding adsorption onto iron minerals are much more complex dixit and hering 2003 and that adsorbed arsenite can oxidize in a variety of minerals and natural soils campbell and nordstrom 2014 the primary mechanism for removal of as v and as iii from groundwater is likely to be the adsorption by oxidized sediments containing fe iii stollenwerk et al 2007 arsenate can react with fe oh 3 to feaso4 as shown in eq 7 7 fe oh 3 h 3 aso 4 feaso 4 2h 2 o h 2 o the strongest adsorption of both arsenic species on the iron oxides is formed via inner sphere complexation through direct coordination with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of hfos cheng et al 2008 loring et al 2009 mainly by way of monodentate mononuclear complex as well as bidentate complexes with lower adsorption rate through ligand exchange grossl et al 1997 yoon et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 besides the oxidation state of as adsorption efficiency also depends on other solutes that compete with as for adsorption sites through similar mechanisms phosphate bicarbonate and silicate have similar strong ligand properties to arsenate and arsenite and can compete with arsenic through lewis acid base interactions for the adsorption on iron stollenwerk et al 2003 suthersan et al 2017 the decreasing arsenic removal efficiency by these ions is also linked to the sequestering properties that hinder the formation of ferric iii hydroxide from fe ii furthermore the effects of competing anions on the as iii removal in oxidation adsorption processes have been proven to have a strong dependence on ph changes showing higher competitive adsorption with increasing ph values guan et al 2009 2 1 operational aspects of sar technology sar technology bases on the periodically alternating cycles but continuously long term infiltration of oxygen enriched water into the aquifer to ensure a permanent state of oxidation adsorption zones the continuous interchange between infiltration and abstraction phases allows the adsorption to take place while oxidation zones are formed once an oxidation zone is developed more water can be safely extracted here the volumetric ratio determines the efficiency of the mitigation system van halem et al 2010a the efficiency qe of the sar process is expressed either as the ratio of extracted to injected water volume ve vi or by the ratio ve vi ve for example if the extracted volume is twice as large as the injected volume then ve vi 2 and ve vi ve 0 5 higher volumetric coefficients ve vi may affect the stability of the oxidation zones these may also decay as a result of disturbances during the process what will result in higher concentration of iron hydr oxides near the extraction zone of the well and narrowed adsorption zones for mn ii the oxidation species e g manganese oxides can then be reduced and a mobilization may occur it is therefore important that oxidation conditions achieved in the aquifer are kept even in the long term and that the volumetric coefficient is not exceeded the remobilization of arsenic after the adsorption onto hfos is furthermore a potential risk of the process however the process kinetics of the remobilization have not yet been quantified or studied in detail nevertheless long time experience with sir has showed that formed iron oxides are very stable with time and have a much higher density than freshly build flocks regarding the blocking of the well and or the aquifer it is proven that in situ process by aeration prolongs the life expectancy of the wells grischek et al 2015 the precipitated iron and manganese accumulate in the aquifer and favor the adsorption of dissolved iron and manganese by providing more surface areas zhang et al 2017b with time iron and manganese are removed more effectively from the aqueous phase however the proper development of precipitation zones is very important to achieve higher removal efficiencies which may take up to ten or more injection cycles tredoux et al 2004 the precipitation of iron and manganese only occurs when the equilibrium is displaced towards the oxidative side through the addition of oxygen enriched water the large pore volume provided by the reaction zone in the underground around the well and underneath favors the precipitation of iron ahmad 2012 also when operated properly and continuously the tube well used for abstraction and infiltration cycles will be permanently protected by the oxygenated water front which effectively blocks the transport of reduced iron and manganese to the borehole and prevents the clogging of pumping equipment and screens with time the precipitated iron may settle to more stable forms e g hematite which have a smaller volume than the first formed hydrated oxides e g ferrihydrite tredoux et al 2004 precipitates of iron and manganese show also the smallest size in a coarse aquifer by the proper development of the oxygenation zone and operation of the plant the loss of pore volume in the aquifer happens only slowly and its permeability is not be reduced even after many years so that no long term risks of clogging of the aquifer is expected mettler et al 2001 other important hydrological requirements for the safe operation of the sar include the type of aquifer porous aquifers with high specific surface values like sand or gravel layers are well suitable whereas clay and marl aquifers are not appropriate furthermore the influence of natural flow of groundwater needs to be considered hereby a raw water analysis to estimate operational cycle duration and infiltration to abstraction ratios must be carried out before starting any pilot trials a proper construction and safe sealing of boreholes and wells to prevent negative influences on the aquifer e g by surface water infiltration is highly important grischek et al 2015 the subsurface iron and arsenic removal has been investigated in different studies a distinction is drawn between two types of sar approaches one without using any addition of chemicals injecting only aerated natural groundwater and one which besides aeration also doses dissolved fe iii since the removal of arsenic requires a higher concentration of fe than of as the latter approach has been applied in grounds where iron is naturally too low nevertheless the most common type of sar makes use of high natural fe levels both approaches are considered in the following sections 2 2 subsurface arsenic removal sar technology by dosing fe and aerated water welch et al 2008 studied subsurface arsenic removal with a combination of aerated water and the injection of ferric chloride in two wells with depths of 30 m in carson valley nv usa arsenic concentrations in groundwater beneath carson valley in western usa typically exceeded the 10 μg l 1 drinking water standard with concentrations of around 30 36 μg l 1 the groundwater was typically alkaline ph 8 and had dissolved fe concentrations lower than a few tens of μg l 1 both wells had similar total as concentrations however one aquifer had high concentrations of as iii and the other contained mostly as v during the pilot trials the following chemical and physical processes were applied 1 injection of cl2 which oxidized as iii to as v during a reaction time of about 7 min 2 cl2 subtraction to prevent formation of undesirable disinfection by products in the aquifers 3 injection of dissolved o2 and fe ii to form fe oxide in the aquifer and hcl to lower the ph 4 outgassing of co2 the fe ii concentration in the injection water ranged between 0 15 and 6 35 mg l 1 and the ph was 5 3 6 4 by setting the flow rate about 120 l h 1 the injected water volume was 790 2880 l and the extracted volume was 1340 3900 l which amounted to a sar efficiency qe of up to 0 6 the time between the end of injection and the beginning of withdrawal was generally about 1 h after conducting several trials the extracted water achieved as levels as low as 1 and 6 μg l 1 however during some withdrawal periods fe and mn concentrations exceeded u s secondary drinking water standards 0 3 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively u s epa 2012 the authors concluded that the evaluation of optimum design parameters needs further investigation miller 2008 combined the pulsed injection of aerated water and ferrous iron to remove as v the pilot trials were conducted at the san antonio field laboratory safl located in a valley fill aquifer in central new mexico the testing was successful in reducing ambient arsenic concentrations 38 42 μg l 1 and iron concentration 0 189 mg l 1 to below the drinking water standard by multiple daily injections of air and iron in short duration pulses the investigation was able to show a clear trend towards lower arsenic concentrations only after the addition of iron an incremental increase in arsenic removal capability was achieved at the site some difficulties were caused by iron pre oxidation in the apparatus which should be reduced to better control the amount of iron injected for the same effect chen and leung 2016 proposed an in situ technique using injection of ferric iron and a naoh solution to force the precipitation iron and the arsenic co precipitation first the ferric iron solution and naoh were injected into a well with arsenic contamination the ferric iron hydrolyzed and precipitated as amorphous ferric hydroxide hfo in the local aquifer surrounding the well arsenite and arsenate could be then intercepted and sorbed onto hfo in the adsorption zone although the technology was proven to be feasible the major drawback of this approach was the injection of chemicals into the aquifer that may cause unexpected biochemical and geochemical effects in the subsurface system with unknown long term consequences krüger et al 2014 conducted pilot trials on in situ immobilization of arsenical chemical warfare agents cwa at a contaminated military site in northern germany the site showed concentrations of cwa containing arsenic ranging from 30 μg l 1 up to 9 0 mg l 1 arithmetic mean 2 4 mg as l 1 cwa showcased arsenic mainly in organic form as phenylized as compounds the proportion of inorganic as iii and as v in total as ranged from 6 to 87 two remediation wells depth 15 and 19 m were installed for pumping and infiltration total arsenic was measured to 1 3 and 2 5 mg l 1 respectively krüger et al 2014 showed that organic arsenic compounds from cwa could be precipitated by adding different fe ii compounds fecl2 and feso4 showed the best removal efficiency of total as of about 80 the treatment unit consisted of three 500 l tanks aeration tank degassing tank and buffer tank the water was infiltrated in cycles each one consisting of four steps 1 infiltration of fe ii cl2 dissolved in water up to 118 g l 1 stripped with n2 in order to decrease dissolved oxygen do concentration 2 infiltration of dissolved fe into the aquifer 3 infiltration of aerated water to induce oxidation of fe and precipitation of hfo and 4 infiltration of untreated water for dilution in order to reduce the risk of clogging the well it was demonstrated that total as could be reduced to less than 0 4 mg l 1 with the main advantage that no contaminated sludge or adsorption material had to be disposed of however the main challenge here was the clogging problem due to the precipitation of hfo in the screen of the well furthermore the authors mentioned that this remediation technique could also be used to treat groundwater with naturally occurring as in order to produce drinking water 2 3 subsurface arsenic removal sar technology by only dosing aerated water the first pilot trials using sar were conducted in the 1990s by rott et al 1996 in germany with groundwater characterized by anoxic conditions and high values of fe ii mn and as which occurred mainly in its trivalent form the trials 26 cycles were carried out with two wells of 30 and 50 m depth with total as of 38 and 25 μg l 1 respectively as iii 24 and 25 μg l 1 fe 1 97 and 0 29 mg l 1 mn 0 35 and 0 29 mg l 1 after running six cycles water in both wells reached values in compliance with the german drinking water standard regarding iron 0 2 mg l 1 trinkwv 1990 however only the first well provided good drinking water quality with regard to mn 0 05 mg l 1 and as 10 μg l 1 this well could be operated up to a water volume efficiency of qe 0 75 whereas the qe of the second well was limited to 0 5 throughout the four month trials more than 30 000 m3 treated water were extracted the limited removal efficiency of the second well was explained by strong inhomogeneities in the aquifer that resulted in an insufficient formation of an oxidation zone in the aquifer van halem et al 2010a studied iron and arsenic removal as a low cost technology for community based water supply in bangladesh two wells in manikganj district west of dhaka were selected as test grounds for the study both sites showed the same total dissolved arsenic concentration 145 μg l 1 with an as iii fraction of around 82 85 and higher concentrations of iron 1 0 15 mg l 1 and manganese 2 5 0 3 mg l 1 the pilot set up was connected to the existing hand pump of an existing tube well with 31 m depth and perforated well length of 3 m the extracted groundwater was aerated sand filtered and passed through an adsorptive arsenic filter the maximum injection volume was limited to 1 m3 treated water reached as levels of 10 μg l 1 and iron bdl the study was conducted by varying the ratio between abstracted and injected water volume as it is the volumetric ratio that determines the efficiency of the system typically abstraction started 12 16 h after injection results showed a much faster rising of arsenic concentrations than of iron concentrations in the second well however several cycles were needed to achieve effective removal of iron and arsenic the comparison indicated that the occurrence of a high iron level in the groundwater did not promote the effective co removal of arsenic during subsurface treatment since both wells showed similar breakthrough curves for arsenic at the same volumetric ratio of abstracted and injected volumes furthermore the authors concluded that injection of oxygen at higher concentrations 1 5 3 mg o2 l 1 promoted the subsurface removal of iron however the better retention of iron did not enhance the co removal of arsenic subsurface iron removal increased with every successive cycle so that the ratio of abstracted to injected volume would rise on the other hand arsenic removal efficiency was not sufficient and a breakthrough of 10 μg l 1 was observed before a volume ratio abstracted to injected of 1 was reached this was attributed to the short contact times 20 min within the oxidation zone and the presence of competing anions such as phosphates as it has previously been discussed in section 2 van halem et al 2010b also conducted anoxic column experiments with natural groundwater to simulate the shifting redox conditions in the oxidation zone during subsurface iron and arsenic removal the column experiments provided controlled conditions for the investigation of the adsorptive catalytic oxidation mechanism by spiking the water with as iii the operational mode of injection abstraction at the test facility was simulated in the 2d plug flow environment of the columns with down flow 1 0 l h 1 for both injection and abstraction the water samples showed average ph of 7 1 almost constant temperature of 12 c iron concentrations of 5 3 mg l 1 manganese concentrations of 0 61 mg l 1 and phosphate concentrations of 1 13 mg l 1 in the column experiments as iii was dosed at different concentrations 232 112 and 67 μg l 1 in order to study the effect of changing the fe as ratio in groundwater on the adsorptive removal efficiency of arsenic iron concentrations in the groundwater remained constant thus the respective fe as ratios were 28 63 and 103 for the testing oxygen rich 8 9 mg l 1 drinking water was dosed to the columns for 1 5 pore volume transparent pvc length 80 cm inner diameter 36 mm after a waiting period of 16 h the columns were re started with natural groundwater and monitored for the retardation of arsenic and iron it was assumed that as in the subsurface process homogeneous oxidation and precipitation were extremely limited as were heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption processes hence the mechanism of adsorptive catalytic oxidation dominated the efficiency of subsurface iron removal van halem et al 2010b was much higher than could be explained by the adsorptive catalytic oxidation in the column experiments hence other processes e g biotic or transport mechanisms must contribute to the iron removal efficiency of the system it was shown that arsenic adsorption during subsurface treatment was controlled by the amount of adsorbed oxidized iron and not by the amount of removed iron this was significant for the operation of the process since it became apparent that the oxygen concentration of the injection water did not control the arsenic removal but rather the injection volume van halem et al 2010b also found no relation between the amount of removed arsenic and the fe as ratio of the groundwater rather the authors suggested that the removal of arsenic was limited by competing ions such as phosphate van halem et al 2009b compared subsurface adsorption mechanisms with adsorption treatment technologies using iron hydr oxide media which is a popular low cost technique iron precipitates from sir plants have been characterized in previous research to contain mainly goethite feo oh 50 100 as well as traces of ferrihydrites the latter is also called amorphous iron oxide or hydrous ferric oxide hfo with time hfo transforms into stable iron oxides like goethite which is one of the most stable ferric oxides this process is considered the main reason why iron precipitates do not clog the subsurface pores since the volume of amorphous hfo is reduced by the crystallization processes the oxidation process of as iii to as v in the presence of oxygen was slow and took several days research also showed that remobilization of adsorbed arsenic occurred stepwise and slowly and that the efficiency of arsenic adsorption on iron oxides depended on the ph and presence of interfering anions such as phosphate with increasing ph the adsorption of as v decreased whereas the adsorption of as iii showed a maximum around neutral ph hsia et al 1994 pierce and moore 1982 furthermore the adsorption of as v was reduced by half when phosphate was present at ph 7 and a ratio of po4 3 as of 10 the observed effect of phosphate concurs with their previous studies van halem et al 2010a 2010b gude et al 2016 investigated the natural arsenic removal capacity at three groundwater treatment plants in the netherlands with arsenic levels of 10 26 μg l 1 in order to identify operational parameters to obtain as concentrations 1 μg l 1 groundwater treatment in the netherlands usually comprises aeration and subsequent sand filtration without using any chemicals gude et al investigated the interaction between as fe po4 3 mn and nh4 after aeration and during rapid filtration in the natural groundwater matrix they showed that as iii was not efficiently removed in the supernatant water after aeration even after extending residence time 12 4 13 9 min despite the fact that all fe ii was precipitated into filterable hfo flocs most naturally occurring as iii remained mobile achieving only 20 48 removal with 1 4 4 2 mg l 1 precipitated fe ii however added as v was readily adsorbed moreover it was shown that the improved as iii removal from the aerated supernatant water occurred in the rapid sand filter also after 60 min residence time this was credited to the accumulation of manganese on the sand filter grains which lead to the catalytic oxidation of as iii by manganese oxides and the readily adsorption of oxidized as v onto hfo flocs nitzsche et al 2015b this improved removal efficiency by the filter bed was not observed for p o 4 3 however n h 4 and mn which showed no removal in the supernatant water were completely removed by the sand filter bed n h 4 removal was attributed to biological activity in the filter bed nitrification reaction while the mn oxidation could have been both biotic and abiotic sen gupta et al 2009 conducted a study in kasimpore 25 km from kolkata india the main sources of water for the village were shallow and tube wells preliminary studies revealed that 70 of the tube wells had arsenic concentrations above 50 μg l 1 plastic shower heads were used to oxygenate the water to do levels up to 6 mg l 1 by spraying it in a plastic tank in certain operating sequences delivery rest infiltration the typical aerated water infiltration and extraction volumes were 2000 l and 4000 l respectively with flow rate at around 2 7 m3 h 1 an as level of below 10 μg l 1 in the extracted water could be achieved finally the operation cost was estimated at usd 1 0 per day for producing 2000 l of extracted water the results have been documented in a report sen gupta 2008 for the different pilot trials of six plants in rural locations in west bengal india in a project financed by the world bank all plants were managed by local water users and supplied water to the local population the results showed that the sar process was able to reduce the total arsenic content from 150 to 300 μg l 1 to below 50 μg l 1 with a capacity of 3 4 m3 per cycle at efficiency qe of 0 33 0 5 although no concentrations below the who standard of 10 μg l 1 were achieved the results show that the sar process is a feasible arsenic removal technique suitable as a low cost treatment however the authors didn t provide further information regarding iron concentrations or other raw water parameters which can explain the high efficiency results regardless both high recovery rates and still relative lower oxygen concentrations rott and kauffmann 2008 carried out a field test using sar in kashimpur a rural community in west bengal india the in situ treatment plant was operated manually at a well with 37 m depth alternately draining and infiltrating into the same well the low cost aeration occurred by passing the groundwater through three shower heads and storing in a tank before infiltration during the first period 4 m3 were delivered and 2 m3 were infiltrated the cycles during the first phase consisted of 80 min delivery 30 min intermission and 40 min infiltration adding up to a total time of 2 5 h in a subsequent second phase the volume of infiltration was increased to 6 m3 extending the cycle time to 7 h in total after having run the sar system for about 16 months a significant drop of the initial arsenic concentrations of 150 300 μg l 1 in the delivery water was observed and stable concentrations below 10 μg l 1 were achieved after 19 months operation this decrease could be explained by the fact that during the field trial traces of iron accumulated in the oxidation zone at a particular time there was enough iron present to make higher arsenic removal possible rahman et al 2014 analyzed the subsurface arsenic removal in two wells approx 22 m depth at muradnagar upazila comilla district bangladesh with as concentration of around 200 μg l 1 and fe level of 12 6 and 8 7 mg l 1 respectively larger injection volume lower pumping rate and intermittent pumping had positive effects on arsenic removal indicating that arsenic adsorption was kinetically limited after injecting 1 m3 of aerated water a maximum of 3 m3 of water with as 50 μg l 1 was extracted of which 2 m3 were used for drinking in compliance with bangladesh mcl of 50 μg l 1 and the remainder was used for re injection besides pumping rate and injection volume the ph of the water played a major role the ph of injection water was always above 8 whereas the ph of extraction water always started below 8 which was attributed to formation of h ions due to fe ii oxidation see eq 1 2 the results also showed that higher ph was essential for better as adsorption on hfo which increased up to a ph value of 8 5 but decreased above this value kartinen and martin 1995 the cost for 1 m3 treated water was estimated at usd 2 0 sarkar and rahman 2001 carried out sar trials with groundwater at maijdee area bangladesh with three shallow tube wells screen depth 10 12 m the iron and arsenic levels were measured as 1 0 2 4 1 0 mg l 1 and 0 11 0 52 and 1 3 mg l 1 correspondingly 500 l aerated water were re injected after 12 h 3 m3 were extracted they were able to reduce the arsenic level by 50 up to an extraction of 2 5 m3 however only the treated water from the tube well with an as level of 0 11 mg l 1 could comply with the bangladeshi mcl of 50 μg l 1 the rather low as reduction was mainly attributed to the relatively low level of dissolved oxygen in the aerated water 5 mg l 1 monitoring of the injected and pumped water was therefore suggested furthermore sarkar and rahman 2001 also recommended having an iron content 10 times higher than the arsenic level for increasing sar potential the influence of dissolved oxygen in the infiltrated water is in agreement with van halem et al 2010a and was also shown in a study of visoottiviseth and ahmed 2008 the study revealed that the in situ oxidation method was able to meet the bangladesh standard of 50 μg l 1 when the arsenic level in the groundwater was less than 100 μg l 1 treatment efficiency improved if the dissolved oxygen level of recharge water or the quantity of recharge water in the aquifer increased brunsting and mcbean 2014 used a solution with constant iron and arsenic concentration 5 3 mg l 1 and 200 μg l 1 under anoxic conditions to study key factors of the sar process ahead of possible field tests fe and as salts were dissolved in water with do less than 0 05 mg l 1 oxygen removal by nitrogen gas sparging in order to mimic the anoxic groundwater of bangladesh the model water was then aerated and passed through a simple sand filter l 2 m d 0 5 m with the exception of initial trials all experiments were conducted with as v at a hrt of 13 h the maximum removal of arsenic was 79 at a local point in the apparatus while a total removal of 59 between inlet and outlet was observed in addition brunsting and mcbean 2014 examined characteristics of iron and arsenic co precipitation in a simplified environment by conducting a lab scale jar test with short time vigorous aeration and subsequent settling and sampling of supernatant solution after the 5 day experimental period fe concentration dropped by only 5 whereas the as level dropped by 77 the low fe reduction was attributed to the lower ph at the end of the experimental period on the other hand this shows that a relatively small drop in iron has a large effect on the arsenic removal hence a large removal rate was achieved at an fe as mass ratio of 1 5 molar removal ratio of 2 0 they confirmed co precipitation as the main removal mechanism since 37 of the removed as could be re mobilized into the solution after five days by vigorous stirring in order to get an overview of the different trial tests on subsurface removal of arsenic by aeration a comparison of the several different case studies and investigations is shown in table 2 here the most important parameters that play a role in the subsurface arsenic removal are shown besides the concentration of arsenic and iron these are the concentration of important co ions and efficiency ratio of extracted to injected volume qe ve vi the overall removal efficiency achieved throughout the trials to reduce arsenic concentrations to below 10 μg l 1 was realised only by some of the studies as mostly only the limit standard value of 50 μg l 1 was achieved the complexity of the different parameters and surrounding conditions makes a direct comparison between studies difficult although there is no clear tendency of influencing factors for the efficiency of sar e g iron arsenic ratio concentrations of competing ions the better results tend to be achieved only in trials where the extraction efficiency qe ve vi was kept low furthermore experiments carried out with lower oxygenation rates showed poorer results sarkar and rahman 2001 2 4 modeling of sar technology computer models are necessary to assess potential sar processes based on specific local conditions some studies have aimed to develop a general tool to determine which hydrogeochemical processes are responsible for the im mobilization of arsenic in the subsurface during sar with the aim of predicting sar performances at different locations appelo and de vet 2003 simulated an in situ iron and arsenic removal project in the netherlands by using a reactive transport model rtm in order to study concentration changes of ch4 nh4 mn2 fe2 po4 3 and as they interpreted data from the groundwater pumping station schuwacht of hydron zh gouda the netherlands where the water quality was monitored for the first seven cycles of in situ iron removal in this study the injection volumes started at 30 m3 h 1 for 2 days and reduced to 23 m3 h 1 for 40 days the maximum groundwater total as concentration at their site was only 14 μg l 1 which was significantly lower than typical as levels in india bangladesh and south east asia they explained the principles of in situ iron removal from groundwater in simple terms based on the reaction of sorbed ferrous iron in the aquifer the modeling was based on cation exchange in groundwater a multicomponent process in which all the solute cations participated the sorption reactions were calculated with the geochemical model phreeqc 2 which included databases with representative values of the cation exchange constants parkhurst and appelo 1999 the efficiency of the process was calculated by neglecting dispersion and by limiting the sorption reactions to the zone where oxygen had penetrated the concentration pattern of the elements ch4 n h 4 mn2 fe2 and p o 4 3 could be modeled well with known equations their retardation increased in successive cycles due to sorption to the iron oxyhydroxide which was precipitated in the previous cycles the modeled pattern generally showed the observed concentration trends but it did not match the spike details particularly at the beginning of the pilot trials the modeling demonstrated that arsenite was much less sorbed than arsenate in groundwater without phosphate however in the presence of po4 3 the sorption of arsenate decreased to a small amount 2 mol adsorbed l 1 mol solute l 1 due to negative charging of the hfo surface after phosphate adsorption the effect was greater for arsenate than for arsenite because arsenate was sorbed as a negative species while arsenite forms a neutral surface complex appelo and de vet 2003 rahman et al 2015 developed a one dimensional radially symmetric reactive transport model in phreeqc to model key hydrogeochemical reactions during the sar operation oxidation of fe ii and as iii was modeled using kinetic rate expressions that were not considered in the work of appelo and de vet 2003 cation exchange precipitation of hfo and surface complexation were modeled as equilibrium processes the reactive transport model was developed for an sar well that was located in a holocene reduced aquifer system in muradnagar upazila a sub district in comilla bangladesh the reactive transport model was subsequently applied to two other sar wells in bangladesh without further calibration during the pilot phase 5 m3 of aerated water was injected and around 20 m3 of groundwater was extracted in the first half of the trial the groundwater marked a total as level of 201 μg l 1 162 μg l 1 as iii and 69 μg l 1 as v and a fe level of 8 6 mg l 1 same well as in rahman et al 2014 generally they included the following processes in the models for the injection storage and extraction phases processes during injection and storage phases rahman et al 2015 oxidation processes during injection oxidation of dissolved fe ii creates a hfo filter or curtain in the subsurface van halem et al 2010a simultaneously oxidation of as iii to as v and of soil organic matter forming alkalinity not included in the model may occur iron desorption during injection fe ii desorbs from clay and soil surfaces via cation exchange reactions and via surface complexation reactions on hfo wallis et al 2010 sorption reactions during the storage phase as iii as v fe hco3 po4 3 si and to a lesser degree other ions sorb via surface complexation reactions to initially present and newly formed hfo wallis et al 2010 2011 processes during extraction phase rahman et al 2015 sorption reactions the hfo curtain filters out as and other ions until the maximum capacity is reached and arsenic breakthrough occurs appelo and de vet 2003 competitive sorption processes when native groundwater flows towards the sar well during the extraction phases other ions such as fe ii h c o 3 p o 4 3 and silicate sorb at the same time with as iii and as v this simultaneous sorption limits the removal of as during extraction fe ii also sorbs to the cation exchanger clay minerals and organic matter via cation exchange reactions the authors summarized that their model gave reasonable results for measured concentrations of as fe ii mn ii si mg na and k in the extracted water of the studied sar well therefore they concluded that the key processes taking place were modeled correctly using their theoretical approach the as removal during sar operation was improved by high ph and fe levels in the injection water as well as multiple injection extraction cycles of an equal water volume particularly co2 degassing during aeration resulted in higher ph of injection water and therefore increased the as sorption oxidation of as iii during sar operation further contributed to better removal since as v is preferentially removed from the water the surface complexation modeling recorded that simultaneous sorption of h4sio4 particularly is an important factor for limiting as removal during sar the model was also successfully applied to simulate subsurface as removal at two other subsurface wells in bangladesh and it was pointed out that the general trend of the model is to underestimate sar performance regarding as removal which gives a conservative estimate from a practical point of view however so far the model is limited to locations with similar aquifer characteristics to the two wells studied in bangladesh i e similar hydrogeochemical conditions the model still needs to be generalized in order to also simulate sar performance of other wells with different aquifer characteristics worldwide this overview shows some of the advances made for the modeling of such complex systems however the multi component effects occurring in natural environments still need to be verified future multiphase multi species and reactive kinetic transport modeling is needed which also considers modeling of coupled redox systems and conversions between different species of the same element in particular of as fe mn n p o organic matter also soluble complexes and the modeling of biological activity and bacteria triggered geochemical reactions such has not been considered so far in the model by rahman et al 2015 which modeled cation exchange precipitation of hfo and surface complexation as equilibrium processes nonetheless this modeling included oxidation of fe ii and as iii using kinetic rate expressions that were not considered in the work of appelo and de vet 2003 3 conclusion a variety of pilot scale trials on subsurface arsenic removal sar by aeration have been conducted mostly in bangladesh and india unlike subsurface iron removal sir which has been proven for many years as technically feasible they have shown that sar is not yet an established solution since it shows vulnerability to diverse geochemical conditions e g ph and fe as ratio high concentrations of co ions e g phosphates carbonates silicates can also significantly reduce the arsenic removal rate due to similar adsorption mechanisms however the who limit 10 μg l 1 can be reached with proper injection water volumes and sufficient cycle times the addition of fe ii is an alternative for the in situ treatment of arsenic that showed improvement on the arsenic removal efficiency nonetheless sar technologies offer the major advantage of negligible waste production and hence the potential of being the only sustainable long term treatment option currently available 4 future prospects and recommendations for better understanding of sar processes further studies through pilot trials to obtain long term experiences are necessary the most important aspects for the proper technical operation of a sar process must include 1 an efficient aeration system to ensure complete air saturation in infiltration water 2 controlled infiltration and abstraction volumes to avoid breakthrough of arsenic 3 a guarantee of the continuous long term infiltration of oxygen into the aquifer so that oxidation conditions remain and leaching or breakthrough is prevented before starting any pilot trials the injected to extraction ratio must be determined from a thorough groundwater analysis this should consider not only iron arsenic and manganese but also oxygen consuming agents ammonia methane and competitive ions phosphates silicates etc for better understanding long term experimental trials are mandatory and special focus must be given to the arsenic to iron ratio ph and redox conditions redox measurements in the aquifer are strongly recommended to produce safe drinking water in compliance with the who guideline value sar technology could be combined easily with processes offering a safe barrier such as e g nanofiltration or reverse osmosis where liquid concentrate streams can be also re injected into the subsurface to avoid additional waste production besides sar for drinking water purpose mitigation of groundwater for irrigation of crops is becoming increasingly important in future in order to avoid arsenic accumulation in the food chain however experience with high water demands as needed for agriculture are still needed to assess the economic feasibility of sar process acknowledgements funding this work was done within the joint research project wakap supported by the german federal ministry of education and research grant number

19713,arsenic contamination in groundwater is a critical issue and one that raises great concern around the world as the cause of many negative health impacts on the human body including internal and external cancers there are many ways to remove or immobilize arsenic including membrane technologies adsorption sand filtration ion exchange and capacitive deionization these exhibit many different advantages and disadvantages among these methods in situ subsurface arsenic immobilization by aeration and the subsequent removal of arsenic from the aqueous phase has shown to be very a promising convenient technology with high treatment efficiency in contrast to most of other as remediation technologies in situ subsurface immobilization offers the advantage of negligible waste production and hence has the potential of being a sustainable treatment option this paper reviews the application of subsurface arsenic removal sar technologies as well as current modeling approaches unlike subsurface iron removal sir which has proven to be technically feasible in a variety of hydrogeochemical settings for many years sar is not yet an established solution since it shows vulnerability to diverse geochemical conditions such as ph fe as ratio and the presence of co ions in some situations this makes it difficult to comply with the stringent guideline value for drinking water recommended by the who 10 μg l 1 in order to overcome its limitations more theoretical and experimental studies are needed to show long term application achievements and help the development of sar processes into state of the art technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords subsurface arsenic removal sar in situ remediation arsenic adsorption aeration arsenic contamination 1 introduction arsenic as is considered to be one of the most serious inorganic contaminants in groundwater and it is recognized as a significant environmental cause of cancer mortality globally martinez et al 2011 van halem et al 2009a who 2011a inorganic arsenic occurs naturally at high levels in groundwater in many countries around the world including mostly south america and southeast asia amini et al 2008 mukherjee et

organization who is 10 μg l 1 who 2011b the sources of exposure are drinking water crops irrigated with contaminated water and food prepared with polluted water after long term exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic the first visible symptoms are usually observed in the skin and include pigmentation changes skin lesions and hard patches on the palms and soles of the feet hyperkeratosis generally these occur after a minimum exposure of approximately five years and may be a precursor to skin cancer james et al 2017 who 2012 a variety of ex situ and in situ treatment technologies for arsenic removal from water including immobilization has been implemented over the last two decades ex situ processes include precipitation flocculation ion exchange membrane technologies figoli et al 2016 and adsorption with adsorption technologies using multiple materials being the most common jadhav et al 2015 jain and singh 2012 mondal et al 2013 nicomel et al 2015 singh et al 2015 in situ treatment comprises an array of relatively novel methods typically including technologies such as chemical oxidation arsenic immobilization by sorption and bioremediation techniques including arsenic biotransformation phytostabilization and hyperaccumulation in plants bundschuh et al 2014 xie et al 2015 other alternative in situ technologies permeable reactive barriers prb electrokinetics nanoparticles zero valent iron natural attenuation etc might be suitable for groundwater and or soil treatment as they have the overall advantage of being environmental friendly and less expensive compared with conventional technologies but some disadvantages arise due to the novelty of these technologies and the overall lack of long term experience using these techniques litter et al 2014 table 1 shows an overview of the most common ex situ and in situ arsenic removal techniques and their most prominent advantages and disadvantages fe iii hydr oxides also referred to as amorphous hydrous ferric oxides or hfo are known as the most important arsenic sorption materials due to their high specific surface area and ability to adsorb total as in large capacities it is well known that dissolved fe ii in groundwater that is exposed to air is oxidized to fe iii and subsequently forms sparingly dissolvable hfo appelo and de vet 2003 omoregie et al 2013 welch et al 2008 through this process some part of the total dissolved arsenic is also removed by co precipitation with the oxidized fe through different mechanisms such as surface ionization surface complexation and ligand exchange buamah et al 2008 farrell and chaudhary 2013 van der laan 2009 in ex situ treatment this can be used as pre treatment for e g subsequent membrane filtration schmidt et al 2016 the most salient advantage of the sar process over ex situ and other in situ technologies is its negligible waste production low maintenance costs and simple operation without additives or chemicals making it especially suitable for remote and undeveloped rural areas shan et al 2013 van halem et al 2010a with the potential to become a sustainable long term treatment option it should be noted that arsenic laden water is not eliminated by the sar treatment of arsenic the arsenic is just transferred from a soluble phase to a less readily immobile phase arsenic waste is hereby bound into the aquifer layer and no waste stream is produced for the user in ex situ processes on the other hand toxic sludge and or arsenic laden concentrate streams are produced which may require costly methods for treating and proper disposal for example the disposal of used adsorption media from ex situ processes poses a threat to the environment and specific recommendations for the arsenic waste disposal are often omitted or mentioned as an area for future research therefore the proper disposal and stabilization of arsenic laden waste remains a barrier to the successful and economic implementation of arsenic removal technologies clancy et al 2013 litter et al 2014 on a household level several low cost and easily applicable techniques have been applied using different arsenic removal technologies such as precipitation with aluminum or iron hydroxide flocs and subsequent filtration adsorption on artificial and natural sorbents water softening with lime ion exchange and bioremediation berg et al 2006 pokhrel et al 2009b in aquifers with high ferrous iron concentrations fe ii the arsenic removal by using sand filters is also suitable berg et al 2006 the in situ chemical treatment is also an alternative involving the injection of oxidants into the soil and aquifer kmno4 h2o2 to promote the oxidation of arsenic and coagulants to enhance the sorption and coprecipitation fecl3 litter et al 2014 recently a few studies have also looked into in situ immobilization of arsenic under reducing conditions by forming subsurface fe sulfides coatings kirk et al 2004 omoregie et al 2013 pi et al 2017 the electrolytic oxidation and subsequent removal of arsenic through electrocoagulation has also been studied in detail recently nidheesh and singh 2017 song et al 2017 the purpose of this paper is to review subsurface arsenic removal sar by aeration as a promising in situ technology with the advantage of negligible waste production since the arsenic is kept subsurface in the aquifer furthermore sar technology has proven to be relatively simple and less expensive compared with conventional above ground and ex situ treatment methods to date this technology has been tested within a variety of small and large pilot trials mostly in india and bangladesh in this paper sar technology will be evaluated for its application on a global scale 2 subsurface arsenic removal sar technology based on subsurface iron removal sir subsurface arsenic removal sar is a simple in situ technology that relies on subsurface removal by adsorption and co precipitation with iron hydr oxides through mechanisms such as surface complexation and ligand exchange in europe subsurface iron sir and manganese removal has been successfully used for many decades however subsurface removal of arsenic is a relatively new technique rott et al 2002 the in situ remediation of arsenic is based on the underground precipitation and adsorption onto ferric oxides and consists primarily of three main steps 1 water is extracted from the aquifer and oxygenated via an aeration system 2 the oxygen enriched water is infiltrated back into the aquifer through an infiltration well forming large oxidation zones in the aquifer aqueous fe ii is oxidized to solid fe iii hydroxides fomenting the removal of aqueous arsenic onto into solid phases finally 3 water around the well with low iron and arsenic can be extracted from the aquifer by periodically extracting anoxic groundwater and injecting aerated water into the aquifer through the tube well alternate oxidizing and adsorbing phases of iron and arsenic are induced so that larger water volumes with reduced arsenic levels can be subsequently extracted grischek et al 2015 two types of technological sar systems can be differentiated 1 one or two wells being operated alternately by injection extraction for small scale application and 2 extraction well surrounded by infiltration wells for large scale application fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of a typical sar unit consisting of an aeration system with storage tank and one tube well for the infiltration and the extraction of the groundwater under natural reducing conditions of an aquifer eh 0 iron ii manganese ii and arsenic iii can be found in dissolved form with the input of oxygen during the infiltration oxidation phase fig 1 left the redox potential of the aquifer increases eh 0 and aqueous fe ii will be oxidized to solid iron hydroxide the oxidation of manganese takes place after iron ii oxidation is completed in the course of time solid iron and manganese oxidation products will build up a coating around the soil grains in groundwater enhancing adsorptive places henning and rott 2003 during the adsorption or delivery phase fig 1 right contaminated groundwater flows through the formed adsorption zones where iron manganese and arsenic species can be adsorbed and then co precipitated through different mechanisms when more water is extracted dissolved fe ii is adsorbed onto the fe iii coated soil grains jeon et al 2003 the adsorbed fe ii will be oxidized during the next oxidation phase resulting in an enhanced adsorptive surface area of hfo which has the ability to adsorb both as iii dzombak and morel 1990 and as v suthersan et al 2017 the main chemical oxidation reactions occurring can be written as 1 2fe 2 ½o 2 x 2 h 2 o fe 2 o 3 xh 2 o 4h 2 2fe 2 ½o 2 3h 2 o 2feo oh 4h 3 mn 2 ½o 2 h 2 o mno 2 2h 4 h 3 a s o 3 1 2 o 2 h 2 a s o 4 h in general the oxidation of mn2 requires a redox potential eh 800 mv as shown in fig 2 which is higher than those needed for the oxidation of iron hence oxidation of manganese takes place after the oxidation of iron kim and nriagu 2000 despite the lower redox potential compared to fe and mn required for the oxidation of as iii to as v fig 2 oxidation by oxygen in water occurs very slowly making it generally not relevant for in situ as removal some studies e g kim and nriagu 2000 showed that the half lifetime of naturally occurring as iii was four to nine days when saturated with air and two to five days with pure oxygen however the oxidation process can be accelerated for example by the presence of manganese oxides mno2 which act under various conditions as a solid oxidizing media for both as iii as shown in eq 5 and fe ii driehaus et al 1995 wu et al 2015 5 m n o 2 h 3 a s o 3 m n 2 h a s o 4 2 h 2 o this process contributes to the abiotic as iii oxidation what on the one side reduces the concentrations of the more toxic arsenite species compared to arsenate on the other side the formation of manganese oxides also enhances the immobilization of as v by sorption onto fe oxides and its precipitation as manganese arsenate compounds cheng et al 2008 huang and kretzschmar 2010 nitzsche et al 2015b if ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 methane ch4 or other oxygen demanding substances are present in the groundwater the economic efficiency of the sar process can be significantly lowered as more oxygen needs to be delivered by the system the oxidation of nh4 to nitrate no3 over no2 can be summarized according to following equation 6 n h 4 2 o 2 n o 3 h 2 o 2 h although the oxidation processes occurring in the groundwater are both chemical and microbial driven mn oxidation does not occur in the presence of nh4 and no2 the chemical oxidation of mn2 by oxygen at neutral ph is rather slow as it occurs optimally at a very high redox potential cf fig 2 so that microbial catalysis is needed for the effective manganese removal with sar farnsworth et al 2012 nitzsche et al 2015a however the oxidation of n h 4 and no2 through nitrification is energetically more favorable than mn oxidation so that manganese removal through sar will take place only after ammonium is completely oxidized gouzinis et al 1998 nitzsche et al 2015b vandenabeele et al 1995 furthermore processes with high oxygen demand such as the oxidation of ammonium or methane can lower the oxygen availability and thus slow the microbial activity for the manganese oxidation it is therefore important to assess the quality of the raw water for each sar application i e when nh4 might be present nonetheless the successful removal of both manganese in the presence of ammonium has been observed in different case studies kellner et al 2016 rott et al 2002 it must also be considered that seasonal fluctuations in the concentrations of ammonium might occur in places close to surface water sources this indicates that the interaction between groundwater and surface waters have an effect on redox conditions throughout seasonal changes which might have an impact on the sar process throughout the year richards et al 2017 changes in redox potential also have an influence on arsenic remobilization in the aquifer due to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides the key factors controlling this process are still poorly understood zhang et al 2017b the transformation of the fe oxides under reducing conditions is presumably controlled by biochemical processes and may cause pronounced changes in the as adsorption potential over time neidhardt et al 2014 generally the transformation of less crystalline phases into more crystalline ones increases the potential for arsenic mobilization and it can occur spontaneously or can be driven by changing redox conditions campbell and nordstrom 2014 reductive conditions within the aquifer can be caused by the biogenic decomposition of buried organic material and leads to the microbial reduction of iron hydr oxides and the subsequent release of the adsorbed arsenic berg et al 2007 2001 frising 2014 zhang et al 2017a however adsorbed arsenic can also retard or inhibit the transformation of ferrihydrites by blocking surface sites and thus preventing its reductive dissolution and recrystallization stabilizing the less crystalline phases with higher adsorptive capacity campbell and nordstrom 2014 unstable redox conditions may also increase the remobilization of arsenic so that maintaining controlled redox conditions is crucial to avoid the long term arsenic mobility bissacot and ciminelli 2014 overall the long term study of the adsorption desorption process on the sediment surface is a key aspect needed for the understanding of the migration and transformation of arsenic zhang et al 2017b besides redox condition the chemical stability over time of the different mineral complexes and desorption kinetics of arsenic are affected by various geochemical factors including most importantly ph natural organic matter content and microbial oxidation reactions datta et al 2014 leiva et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b studies also show the effect of surface site competition e g hco3 phosphates silicates etc gao et al 2013 jeon et al 2003 kanematsu et al 2013 norrman et al 2008 thi hoa mai et al 2014 on arsenic mobilization the type of mineral deposits plays also an important role iron iii arsenate minerals e g scorodite eq 7 shows a release of as under acidic and reducing conditions whereas the stability of fe s as minerals e g arsenopyrite is favored for example in reduced aquifers ciminelli 2014 at higher ph other mechanisms might contribute to as release for example from desorption from iron hydr oxides coatings and dissolution of arsenopyrite bia et al 2014 ciminelli 2014 under most natural ph conditions in groundwater as v adsorbs more strongly on fe iii hydr oxides than as iii pierce and moore 1982 the dominant mechanism for the proposed arsenic removal is an adsorption oxidation reaction non ionic arsenite as iii can be adsorbed by hfo through lewis acid base interactions whereas ionic arsenate as v is adsorbed by both lewis acid base and coulombic electrostatic interactions huling et al 2017 at lower ph conditions where amphoteric hfo is positively charged and hence can be more readily adsorbed suthersan et al 2017 thus arsenite has a weaker adsorption on mineral phases as it is uncharged below ph 9 2 ladeira and ciminelli 2004 yet some studies state that process regarding adsorption onto iron minerals are much more complex dixit and hering 2003 and that adsorbed arsenite can oxidize in a variety of minerals and natural soils campbell and nordstrom 2014 the primary mechanism for removal of as v and as iii from groundwater is likely to be the adsorption by oxidized sediments containing fe iii stollenwerk et al 2007 arsenate can react with fe oh 3 to feaso4 as shown in eq 7 7 fe oh 3 h 3 aso 4 feaso 4 2h 2 o h 2 o the strongest adsorption of both arsenic species on the iron oxides is formed via inner sphere complexation through direct coordination with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of hfos cheng et al 2008 loring et al 2009 mainly by way of monodentate mononuclear complex as well as bidentate complexes with lower adsorption rate through ligand exchange grossl et al 1997 yoon et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 besides the oxidation state of as adsorption efficiency also depends on other solutes that compete with as for adsorption sites through similar mechanisms phosphate bicarbonate and silicate have similar strong ligand properties to arsenate and arsenite and can compete with arsenic through lewis acid base interactions for the adsorption on iron stollenwerk et al 2003 suthersan et al 2017 the decreasing arsenic removal efficiency by these ions is also linked to the sequestering properties that hinder the formation of ferric iii hydroxide from fe ii furthermore the effects of competing anions on the as iii removal in oxidation adsorption processes have been proven to have a strong dependence on ph changes showing higher competitive adsorption with increasing ph values guan et al 2009 2 1 operational aspects of sar technology sar technology bases on the periodically alternating cycles but continuously long term infiltration of oxygen enriched water into the aquifer to ensure a permanent state of oxidation adsorption zones the continuous interchange between infiltration and abstraction phases allows the adsorption to take place while oxidation zones are formed once an oxidation zone is developed more water can be safely extracted here the volumetric ratio determines the efficiency of the mitigation system van halem et al 2010a the efficiency qe of the sar process is expressed either as the ratio of extracted to injected water volume ve vi or by the ratio ve vi ve for example if the extracted volume is twice as large as the injected volume then ve vi 2 and ve vi ve 0 5 higher volumetric coefficients ve vi may affect the stability of the oxidation zones these may also decay as a result of disturbances during the process what will result in higher concentration of iron hydr oxides near the extraction zone of the well and narrowed adsorption zones for mn ii the oxidation species e g manganese oxides can then be reduced and a mobilization may occur it is therefore important that oxidation conditions achieved in the aquifer are kept even in the long term and that the volumetric coefficient is not exceeded the remobilization of arsenic after the adsorption onto hfos is furthermore a potential risk of the process however the process kinetics of the remobilization have not yet been quantified or studied in detail nevertheless long time experience with sir has showed that formed iron oxides are very stable with time and have a much higher density than freshly build flocks regarding the blocking of the well and or the aquifer it is proven that in situ process by aeration prolongs the life expectancy of the wells grischek et al 2015 the precipitated iron and manganese accumulate in the aquifer and favor the adsorption of dissolved iron and manganese by providing more surface areas zhang et al 2017b with time iron and manganese are removed more effectively from the aqueous phase however the proper development of precipitation zones is very important to achieve higher removal efficiencies which may take up to ten or more injection cycles tredoux et al 2004 the precipitation of iron and manganese only occurs when the equilibrium is displaced towards the oxidative side through the addition of oxygen enriched water the large pore volume provided by the reaction zone in the underground around the well and underneath favors the precipitation of iron ahmad 2012 also when operated properly and continuously the tube well used for abstraction and infiltration cycles will be permanently protected by the oxygenated water front which effectively blocks the transport of reduced iron and manganese to the borehole and prevents the clogging of pumping equipment and screens with time the precipitated iron may settle to more stable forms e g hematite which have a smaller volume than the first formed hydrated oxides e g ferrihydrite tredoux et al 2004 precipitates of iron and manganese show also the smallest size in a coarse aquifer by the proper development of the oxygenation zone and operation of the plant the loss of pore volume in the aquifer happens only slowly and its permeability is not be reduced even after many years so that no long term risks of clogging of the aquifer is expected mettler et al 2001 other important hydrological requirements for the safe operation of the sar include the type of aquifer porous aquifers with high specific surface values like sand or gravel layers are well suitable whereas clay and marl aquifers are not appropriate furthermore the influence of natural flow of groundwater needs to be considered hereby a raw water analysis to estimate operational cycle duration and infiltration to abstraction ratios must be carried out before starting any pilot trials a proper construction and safe sealing of boreholes and wells to prevent negative influences on the aquifer e g by surface water infiltration is highly important grischek et al 2015 the subsurface iron and arsenic removal has been investigated in different studies a distinction is drawn between two types of sar approaches one without using any addition of chemicals injecting only aerated natural groundwater and one which besides aeration also doses dissolved fe iii since the removal of arsenic requires a higher concentration of fe than of as the latter approach has been applied in grounds where iron is naturally too low nevertheless the most common type of sar makes use of high natural fe levels both approaches are considered in the following sections 2 2 subsurface arsenic removal sar technology by dosing fe and aerated water welch et al 2008 studied subsurface arsenic removal with a combination of aerated water and the injection of ferric chloride in two wells with depths of 30 m in carson valley nv usa arsenic concentrations in groundwater beneath carson valley in western usa typically exceeded the 10 μg l 1 drinking water standard with concentrations of around 30 36 μg l 1 the groundwater was typically alkaline ph 8 and had dissolved fe concentrations lower than a few tens of μg l 1 both wells had similar total as concentrations however one aquifer had high concentrations of as iii and the other contained mostly as v during the pilot trials the following chemical and physical processes were applied 1 injection of cl2 which oxidized as iii to as v during a reaction time of about 7 min 2 cl2 subtraction to prevent formation of undesirable disinfection by products in the aquifers 3 injection of dissolved o2 and fe ii to form fe oxide in the aquifer and hcl to lower the ph 4 outgassing of co2 the fe ii concentration in the injection water ranged between 0 15 and 6 35 mg l 1 and the ph was 5 3 6 4 by setting the flow rate about 120 l h 1 the injected water volume was 790 2880 l and the extracted volume was 1340 3900 l which amounted to a sar efficiency qe of up to 0 6 the time between the end of injection and the beginning of withdrawal was generally about 1 h after conducting several trials the extracted water achieved as levels as low as 1 and 6 μg l 1 however during some withdrawal periods fe and mn concentrations exceeded u s secondary drinking water standards 0 3 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively u s epa 2012 the authors concluded that the evaluation of optimum design parameters needs further investigation miller 2008 combined the pulsed injection of aerated water and ferrous iron to remove as v the pilot trials were conducted at the san antonio field laboratory safl located in a valley fill aquifer in central new mexico the testing was successful in reducing ambient arsenic concentrations 38 42 μg l 1 and iron concentration 0 189 mg l 1 to below the drinking water standard by multiple daily injections of air and iron in short duration pulses the investigation was able to show a clear trend towards lower arsenic concentrations only after the addition of iron an incremental increase in arsenic removal capability was achieved at the site some difficulties were caused by iron pre oxidation in the apparatus which should be reduced to better control the amount of iron injected for the same effect chen and leung 2016 proposed an in situ technique using injection of ferric iron and a naoh solution to force the precipitation iron and the arsenic co precipitation first the ferric iron solution and naoh were injected into a well with arsenic contamination the ferric iron hydrolyzed and precipitated as amorphous ferric hydroxide hfo in the local aquifer surrounding the well arsenite and arsenate could be then intercepted and sorbed onto hfo in the adsorption zone although the technology was proven to be feasible the major drawback of this approach was the injection of chemicals into the aquifer that may cause unexpected biochemical and geochemical effects in the subsurface system with unknown long term consequences krüger et al 2014 conducted pilot trials on in situ immobilization of arsenical chemical warfare agents cwa at a contaminated military site in northern germany the site showed concentrations of cwa containing arsenic ranging from 30 μg l 1 up to 9 0 mg l 1 arithmetic mean 2 4 mg as l 1 cwa showcased arsenic mainly in organic form as phenylized as compounds the proportion of inorganic as iii and as v in total as ranged from 6 to 87 two remediation wells depth 15 and 19 m were installed for pumping and infiltration total arsenic was measured to 1 3 and 2 5 mg l 1 respectively krüger et al 2014 showed that organic arsenic compounds from cwa could be precipitated by adding different fe ii compounds fecl2 and feso4 showed the best removal efficiency of total as of about 80 the treatment unit consisted of three 500 l tanks aeration tank degassing tank and buffer tank the water was infiltrated in cycles each one consisting of four steps 1 infiltration of fe ii cl2 dissolved in water up to 118 g l 1 stripped with n2 in order to decrease dissolved oxygen do concentration 2 infiltration of dissolved fe into the aquifer 3 infiltration of aerated water to induce oxidation of fe and precipitation of hfo and 4 infiltration of untreated water for dilution in order to reduce the risk of clogging the well it was demonstrated that total as could be reduced to less than 0 4 mg l 1 with the main advantage that no contaminated sludge or adsorption material had to be disposed of however the main challenge here was the clogging problem due to the precipitation of hfo in the screen of the well furthermore the authors mentioned that this remediation technique could also be used to treat groundwater with naturally occurring as in order to produce drinking water 2 3 subsurface arsenic removal sar technology by only dosing aerated water the first pilot trials using sar were conducted in the 1990s by rott et al 1996 in germany with groundwater characterized by anoxic conditions and high values of fe ii mn and as which occurred mainly in its trivalent form the trials 26 cycles were carried out with two wells of 30 and 50 m depth with total as of 38 and 25 μg l 1 respectively as iii 24 and 25 μg l 1 fe 1 97 and 0 29 mg l 1 mn 0 35 and 0 29 mg l 1 after running six cycles water in both wells reached values in compliance with the german drinking water standard regarding iron 0 2 mg l 1 trinkwv 1990 however only the first well provided good drinking water quality with regard to mn 0 05 mg l 1 and as 10 μg l 1 this well could be operated up to a water volume efficiency of qe 0 75 whereas the qe of the second well was limited to 0 5 throughout the four month trials more than 30 000 m3 treated water were extracted the limited removal efficiency of the second well was explained by strong inhomogeneities in the aquifer that resulted in an insufficient formation of an oxidation zone in the aquifer van halem et al 2010a studied iron and arsenic removal as a low cost technology for community based water supply in bangladesh two wells in manikganj district west of dhaka were selected as test grounds for the study both sites showed the same total dissolved arsenic concentration 145 μg l 1 with an as iii fraction of around 82 85 and higher concentrations of iron 1 0 15 mg l 1 and manganese 2 5 0 3 mg l 1 the pilot set up was connected to the existing hand pump of an existing tube well with 31 m depth and perforated well length of 3 m the extracted groundwater was aerated sand filtered and passed through an adsorptive arsenic filter the maximum injection volume was limited to 1 m3 treated water reached as levels of 10 μg l 1 and iron bdl the study was conducted by varying the ratio between abstracted and injected water volume as it is the volumetric ratio that determines the efficiency of the system typically abstraction started 12 16 h after injection results showed a much faster rising of arsenic concentrations than of iron concentrations in the second well however several cycles were needed to achieve effective removal of iron and arsenic the comparison indicated that the occurrence of a high iron level in the groundwater did not promote the effective co removal of arsenic during subsurface treatment since both wells showed similar breakthrough curves for arsenic at the same volumetric ratio of abstracted and injected volumes furthermore the authors concluded that injection of oxygen at higher concentrations 1 5 3 mg o2 l 1 promoted the subsurface removal of iron however the better retention of iron did not enhance the co removal of arsenic subsurface iron removal increased with every successive cycle so that the ratio of abstracted to injected volume would rise on the other hand arsenic removal efficiency was not sufficient and a breakthrough of 10 μg l 1 was observed before a volume ratio abstracted to injected of 1 was reached this was attributed to the short contact times 20 min within the oxidation zone and the presence of competing anions such as phosphates as it has previously been discussed in section 2 van halem et al 2010b also conducted anoxic column experiments with natural groundwater to simulate the shifting redox conditions in the oxidation zone during subsurface iron and arsenic removal the column experiments provided controlled conditions for the investigation of the adsorptive catalytic oxidation mechanism by spiking the water with as iii the operational mode of injection abstraction at the test facility was simulated in the 2d plug flow environment of the columns with down flow 1 0 l h 1 for both injection and abstraction the water samples showed average ph of 7 1 almost constant temperature of 12 c iron concentrations of 5 3 mg l 1 manganese concentrations of 0 61 mg l 1 and phosphate concentrations of 1 13 mg l 1 in the column experiments as iii was dosed at different concentrations 232 112 and 67 μg l 1 in order to study the effect of changing the fe as ratio in groundwater on the adsorptive removal efficiency of arsenic iron concentrations in the groundwater remained constant thus the respective fe as ratios were 28 63 and 103 for the testing oxygen rich 8 9 mg l 1 drinking water was dosed to the columns for 1 5 pore volume transparent pvc length 80 cm inner diameter 36 mm after a waiting period of 16 h the columns were re started with natural groundwater and monitored for the retardation of arsenic and iron it was assumed that as in the subsurface process homogeneous oxidation and precipitation were extremely limited as were heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption processes hence the mechanism of adsorptive catalytic oxidation dominated the efficiency of subsurface iron removal van halem et al 2010b was much higher than could be explained by the adsorptive catalytic oxidation in the column experiments hence other processes e g biotic or transport mechanisms must contribute to the iron removal efficiency of the system it was shown that arsenic adsorption during subsurface treatment was controlled by the amount of adsorbed oxidized iron and not by the amount of removed iron this was significant for the operation of the process since it became apparent that the oxygen concentration of the injection water did not control the arsenic removal but rather the injection volume van halem et al 2010b also found no relation between the amount of removed arsenic and the fe as ratio of the groundwater rather the authors suggested that the removal of arsenic was limited by competing ions such as phosphate van halem et al 2009b compared subsurface adsorption mechanisms with adsorption treatment technologies using iron hydr oxide media which is a popular low cost technique iron precipitates from sir plants have been characterized in previous research to contain mainly goethite feo oh 50 100 as well as traces of ferrihydrites the latter is also called amorphous iron oxide or hydrous ferric oxide hfo with time hfo transforms into stable iron oxides like goethite which is one of the most stable ferric oxides this process is considered the main reason why iron precipitates do not clog the subsurface pores since the volume of amorphous hfo is reduced by the crystallization processes the oxidation process of as iii to as v in the presence of oxygen was slow and took several days research also showed that remobilization of adsorbed arsenic occurred stepwise and slowly and that the efficiency of arsenic adsorption on iron oxides depended on the ph and presence of interfering anions such as phosphate with increasing ph the adsorption of as v decreased whereas the adsorption of as iii showed a maximum around neutral ph hsia et al 1994 pierce and moore 1982 furthermore the adsorption of as v was reduced by half when phosphate was present at ph 7 and a ratio of po4 3 as of 10 the observed effect of phosphate concurs with their previous studies van halem et al 2010a 2010b gude et al 2016 investigated the natural arsenic removal capacity at three groundwater treatment plants in the netherlands with arsenic levels of 10 26 μg l 1 in order to identify operational parameters to obtain as concentrations 1 μg l 1 groundwater treatment in the netherlands usually comprises aeration and subsequent sand filtration without using any chemicals gude et al investigated the interaction between as fe po4 3 mn and nh4 after aeration and during rapid filtration in the natural groundwater matrix they showed that as iii was not efficiently removed in the supernatant water after aeration even after extending residence time 12 4 13 9 min despite the fact that all fe ii was precipitated into filterable hfo flocs most naturally occurring as iii remained mobile achieving only 20 48 removal with 1 4 4 2 mg l 1 precipitated fe ii however added as v was readily adsorbed moreover it was shown that the improved as iii removal from the aerated supernatant water occurred in the rapid sand filter also after 60 min residence time this was credited to the accumulation of manganese on the sand filter grains which lead to the catalytic oxidation of as iii by manganese oxides and the readily adsorption of oxidized as v onto hfo flocs nitzsche et al 2015b this improved removal efficiency by the filter bed was not observed for p o 4 3 however n h 4 and mn which showed no removal in the supernatant water were completely removed by the sand filter bed n h 4 removal was attributed to biological activity in the filter bed nitrification reaction while the mn oxidation could have been both biotic and abiotic sen gupta et al 2009 conducted a study in kasimpore 25 km from kolkata india the main sources of water for the village were shallow and tube wells preliminary studies revealed that 70 of the tube wells had arsenic concentrations above 50 μg l 1 plastic shower heads were used to oxygenate the water to do levels up to 6 mg l 1 by spraying it in a plastic tank in certain operating sequences delivery rest infiltration the typical aerated water infiltration and extraction volumes were 2000 l and 4000 l respectively with flow rate at around 2 7 m3 h 1 an as level of below 10 μg l 1 in the extracted water could be achieved finally the operation cost was estimated at usd 1 0 per day for producing 2000 l of extracted water the results have been documented in a report sen gupta 2008 for the different pilot trials of six plants in rural locations in west bengal india in a project financed by the world bank all plants were managed by local water users and supplied water to the local population the results showed that the sar process was able to reduce the total arsenic content from 150 to 300 μg l 1 to below 50 μg l 1 with a capacity of 3 4 m3 per cycle at efficiency qe of 0 33 0 5 although no concentrations below the who standard of 10 μg l 1 were achieved the results show that the sar process is a feasible arsenic removal technique suitable as a low cost treatment however the authors didn t provide further information regarding iron concentrations or other raw water parameters which can explain the high efficiency results regardless both high recovery rates and still relative lower oxygen concentrations rott and kauffmann 2008 carried out a field test using sar in kashimpur a rural community in west bengal india the in situ treatment plant was operated manually at a well with 37 m depth alternately draining and infiltrating into the same well the low cost aeration occurred by passing the groundwater through three shower heads and storing in a tank before infiltration during the first period 4 m3 were delivered and 2 m3 were infiltrated the cycles during the first phase consisted of 80 min delivery 30 min intermission and 40 min infiltration adding up to a total time of 2 5 h in a subsequent second phase the volume of infiltration was increased to 6 m3 extending the cycle time to 7 h in total after having run the sar system for about 16 months a significant drop of the initial arsenic concentrations of 150 300 μg l 1 in the delivery water was observed and stable concentrations below 10 μg l 1 were achieved after 19 months operation this decrease could be explained by the fact that during the field trial traces of iron accumulated in the oxidation zone at a particular time there was enough iron present to make higher arsenic removal possible rahman et al 2014 analyzed the subsurface arsenic removal in two wells approx 22 m depth at muradnagar upazila comilla district bangladesh with as concentration of around 200 μg l 1 and fe level of 12 6 and 8 7 mg l 1 respectively larger injection volume lower pumping rate and intermittent pumping had positive effects on arsenic removal indicating that arsenic adsorption was kinetically limited after injecting 1 m3 of aerated water a maximum of 3 m3 of water with as 50 μg l 1 was extracted of which 2 m3 were used for drinking in compliance with bangladesh mcl of 50 μg l 1 and the remainder was used for re injection besides pumping rate and injection volume the ph of the water played a major role the ph of injection water was always above 8 whereas the ph of extraction water always started below 8 which was attributed to formation of h ions due to fe ii oxidation see eq 1 2 the results also showed that higher ph was essential for better as adsorption on hfo which increased up to a ph value of 8 5 but decreased above this value kartinen and martin 1995 the cost for 1 m3 treated water was estimated at usd 2 0 sarkar and rahman 2001 carried out sar trials with groundwater at maijdee area bangladesh with three shallow tube wells screen depth 10 12 m the iron and arsenic levels were measured as 1 0 2 4 1 0 mg l 1 and 0 11 0 52 and 1 3 mg l 1 correspondingly 500 l aerated water were re injected after 12 h 3 m3 were extracted they were able to reduce the arsenic level by 50 up to an extraction of 2 5 m3 however only the treated water from the tube well with an as level of 0 11 mg l 1 could comply with the bangladeshi mcl of 50 μg l 1 the rather low as reduction was mainly attributed to the relatively low level of dissolved oxygen in the aerated water 5 mg l 1 monitoring of the injected and pumped water was therefore suggested furthermore sarkar and rahman 2001 also recommended having an iron content 10 times higher than the arsenic level for increasing sar potential the influence of dissolved oxygen in the infiltrated water is in agreement with van halem et al 2010a and was also shown in a study of visoottiviseth and ahmed 2008 the study revealed that the in situ oxidation method was able to meet the bangladesh standard of 50 μg l 1 when the arsenic level in the groundwater was less than 100 μg l 1 treatment efficiency improved if the dissolved oxygen level of recharge water or the quantity of recharge water in the aquifer increased brunsting and mcbean 2014 used a solution with constant iron and arsenic concentration 5 3 mg l 1 and 200 μg l 1 under anoxic conditions to study key factors of the sar process ahead of possible field tests fe and as salts were dissolved in water with do less than 0 05 mg l 1 oxygen removal by nitrogen gas sparging in order to mimic the anoxic groundwater of bangladesh the model water was then aerated and passed through a simple sand filter l 2 m d 0 5 m with the exception of initial trials all experiments were conducted with as v at a hrt of 13 h the maximum removal of arsenic was 79 at a local point in the apparatus while a total removal of 59 between inlet and outlet was observed in addition brunsting and mcbean 2014 examined characteristics of iron and arsenic co precipitation in a simplified environment by conducting a lab scale jar test with short time vigorous aeration and subsequent settling and sampling of supernatant solution after the 5 day experimental period fe concentration dropped by only 5 whereas the as level dropped by 77 the low fe reduction was attributed to the lower ph at the end of the experimental period on the other hand this shows that a relatively small drop in iron has a large effect on the arsenic removal hence a large removal rate was achieved at an fe as mass ratio of 1 5 molar removal ratio of 2 0 they confirmed co precipitation as the main removal mechanism since 37 of the removed as could be re mobilized into the solution after five days by vigorous stirring in order to get an overview of the different trial tests on subsurface removal of arsenic by aeration a comparison of the several different case studies and investigations is shown in table 2 here the most important parameters that play a role in the subsurface arsenic removal are shown besides the concentration of arsenic and iron these are the concentration of important co ions and efficiency ratio of extracted to injected volume qe ve vi the overall removal efficiency achieved throughout the trials to reduce arsenic concentrations to below 10 μg l 1 was realised only by some of the studies as mostly only the limit standard value of 50 μg l 1 was achieved the complexity of the different parameters and surrounding conditions makes a direct comparison between studies difficult although there is no clear tendency of influencing factors for the efficiency of sar e g iron arsenic ratio concentrations of competing ions the better results tend to be achieved only in trials where the extraction efficiency qe ve vi was kept low furthermore experiments carried out with lower oxygenation rates showed poorer results sarkar and rahman 2001 2 4 modeling of sar technology computer models are necessary to assess potential sar processes based on specific local conditions some studies have aimed to develop a general tool to determine which hydrogeochemical processes are responsible for the im mobilization of arsenic in the subsurface during sar with the aim of predicting sar performances at different locations appelo and de vet 2003 simulated an in situ iron and arsenic removal project in the netherlands by using a reactive transport model rtm in order to study concentration changes of ch4 nh4 mn2 fe2 po4 3 and as they interpreted data from the groundwater pumping station schuwacht of hydron zh gouda the netherlands where the water quality was monitored for the first seven cycles of in situ iron removal in this study the injection volumes started at 30 m3 h 1 for 2 days and reduced to 23 m3 h 1 for 40 days the maximum groundwater total as concentration at their site was only 14 μg l 1 which was significantly lower than typical as levels in india bangladesh and south east asia they explained the principles of in situ iron removal from groundwater in simple terms based on the reaction of sorbed ferrous iron in the aquifer the modeling was based on cation exchange in groundwater a multicomponent process in which all the solute cations participated the sorption reactions were calculated with the geochemical model phreeqc 2 which included databases with representative values of the cation exchange constants parkhurst and appelo 1999 the efficiency of the process was calculated by neglecting dispersion and by limiting the sorption reactions to the zone where oxygen had penetrated the concentration pattern of the elements ch4 n h 4 mn2 fe2 and p o 4 3 could be modeled well with known equations their retardation increased in successive cycles due to sorption to the iron oxyhydroxide which was precipitated in the previous cycles the modeled pattern generally showed the observed concentration trends but it did not match the spike details particularly at the beginning of the pilot trials the modeling demonstrated that arsenite was much less sorbed than arsenate in groundwater without phosphate however in the presence of po4 3 the sorption of arsenate decreased to a small amount 2 mol adsorbed l 1 mol solute l 1 due to negative charging of the hfo surface after phosphate adsorption the effect was greater for arsenate than for arsenite because arsenate was sorbed as a negative species while arsenite forms a neutral surface complex appelo and de vet 2003 rahman et al 2015 developed a one dimensional radially symmetric reactive transport model in phreeqc to model key hydrogeochemical reactions during the sar operation oxidation of fe ii and as iii was modeled using kinetic rate expressions that were not considered in the work of appelo and de vet 2003 cation exchange precipitation of hfo and surface complexation were modeled as equilibrium processes the reactive transport model was developed for an sar well that was located in a holocene reduced aquifer system in muradnagar upazila a sub district in comilla bangladesh the reactive transport model was subsequently applied to two other sar wells in bangladesh without further calibration during the pilot phase 5 m3 of aerated water was injected and around 20 m3 of groundwater was extracted in the first half of the trial the groundwater marked a total as level of 201 μg l 1 162 μg l 1 as iii and 69 μg l 1 as v and a fe level of 8 6 mg l 1 same well as in rahman et al 2014 generally they included the following processes in the models for the injection storage and extraction phases processes during injection and storage phases rahman et al 2015 oxidation processes during injection oxidation of dissolved fe ii creates a hfo filter or curtain in the subsurface van halem et al 2010a simultaneously oxidation of as iii to as v and of soil organic matter forming alkalinity not included in the model may occur iron desorption during injection fe ii desorbs from clay and soil surfaces via cation exchange reactions and via surface complexation reactions on hfo wallis et al 2010 sorption reactions during the storage phase as iii as v fe hco3 po4 3 si and to a lesser degree other ions sorb via surface complexation reactions to initially present and newly formed hfo wallis et al 2010 2011 processes during extraction phase rahman et al 2015 sorption reactions the hfo curtain filters out as and other ions until the maximum capacity is reached and arsenic breakthrough occurs appelo and de vet 2003 competitive sorption processes when native groundwater flows towards the sar well during the extraction phases other ions such as fe ii h c o 3 p o 4 3 and silicate sorb at the same time with as iii and as v this simultaneous sorption limits the removal of as during extraction fe ii also sorbs to the cation exchanger clay minerals and organic matter via cation exchange reactions the authors summarized that their model gave reasonable results for measured concentrations of as fe ii mn ii si mg na and k in the extracted water of the studied sar well therefore they concluded that the key processes taking place were modeled correctly using their theoretical approach the as removal during sar operation was improved by high ph and fe levels in the injection water as well as multiple injection extraction cycles of an equal water volume particularly co2 degassing during aeration resulted in higher ph of injection water and therefore increased the as sorption oxidation of as iii during sar operation further contributed to better removal since as v is preferentially removed from the water the surface complexation modeling recorded that simultaneous sorption of h4sio4 particularly is an important factor for limiting as removal during sar the model was also successfully applied to simulate subsurface as removal at two other subsurface wells in bangladesh and it was pointed out that the general trend of the model is to underestimate sar performance regarding as removal which gives a conservative estimate from a practical point of view however so far the model is limited to locations with similar aquifer characteristics to the two wells studied in bangladesh i e similar hydrogeochemical conditions the model still needs to be generalized in order to also simulate sar performance of other wells with different aquifer characteristics worldwide this overview shows some of the advances made for the modeling of such complex systems however the multi component effects occurring in natural environments still need to be verified future multiphase multi species and reactive kinetic transport modeling is needed which also considers modeling of coupled redox systems and conversions between different species of the same element in particular of as fe mn n p o organic matter also soluble complexes and the modeling of biological activity and bacteria triggered geochemical reactions such has not been considered so far in the model by rahman et al 2015 which modeled cation exchange precipitation of hfo and surface complexation as equilibrium processes nonetheless this modeling included oxidation of fe ii and as iii using kinetic rate expressions that were not considered in the work of appelo and de vet 2003 3 conclusion a variety of pilot scale trials on subsurface arsenic removal sar by aeration have been conducted mostly in bangladesh and india unlike subsurface iron removal sir which has been proven for many years as technically feasible they have shown that sar is not yet an established solution since it shows vulnerability to diverse geochemical conditions e g ph and fe as ratio high concentrations of co ions e g phosphates carbonates silicates can also significantly reduce the arsenic removal rate due to similar adsorption mechanisms however the who limit 10 μg l 1 can be reached with proper injection water volumes and sufficient cycle times the addition of fe ii is an alternative for the in situ treatment of arsenic that showed improvement on the arsenic removal efficiency nonetheless sar technologies offer the major advantage of negligible waste production and hence the potential of being the only sustainable long term treatment option currently available 4 future prospects and recommendations for better understanding of sar processes further studies through pilot trials to obtain long term experiences are necessary the most important aspects for the proper technical operation of a sar process must include 1 an efficient aeration system to ensure complete air saturation in infiltration water 2 controlled infiltration and abstraction volumes to avoid breakthrough of arsenic 3 a guarantee of the continuous long term infiltration of oxygen into the aquifer so that oxidation conditions remain and leaching or breakthrough is prevented before starting any pilot trials the injected to extraction ratio must be determined from a thorough groundwater analysis this should consider not only iron arsenic and manganese but also oxygen consuming agents ammonia methane and competitive ions phosphates silicates etc for better understanding long term experimental trials are mandatory and special focus must be given to the arsenic to iron ratio ph and redox conditions redox measurements in the aquifer are strongly recommended to produce safe drinking water in compliance with the who guideline value sar technology could be combined easily with processes offering a safe barrier such as e g nanofiltration or reverse osmosis where liquid concentrate streams can be also re injected into the subsurface to avoid additional waste production besides sar for drinking water purpose mitigation of groundwater for irrigation of crops is becoming increasingly important in future in order to avoid arsenic accumulation in the food chain however experience with high water demands as needed for agriculture are still needed to assess the economic feasibility of sar process acknowledgements funding this work was done within the joint research project wakap supported by the german federal ministry of education and research grant number

19714,emerging contaminants such as antibiotics pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones and artificial sweeteners are recognized as new classes of water contaminants due to their proven or potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health this review provides comprehensive data on the occurrence of 60 emerging contaminants ecs in influent treated effluent sludge and biosolids in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in particular data on the occurrence of ecs in the influents and effluents of wwtps are systematically summarized and categorized according to geographical regions asia europe and north america the occurrence patterns of ecs in raw influent and treated effluents of wwtps between geographical regions were compared and evaluated concentrations of most ecs in raw influent in asian region tend to be higher than those in european and north american countries many antibiotics were detected in the influents and effluents of wwtps at concentrations close to or exceeding the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for resistance selection the efficacy of ec removal by sorption and biodegradation during wastewater treatment

image keywords antibiotics biodegradation emerging contaminants occurrence sorption wastewater 1 introduction over the last few decades the occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceutically active compounds phacs personal care products pcps artificial sweeteners ass and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs has increasingly received attention due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment and their potential to cause undesirable ecological effects cleuvers 2003 ferrari et al 2003 al aukidy et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2012 verlicchi and zambello 2015 emerging contaminants are introduced to the aquatic environment via a number of routes including direct discharge of raw or treated wastewater from municipal al aukidy et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2012 hospital duong et al 2008 verlicchi et al 2010 and industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtps sewer leakage sewer overflow wolf et al 2012 launay et al 2016 landfill leachate yi et al 2017 and surface runoff from urban or agricultural areas where treated wastewater sludge or manure waste is applied for irrigation activities chee sanford et al 2009 al aukidy et al 2012 sidhu et al 2013 among the aforementioned sources wwtps are of particular interest since they continuously discharge ecs into the environment ecs are frequently detected in both raw influent and treated effluents of wwtps at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l behera et al 2011 aukidy et al 2012 tran et al 2013a 2014a 2014b tran et al 2014d types and concentrations of ecs in influents and effluents also depend on the socioeconomic composition of the population that feeds to the wwtps the presence of ecs in the water environment has been known to potentially affect aquatic organisms and result in changes that threaten the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems jones et al 2004 lapworth et al 2012 for example it was reported that the presence of 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 in the aquatic environment at ng l levels can modulate activity of different physiological endpoints for aquatic organisms e g the activity of acetylcholinesterase ache and glutathione s transferase gst enzymes governing neurotransmission and detoxification systems respectively souza et al 2013 another study found that gst inhibition lipid peroxidation lpo and dna damage were significantly impacted when fish were exposed to the lipid lowering agent gemfibrozil and the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac at environmentally relevant concentrations schmidt et al 2011 continuous discharge and chronic exposure to these chemicals may pose a risk to human health even at trace levels jones et al 2004 another concern is that the presence of ecs such as antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can result in the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and bacteria arb which reduce the therapeutic potential of antibiotics against human and animal pathogens for these reasons the collection of information on the environmental occurrence and fate of ecs in the environment allows an accurate evaluation of the environmental risk associated with these chemicals which target aquatic organisms as well as human the knowledge on the environmental occurrence and fate of several classes of ecs has been documented in earlier studies heberer 2002 kolpin et al 2002 tixier et al 2003 richardson et al 2005 okuda et al 2008 terzic et al 2008 sim et al 2010 in particular a number of efforts has been recently made to summarize the environmental occurrence of several classes of ecs in environmental media such as wastewater michael et al 2013 luo et al 2014 sludge clarke and smith 2011 hamid and eskicioglu 2012 surface water heberer 2002 and groundwater lapworth et al 2012 however almost all information in the review papers of ecs are available only for european and north american countries lange et al 2012 while very little information on the occurrence of ecs is reviewed for the asian region where the population is equivalent to approximately 60 of the total world population furthermore many asian countries china india thailand vietnam etc antibiotics and other drugs can be easily bought and sold in the over the counter market le and munekage 2004 duong et al 2008 yan et al 2014 subedi et al 2015 in addition most of the published review papers have exclusively focused on the occurrence of ecs in the dissolved phase of wastewater samples pal et al 2010 rivera utrilla et al 2013 luo et al 2014 while summarized information on the occurrence and distribution of ecs in the particulate phase sludge and biosolids is still limited clarke and smith 2011 verlicchi and zambello 2015 in particular most reviews have lumped the occurrence data of ecs from all geographical regions into one table figure heberer 2002 verlicchi et al 2012 rivera utrilla et al 2013 luo et al 2014 consequently it is challenging to evaluate the differences in occurrence patterns between geographical regions therefore the first objective of this review is to systematically summarize current knowledge on the environmental occurrence of 60 commonly consumed ecs in raw influent treated effluent sludge and biosolids in wwtps in particular the occurrence of ecs in raw influents and treated effluents of wwtps is systematically categorized according to each geographical region i e asia europe and north america the investigative approach entails compiling the occurrence data of ecs in wwtp influents and effluents collected from published papers related to the monitoring data of ecs in wwtps in asian european and north american countries for the asian region the occurrence data of ecs in wwtps in this review is based on the data availability from countries including japan china south korea india taiwan hong kong thailand malaysia singapore and vietnam similarly the occurrence data of ecs in wwtps for the european regions is based on the information available from countries including germany france italy spain netherland united kingdom switzerland austria greece czech republic norway belgium croatia and luxembourg the second objective of the review is to provide an in depth analysis of the fate of ecs i e sorption and biodegradation through wwtps based on their sorption coefficients kd and biodegradation kinetic constants kbio the third objective of the review aims to identify knowledge gaps and propose research directions for future studies 2 summary of reported ecs concentrations in the dissolved phase of wwtp influents and effluents the monitoring data on the occurrence of numerous ecs in the influents and treated effluents of wwtps have been documented over the last two decades most of these data come from europe ternes 1998 heberer et al 2002 gros et al 2007 stülten et al 2008 kosma et al 2014 north america miao et al 2004 lishman et al 2006 and some countries in northeast asia such as japan nakada et al 2006 okuda et al 2008 south korea kim et al 2007 sim et al 2010 behera et al 2011 subedi et al 2014 and china sui et al 2010 yang et al 2011 gan et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 while very limited data was available until recently for southeast asian countries duong et al 2008 tran et al 2014d 2015 2016 based on the monitoring data from the literature this review paper focuses on the following families of emerging contaminants i antibiotics ii antifungal antimicrobial agents iii nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids iv anticonvulsants antidepressants v artificial sweeteners vi beta adrenoceptor blocking agents vii lipid regulating drugs viii steroidal hormones ix x ray contrast media x uv filters xi stimulants xii anti itching drugs xiii insect repellents xiv plasticizers the ecs studied herein include a large variety of substance families and physicochemical properties the selection of these classes of emerging contaminants was based on the following criteria i high consumption worldwide ii high detection frequencies in wastewater iii potential risks to ecosystems and human health and iv the availability of the analytical data 2 1 occurrence of antibiotics in wwtps over the last few decades antibiotics has been recognized as a new class of water contaminants of emerging concern due to their adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems kummerer 2009 however the greatest concern of releasing antibiotics to the aquatic environment is probably connected to the evolution of args and arb which reduces the therapeutic potential against human and animal pathogens it has been reported that approximately 50 90 percent of antibiotics administered by humans or animals are excreted via urine and feces as a mixture of the parent compound and its metabolite forms e g glucuronides kummerer 2009 tran et al 2016 these compounds are then carried to wwtps where some of them can be partially eliminated or pass the process unchanged table 1 shows the concentrations of 21 selected antibiotics in the dissolved phase of influent and treated effluent samples collected at wwtps from different geographical regions in the world these antibiotics belonging to nine commonly used classes for humans and animals include i β lactams ceftazidime meropenem and amoxicillin ii fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin iii lincosamides lincomycin and clindamycin iv macrolides erythromycin erythromycin h2o azithromycin clarithromycin and tylosin v sulfonamides sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole vi reductase inhibitor trimethoprim vii tetracycline family tetracycline minocycline chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline viii glycopeptide vancomycin ix amphenicol chloramphenicol as shown in table 1 the concentration of antibiotics in wwtp influent and effluent samples varied significantly from below the method quantification limit mql to a few tens of micrograms per liter depending on the compound type of wastewater sample sampling site and sampling date among the classes of antibiotics investigated sulfonamides fluoroquinolones macrolides and trimethoprim were frequently detected in both influent and effluent samples worldwide in contrast the occurrence of β lactams amoxicillin ceftazidime and meropenem tetracyclines e g chlortetracycline minocycline and oxytetracycline chloramphenicol and vancomycin in the influent and effluent was rarely reported for north american and european countries while they were still present in wwtp influent and effluent from asian countries such as china india japan singapore and thailand minh et al 2009 mutiyar and mittal 2013 tran et al 2016 it can be seen from fig 1 that no statically significant difference in the concentrations of ecs in the influents of wwtps was observed between the studied geographical regions for the majority of the investigated antibiotics except for ciprofloxacin which occurs at significantly higher concentrations in the influents of wwtps in north american than those in europe t test p 05 it has been found that the concentrations of antibiotics in influent and effluent depend mainly on usage patterns in each country water consumption per person per day water catchment characteristics e g land use population size and population density weather conditions sewer systems i e combined or separate sewer systems environmental persistence and elimination efficacy of wastewater treatment processes petrovic et al 2009 radjenovic et al 2009 jelic et al 2011 luo et al 2014 tran et al 2016 for example the frequent absence of β lactams i e amoxicillin ceftazidime and meropenem in influent and effluent can be attributed to their high susceptibility to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis in wwtps cha et al 2006 watkinson et al 2007 le minh et al 2010 tran et al 2016 it has been reported that chemical hydrolysis and or chemical transformations of β lactam antibiotics can take place under acidic alkaline conditions or by reactions with weak nucleophiles e g water or metal ions le minh et al 2010 hirte et al 2016 in a recent study hirte et al 2016 found that the half life of amoxicillin in water was 128 2 h under acidic condition ph 3 208 3 h in neutral conditions ph 7 and only 9 7 h in alkaline conditions ph 11 in addition β lactam antibiotics can be enzymatically hydrolyzed by β lactamase this is the reason why in treated wastewater β lactam antibiotics are generally detected at a very low concentration or not detected at all although they are among the most widely used prescribed antibiotics watkinson et al 2007 the data summarized in table 1 reveals the differences in the antibiotic concentrations in the influent and effluent among the studied geographical regions for example chloramphenicol was often absent or present only at low concentrations in the influent of wwtps in european kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 gracia lor et al 2012 or other developed countries tran et al 2016 as it is banned for use in livestock breeding in many developed countries however chloramphenicol was frequently detected in wwtps in china peng et al 2006 minh et al 2009 sui et al 2011 with concentrations up to 2430 ng l in influents and 1050 ng l in effluents the particularly high levels could be explained by the high consumption and easy accessibility of this compound in over the counter markets in general the concentrations of the vast majority of antibiotics in effluents from wwtps in most asian countries particularly with regards to developing countries i e china india thailand and vietnam tend to be higher than those reported in european and north american countries duong et al 2008 tewari et al 2013 tran et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the presence of antibiotics in the influents and effluents of wwtps can promote the development of arb and args to predict no effect concentrations pnecs for resistance selection for each antibiotics the minimal inhibitory concentrations mic are typically used for sensitive pathogenic bacteria kümmerer and henninger 2003 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 it can be seen that the concentrations of many antibiotics detected in the influents and effluents of wwtps table 1 were close to or exceeding the pnecs for resistance selection table 2 furthermore it is well known that bacteria in wwtps as well as in the environment are likely to be exposed to mixtures of antibiotics rather than single substances which may ower the minimal sensitive concentrations bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 apart from resistance selection the presence of antibiotics in the influent of wwtps can also directly influence the microbial activities and wastewater treatment performance for example gonzalez martinez et al 2014 reported that the presence of ciprofloxacin induced a deterioration of the partial nitrification process even at a relatively low concentration i e 350 ng l in addition the discharge of effluents containing antibiotics into the receiving water bodies can pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms verlicchi et al 2012 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 rivera jaimes et al 2017 the concentrations of numerous antibiotics in the effluents were higher than their predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 2 2 occurrence of antifungal antimicrobial agents in wwtps similar to the case of antibiotics the presence of antifungal and antimicrobial agents in aquatic environments has been recognized as contaminants of emerging concerns due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms and the development of args and arb antifungal and antimicrobial agents i e miconazole thiabendazole triclocarban and triclosan are widely used in household products such as hair shampoos dermal creams soaps toothpastes and shower gels in addition miconazole and thiabendazole are commonly used in therapeutic products tablets aerosol sprays and ointments to treat fungal infection in human after consumption these compounds are flushed into sewer systems as such domestic sewage is the main pollution source of antifungal and antimicrobial agents contributing to the receiving water bodies the occurrence of four selected antifungal and antimicrobial agents i e miconazole thiabendazole triclocarban and triclosan in wwtps from different geographical regions is shown in table 1 the concentrations of antifungal and antimicrobial agents in the influent fluctuated substantially from below mql to several micrograms per liter depending upon the compound and sampling site for instance the concentrations of antimicrobial agents i e triclocarban and triclosan appear to be higher than those of antifungal compounds e g miconazole thiabendazole by 1 3 orders of magnitude in effluent the levels of most antifungal and antimicrobial agents except triclocarban are much lower than in the influent mostly varying from below mql to a few hundreds of nanogram per liter table 1 the maximum concentration of triclocarban 5860 ng l was noted at a wwtp in india subedi et al 2015 in general the concentrations of triclocarban and triclosan within influents and effluents of wwtps from the asian region e g china appeared to be higher than those in european and north american countries generally the concentrations of triclosan and triclocarban in the influents and effluents of wwtps were often higher than their predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for aquatic organisms table 2 as such the direct discharge of raw influents or treated effluents containing these drugs may pose a considerable threat to aquatic ecosystems 2 3 occurrence of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs in wwtps out of the classes of ecs investigated in monitoring studies nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are the most studied class of ecs in this paper we reviewed nine most commonly used nsaids including acetaminophen codeine diclofenac fenoprofen ibuprofen indomethacin ketoprofen naproxen and salicylic acid these pharmaceuticals are widely used to relieve pain or suppress inflammation and are often detected in the influents of wwtps at concentrations up to several hundreds of micrograms per liter miège et al 2009 for example miège et al 2009 reported that the maximum concentrations of ibuprofen acetaminophen and naproxen detected in the influent of wwtps were 83 3 292 and 611 μg l respectively it can be found from worldwide monitoring data that acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen appear to be the most abundant nsaids detected in influents table 1 the distribution tendencies of nsaids in influents seem to be associated with their consumption patterns for example acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen are known to be the most widely used non prescription nsaids to relieve pain swelling fever cold flu symptoms and headaches by contrast prescription nsaids e g fenoprofen diclofenac indomethacin and ketoprofen are used in lower quantities and are found at lower concentrations compared to non prescribed nsaids acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen it can be seen from table 1 and fig 1 that there is a large variation in the concentrations of nsaids within influent samples collected from different wwtps in a study area or in different geographical regions for example acetaminophen was found within influent wastewater in asian region at concentrations ranging from 67 to 147 700 ng l choi et al 2008 tewari et al 2013 sun et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 yang et al 2017 similarly the concentrations of ibuprofen in the influents of wwtps in europe varied substantially from below method quantification limit mql to 482 687 ng l kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 miège et al 2009 kosma et al 2010 2014 papageorgiou et al 2016 the concentrations of acetaminophen within the influents from wwtps in north american countries were significantly higher t test p 05 than those detected in asian and european regions fig 1 for other nsaids there is no significant difference t test p 05 in the concentrations in the influents of wwtps between the investigated geographical regions fig 1 the substantial variation in the level of nsaids among geographical regions could be due to the differences in usage patterns in each region climate conditions wet dry winter or summer population size density and sampling mode all these factors will contribute to the variability of nsaids as well as other ecs in the aquatic environment for example tran et al 2016 found high levels of ecs in raw influent of wwtps in a highly urbanized region generally the concentrations of selected nsaids e g acetaminophen diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen and salicylic acid in the influents and effluents of wwtps were frequently higher than their pnecs for the aquatic ecosystems in all the three regions table 2 consequently the discharges of raw influents and effluents of wwtps into the receiving water bodies could pose potential long term risks to aquatic ecosystems 2 4 occurrence of lipid regulators in wwtps earlier monitoring studies showed that lipid regulating drugs such as bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals within influent and effluent of wwtps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 kosma et al 2010 2014 rosal et al 2010 kosma et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the concentrations of lipid regulating drugs in influent and effluent of wwtps varied significantly from below mql to 17 055 ng l and from below mql to 5233 ng l respectively depending on the compound and sampling area kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 kosma et al 2010 2014 rosal et al 2010 kosma et al 2014 papageorgiou et al 2016 for example clofibric acid main metabolite of clofibrate was often not detected or found in the influent at a substantially lower concentration than bezafibrate or gemfibrozil metcalfe et al 2003 lishman et al 2006 kosma et al 2010 behera et al 2011 papageorgiou et al 2016 this is related to its lower usage compared to other lipid regulating drugs e g simvastatin bezafibrate and gemfibrozil similar to aforementioned pharmaceutical families there are differences in the concentrations of lipid regulating drugs between geographical regions table 1 for instance the median concentration of gemfibrozil detected within the influent of wwtps in asian countries tend to be lower than that in european and north american regions by two orders of magnitude fig 1 the difference may be related to the demographical patterns and obesity rate of each region north america and europe countries have a significantly higher obesity rate than asian countries such as china india japan and korea oedc 2014 lipid regulators are also prescribed to prevent heart disease mainly caused by junk food and high sugar consumption consequently the consumption pattern of lipid regulating drugs in north america and europe is likely to be higher than that in asia the concentrations of bezafibrate and gemfibrozil detected in both the influents and effluents of wwtps from european countries were often higher than their pnecs for aquatic organisms table 2 indicating that the continuous discharge of effluents into the receiving water bodies rivers lakes can pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms 2 5 occurrence of beta adrenoceptor blocking agents in wwtps beta adrenoceptor blocking agents i e beta blockers are widely used to treat a variety of conditions such as high blood pressure hypertension and migraines beta blockers have been reported to be found ubiquitously in influents and effluents of wwtps at trace levels ranging from a few ng l to several hundred μg l behera et al 2011 tewari et al 2013 mohapatra et al 2016 sun et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 for example mohapatra et al 2016 reported that the concentration of atenolol in the influents of wwtps in india could go up to 294 700 ng l probably due to disposal of unused drug table 1 shows the concentrations of three widely used beta blockers including atenolol metoprolol and propranolol in influents and effluents of wwtps in different geographical regions of the three beta blockers investigated atenolol was consistently found in influents and effluents of wwtps at the highest concentration followed by metoprolol and propranolol table 1 in fact the high levels of atenolol in influents and effluents are explained by its high dispension and its high excretion rates as an unchanged drug 50 compared with the other beta blockers investigated i e metoprolol and propranolol excretion as unchanged drugs of approximately 15 and 0 5 respectively kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 evgenidou et al 2015 the concentrations of atenolol detected within the influents of wwtps in asian countries were significantly higher t test p 05 than those found in europe and north american fig 1 the concentrations of beta blockers i e atenolol and propranolol in the effluents of wwtps in the investigated geographical regions could be in some cases higher than their pnecs to aquatic organisms table 2 as a result the continuous discharge of the effluents into the environment could pose a long term threat to aquatic ecosystems 2 6 occurrence of antiepileptic antipsychotic drugs in wwtps antiepileptic and antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed together for treatment of depression in patients with epilepsy it was estimated that approximately 11 of americans aged 12 and above took antidepressant medication and antidepressant drugs were the third most common prescription drug taken by americans of all ages in 2005 2008 and most frequently used by persons aged 18 44 years pratt et al 2011 earlier studies in europe and north america have shown that carbamazepine gabapentin and sulpiride are the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals within influents and effluents of wwtps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 behera et al 2011 writer et al 2013 gurke et al 2015 subedi et al 2015 sun et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 yang et al 2017 as shown in table 1 the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals detected in influents and effluents of wwtps varied significantly from below mql to upper ten thousands of ng l clara et al 2005a kahle et al 2009 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 miège et al 2009 kosma et al 2014 gurke et al 2015 bollmann et al 2016 depending on the usage pattern of each compound temporal and spatial variability the concentrations of antiepileptic antipsychotic drugs e g carbamazepine gabapentin and sulpiride detected in the effluents of wwtps in the studied geographical regions were often higher than their pnecs to aquatic organisms table 2 thus posing potential risks to aquatic ecosystems 2 7 occurrence of estrogens in wwtps over the last few decades estrogenic hormones excreted by humans have emerged as a novel class of water contaminant of great concern since these substances cause endocrine disruption and negatively affect the sexual and reproductive systems in wildlife fish and humans gross sorokin et al 2006 gabet giraud et al 2010 chang et al 2011 hamid and eskicioglu 2012 the occurrence of estrogens in wastewater has been reported in previous studies radjenovic et al 2009 gabet giraud et al 2010 in which both natural i e estrone and 17 β estradiol and synthetic 17 α ethinylestradiol hormones were identified as the main substances responsible for estrogenic activities in wwtps the concentrations of natural i e estrone and estriol and synthetic 17 α ethinylestradiol hormones in influents and effluents of wttps ranged from below mql to several hundreds of ng l table 1 in general the concentrations of both natural and synthetic estrogens e g estrone 17 β estradiol and 17 α ethinylestradiol in the effluents of wwtps in asian and european countries sometimes exceeded their pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 implying possible risks to aquatic ecosystems 2 8 occurrence of x ray contrast media in wwtps iodinated x ray contrast media icm are the most widely used pharmaceuticals for intravascular administration in hospitals with a relatively high dosage approximately 200 g examination kormos et al 2011 annual consumption of iodinated x ray contrast media in the world was about 3 5 106 kg pérez and barceló 2007 in addition to consumption of large amounts in hospitals x ray contrast media exhibit a high biochemical stability and therefore are excreted via urine and faeces mainly in non metabolized forms ternes and hirsch 2000 x ray contrast media have been frequently detected in influents and effluents of wwtps with an upper concentration of 10 μg l table 1 a large variation in influent wastewater concentrations was observed for some x ray contrast media for example iopromide was found within influent wastewater at concentrations varying from below mql to 12 200 ng l indicating large variation in their usage in addition the concentrations of x ray contrast media in influents of wwtps depend on the water catchment characteristics i e land use patterns population size and density or sampling strategies e g grab or composite sampling methods for example tran and gin 2017 recently found that high concentrations of iohexol and iopamidol were observed in wwtps in an urban area with numerous hospitals most x ray contrast media except iopamidol are bio transformed throughout conventional wwtps as such the concentrations of x ray contrast media iohexol iopromide and iomeprol in effluents of wwtps tend to be lower than in influents the concentrations of x ray contrast media in both the influents and effluents of wwtps in the investigated regions were significantly lower than their pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 to date the impacts of x ray contrast media at trace levels ng l μ g l on the aquatic ecosystems are not yet understood several studies reported that x ray contrast media i e iopromide did not pose risk to aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations steger hartmann et al 1999 haiss and kummerer 2006 however it is still unknown whether there are combined toxic effects between x ray contrast media and other ecs on aquatic organisms furthermore the toxicity of transformation products of x ray contrast media have not been addressed yet 2 9 occurrence of uv filters in wwtps organic uv filters are not only used in sunscreen products but also in other personal care products such as cosmetics beauty creams skin lotions lipsticks hair sprays dyes shampoo etc balmer et al 2005 gago ferrero et al 2011 after being used uv filters can enter the aquatic environment via two main routes i direct inputs via water recreational activities e g swimming and bathing in lakes and rivers balmer et al 2005 and ii indirect inputs from showering wash off and laundering via wwtps li et al 2007 gago ferrero et al 2011 tsui et al 2014 in earlier monitoring studies in europe and asia it was found that some organic uv filters e g octocrylene and oxybenzone were omnipresent in influents of wwtps with concentrations ranging from below mql to several thousands of ng l balmer et al 2005 li et al 2007 rosal et al 2010 tsui et al 2014 subedi et al 2015 the concentrations of uv filters within influents of wwtps varied significantly from location to location and with time of day week and season for example li et al 2007 found that the concentrations of uv filters such as i e oxybenzone octocrylene and 4 methylbenzylidence camphor appeared to be higher in hot weather july and september than those in cold weather february the presence of uv filters in the water environment has been considered to be toxic to aquatic organisms coronado et al 2008 langford et al 2015 for example coronado et al 2008 found that the uv filter oxybenzone could alter endocrine or reproduction endpoints of japanese medaka fish table 1 shows that the concentrations of oxybenzone and octocrylene detected in the effluents of wwtps were significantly lower than the lowest observed effective concentration loec of 16 000 ng l coronado et al 2008 however the continuous discharge and chronic exposure to these uv filters may pose a risk to aquatic organisms however data on long term exposure effects are still lacking 2 10 occurrence of artificial sweeteners in wwtps artificial sweeteners have recently been recognized as a new class of water contaminants due to their environmental persistence and potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 huggett and stoddard 2011 mawhinney et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 lange et al 2012 gan et al 2013 subedi and kannan 2014 tran et al 2014a artificial sweeteners are used as sugar substitutes in food additives low calorie beverage dietary food and personal care products e g shampoos and toothpastes in substantial concentrations subedi and kannan 2014 artificial sweeteners pass unchanged through the human body and reach the wwtps at relatively concentrations wwtps are the main source of artificial sweeteners in receiving water bodies buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 tran et al 2015 earlier studies reported that artificial sweeteners are one of the most abundant detected ecs in influents and effluents of wwtps with concentrations up to a few hundreds of μg l table 1 a substantial variation in influent wastewater concentration was noted for the investigated artificial sweeteners for example the concentrations of saccharin in influent of wwtps in fluctuated from 9310 to 389 000 ng l for asia subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 anumol et al 2016 yang et al 2017 1860 25 100 ng l for north america subedi and kannan 2014 and 7100 18 000 ng l for europe buerge et al 2009 cyclamate and saccharin are the only artificial sweeteners that are biodegraded during biological wastewater treatment and are therefore rarely detected or only at low level in effluents buerge et al 2009 tran et al 2015 in contrast sucralose and acesulfame were consistently reported to be persistent during conventional wwtps buerge et al 2009 subedi and kannan 2014 so far there is little information reported on the toxicity of artificial sweeteners e g acesulfame and sucralose to aquatic organisms and human health at environmentally relevant concentrations huggett and stoddard 2011 tollefsen et al 2012 wiklund et al 2012 however sucralose is a chlorinated molecule that may be toxic or unusable for plant metabolism amy sagers et al 2017 consequently continuous discharge and simultaneously chronic exposure to artificial sweeteners their transformation products and other ecs may increasingly pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems 2 11 occurrence of other classes of ecs in wwtps other classes of emerging contaminants such as stimulants e g caffeine anti itching medication e g crotamiton insect repellents e g deet and plasticizers e g bisphenol a have been found ubiquitously in influents and effluents of wwtps in many countries table 1 the concentrations of these substances in influents of wwtps varied significantly ranging from below mql to upper hundred μg l for example caffeine was omnipresent in influents of wwtps in europe at concentrations ranging from 7000 to 113 200 ng l while crotamiton was only detected at lower levels mql 140 ng l deet was ubiquitously detected in influents of wwtps in north america at concentrations 200 42 334 ng l the concentrations of caffeine and bisphenol a in the effluents of wwtps from the studied geographical regions were often higher than their pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 indicating that the continuous discharge of effluents into the receiving water bodies may pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems 3 occurrence of ecs in sewage sludge and biosolids in wwtps to date most studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps have focused solely on the dissolved phase of influents and effluents duong et al 2008 sim et al 2010 tran et al 2014a 2014b 2014d while the occurrence and fate of these chemicals in the particulate phase i e sewage sludge treated sludge has rarely been documented martin et al 2012 subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 probably due to the lack of suitable sensitive analytical methods and the complexity of the matrix however the analysis of ecs in particulate phase is crucial for evaluating their fate and possible impacts on the environment previous studies reported frequent occurrence of ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin chlortetracycline oxytetracycline tetracycline triclocarban and triclosan in sewage sludge and biosolids from wwtps at relatively high concentrations i e μg g dry weight dw mcclellan and halden 2010 guerra et al 2014 for example mcclellan and halden 2010 reported that ciprofloxacin was omnipresent in sewage sludge and biosolids i e treated sewage sludge from wwtps at a concentration up to 160 000 ng g dw similarly the concentrations of chlortetracycline triclocarban and triclosan in biosolids were as high as several tens of μg g dw these results indicate that sewage sludge and biosolids can serve as a major sink of these ecs stressing the importance of sludge management strategies for example the use of sludge and biosolids for irrigation activities may result in the continuous exposure of the agricultural environment to a variety of antibiotics which can provide selective pressure for the development of args and arb chee sanford et al 2009 it can be seen from table 3 that the levels of ecs in sewage sludge and biosolids ranged widely from below mql to greater than 10 μg g dw depending on the compound for example fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin tetracyclines chlortetracycline oxytetracycline minocycline and tetracycline and antimicrobial agents triclocarban and triclosan were the most abundant detected ecs in sewage sludge and biosolids with median concentrations in the upper 1000 ng g dw in contrast β lactams i e amoxicillin meropenem and ceftazidime and glycopeptide vancomycin and chloramphenicol were rarely detected in sewage sludge and or biosolids due to their rapid degradation during wastewater treatment as well as anaerobic digestion of sludge it was found that the concentrations of ecs in sewage sludge biosolids were not only dependent on their usage patterns but also on their physicochemical properties i e hydrophobicity and ionization state and molecular features for example ecs with hydrophobic nature i e log k ow 3 0 such as bisphenol a miconazole oxybenzone octocrylene triclocarban and triclosan tended to heavily partition onto particulate phase as a result they were ubiquitously found in sewage sludge biosolids from wwtps at concentrations 1000 ng g dw table 3 the ecs existing mainly as cations and zwitterion forms under environmental ph of 6 8 such as fluoroquinolones tetracyclines lincosamides beta blockers and macrolides tended to strongly sorb onto sludge and biosolids via electrostatic interactions tran et al 2016 2017 this is one of the reasons resulting in their high concentrations in particulate phase for tetracyclines e g chlortetracycline oxytetracycline minocycline and tetracycline in addition to electrostatic interactions the formation of complexes between these antibiotics with divalent metal cations i e mg2 ca2 and cu2 present in sewage sludge and biosolids also affects their concentrations in particulate phase sludge and biosolids tran et al 2016 salicylic acid is found at high concentration in sewage sluge up to 13 743 ng g dw table 3 despite its hydrophilic characteristics log k ow 3 0 and existence as anion under environmental ph of 6 8 this could be due to the formation of complexes between phenolic group oh in salicylic acid and fe3 present in the sediment in an earlier study ou et al 2010 found that the fe iii sa complex could be formed by ligand exchange between the hydrogen ions in sa and fe iii ions the concentrations of ecs in sludge and biosolids also depend on environmental conditions and the biodegradation ability of the sludge system for example higher concentrations of several ppcps were observed in secondary sludge compared to those in primary sludge this could be interpreted by the hydrolysis of conjugates or by the higher organic matter content of secondary sludge urase and kikuta 2005 in another study martin et al 2012 found that concentrations of most of the studied ppcps i e ibuprofen naproxen ketoprofen salicylic acid sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine propranolol 17 α ethinylestradiol and estriol in sludge were decreased during anaerobic digestion of excess sludge 4 fate of emerging contaminants in municipal wwtps most municipal wwtps are primarily designed to remove organic nutrients such as organic carbonaceous nitrogenous and phosphorus substances they are not necessarily designed to eliminate ecs particularly persistent and toxic ecs such as antibiotics consequently many ecs have been often detected in effluents of wwtps kolpin et al 2002 tran et al 2016 in general the municipal wwtps consist of a primary secondary and occasionally tertiary treatment processes primary treatment aims to reduce the suspended solids i e oils and fats grease sand grit and settable solids but it has been reported that such treatment is usually not effective in eliminating the vast majority of ecs particularly for hydrophilic contaminants log d o w 1 0 a large number of hydrophobic ecs log d o w 3 0 however tend to heavily sorb onto primary sludge and are partially removed from dissolved phase after primary treatment ternes et al 2004 radjenovic et al 2009 martin et al 2012 tsui et al 2014 for example tsui et al 2014 reported that the removal efficiencies for benzophenones group uv filters bp 1 bp 3 bp 4 and bp 8 varied from 10 to 27 after primary treatment similarly lozano et al 2013 also found that over 75 amount of triclocarban and triclosan in the dissolved phase of influents was removed after primary treatment the secondary treatment stage in wwtps is typically designed to remove organic matter and or nutrients based on biological processes i e aerobic and anaerobic systems in this stage ecs are also biologically degraded to varying degrees leading to mineralization or incomplete degradation i e transformation products in secondary treatment biodegradation of ecs can take place via two main mechanisms including metabolism and co metabolism for metabolism microorganisms in activated sludge system use ecs as the sole energy and or carbon source to maintain their biomass and produce the relevant enzymes and cofactors for their oxidation reduction in order to be metabolized by microbes ecs should be non toxic or less harmful to the microbial growth and also be present at a high enough concentration to allow maintenance of biomass while inducing the production of relevant enzymes cofactors involved in the degradation process tran et al 2013b for co metabolism microorganisms are able to degrade ecs i e non growth substrate in the obligatory presence of growth substrate tran et al 2013b to date numerous studies have revealed that biodegradation of ecs in wastewater treatment processes appear to take place via co metabolism rather than the metabolism pathway since many ecs are toxic resistant to microbes and often present in wastewater at trace levels ng l μg l these two characteristics imply that most ecs do not enter catabolic and anabolic pathways of microbial cells in other words the energy resulting from the biodegradation of ecs is not sufficient to support microbial growth and induce the relevant enzymes cofactors involved in the biodegradation thus biodegradation of ecs during wastewater treatment processes largely depends on the presence of primary substrates e g ammonium carbonate salts or organic carbon sources as well as the presence of microorganisms involved in co metabolic degradation tran et al 2013b apart from sorption and biodegradation by activated sludge systems the removal of volatile ecs in wwtps can be associated with volatilization in which volatile ecs can be transferred from dissolved to gaseous phase generally the volatilization process heavily depends on physicochemical properties of the ecs i e henry s law constant and operating conditions of wwtps i e aeration agitation temperature and atmosphere pressure however the henry s law constant for the investigated classes of ecs in this review are less than 10 5 atm m3 mol indicating volatilization is negligible as a removal mechanism for these ecs 4 1 apparent removal of emerging contaminants in municipal wwtps table 4 and fig 2 display the apparent removal range of selected ecs in full scale municipal wwtps from different geographical regions removal efficiencies for the studied ecs varied widely from negative removal to 100 depending on the compound and wwtp fig 2 for example amoxicillin meropenem ciprofloxacin chlortetracycline oxytetracycline minocycline tetracycline acetaminophen ibuprofen fenoprofen naproxen and salicylic acid cyclamate saccharin estrone estriol oxybenzone caffeine deet and bisphenol a tended to be highly removed in biological wwtps with median removal 80 fig 2 in contrast the following compounds lincomycin thiabendazole codeine metoprolol propranolol carbamazepine sulpride sucralose clofibric acid iopamidol and crotamiton appeared to be persistent during biological wastewater treatment processes the median removal efficiency of these compounds were often less than 40 fig 2 it is noteworthy that removal efficiencies of many antibiotics antimicrobials nsaids beta blockers anticonvulsants artificial sweeteners lipid regulators and x ray contrast media can sometimes be negative fig 2 this indicates that concentrations of these ecs in treated effluents were higher than those in raw influent ternes and hirsch 2000 clara et al 2004a behera et al 2011 yang et al 2011 the apparent negative removal efficiencies of ecs could be explained by at least one of the following reasons firstly most of the detected antibiotics and oral drugs in the wastewater samples can be excreted from the human body via urine and feces as a mixture of unchanged parent compounds and conjugates of glucuronic acid jelic et al 2011 osorio et al 2014 zonja et al 2016a 2016b as such these conjugates could undergo enzymatic cleavage to form their parent compounds throughout biological wastewater treatment processes resulting in increased concentrations in treated effluents in an earlier study however zonja et al 2016b found that lamotrigine n2 glucuronide a predominant human metabolite of anticonvulsant lamotrigine lmg could be deconjugated to its parent compound lgm in biological wwtp in addition to the deconjugation route lamotrigine n2 glucuronide may undergo abiotic hydrolysis at ph 7 zonja et al 2016a or oxidation of glucuronide moiety zonja et al 2016b to form other transformation products in another study osorio et al 2014 also reported the co occurrence of diclofenac and its glucuronide diclofenac acyl glucuronides in influent samples at several wwtps in spain in particular the higher concentrations of diclofenac in effluent compared to those in influent were noted at two wwtps besos and riu sec spain this could have resulted from the deconjugation of diclofenac acyl glucuronides to form diclofenac during biological wastewater treatment processes osorio et al 2014 secondly pharmaceuticals excreted via urine and feces could be enclosed in fecal particles in wastewater samples and released gradually during wastewater treatment processes resulting in an increase in apparent concentration in the treated effluent samples gobel et al 2007 finally negative removal and variable removal efficiencies of ecs in full scale wwtps could be simply due to sampling schemes in fact in earlier studies removal efficiencies of ecs estimated for wwtps were based on the grab sampling approach it is widely accepted that grab sampling does not capture the variation of ec concentrations in short or long term since it takes an instantaneous snapshot of the concentration of ecs in the water samples at the time of sampling rodayan et al 2014 i e the hydraulic retention time distribution of wwtp is not taken into consideration consequently this sampling method could cause apparently false removal efficiency when comparing the concentrations between raw influent and treated effluent this is deemed as one of the existing research gaps in accurately evaluating the capacity of wwtps to eliminate ecs alternative sampling strategies e g composite sampling or polar organic chemical integrative sampling methods and removal calculation approaches for further monitoring studies are critically needed rodayan et al 2014 found that the application of a time shifted mass balancing eliminated negative removals obtained with other approaches e g grab sampling composite sampling or polar organic chemical integrative sampling since it allows reliably matching influent load to effluent loads in the calculation of removal of ecs during wwtps in another effort to obtain reliable data on the removal of ecs during wwtps baalbaki et al 2017 used the fractionated approach which compares the mass load of the output stream with a reference mass load of the input stream that takes into account the retention time distribution for estimating the removal of 23 ecs in wwtps 4 2 sorption and its controlling factors in wwtps as aforementioned sorption onto solids can be one of the important mechanisms controlling the removal of ecs in municipal wwtps it may also affect the rate of other processes e g photolysis and biodegradation until now sorption data for a variety of ecs onto activated sludge has been evaluated via laboratory based batch experiments and or field based studies from full scale wwtps urase and kikuta 2005 lozano et al 2013 narumiya et al 2013 table 5 and fig 3 summarize the sorption coefficient k d of ecs onto sludge from the literature it can be seen from fig 3 that k d values reported from different studies showed a great variability particularly for ecs such as clofibric acid diclofenac and indomethacin for example joss et al 2006 and abegglen et al 2009 reported that k d values for clofibric acid were in the ranged from 5 to 7 l kgmlss whereas urase and kikuta 2005 and yan et al 2014 found that its k d varied significantly from 24 to 554 l kgmlss a significant variation in k d value of a compound among studies is likely to be due to the differences in methodology for estimating k d i e difference between lab based experiments and field based monitoring at wwtps for example most of the lab based sorption studies were conducted at ec concentrations ranging from a few tens of μg l to several mg l clara et al 2004b ternes et al 2004 urase and kikuta 2005 yi and harper 2007a b wick et al 2009 which are substantially higher than those found in raw wastewater by 1 3 orders of magnitude another reason could be that previous studies have used single point calculations rather than sorption isotherms for determining kd ternes et al 2004 urase and kikuta 2005 yi and harper jr 2007 radjenovic et al 2009 wick et al 2009 senta et al 2013 subsequently this could result in overestimation underestimation of kd value for ecs in addition the differences in inactivation methods of sludge employed in sorption studies such as chemical inactivation using sodium azide mercury salts clara et al 2004b yi and harper jr 2007 wick et al 2009 or nonchemical inactivation by dry heating technique hörsing et al 2011 could also lead to variability in the k d value furthermore earlier studies have reported that kd values are largely dependent on operational conditions of wwtps such as temperature ph solid retention time srt and reactor configuration for instance lajeunesse et al 2012 found that lower k d values for most antidepressant drugs were observed at a higher temperature in other studies fernandez fontaina et al 2013 and hyland et al 2012 revealed that there was no significant difference in k d values in conventional activated sludge with different sludge ages in contrast jia et al 2012 suggested that k d values were slightly higher in aerobic units than those in anoxic anaerobic units in addition to operational conditions of wwtps sorption of ecs onto sewage sludge biosolids strictly relies on their physiochemical properties i e log k o w pka and ionization state and molecular structures to date it has been widely accepted that ecs with log k o w 4 0 or log d o w 3 0 tend to have high sorption potential onto particulate phase i e k d 1000 l kgmlss while compounds with log k o w 2 5 or log d o w 1 0 often exhibit low sorption potential kd 300 l kgmlss luo et al 2014 ecs with log k o w between 2 5 and 4 or 1 log d o w 3 0 are more likely to have medium sorption potential for example triclosan and triclocarban show higher hydrophobicity i e log k o w 4 2 4 8 or log d o w 4 19 5 27 under environmental ph 6 8 consequently k d values of these compounds are often found to be higher than 1000 l kgmlss to date numerous efforts have been made to elucidate a correlation between k d and physicochemical properties of the chemical of interest and the particulate phase i e sewage sludge biosolids for instance matter muller et al 1980 proposed a correlation between k d and hydrophobicity according to eq 1 1 k d 0 39 0 67 k o w similarly karickhoff 1981 established a relationship among k d k o w and fraction organic carbon in sludge and f o c according to eq 2 2 k d f o c 0 41 k o w it is noted that f o c values largely depend on the type of sludge for primary sludge f o c was assumed to be in the range of 0 3 0 51 verlicchi and zambello 2015 while its values varied from 0 27 to 0 55 in secondary sludge stevens garmon et al 2011 hyland et al 2012 or from 0 02 to 0 136 for pretreated mesophilic digested sludge carballa et al 2008 however one of the drawbacks in the prediction of a k d value for a compound based on eq 1 or eq 2 is that it results in an overestimation of several orders of magnitude for hydrophobic compounds and an underestimation for ionic and polar chemicals particularly for ecs which exist mainly as cations and zwitterions under environmental ph for example fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin or tetracyclines e g chlortetracycline oxytetracycline and tetracycline exhibit hydrophilic characteristics log k o w 2 5 and log d o w 1 0 but they are frequently found to have a high sorption potential onto sludge k d 500 l kgmlss table 5 indeed high sorption capacity of these compounds onto sludge is mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions in addition the formation of complexes between the phenolic groups oh in tetracyclines with divalent metal cations i e mg2 ca2 and cu2 present in sewage sludge and biosolids is one of the mechanisms mainly controlling sorption of these antibiotics onto particulate phase loke et al 2002 carlotti et al 2012 4 3 biodegradation and its controlling factors in wwtps biodegradation has been known to be one of the main mechanisms of removing a large number of ecs in both aqueous and particulate phases during biological wastewater and sludge treatment processes until now biodegradability of a compound has been often evaluated based on its kinetic constant k b i o l l gmlss d or k b i o l h 1 from pseudo first order kinetic models as described in eq 3 and eq 4 3 d c w d t k b i o l c w x a c t i v e 4 d c w d t k b i o l c w t where k b i o l l gmlss d and k b i o l h 1 are the biodegradation constants c w is the concentration of ec in water phase μg l and x a c t i v e is the concentration of active biomass g l in an earlier study joss et al 2006 proposed the following rules to evaluate the biodegradability of ecs based on biodegradation rate k b i o l values compounds with k b i o l 0 01 l gmlss d tend to be persistent during biological wastewater treatment processes i e removal efficiency 20 compounds with k b i o l between 0 1 and 10 l gmlss d were moderately removed by biodegradation processes and their removal efficiencies often ranged from 20 to 90 ecs with k b i o l 10 l gmlss d appeared to be easily biodegraded during biological wastewater treatment processes their removal efficiencies were often greater than 90 table 6 and fig 4 summarize the biodegradation kinetic constants of selected ecs in activated sludge process high median k b i o l value 10 l gmlss d were often observed for acetaminophen ibuprofen estradiol estrone and caffeine indicating that these compounds are easily biodegradable in activated sludge system fig 4 in contrast extremely low k b i o l values have been reported for carbamazepine 0 005 0 389 l gmlss d iopamidol 0 01 2 664 l gmlss d and tetracycline 0 44 l gmlss d suggesting that these chemicals are recalcitrant to biodegradation processes to date numerous efforts have been made to enhance the biodegradation of these persistent pharmaceuticals by using enriched nitrifier culture batt et al 2006 tran et al 2009 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 song et al 2015 or white rot fungal cultures and or their oxidoreductase enzymes such as laccase hata et al 2010 tran et al 2010 zhang and geissen 2012 it has been widely accepted that the biodegradability of a compound k b i o l can be affected by a large number of biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature ph redox potentials availability of the ecs to microorganisms the presence of primary substrates i e ammonium inorganic and organic carbon sources hydraulic retention time microbial diversity heterotrophs and autotrophs physicochemical properties molecular features and toxicity of ecs tadkaew et al 2010 2011 hai et al 2011a hai et al 2011b tadkaew et al 2011 tran et al 2013b 4 3 1 effect of redox conditions on biodegradation of ecs it is widely accepted that redox conditions i e anaerobic anoxic and aerobic play a key role in determining the development of microbial populations in the bioreactor and thus affect the biodegradation efficiency of a given ec alvarino et al 2014 2017 phan et al 2014 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 the degree of degradation is also largely dependent on the chemical structure of target ecs it was found that numerous ecs e g acetaminophen atenolol caffeine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim naproxen estrone estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol could undergo biotransformation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions narumiya et al 2013 alvarino et al 2014 2017 phan et al 2014 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 in contrast several ecs e g ibuprofen roxithromycin erythromycin deet gemfibrozil and triclosan were only biotransformed under aerobic conditions narumiya et al 2013 alvarino et al 2014 2017 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 previous studies also found that better biodegradation i e higher k b i o l value of many ecs e g atenolol gemfibrozil ibuprofen naproxen estrone estradiol erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole was observed under aerobic conditions compared to anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2014 2017 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 this indicates that aerobic tanks in wwtps play an important role in the biodegradation of ecs in wastewater although the anaerobic treatment tank does not seem to contribute much to the overall removal of ecs in wwtps anaerobic systems still exhibit many advantages over aerobic systems such as lower energy requirements production of a rich methane biogas and lower sludge production in particular it was found that improved degradation of several compounds including clofibric acid diclofenac venlafaxine diatrizoate and tramadol was observed under anaerobic conditions zwiener and frimmel 2003 falas et al 2016 currently one of the trends in wastewater treatment technologies is the integration of different redox potentials in a hybrid advanced biological wastewater system e g anaerobic aerobic membrane bioreactor or anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor to enhance the diversity in microbial community nerenberg 2016 lai et al 2017 this allows the degradation of a broad spectrum of ecs while maintaining a high degree of removal for organic matter and nutrients luo et al 2014 phan et al 2014 alvarino et al 2016 semblante et al 2017 4 3 2 effect of microbial populations on the metabolism and co metabolism of ecs hitherto it is widely believed that biodegradation of ecs in wwtps can be referred to both metabolism murdoch and hay 2005 quintana et al 2005 zeng et al 2009 iasur kruh et al 2011 and co metabolism by the relevant microorganisms yi and harper 2007a b pauwels et al 2008 tran et al 2009 2013b in an earlier study zeng et al 2009 found that pseudomonas aeruginosa could transform estradiol via metabolism in another study isaur kruh et al 2011 also observed that enriched estradiol degrading bacteria edb culture or pure culture edb li1 novosphingobium jem 1 was able to degrade estradiol e2 at an initial concentration of 50 mg l as the sole carbon source however the vast majority of ecs are often present in wastewater at trace levels ng l μg l as shown in table 1 in addition many ecs such as antibiotics and antimicrobial agents are toxic and or resistant to the growth of microorganisms for these reasons ecs in wastewater may not be deemed as the sole carbon or energy sources to maintain biomass growth and induce the relevant enzymes for their assimilation in this context the obligatory presence of primary substrates i e ammonium carbonate salts or utilizable organic carbon sources is critically needed to maintain biomass and induce the corresponding enzymes e g ammonia monooxygenase or other oxidative enzymes for biotransformation of ecs to date heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic ammonia oxidizers including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa are the two main microbial groups involved in the biodegradation of ecs during biological wwtps khunjar et al 2011 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 helbling et al 2012 tran et al 2013b men et al 2017 it was consistently reported that autotrophic aob played a key role in the biodegradation of many ecs tran et al 2009 2014c khunjar et al 2011 tran et al 2014c men et al 2017 however previous studies also observed that heterotrophic bacteria also played a significant role in the overall biodegradation of ecs particularly for biodegradable ecs e g acetaminophen bisphenol a ibuprofen trimethoprim etc roh et al 2009 tran et al 2009 de gusseme et al 2011 khunjar et al 2011 in addition it was found that there could be collaboration between autotrophic ammonia oxidizers and heterotrophic bacteria in the enhanced biodegradation of ecs tran et al 2009 khunjar et al 2011 in a previous study tran et al 2013b suggested that enhanced biodegradation of ecs can be implemented by controlling the diversity in microbial community structure i e autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes in activated sludge systems the use of membrane bioreactor mbr in place of conventional activated sludge cas in wwtps is a simple way to control biomass composition which allows enriching slowly growing bacteria such as autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and is expected to enhance the biodegradation of ecs joss et al 2005 kimura et al 2007 radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 until now it is widely accepted that mbr outperforms the cas system in the elimination of many ecs for example it was reported that a higher removal of some ecs e g naproxen diclofenac ketoprofen gemfibrozil propyphenazone fluoxetine ofloxacin atenolol propranolol trimethoprim lincomycin tetracycline etc was observed in mbr systems compared to that in cas systems kimura et al 2007 radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 however other studies found that removal rates in mbr and cas systems were comparable for selected ecs clara et al 2005b joss et al 2005 in particular no significant difference in removal of readily biodegradable i e acetaminophen bisphenol a caffeine and ibuprofen or recalcitrant ecs e g carbamazepine erythromycin iopromide and lincomycin was observed between mbr and cas systems clara et al 2005b joss et al 2005 radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 in recent years biofilm systems such as moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs have been reported to have similar or better removal efficiencies for ecs compared to other technologies i e cas or mbr particularly for x ray contrast media hapeshi et al 2013 casas et al 2015 however the major drawback for mbbr applications is the decrease of sludge settleability which may result in severe operational problems when clarifiers are used for the separation of solids 4 3 3 effect of the presence of primary substrates on the biodegradation of ecs as discussed above biodegradation of ecs is widely assumed to be due to co metabolism by microorganisms this means that biodegradation of ecs tends to be tightly associated with the degradation of primary substrates i e ammonium inorganic organic carbon and other nutrients which serve as energy and carbon source for the growth of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms yi and harper 2007a b fernandez fontaina et al 2013 tran et al 2014c for example fernandez fontaina et al 2012 and tran et al 2014c found that there was a linear relationship between the biodegradation rate constant of ecs i e ppcps and ass and the ammonia oxidation rate in addition the biodegradation rate constant of ecs is known to be dependent on the concentration of primary substrates ammonium or organic substrates in the influent tran et al 2009 2014c helbling et al 2012 for example tran et al 2009 2014c found that higher biodegradation rate constants of most of the investigated ecs were observed under higher concentration of primary substrates 4 3 4 effect of the temperature and ph on the removal of ecs apart from biotic factors abiotic conditions such as temperature and ph of wastewater may also influence the biodegradation of ecs previous studies reported that enhanced removal of ecs could be achieved at warmer temperature due to promoted microbial activities tran et al 2013b luo et al 2014 however hai et al 2011b found that lower removal of ecs was observed at high temperature 45 c similarly ph of wastewater is also known to affect the physiology of microbes solubility of ecs in the aqueous phase and ionization states i e cation anion and zwitterion of ionizable ecs thus influencing the elimination of ecs tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 for example tran et al 2016 and tran and gin 2017 found that several ecs such as atenolol azithromycin erythromycin clarithromycin clindamycin and tylosin mainly exist as cation and zwitterion forms under environmental ph 6 8 consequently these cation forms tend to be easily sorbed onto activated sludge flocs via electrostatic interactions because activated sludge biomass is widely assumed to have negatively charged surfaces in another study urase et al 2005 found that removal of acidic pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen and ketoprofen was strongly affected by ph where higher removal efficiencies of these compounds were observed under slightly acidic conditions ph 5 6 for neutral compounds propyphenazone and carbamazepine however elimination rates were relatively constant and quite independent of the ph of wastewater samples urase et al 2005 tadkaew et al 2010 5 concluding remarks and future perspectives this review provides a comprehensive data on the occurrence of a large number of classes of ecs in wwtps from different geographical regions north america europe and asia in addition the distribution of ecs in sewage sludge and or biosolids and their removal in wwtps were also summarized however most investigations on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps have mainly focused on the dissolved phase while scarce data for the particulate phase i e sewage sludge and biosolids has been documented therefore further studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps should include analyses of particulate phases in addition to the dissolved phase there were large variations in the concentrations of ecs within influent samples collected from different wwtps in a particular study area or between different geographical regions this could be attributed to the differences in usage patterns in each region climate conditions population size density analytical methods and particularly sampling strategies the use of unsuitable sampling schemes could be the greatest weakness for the reported occurrence data in particular most studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps were based on the grab sampling strategy this approach shows limitations since it only provides a snap shot of the ec concentration at a specific point in time to overcome this drawback future studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs should be based on composite sampling method in addition inter day intra day and seasonal variability should be considered in evaluating the occurrence of ecs in wwtps in light of analytical methods sensitive and reliable analytical methods for the quantification of ecs in a variety of environmental samples need to be improved the use of isotopically labelled compounds as internal surrogate standards in analytical procedure is critically needed to compensate the losses of ecs in sample preparation and correct matrix effects in ms ms analyses there are great discrepancies in removal efficiencies of ecs in wwtps between countries and even between wwtps within the same country this could be due to the limitations of previously used sampling methods as such removal performance of full scale wwtps needs to be re evaluated using appropriate sampling methods i e composite sampling strategy or removal calculation approaches e g time shifted mass balancing or fractionated approaches in addition removal performance of ecs in biological wastewater treatment processes should be evaluated using lab scale or pilot scale wwtps conventional wwtps based on activated sludge processes e g cas or mbr systems still exhibit limitations in removing many ecs particularly in terms of persistent compounds e g antibiotics anticonvulsants beta blockers and x ray contrast media although alternative treatment technologies such as moving bed biofilm reactor coupled with membrane bioreactor mbbr mbr or white rot fungal culture enzyme membrane reactor were reported to enhance removal of ecs under lab scale there is no or little information about the performance of these treatment systems under pilot scale or full scale wwtps therefore further evaluation of the performance efficiency of mbbr mbr systems or fungal culture enzyme based reactors in the removal of ecs at full scale is needed in addition further studies on the occurrence and toxicity of transformation products of ecs in both dissolved and particulate phases during wwtps are highly recommended acknowledgements this research was funded by singapore national research foundation nrf under the campus for research excellence

19714,emerging contaminants such as antibiotics pharmaceuticals personal care products hormones and artificial sweeteners are recognized as new classes of water contaminants due to their proven or potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health this review provides comprehensive data on the occurrence of 60 emerging contaminants ecs in influent treated effluent sludge and biosolids in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in particular data on the occurrence of ecs in the influents and effluents of wwtps are systematically summarized and categorized according to geographical regions asia europe and north america the occurrence patterns of ecs in raw influent and treated effluents of wwtps between geographical regions were compared and evaluated concentrations of most ecs in raw influent in asian region tend to be higher than those in european and north american countries many antibiotics were detected in the influents and effluents of wwtps at concentrations close to or exceeding the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for resistance selection the efficacy of ec removal by sorption and biodegradation during wastewater treatment

image keywords antibiotics biodegradation emerging contaminants occurrence sorption wastewater 1 introduction over the last few decades the occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceutically active compounds phacs personal care products pcps artificial sweeteners ass and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs has increasingly received attention due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment and their potential to cause undesirable ecological effects cleuvers 2003 ferrari et al 2003 al aukidy et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2012 verlicchi and zambello 2015 emerging contaminants are introduced to the aquatic environment via a number of routes including direct discharge of raw or treated wastewater from municipal al aukidy et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2012 hospital duong et al 2008 verlicchi et al 2010 and industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtps sewer leakage sewer overflow wolf et al 2012 launay et al 2016 landfill leachate yi et al 2017 and surface runoff from urban or agricultural areas where treated wastewater sludge or manure waste is applied for irrigation activities chee sanford et al 2009 al aukidy et al 2012 sidhu et al 2013 among the aforementioned sources wwtps are of particular interest since they continuously discharge ecs into the environment ecs are frequently detected in both raw influent and treated effluents of wwtps at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l behera et al 2011 aukidy et al 2012 tran et al 2013a 2014a 2014b tran et al 2014d types and concentrations of ecs in influents and effluents also depend on the socioeconomic composition of the population that feeds to the wwtps the presence of ecs in the water environment has been known to potentially affect aquatic organisms and result in changes that threaten the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems jones et al 2004 lapworth et al 2012 for example it was reported that the presence of 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 in the aquatic environment at ng l levels can modulate activity of different physiological endpoints for aquatic organisms e g the activity of acetylcholinesterase ache and glutathione s transferase gst enzymes governing neurotransmission and detoxification systems respectively souza et al 2013 another study found that gst inhibition lipid peroxidation lpo and dna damage were significantly impacted when fish were exposed to the lipid lowering agent gemfibrozil and the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac at environmentally relevant concentrations schmidt et al 2011 continuous discharge and chronic exposure to these chemicals may pose a risk to human health even at trace levels jones et al 2004 another concern is that the presence of ecs such as antibiotics and antimicrobial agents can result in the development of antibiotic resistance genes args and bacteria arb which reduce the therapeutic potential of antibiotics against human and animal pathogens for these reasons the collection of information on the environmental occurrence and fate of ecs in the environment allows an accurate evaluation of the environmental risk associated with these chemicals which target aquatic organisms as well as human the knowledge on the environmental occurrence and fate of several classes of ecs has been documented in earlier studies heberer 2002 kolpin et al 2002 tixier et al 2003 richardson et al 2005 okuda et al 2008 terzic et al 2008 sim et al 2010 in particular a number of efforts has been recently made to summarize the environmental occurrence of several classes of ecs in environmental media such as wastewater michael et al 2013 luo et al 2014 sludge clarke and smith 2011 hamid and eskicioglu 2012 surface water heberer 2002 and groundwater lapworth et al 2012 however almost all information in the review papers of ecs are available only for european and north american countries lange et al 2012 while very little information on the occurrence of ecs is reviewed for the asian region where the population is equivalent to approximately 60 of the total world population furthermore many asian countries china india thailand vietnam etc antibiotics and other drugs can be easily bought and sold in the over the counter market le and munekage 2004 duong et al 2008 yan et al 2014 subedi et al 2015 in addition most of the published review papers have exclusively focused on the occurrence of ecs in the dissolved phase of wastewater samples pal et al 2010 rivera utrilla et al 2013 luo et al 2014 while summarized information on the occurrence and distribution of ecs in the particulate phase sludge and biosolids is still limited clarke and smith 2011 verlicchi and zambello 2015 in particular most reviews have lumped the occurrence data of ecs from all geographical regions into one table figure heberer 2002 verlicchi et al 2012 rivera utrilla et al 2013 luo et al 2014 consequently it is challenging to evaluate the differences in occurrence patterns between geographical regions therefore the first objective of this review is to systematically summarize current knowledge on the environmental occurrence of 60 commonly consumed ecs in raw influent treated effluent sludge and biosolids in wwtps in particular the occurrence of ecs in raw influents and treated effluents of wwtps is systematically categorized according to each geographical region i e asia europe and north america the investigative approach entails compiling the occurrence data of ecs in wwtp influents and effluents collected from published papers related to the monitoring data of ecs in wwtps in asian european and north american countries for the asian region the occurrence data of ecs in wwtps in this review is based on the data availability from countries including japan china south korea india taiwan hong kong thailand malaysia singapore and vietnam similarly the occurrence data of ecs in wwtps for the european regions is based on the information available from countries including germany france italy spain netherland united kingdom switzerland austria greece czech republic norway belgium croatia and luxembourg the second objective of the review is to provide an in depth analysis of the fate of ecs i e sorption and biodegradation through wwtps based on their sorption coefficients kd and biodegradation kinetic constants kbio the third objective of the review aims to identify knowledge gaps and propose research directions for future studies 2 summary of reported ecs concentrations in the dissolved phase of wwtp influents and effluents the monitoring data on the occurrence of numerous ecs in the influents and treated effluents of wwtps have been documented over the last two decades most of these data come from europe ternes 1998 heberer et al 2002 gros et al 2007 stülten et al 2008 kosma et al 2014 north america miao et al 2004 lishman et al 2006 and some countries in northeast asia such as japan nakada et al 2006 okuda et al 2008 south korea kim et al 2007 sim et al 2010 behera et al 2011 subedi et al 2014 and china sui et al 2010 yang et al 2011 gan et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 while very limited data was available until recently for southeast asian countries duong et al 2008 tran et al 2014d 2015 2016 based on the monitoring data from the literature this review paper focuses on the following families of emerging contaminants i antibiotics ii antifungal antimicrobial agents iii nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids iv anticonvulsants antidepressants v artificial sweeteners vi beta adrenoceptor blocking agents vii lipid regulating drugs viii steroidal hormones ix x ray contrast media x uv filters xi stimulants xii anti itching drugs xiii insect repellents xiv plasticizers the ecs studied herein include a large variety of substance families and physicochemical properties the selection of these classes of emerging contaminants was based on the following criteria i high consumption worldwide ii high detection frequencies in wastewater iii potential risks to ecosystems and human health and iv the availability of the analytical data 2 1 occurrence of antibiotics in wwtps over the last few decades antibiotics has been recognized as a new class of water contaminants of emerging concern due to their adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems kummerer 2009 however the greatest concern of releasing antibiotics to the aquatic environment is probably connected to the evolution of args and arb which reduces the therapeutic potential against human and animal pathogens it has been reported that approximately 50 90 percent of antibiotics administered by humans or animals are excreted via urine and feces as a mixture of the parent compound and its metabolite forms e g glucuronides kummerer 2009 tran et al 2016 these compounds are then carried to wwtps where some of them can be partially eliminated or pass the process unchanged table 1 shows the concentrations of 21 selected antibiotics in the dissolved phase of influent and treated effluent samples collected at wwtps from different geographical regions in the world these antibiotics belonging to nine commonly used classes for humans and animals include i β lactams ceftazidime meropenem and amoxicillin ii fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin iii lincosamides lincomycin and clindamycin iv macrolides erythromycin erythromycin h2o azithromycin clarithromycin and tylosin v sulfonamides sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole vi reductase inhibitor trimethoprim vii tetracycline family tetracycline minocycline chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline viii glycopeptide vancomycin ix amphenicol chloramphenicol as shown in table 1 the concentration of antibiotics in wwtp influent and effluent samples varied significantly from below the method quantification limit mql to a few tens of micrograms per liter depending on the compound type of wastewater sample sampling site and sampling date among the classes of antibiotics investigated sulfonamides fluoroquinolones macrolides and trimethoprim were frequently detected in both influent and effluent samples worldwide in contrast the occurrence of β lactams amoxicillin ceftazidime and meropenem tetracyclines e g chlortetracycline minocycline and oxytetracycline chloramphenicol and vancomycin in the influent and effluent was rarely reported for north american and european countries while they were still present in wwtp influent and effluent from asian countries such as china india japan singapore and thailand minh et al 2009 mutiyar and mittal 2013 tran et al 2016 it can be seen from fig 1 that no statically significant difference in the concentrations of ecs in the influents of wwtps was observed between the studied geographical regions for the majority of the investigated antibiotics except for ciprofloxacin which occurs at significantly higher concentrations in the influents of wwtps in north american than those in europe t test p 05 it has been found that the concentrations of antibiotics in influent and effluent depend mainly on usage patterns in each country water consumption per person per day water catchment characteristics e g land use population size and population density weather conditions sewer systems i e combined or separate sewer systems environmental persistence and elimination efficacy of wastewater treatment processes petrovic et al 2009 radjenovic et al 2009 jelic et al 2011 luo et al 2014 tran et al 2016 for example the frequent absence of β lactams i e amoxicillin ceftazidime and meropenem in influent and effluent can be attributed to their high susceptibility to chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis in wwtps cha et al 2006 watkinson et al 2007 le minh et al 2010 tran et al 2016 it has been reported that chemical hydrolysis and or chemical transformations of β lactam antibiotics can take place under acidic alkaline conditions or by reactions with weak nucleophiles e g water or metal ions le minh et al 2010 hirte et al 2016 in a recent study hirte et al 2016 found that the half life of amoxicillin in water was 128 2 h under acidic condition ph 3 208 3 h in neutral conditions ph 7 and only 9 7 h in alkaline conditions ph 11 in addition β lactam antibiotics can be enzymatically hydrolyzed by β lactamase this is the reason why in treated wastewater β lactam antibiotics are generally detected at a very low concentration or not detected at all although they are among the most widely used prescribed antibiotics watkinson et al 2007 the data summarized in table 1 reveals the differences in the antibiotic concentrations in the influent and effluent among the studied geographical regions for example chloramphenicol was often absent or present only at low concentrations in the influent of wwtps in european kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 gracia lor et al 2012 or other developed countries tran et al 2016 as it is banned for use in livestock breeding in many developed countries however chloramphenicol was frequently detected in wwtps in china peng et al 2006 minh et al 2009 sui et al 2011 with concentrations up to 2430 ng l in influents and 1050 ng l in effluents the particularly high levels could be explained by the high consumption and easy accessibility of this compound in over the counter markets in general the concentrations of the vast majority of antibiotics in effluents from wwtps in most asian countries particularly with regards to developing countries i e china india thailand and vietnam tend to be higher than those reported in european and north american countries duong et al 2008 tewari et al 2013 tran et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the presence of antibiotics in the influents and effluents of wwtps can promote the development of arb and args to predict no effect concentrations pnecs for resistance selection for each antibiotics the minimal inhibitory concentrations mic are typically used for sensitive pathogenic bacteria kümmerer and henninger 2003 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 it can be seen that the concentrations of many antibiotics detected in the influents and effluents of wwtps table 1 were close to or exceeding the pnecs for resistance selection table 2 furthermore it is well known that bacteria in wwtps as well as in the environment are likely to be exposed to mixtures of antibiotics rather than single substances which may ower the minimal sensitive concentrations bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 apart from resistance selection the presence of antibiotics in the influent of wwtps can also directly influence the microbial activities and wastewater treatment performance for example gonzalez martinez et al 2014 reported that the presence of ciprofloxacin induced a deterioration of the partial nitrification process even at a relatively low concentration i e 350 ng l in addition the discharge of effluents containing antibiotics into the receiving water bodies can pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms verlicchi et al 2012 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 rivera jaimes et al 2017 the concentrations of numerous antibiotics in the effluents were higher than their predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 2 2 occurrence of antifungal antimicrobial agents in wwtps similar to the case of antibiotics the presence of antifungal and antimicrobial agents in aquatic environments has been recognized as contaminants of emerging concerns due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms and the development of args and arb antifungal and antimicrobial agents i e miconazole thiabendazole triclocarban and triclosan are widely used in household products such as hair shampoos dermal creams soaps toothpastes and shower gels in addition miconazole and thiabendazole are commonly used in therapeutic products tablets aerosol sprays and ointments to treat fungal infection in human after consumption these compounds are flushed into sewer systems as such domestic sewage is the main pollution source of antifungal and antimicrobial agents contributing to the receiving water bodies the occurrence of four selected antifungal and antimicrobial agents i e miconazole thiabendazole triclocarban and triclosan in wwtps from different geographical regions is shown in table 1 the concentrations of antifungal and antimicrobial agents in the influent fluctuated substantially from below mql to several micrograms per liter depending upon the compound and sampling site for instance the concentrations of antimicrobial agents i e triclocarban and triclosan appear to be higher than those of antifungal compounds e g miconazole thiabendazole by 1 3 orders of magnitude in effluent the levels of most antifungal and antimicrobial agents except triclocarban are much lower than in the influent mostly varying from below mql to a few hundreds of nanogram per liter table 1 the maximum concentration of triclocarban 5860 ng l was noted at a wwtp in india subedi et al 2015 in general the concentrations of triclocarban and triclosan within influents and effluents of wwtps from the asian region e g china appeared to be higher than those in european and north american countries generally the concentrations of triclosan and triclocarban in the influents and effluents of wwtps were often higher than their predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for aquatic organisms table 2 as such the direct discharge of raw influents or treated effluents containing these drugs may pose a considerable threat to aquatic ecosystems 2 3 occurrence of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs in wwtps out of the classes of ecs investigated in monitoring studies nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are the most studied class of ecs in this paper we reviewed nine most commonly used nsaids including acetaminophen codeine diclofenac fenoprofen ibuprofen indomethacin ketoprofen naproxen and salicylic acid these pharmaceuticals are widely used to relieve pain or suppress inflammation and are often detected in the influents of wwtps at concentrations up to several hundreds of micrograms per liter miège et al 2009 for example miège et al 2009 reported that the maximum concentrations of ibuprofen acetaminophen and naproxen detected in the influent of wwtps were 83 3 292 and 611 μg l respectively it can be found from worldwide monitoring data that acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen appear to be the most abundant nsaids detected in influents table 1 the distribution tendencies of nsaids in influents seem to be associated with their consumption patterns for example acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen are known to be the most widely used non prescription nsaids to relieve pain swelling fever cold flu symptoms and headaches by contrast prescription nsaids e g fenoprofen diclofenac indomethacin and ketoprofen are used in lower quantities and are found at lower concentrations compared to non prescribed nsaids acetaminophen ibuprofen and naproxen it can be seen from table 1 and fig 1 that there is a large variation in the concentrations of nsaids within influent samples collected from different wwtps in a study area or in different geographical regions for example acetaminophen was found within influent wastewater in asian region at concentrations ranging from 67 to 147 700 ng l choi et al 2008 tewari et al 2013 sun et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 yang et al 2017 similarly the concentrations of ibuprofen in the influents of wwtps in europe varied substantially from below method quantification limit mql to 482 687 ng l kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 miège et al 2009 kosma et al 2010 2014 papageorgiou et al 2016 the concentrations of acetaminophen within the influents from wwtps in north american countries were significantly higher t test p 05 than those detected in asian and european regions fig 1 for other nsaids there is no significant difference t test p 05 in the concentrations in the influents of wwtps between the investigated geographical regions fig 1 the substantial variation in the level of nsaids among geographical regions could be due to the differences in usage patterns in each region climate conditions wet dry winter or summer population size density and sampling mode all these factors will contribute to the variability of nsaids as well as other ecs in the aquatic environment for example tran et al 2016 found high levels of ecs in raw influent of wwtps in a highly urbanized region generally the concentrations of selected nsaids e g acetaminophen diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen and salicylic acid in the influents and effluents of wwtps were frequently higher than their pnecs for the aquatic ecosystems in all the three regions table 2 consequently the discharges of raw influents and effluents of wwtps into the receiving water bodies could pose potential long term risks to aquatic ecosystems 2 4 occurrence of lipid regulators in wwtps earlier monitoring studies showed that lipid regulating drugs such as bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals within influent and effluent of wwtps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 kosma et al 2010 2014 rosal et al 2010 kosma et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the concentrations of lipid regulating drugs in influent and effluent of wwtps varied significantly from below mql to 17 055 ng l and from below mql to 5233 ng l respectively depending on the compound and sampling area kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 kosma et al 2010 2014 rosal et al 2010 kosma et al 2014 papageorgiou et al 2016 for example clofibric acid main metabolite of clofibrate was often not detected or found in the influent at a substantially lower concentration than bezafibrate or gemfibrozil metcalfe et al 2003 lishman et al 2006 kosma et al 2010 behera et al 2011 papageorgiou et al 2016 this is related to its lower usage compared to other lipid regulating drugs e g simvastatin bezafibrate and gemfibrozil similar to aforementioned pharmaceutical families there are differences in the concentrations of lipid regulating drugs between geographical regions table 1 for instance the median concentration of gemfibrozil detected within the influent of wwtps in asian countries tend to be lower than that in european and north american regions by two orders of magnitude fig 1 the difference may be related to the demographical patterns and obesity rate of each region north america and europe countries have a significantly higher obesity rate than asian countries such as china india japan and korea oedc 2014 lipid regulators are also prescribed to prevent heart disease mainly caused by junk food and high sugar consumption consequently the consumption pattern of lipid regulating drugs in north america and europe is likely to be higher than that in asia the concentrations of bezafibrate and gemfibrozil detected in both the influents and effluents of wwtps from european countries were often higher than their pnecs for aquatic organisms table 2 indicating that the continuous discharge of effluents into the receiving water bodies rivers lakes can pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms 2 5 occurrence of beta adrenoceptor blocking agents in wwtps beta adrenoceptor blocking agents i e beta blockers are widely used to treat a variety of conditions such as high blood pressure hypertension and migraines beta blockers have been reported to be found ubiquitously in influents and effluents of wwtps at trace levels ranging from a few ng l to several hundred μg l behera et al 2011 tewari et al 2013 mohapatra et al 2016 sun et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 for example mohapatra et al 2016 reported that the concentration of atenolol in the influents of wwtps in india could go up to 294 700 ng l probably due to disposal of unused drug table 1 shows the concentrations of three widely used beta blockers including atenolol metoprolol and propranolol in influents and effluents of wwtps in different geographical regions of the three beta blockers investigated atenolol was consistently found in influents and effluents of wwtps at the highest concentration followed by metoprolol and propranolol table 1 in fact the high levels of atenolol in influents and effluents are explained by its high dispension and its high excretion rates as an unchanged drug 50 compared with the other beta blockers investigated i e metoprolol and propranolol excretion as unchanged drugs of approximately 15 and 0 5 respectively kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 evgenidou et al 2015 the concentrations of atenolol detected within the influents of wwtps in asian countries were significantly higher t test p 05 than those found in europe and north american fig 1 the concentrations of beta blockers i e atenolol and propranolol in the effluents of wwtps in the investigated geographical regions could be in some cases higher than their pnecs to aquatic organisms table 2 as a result the continuous discharge of the effluents into the environment could pose a long term threat to aquatic ecosystems 2 6 occurrence of antiepileptic antipsychotic drugs in wwtps antiepileptic and antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed together for treatment of depression in patients with epilepsy it was estimated that approximately 11 of americans aged 12 and above took antidepressant medication and antidepressant drugs were the third most common prescription drug taken by americans of all ages in 2005 2008 and most frequently used by persons aged 18 44 years pratt et al 2011 earlier studies in europe and north america have shown that carbamazepine gabapentin and sulpiride are the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals within influents and effluents of wwtps kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 behera et al 2011 writer et al 2013 gurke et al 2015 subedi et al 2015 sun et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 yang et al 2017 as shown in table 1 the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals detected in influents and effluents of wwtps varied significantly from below mql to upper ten thousands of ng l clara et al 2005a kahle et al 2009 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 miège et al 2009 kosma et al 2014 gurke et al 2015 bollmann et al 2016 depending on the usage pattern of each compound temporal and spatial variability the concentrations of antiepileptic antipsychotic drugs e g carbamazepine gabapentin and sulpiride detected in the effluents of wwtps in the studied geographical regions were often higher than their pnecs to aquatic organisms table 2 thus posing potential risks to aquatic ecosystems 2 7 occurrence of estrogens in wwtps over the last few decades estrogenic hormones excreted by humans have emerged as a novel class of water contaminant of great concern since these substances cause endocrine disruption and negatively affect the sexual and reproductive systems in wildlife fish and humans gross sorokin et al 2006 gabet giraud et al 2010 chang et al 2011 hamid and eskicioglu 2012 the occurrence of estrogens in wastewater has been reported in previous studies radjenovic et al 2009 gabet giraud et al 2010 in which both natural i e estrone and 17 β estradiol and synthetic 17 α ethinylestradiol hormones were identified as the main substances responsible for estrogenic activities in wwtps the concentrations of natural i e estrone and estriol and synthetic 17 α ethinylestradiol hormones in influents and effluents of wttps ranged from below mql to several hundreds of ng l table 1 in general the concentrations of both natural and synthetic estrogens e g estrone 17 β estradiol and 17 α ethinylestradiol in the effluents of wwtps in asian and european countries sometimes exceeded their pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 implying possible risks to aquatic ecosystems 2 8 occurrence of x ray contrast media in wwtps iodinated x ray contrast media icm are the most widely used pharmaceuticals for intravascular administration in hospitals with a relatively high dosage approximately 200 g examination kormos et al 2011 annual consumption of iodinated x ray contrast media in the world was about 3 5 106 kg pérez and barceló 2007 in addition to consumption of large amounts in hospitals x ray contrast media exhibit a high biochemical stability and therefore are excreted via urine and faeces mainly in non metabolized forms ternes and hirsch 2000 x ray contrast media have been frequently detected in influents and effluents of wwtps with an upper concentration of 10 μg l table 1 a large variation in influent wastewater concentrations was observed for some x ray contrast media for example iopromide was found within influent wastewater at concentrations varying from below mql to 12 200 ng l indicating large variation in their usage in addition the concentrations of x ray contrast media in influents of wwtps depend on the water catchment characteristics i e land use patterns population size and density or sampling strategies e g grab or composite sampling methods for example tran and gin 2017 recently found that high concentrations of iohexol and iopamidol were observed in wwtps in an urban area with numerous hospitals most x ray contrast media except iopamidol are bio transformed throughout conventional wwtps as such the concentrations of x ray contrast media iohexol iopromide and iomeprol in effluents of wwtps tend to be lower than in influents the concentrations of x ray contrast media in both the influents and effluents of wwtps in the investigated regions were significantly lower than their pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 to date the impacts of x ray contrast media at trace levels ng l μ g l on the aquatic ecosystems are not yet understood several studies reported that x ray contrast media i e iopromide did not pose risk to aquatic organisms at environmentally relevant concentrations steger hartmann et al 1999 haiss and kummerer 2006 however it is still unknown whether there are combined toxic effects between x ray contrast media and other ecs on aquatic organisms furthermore the toxicity of transformation products of x ray contrast media have not been addressed yet 2 9 occurrence of uv filters in wwtps organic uv filters are not only used in sunscreen products but also in other personal care products such as cosmetics beauty creams skin lotions lipsticks hair sprays dyes shampoo etc balmer et al 2005 gago ferrero et al 2011 after being used uv filters can enter the aquatic environment via two main routes i direct inputs via water recreational activities e g swimming and bathing in lakes and rivers balmer et al 2005 and ii indirect inputs from showering wash off and laundering via wwtps li et al 2007 gago ferrero et al 2011 tsui et al 2014 in earlier monitoring studies in europe and asia it was found that some organic uv filters e g octocrylene and oxybenzone were omnipresent in influents of wwtps with concentrations ranging from below mql to several thousands of ng l balmer et al 2005 li et al 2007 rosal et al 2010 tsui et al 2014 subedi et al 2015 the concentrations of uv filters within influents of wwtps varied significantly from location to location and with time of day week and season for example li et al 2007 found that the concentrations of uv filters such as i e oxybenzone octocrylene and 4 methylbenzylidence camphor appeared to be higher in hot weather july and september than those in cold weather february the presence of uv filters in the water environment has been considered to be toxic to aquatic organisms coronado et al 2008 langford et al 2015 for example coronado et al 2008 found that the uv filter oxybenzone could alter endocrine or reproduction endpoints of japanese medaka fish table 1 shows that the concentrations of oxybenzone and octocrylene detected in the effluents of wwtps were significantly lower than the lowest observed effective concentration loec of 16 000 ng l coronado et al 2008 however the continuous discharge and chronic exposure to these uv filters may pose a risk to aquatic organisms however data on long term exposure effects are still lacking 2 10 occurrence of artificial sweeteners in wwtps artificial sweeteners have recently been recognized as a new class of water contaminants due to their environmental persistence and potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 huggett and stoddard 2011 mawhinney et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 lange et al 2012 gan et al 2013 subedi and kannan 2014 tran et al 2014a artificial sweeteners are used as sugar substitutes in food additives low calorie beverage dietary food and personal care products e g shampoos and toothpastes in substantial concentrations subedi and kannan 2014 artificial sweeteners pass unchanged through the human body and reach the wwtps at relatively concentrations wwtps are the main source of artificial sweeteners in receiving water bodies buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 tran et al 2015 earlier studies reported that artificial sweeteners are one of the most abundant detected ecs in influents and effluents of wwtps with concentrations up to a few hundreds of μg l table 1 a substantial variation in influent wastewater concentration was noted for the investigated artificial sweeteners for example the concentrations of saccharin in influent of wwtps in fluctuated from 9310 to 389 000 ng l for asia subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 anumol et al 2016 yang et al 2017 1860 25 100 ng l for north america subedi and kannan 2014 and 7100 18 000 ng l for europe buerge et al 2009 cyclamate and saccharin are the only artificial sweeteners that are biodegraded during biological wastewater treatment and are therefore rarely detected or only at low level in effluents buerge et al 2009 tran et al 2015 in contrast sucralose and acesulfame were consistently reported to be persistent during conventional wwtps buerge et al 2009 subedi and kannan 2014 so far there is little information reported on the toxicity of artificial sweeteners e g acesulfame and sucralose to aquatic organisms and human health at environmentally relevant concentrations huggett and stoddard 2011 tollefsen et al 2012 wiklund et al 2012 however sucralose is a chlorinated molecule that may be toxic or unusable for plant metabolism amy sagers et al 2017 consequently continuous discharge and simultaneously chronic exposure to artificial sweeteners their transformation products and other ecs may increasingly pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems 2 11 occurrence of other classes of ecs in wwtps other classes of emerging contaminants such as stimulants e g caffeine anti itching medication e g crotamiton insect repellents e g deet and plasticizers e g bisphenol a have been found ubiquitously in influents and effluents of wwtps in many countries table 1 the concentrations of these substances in influents of wwtps varied significantly ranging from below mql to upper hundred μg l for example caffeine was omnipresent in influents of wwtps in europe at concentrations ranging from 7000 to 113 200 ng l while crotamiton was only detected at lower levels mql 140 ng l deet was ubiquitously detected in influents of wwtps in north america at concentrations 200 42 334 ng l the concentrations of caffeine and bisphenol a in the effluents of wwtps from the studied geographical regions were often higher than their pnecs for ecological toxicity to aquatic organisms table 2 indicating that the continuous discharge of effluents into the receiving water bodies may pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems 3 occurrence of ecs in sewage sludge and biosolids in wwtps to date most studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps have focused solely on the dissolved phase of influents and effluents duong et al 2008 sim et al 2010 tran et al 2014a 2014b 2014d while the occurrence and fate of these chemicals in the particulate phase i e sewage sludge treated sludge has rarely been documented martin et al 2012 subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 probably due to the lack of suitable sensitive analytical methods and the complexity of the matrix however the analysis of ecs in particulate phase is crucial for evaluating their fate and possible impacts on the environment previous studies reported frequent occurrence of ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin chlortetracycline oxytetracycline tetracycline triclocarban and triclosan in sewage sludge and biosolids from wwtps at relatively high concentrations i e μg g dry weight dw mcclellan and halden 2010 guerra et al 2014 for example mcclellan and halden 2010 reported that ciprofloxacin was omnipresent in sewage sludge and biosolids i e treated sewage sludge from wwtps at a concentration up to 160 000 ng g dw similarly the concentrations of chlortetracycline triclocarban and triclosan in biosolids were as high as several tens of μg g dw these results indicate that sewage sludge and biosolids can serve as a major sink of these ecs stressing the importance of sludge management strategies for example the use of sludge and biosolids for irrigation activities may result in the continuous exposure of the agricultural environment to a variety of antibiotics which can provide selective pressure for the development of args and arb chee sanford et al 2009 it can be seen from table 3 that the levels of ecs in sewage sludge and biosolids ranged widely from below mql to greater than 10 μg g dw depending on the compound for example fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin tetracyclines chlortetracycline oxytetracycline minocycline and tetracycline and antimicrobial agents triclocarban and triclosan were the most abundant detected ecs in sewage sludge and biosolids with median concentrations in the upper 1000 ng g dw in contrast β lactams i e amoxicillin meropenem and ceftazidime and glycopeptide vancomycin and chloramphenicol were rarely detected in sewage sludge and or biosolids due to their rapid degradation during wastewater treatment as well as anaerobic digestion of sludge it was found that the concentrations of ecs in sewage sludge biosolids were not only dependent on their usage patterns but also on their physicochemical properties i e hydrophobicity and ionization state and molecular features for example ecs with hydrophobic nature i e log k ow 3 0 such as bisphenol a miconazole oxybenzone octocrylene triclocarban and triclosan tended to heavily partition onto particulate phase as a result they were ubiquitously found in sewage sludge biosolids from wwtps at concentrations 1000 ng g dw table 3 the ecs existing mainly as cations and zwitterion forms under environmental ph of 6 8 such as fluoroquinolones tetracyclines lincosamides beta blockers and macrolides tended to strongly sorb onto sludge and biosolids via electrostatic interactions tran et al 2016 2017 this is one of the reasons resulting in their high concentrations in particulate phase for tetracyclines e g chlortetracycline oxytetracycline minocycline and tetracycline in addition to electrostatic interactions the formation of complexes between these antibiotics with divalent metal cations i e mg2 ca2 and cu2 present in sewage sludge and biosolids also affects their concentrations in particulate phase sludge and biosolids tran et al 2016 salicylic acid is found at high concentration in sewage sluge up to 13 743 ng g dw table 3 despite its hydrophilic characteristics log k ow 3 0 and existence as anion under environmental ph of 6 8 this could be due to the formation of complexes between phenolic group oh in salicylic acid and fe3 present in the sediment in an earlier study ou et al 2010 found that the fe iii sa complex could be formed by ligand exchange between the hydrogen ions in sa and fe iii ions the concentrations of ecs in sludge and biosolids also depend on environmental conditions and the biodegradation ability of the sludge system for example higher concentrations of several ppcps were observed in secondary sludge compared to those in primary sludge this could be interpreted by the hydrolysis of conjugates or by the higher organic matter content of secondary sludge urase and kikuta 2005 in another study martin et al 2012 found that concentrations of most of the studied ppcps i e ibuprofen naproxen ketoprofen salicylic acid sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine propranolol 17 α ethinylestradiol and estriol in sludge were decreased during anaerobic digestion of excess sludge 4 fate of emerging contaminants in municipal wwtps most municipal wwtps are primarily designed to remove organic nutrients such as organic carbonaceous nitrogenous and phosphorus substances they are not necessarily designed to eliminate ecs particularly persistent and toxic ecs such as antibiotics consequently many ecs have been often detected in effluents of wwtps kolpin et al 2002 tran et al 2016 in general the municipal wwtps consist of a primary secondary and occasionally tertiary treatment processes primary treatment aims to reduce the suspended solids i e oils and fats grease sand grit and settable solids but it has been reported that such treatment is usually not effective in eliminating the vast majority of ecs particularly for hydrophilic contaminants log d o w 1 0 a large number of hydrophobic ecs log d o w 3 0 however tend to heavily sorb onto primary sludge and are partially removed from dissolved phase after primary treatment ternes et al 2004 radjenovic et al 2009 martin et al 2012 tsui et al 2014 for example tsui et al 2014 reported that the removal efficiencies for benzophenones group uv filters bp 1 bp 3 bp 4 and bp 8 varied from 10 to 27 after primary treatment similarly lozano et al 2013 also found that over 75 amount of triclocarban and triclosan in the dissolved phase of influents was removed after primary treatment the secondary treatment stage in wwtps is typically designed to remove organic matter and or nutrients based on biological processes i e aerobic and anaerobic systems in this stage ecs are also biologically degraded to varying degrees leading to mineralization or incomplete degradation i e transformation products in secondary treatment biodegradation of ecs can take place via two main mechanisms including metabolism and co metabolism for metabolism microorganisms in activated sludge system use ecs as the sole energy and or carbon source to maintain their biomass and produce the relevant enzymes and cofactors for their oxidation reduction in order to be metabolized by microbes ecs should be non toxic or less harmful to the microbial growth and also be present at a high enough concentration to allow maintenance of biomass while inducing the production of relevant enzymes cofactors involved in the degradation process tran et al 2013b for co metabolism microorganisms are able to degrade ecs i e non growth substrate in the obligatory presence of growth substrate tran et al 2013b to date numerous studies have revealed that biodegradation of ecs in wastewater treatment processes appear to take place via co metabolism rather than the metabolism pathway since many ecs are toxic resistant to microbes and often present in wastewater at trace levels ng l μg l these two characteristics imply that most ecs do not enter catabolic and anabolic pathways of microbial cells in other words the energy resulting from the biodegradation of ecs is not sufficient to support microbial growth and induce the relevant enzymes cofactors involved in the biodegradation thus biodegradation of ecs during wastewater treatment processes largely depends on the presence of primary substrates e g ammonium carbonate salts or organic carbon sources as well as the presence of microorganisms involved in co metabolic degradation tran et al 2013b apart from sorption and biodegradation by activated sludge systems the removal of volatile ecs in wwtps can be associated with volatilization in which volatile ecs can be transferred from dissolved to gaseous phase generally the volatilization process heavily depends on physicochemical properties of the ecs i e henry s law constant and operating conditions of wwtps i e aeration agitation temperature and atmosphere pressure however the henry s law constant for the investigated classes of ecs in this review are less than 10 5 atm m3 mol indicating volatilization is negligible as a removal mechanism for these ecs 4 1 apparent removal of emerging contaminants in municipal wwtps table 4 and fig 2 display the apparent removal range of selected ecs in full scale municipal wwtps from different geographical regions removal efficiencies for the studied ecs varied widely from negative removal to 100 depending on the compound and wwtp fig 2 for example amoxicillin meropenem ciprofloxacin chlortetracycline oxytetracycline minocycline tetracycline acetaminophen ibuprofen fenoprofen naproxen and salicylic acid cyclamate saccharin estrone estriol oxybenzone caffeine deet and bisphenol a tended to be highly removed in biological wwtps with median removal 80 fig 2 in contrast the following compounds lincomycin thiabendazole codeine metoprolol propranolol carbamazepine sulpride sucralose clofibric acid iopamidol and crotamiton appeared to be persistent during biological wastewater treatment processes the median removal efficiency of these compounds were often less than 40 fig 2 it is noteworthy that removal efficiencies of many antibiotics antimicrobials nsaids beta blockers anticonvulsants artificial sweeteners lipid regulators and x ray contrast media can sometimes be negative fig 2 this indicates that concentrations of these ecs in treated effluents were higher than those in raw influent ternes and hirsch 2000 clara et al 2004a behera et al 2011 yang et al 2011 the apparent negative removal efficiencies of ecs could be explained by at least one of the following reasons firstly most of the detected antibiotics and oral drugs in the wastewater samples can be excreted from the human body via urine and feces as a mixture of unchanged parent compounds and conjugates of glucuronic acid jelic et al 2011 osorio et al 2014 zonja et al 2016a 2016b as such these conjugates could undergo enzymatic cleavage to form their parent compounds throughout biological wastewater treatment processes resulting in increased concentrations in treated effluents in an earlier study however zonja et al 2016b found that lamotrigine n2 glucuronide a predominant human metabolite of anticonvulsant lamotrigine lmg could be deconjugated to its parent compound lgm in biological wwtp in addition to the deconjugation route lamotrigine n2 glucuronide may undergo abiotic hydrolysis at ph 7 zonja et al 2016a or oxidation of glucuronide moiety zonja et al 2016b to form other transformation products in another study osorio et al 2014 also reported the co occurrence of diclofenac and its glucuronide diclofenac acyl glucuronides in influent samples at several wwtps in spain in particular the higher concentrations of diclofenac in effluent compared to those in influent were noted at two wwtps besos and riu sec spain this could have resulted from the deconjugation of diclofenac acyl glucuronides to form diclofenac during biological wastewater treatment processes osorio et al 2014 secondly pharmaceuticals excreted via urine and feces could be enclosed in fecal particles in wastewater samples and released gradually during wastewater treatment processes resulting in an increase in apparent concentration in the treated effluent samples gobel et al 2007 finally negative removal and variable removal efficiencies of ecs in full scale wwtps could be simply due to sampling schemes in fact in earlier studies removal efficiencies of ecs estimated for wwtps were based on the grab sampling approach it is widely accepted that grab sampling does not capture the variation of ec concentrations in short or long term since it takes an instantaneous snapshot of the concentration of ecs in the water samples at the time of sampling rodayan et al 2014 i e the hydraulic retention time distribution of wwtp is not taken into consideration consequently this sampling method could cause apparently false removal efficiency when comparing the concentrations between raw influent and treated effluent this is deemed as one of the existing research gaps in accurately evaluating the capacity of wwtps to eliminate ecs alternative sampling strategies e g composite sampling or polar organic chemical integrative sampling methods and removal calculation approaches for further monitoring studies are critically needed rodayan et al 2014 found that the application of a time shifted mass balancing eliminated negative removals obtained with other approaches e g grab sampling composite sampling or polar organic chemical integrative sampling since it allows reliably matching influent load to effluent loads in the calculation of removal of ecs during wwtps in another effort to obtain reliable data on the removal of ecs during wwtps baalbaki et al 2017 used the fractionated approach which compares the mass load of the output stream with a reference mass load of the input stream that takes into account the retention time distribution for estimating the removal of 23 ecs in wwtps 4 2 sorption and its controlling factors in wwtps as aforementioned sorption onto solids can be one of the important mechanisms controlling the removal of ecs in municipal wwtps it may also affect the rate of other processes e g photolysis and biodegradation until now sorption data for a variety of ecs onto activated sludge has been evaluated via laboratory based batch experiments and or field based studies from full scale wwtps urase and kikuta 2005 lozano et al 2013 narumiya et al 2013 table 5 and fig 3 summarize the sorption coefficient k d of ecs onto sludge from the literature it can be seen from fig 3 that k d values reported from different studies showed a great variability particularly for ecs such as clofibric acid diclofenac and indomethacin for example joss et al 2006 and abegglen et al 2009 reported that k d values for clofibric acid were in the ranged from 5 to 7 l kgmlss whereas urase and kikuta 2005 and yan et al 2014 found that its k d varied significantly from 24 to 554 l kgmlss a significant variation in k d value of a compound among studies is likely to be due to the differences in methodology for estimating k d i e difference between lab based experiments and field based monitoring at wwtps for example most of the lab based sorption studies were conducted at ec concentrations ranging from a few tens of μg l to several mg l clara et al 2004b ternes et al 2004 urase and kikuta 2005 yi and harper 2007a b wick et al 2009 which are substantially higher than those found in raw wastewater by 1 3 orders of magnitude another reason could be that previous studies have used single point calculations rather than sorption isotherms for determining kd ternes et al 2004 urase and kikuta 2005 yi and harper jr 2007 radjenovic et al 2009 wick et al 2009 senta et al 2013 subsequently this could result in overestimation underestimation of kd value for ecs in addition the differences in inactivation methods of sludge employed in sorption studies such as chemical inactivation using sodium azide mercury salts clara et al 2004b yi and harper jr 2007 wick et al 2009 or nonchemical inactivation by dry heating technique hörsing et al 2011 could also lead to variability in the k d value furthermore earlier studies have reported that kd values are largely dependent on operational conditions of wwtps such as temperature ph solid retention time srt and reactor configuration for instance lajeunesse et al 2012 found that lower k d values for most antidepressant drugs were observed at a higher temperature in other studies fernandez fontaina et al 2013 and hyland et al 2012 revealed that there was no significant difference in k d values in conventional activated sludge with different sludge ages in contrast jia et al 2012 suggested that k d values were slightly higher in aerobic units than those in anoxic anaerobic units in addition to operational conditions of wwtps sorption of ecs onto sewage sludge biosolids strictly relies on their physiochemical properties i e log k o w pka and ionization state and molecular structures to date it has been widely accepted that ecs with log k o w 4 0 or log d o w 3 0 tend to have high sorption potential onto particulate phase i e k d 1000 l kgmlss while compounds with log k o w 2 5 or log d o w 1 0 often exhibit low sorption potential kd 300 l kgmlss luo et al 2014 ecs with log k o w between 2 5 and 4 or 1 log d o w 3 0 are more likely to have medium sorption potential for example triclosan and triclocarban show higher hydrophobicity i e log k o w 4 2 4 8 or log d o w 4 19 5 27 under environmental ph 6 8 consequently k d values of these compounds are often found to be higher than 1000 l kgmlss to date numerous efforts have been made to elucidate a correlation between k d and physicochemical properties of the chemical of interest and the particulate phase i e sewage sludge biosolids for instance matter muller et al 1980 proposed a correlation between k d and hydrophobicity according to eq 1 1 k d 0 39 0 67 k o w similarly karickhoff 1981 established a relationship among k d k o w and fraction organic carbon in sludge and f o c according to eq 2 2 k d f o c 0 41 k o w it is noted that f o c values largely depend on the type of sludge for primary sludge f o c was assumed to be in the range of 0 3 0 51 verlicchi and zambello 2015 while its values varied from 0 27 to 0 55 in secondary sludge stevens garmon et al 2011 hyland et al 2012 or from 0 02 to 0 136 for pretreated mesophilic digested sludge carballa et al 2008 however one of the drawbacks in the prediction of a k d value for a compound based on eq 1 or eq 2 is that it results in an overestimation of several orders of magnitude for hydrophobic compounds and an underestimation for ionic and polar chemicals particularly for ecs which exist mainly as cations and zwitterions under environmental ph for example fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin and ofloxacin or tetracyclines e g chlortetracycline oxytetracycline and tetracycline exhibit hydrophilic characteristics log k o w 2 5 and log d o w 1 0 but they are frequently found to have a high sorption potential onto sludge k d 500 l kgmlss table 5 indeed high sorption capacity of these compounds onto sludge is mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions in addition the formation of complexes between the phenolic groups oh in tetracyclines with divalent metal cations i e mg2 ca2 and cu2 present in sewage sludge and biosolids is one of the mechanisms mainly controlling sorption of these antibiotics onto particulate phase loke et al 2002 carlotti et al 2012 4 3 biodegradation and its controlling factors in wwtps biodegradation has been known to be one of the main mechanisms of removing a large number of ecs in both aqueous and particulate phases during biological wastewater and sludge treatment processes until now biodegradability of a compound has been often evaluated based on its kinetic constant k b i o l l gmlss d or k b i o l h 1 from pseudo first order kinetic models as described in eq 3 and eq 4 3 d c w d t k b i o l c w x a c t i v e 4 d c w d t k b i o l c w t where k b i o l l gmlss d and k b i o l h 1 are the biodegradation constants c w is the concentration of ec in water phase μg l and x a c t i v e is the concentration of active biomass g l in an earlier study joss et al 2006 proposed the following rules to evaluate the biodegradability of ecs based on biodegradation rate k b i o l values compounds with k b i o l 0 01 l gmlss d tend to be persistent during biological wastewater treatment processes i e removal efficiency 20 compounds with k b i o l between 0 1 and 10 l gmlss d were moderately removed by biodegradation processes and their removal efficiencies often ranged from 20 to 90 ecs with k b i o l 10 l gmlss d appeared to be easily biodegraded during biological wastewater treatment processes their removal efficiencies were often greater than 90 table 6 and fig 4 summarize the biodegradation kinetic constants of selected ecs in activated sludge process high median k b i o l value 10 l gmlss d were often observed for acetaminophen ibuprofen estradiol estrone and caffeine indicating that these compounds are easily biodegradable in activated sludge system fig 4 in contrast extremely low k b i o l values have been reported for carbamazepine 0 005 0 389 l gmlss d iopamidol 0 01 2 664 l gmlss d and tetracycline 0 44 l gmlss d suggesting that these chemicals are recalcitrant to biodegradation processes to date numerous efforts have been made to enhance the biodegradation of these persistent pharmaceuticals by using enriched nitrifier culture batt et al 2006 tran et al 2009 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 song et al 2015 or white rot fungal cultures and or their oxidoreductase enzymes such as laccase hata et al 2010 tran et al 2010 zhang and geissen 2012 it has been widely accepted that the biodegradability of a compound k b i o l can be affected by a large number of biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature ph redox potentials availability of the ecs to microorganisms the presence of primary substrates i e ammonium inorganic and organic carbon sources hydraulic retention time microbial diversity heterotrophs and autotrophs physicochemical properties molecular features and toxicity of ecs tadkaew et al 2010 2011 hai et al 2011a hai et al 2011b tadkaew et al 2011 tran et al 2013b 4 3 1 effect of redox conditions on biodegradation of ecs it is widely accepted that redox conditions i e anaerobic anoxic and aerobic play a key role in determining the development of microbial populations in the bioreactor and thus affect the biodegradation efficiency of a given ec alvarino et al 2014 2017 phan et al 2014 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 the degree of degradation is also largely dependent on the chemical structure of target ecs it was found that numerous ecs e g acetaminophen atenolol caffeine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim naproxen estrone estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol could undergo biotransformation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions narumiya et al 2013 alvarino et al 2014 2017 phan et al 2014 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 in contrast several ecs e g ibuprofen roxithromycin erythromycin deet gemfibrozil and triclosan were only biotransformed under aerobic conditions narumiya et al 2013 alvarino et al 2014 2017 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 previous studies also found that better biodegradation i e higher k b i o l value of many ecs e g atenolol gemfibrozil ibuprofen naproxen estrone estradiol erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole was observed under aerobic conditions compared to anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2014 2017 inyang et al 2016 alvarino et al 2017 this indicates that aerobic tanks in wwtps play an important role in the biodegradation of ecs in wastewater although the anaerobic treatment tank does not seem to contribute much to the overall removal of ecs in wwtps anaerobic systems still exhibit many advantages over aerobic systems such as lower energy requirements production of a rich methane biogas and lower sludge production in particular it was found that improved degradation of several compounds including clofibric acid diclofenac venlafaxine diatrizoate and tramadol was observed under anaerobic conditions zwiener and frimmel 2003 falas et al 2016 currently one of the trends in wastewater treatment technologies is the integration of different redox potentials in a hybrid advanced biological wastewater system e g anaerobic aerobic membrane bioreactor or anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor to enhance the diversity in microbial community nerenberg 2016 lai et al 2017 this allows the degradation of a broad spectrum of ecs while maintaining a high degree of removal for organic matter and nutrients luo et al 2014 phan et al 2014 alvarino et al 2016 semblante et al 2017 4 3 2 effect of microbial populations on the metabolism and co metabolism of ecs hitherto it is widely believed that biodegradation of ecs in wwtps can be referred to both metabolism murdoch and hay 2005 quintana et al 2005 zeng et al 2009 iasur kruh et al 2011 and co metabolism by the relevant microorganisms yi and harper 2007a b pauwels et al 2008 tran et al 2009 2013b in an earlier study zeng et al 2009 found that pseudomonas aeruginosa could transform estradiol via metabolism in another study isaur kruh et al 2011 also observed that enriched estradiol degrading bacteria edb culture or pure culture edb li1 novosphingobium jem 1 was able to degrade estradiol e2 at an initial concentration of 50 mg l as the sole carbon source however the vast majority of ecs are often present in wastewater at trace levels ng l μg l as shown in table 1 in addition many ecs such as antibiotics and antimicrobial agents are toxic and or resistant to the growth of microorganisms for these reasons ecs in wastewater may not be deemed as the sole carbon or energy sources to maintain biomass growth and induce the relevant enzymes for their assimilation in this context the obligatory presence of primary substrates i e ammonium carbonate salts or utilizable organic carbon sources is critically needed to maintain biomass and induce the corresponding enzymes e g ammonia monooxygenase or other oxidative enzymes for biotransformation of ecs to date heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic ammonia oxidizers including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa are the two main microbial groups involved in the biodegradation of ecs during biological wwtps khunjar et al 2011 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 helbling et al 2012 tran et al 2013b men et al 2017 it was consistently reported that autotrophic aob played a key role in the biodegradation of many ecs tran et al 2009 2014c khunjar et al 2011 tran et al 2014c men et al 2017 however previous studies also observed that heterotrophic bacteria also played a significant role in the overall biodegradation of ecs particularly for biodegradable ecs e g acetaminophen bisphenol a ibuprofen trimethoprim etc roh et al 2009 tran et al 2009 de gusseme et al 2011 khunjar et al 2011 in addition it was found that there could be collaboration between autotrophic ammonia oxidizers and heterotrophic bacteria in the enhanced biodegradation of ecs tran et al 2009 khunjar et al 2011 in a previous study tran et al 2013b suggested that enhanced biodegradation of ecs can be implemented by controlling the diversity in microbial community structure i e autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes in activated sludge systems the use of membrane bioreactor mbr in place of conventional activated sludge cas in wwtps is a simple way to control biomass composition which allows enriching slowly growing bacteria such as autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and is expected to enhance the biodegradation of ecs joss et al 2005 kimura et al 2007 radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 until now it is widely accepted that mbr outperforms the cas system in the elimination of many ecs for example it was reported that a higher removal of some ecs e g naproxen diclofenac ketoprofen gemfibrozil propyphenazone fluoxetine ofloxacin atenolol propranolol trimethoprim lincomycin tetracycline etc was observed in mbr systems compared to that in cas systems kimura et al 2007 radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 however other studies found that removal rates in mbr and cas systems were comparable for selected ecs clara et al 2005b joss et al 2005 in particular no significant difference in removal of readily biodegradable i e acetaminophen bisphenol a caffeine and ibuprofen or recalcitrant ecs e g carbamazepine erythromycin iopromide and lincomycin was observed between mbr and cas systems clara et al 2005b joss et al 2005 radjenovic et al 2009 tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 in recent years biofilm systems such as moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs have been reported to have similar or better removal efficiencies for ecs compared to other technologies i e cas or mbr particularly for x ray contrast media hapeshi et al 2013 casas et al 2015 however the major drawback for mbbr applications is the decrease of sludge settleability which may result in severe operational problems when clarifiers are used for the separation of solids 4 3 3 effect of the presence of primary substrates on the biodegradation of ecs as discussed above biodegradation of ecs is widely assumed to be due to co metabolism by microorganisms this means that biodegradation of ecs tends to be tightly associated with the degradation of primary substrates i e ammonium inorganic organic carbon and other nutrients which serve as energy and carbon source for the growth of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms yi and harper 2007a b fernandez fontaina et al 2013 tran et al 2014c for example fernandez fontaina et al 2012 and tran et al 2014c found that there was a linear relationship between the biodegradation rate constant of ecs i e ppcps and ass and the ammonia oxidation rate in addition the biodegradation rate constant of ecs is known to be dependent on the concentration of primary substrates ammonium or organic substrates in the influent tran et al 2009 2014c helbling et al 2012 for example tran et al 2009 2014c found that higher biodegradation rate constants of most of the investigated ecs were observed under higher concentration of primary substrates 4 3 4 effect of the temperature and ph on the removal of ecs apart from biotic factors abiotic conditions such as temperature and ph of wastewater may also influence the biodegradation of ecs previous studies reported that enhanced removal of ecs could be achieved at warmer temperature due to promoted microbial activities tran et al 2013b luo et al 2014 however hai et al 2011b found that lower removal of ecs was observed at high temperature 45 c similarly ph of wastewater is also known to affect the physiology of microbes solubility of ecs in the aqueous phase and ionization states i e cation anion and zwitterion of ionizable ecs thus influencing the elimination of ecs tran et al 2016 tran and gin 2017 for example tran et al 2016 and tran and gin 2017 found that several ecs such as atenolol azithromycin erythromycin clarithromycin clindamycin and tylosin mainly exist as cation and zwitterion forms under environmental ph 6 8 consequently these cation forms tend to be easily sorbed onto activated sludge flocs via electrostatic interactions because activated sludge biomass is widely assumed to have negatively charged surfaces in another study urase et al 2005 found that removal of acidic pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen and ketoprofen was strongly affected by ph where higher removal efficiencies of these compounds were observed under slightly acidic conditions ph 5 6 for neutral compounds propyphenazone and carbamazepine however elimination rates were relatively constant and quite independent of the ph of wastewater samples urase et al 2005 tadkaew et al 2010 5 concluding remarks and future perspectives this review provides a comprehensive data on the occurrence of a large number of classes of ecs in wwtps from different geographical regions north america europe and asia in addition the distribution of ecs in sewage sludge and or biosolids and their removal in wwtps were also summarized however most investigations on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps have mainly focused on the dissolved phase while scarce data for the particulate phase i e sewage sludge and biosolids has been documented therefore further studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps should include analyses of particulate phases in addition to the dissolved phase there were large variations in the concentrations of ecs within influent samples collected from different wwtps in a particular study area or between different geographical regions this could be attributed to the differences in usage patterns in each region climate conditions population size density analytical methods and particularly sampling strategies the use of unsuitable sampling schemes could be the greatest weakness for the reported occurrence data in particular most studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs in wwtps were based on the grab sampling strategy this approach shows limitations since it only provides a snap shot of the ec concentration at a specific point in time to overcome this drawback future studies on the occurrence and fate of ecs should be based on composite sampling method in addition inter day intra day and seasonal variability should be considered in evaluating the occurrence of ecs in wwtps in light of analytical methods sensitive and reliable analytical methods for the quantification of ecs in a variety of environmental samples need to be improved the use of isotopically labelled compounds as internal surrogate standards in analytical procedure is critically needed to compensate the losses of ecs in sample preparation and correct matrix effects in ms ms analyses there are great discrepancies in removal efficiencies of ecs in wwtps between countries and even between wwtps within the same country this could be due to the limitations of previously used sampling methods as such removal performance of full scale wwtps needs to be re evaluated using appropriate sampling methods i e composite sampling strategy or removal calculation approaches e g time shifted mass balancing or fractionated approaches in addition removal performance of ecs in biological wastewater treatment processes should be evaluated using lab scale or pilot scale wwtps conventional wwtps based on activated sludge processes e g cas or mbr systems still exhibit limitations in removing many ecs particularly in terms of persistent compounds e g antibiotics anticonvulsants beta blockers and x ray contrast media although alternative treatment technologies such as moving bed biofilm reactor coupled with membrane bioreactor mbbr mbr or white rot fungal culture enzyme membrane reactor were reported to enhance removal of ecs under lab scale there is no or little information about the performance of these treatment systems under pilot scale or full scale wwtps therefore further evaluation of the performance efficiency of mbbr mbr systems or fungal culture enzyme based reactors in the removal of ecs at full scale is needed in addition further studies on the occurrence and toxicity of transformation products of ecs in both dissolved and particulate phases during wwtps are highly recommended acknowledgements this research was funded by singapore national research foundation nrf under the campus for research excellence
