4225,over the past few decades many gridded p datasets with nearly global coverage have become available these p datasets offer an unprecedented opportunity to constrain hydrological modeling in remote region where the gauge network is sparse however few studies report on p datasets reliability for discharge simulations limiting the use of these datasets this study investigates the reliability of available gridded p datasets for streamflow simulations for 10 basins of the juruá watershed located in the amazon region a total of 19 p datasets including both satellite based and reanalysis based precipitation estimates are considered to provide a comprehensive overview of currently available options used as forcing data in two lumped hydrological models gr4j and hymod some p datasets led to a more realistic simulation of daily and monthly streamflow than the simulation based on precipitation estimates derived from the gauges network p dataset ranking depends on the considered basin and time step i e daily monthly suggesting variability in spatial reliability for all considered p datasets in addition the p dataset reliability increases with the surface area of the considered basins this can be partially explained by the aggregation of precipitation on larger spatial scales counterbalancing potential spatial inconsistencies at more local scales in the p dataset and by the better modeling of smoother hydrographs at the outlets of larger basins overall imerg f v 6 and cmorph bld appear to be the most efficient p datasets for the region under consideration keywords precipitation hydrology streamflow modelling evaluation amazon 1 introduction global warming and increasing anthropogenic pressure threaten the sustainability of water resources in many parts of the world and undermine the integrity of the ecosystems and societies on which they depend in this context observing and quantifying precipitation and its evolution over time is particularly important for estimating the recharge processes of surface and groundwater systems with respect to their use precipitation is traditionally estimated from networks of in situ stations whose data are still collected manually in many regions then digitized and therefore exposed to reporting errors the spatial distribution of the stations constrained by the maintenance costs depending on the accessibility to the installation sites is very heterogeneous and leads to vast areas without any observation the high maintenance cost is often prohibitive for many countries this results in substantial gaps in the surveyed time series and to sparsely populated station networks usually distributed among easily accessible areas the precipitation estimate in remote ungauged areas is then based on the interpolation of scattered and remote stations which are not very representative of the local precipitation dynamics similar difficulties are common in transboundary regions where international conflicts on water resources may limit the access to the data from the national monitoring networks thus in this context open access gridded precipitation datasets p datasets providing near global spatial coverage stand for a particularly attractive alternative over the past 20 years 30 near global scale p datasets with different space time coverage and resolution have been identified sun et al 2018 on a general way the precipitation estimates are derived from different inputs such as gauges observation i e cpc cru gpcc and or satellite information i e imerg tmpa cmorph and or physical and dynamical models output reanalysis dataset i e era5 merra2 wfdei therefore p datasets estimates present discrepancies in space and time depending on the inputs sensitivity to local climate and topographic context for instance gauge based precipitation estimates reliability is closely related to the gauges network density and distribution used for the interpolation process sun et al 2015 satellite based precipitation estimates rely on pmw and ir sensors which measurements are not only influenced by precipitations but also by quick change in topographic and surface emissivity ferraro et al 1998 levizzani et al 2002 satellite based precipitation estimates are generally less reliable across mountainous region hussain et al 2018 satgé et al 2017 snow covered area and big lake river regions paiva et al 2011 satgé et al 2016 tian and peters lidard 2007 moreover the irregular sampling of the satellites hardly capture short term and slight precipitation events gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 finally reanalysis based precipitation estimates reliability vary in space and time as the models are generally more adapted for large scale stratiform systems than small scale convective precipitation cells i e beck et al 2019 satgé et al 2020 in this context p dataset estimates are generally compared to gauges observations to report on p dataset space and time reliability across different regions i e beck et al 2019 maggioni et al 2016 maggioni and massari 2018 satgé et al 2020 in gauge scarce regions this comparison is limited as only one gauge per grid cell is usually available for comparison as a result many precipitation events observed at the grid cell level areal measurement of p datasets may be lost or underestimated at the gauge level point measurement of gauges introducing uncertainties in the comparison i e salles et al 2019 satgé et al 2019 tang et al 2018 to overcome this issue an alternative approach is to compare the simulated streamflow using p datasets as forcing data with the observed streamflow because streamflow is function of basin wide precipitation estimates this comparison overcomes the spatial scale discrepancy between grid cell and rain gauges observation based on this method recent studies use p datasets as forcing data for streamflow modelling to assess the reliability and suitability of p datasets for streamflow modelling accordingly satgé et al 2019 assessed 7 satellite based p datasets sm2rain cci sm2rain ascat imerg e l and f v 6 chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 over 2 basins located in the south american andean plateau results show that daily streamflow modelled with mswep v 2 2 and imerg f v 6 were in close agreement with the observed one another study compared 7 p datasets including satellite based imerg e imerg f prism smap prism smos gpm sm2rain reanalysis based era5 and gauge based gpcc ones for streamflow modelling of 10 basins across europe and africa brocca et al 2020 this work shows that p datasets offer a great opportunity for streamflow modelling over scarcely gauged basins across 15 basins located across the european mediterranean sea region 4 satellite based p datasets tmpa rt v 7 cmorph persiann sm2rain cci provided less realistic streamflow simulation than precipitation gauges observations camici et al 2018 additionally 3 p datasets tmpa rt cmorph and sm2rain ascat were evaluated for the streamflow modelling of 1318 european basins camici et al 2020 according to the authors these p datasets can reasonably be used as forcing data for the considered basins jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 assessed 3 p datasets tmpa adj v 7 imerg e and l v 6 for streamflow modelling of 300 chinese basins and found that imerg p datasets provide comparable streamflow simulations to gauge based precipitation estimates tarek et al 2020 used era5 p dataset to force hydrological modelling for 3138 basins located across north america results show that era5 based hydrological modelling performance is equivalent to the one using gauges observations over most of the considered basins in the above described context p datasets represent a clear opportunity for streamflow modelling especially across remote regions where gauge information is often lacking or missing however the current state of the art only considers a limited number of p datasets up to 7 in the above example with 30 p datasets recently listed sun et al 2018 there is a need for considering a more exhaustive p dataset sample in order to provide a comprehensive reliability overview of the available p datasets in this line of work 17 and 18 p datasets including satellite reanalysis and gauges based p datasets were considered for hydrological modelling across the west african volta basin dembele et al 2020a 2020b and 8 large scale basins mazzoleni et al 2019 respectively according to mazzoleni et al 2019 there is no unique best performing p dataset for all basins and results strongly depend on the basin characteristics in this context the present study assesses 19 p datasets for hydrological modelling across 10 basins located in the juruá watershed one of the large tributary streams of the amazon river the analysis is conducted at both daily and monthly time steps and aims at providing important feedback to support p dataset selection by potential users and improve development of the next generation p datasets 2 materials 2 1 study area juruá basin covers 188 290 km2 of which 93 8 is in brazil and 6 2 in peru the basin has a mean elevation of 203 m ranging from 18 to 760 m in the andean region forming the western border with peru the mean annual basin precipitation is 2 260 mm year 1 with a rainy season from october to april and a dry season from may to september contributing to 77 5 and 22 5 of total annual precipitations ten basins of the juruá river watershed are considered they correspond to the areas drained by each streamflow gauge available in the juruá watershed their surface area ranges from 3 439 km2 to 164 611 km2 at the streamflow station seringal bom futuro and gavião respectively fig 1 c 2 2 reference observation we used the daily gridded precipitation datasets for brazil firstly developed by xavier et al 2016 and updated to version 2 1 by xavier et al 2017 this dataset provides precipitation on a regular 0 25 grid for the 1980 2015 period precipitation estimates are derived from the interpolation angular distance weighting of 9 259 rain gauges operated by the agência nacional de aguas ana and the instituto nacional de meterologia inmet from which 36 are included in the juruá basin the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies datasets for brazil camels br is used for reference streamflow observations chagas et al 2020 camels br consists in 3 679 streamflow gauges with daily observations operated by the ana from which 25 are located in the juruá basin each series comes with a daily flag indicating whether the observation was quality checked by the ana we used this flag to select gauges with more than 95 of daily observations for the 2001 2010 period for a total of 10 streamflow gauges fig 1 2 3 gridded precipitation datasets this study evaluates 19 p datasets covering the 10 years period 2001 2010 with streamflow data for the 10 basins p datasets are based on three main types of input data to retrieve precipitation satellite based precipitation estimates derived from passive active microwaves and infrared sensors reanalysis based precipitation estimates derived from physical and dynamical models gauge based precipitation datasets i e cpc cru gpcc gpcp chpclim and worldclim2 gauge based precipitation datasets are generally used to adjust the precipitation estimates derived from satellite based and or reanalysis based precipitation estimates therefore the p datasets considering gauge based precipitation datasets are expected to provide more reliable precipitation estimates than the other p datasets in this context the 19 p datasets under consideration in this study were divided into 3 main groups p datasets relying only on satellite based and or reanalysis based estimates chirp v 2 era5 gsmap rt v 6 imerg e v 6 imerg l v 6 merra2 flx and tmpa rt v 7 p datasets considering gauge based precipitation datasets and only satellite based or reanalysis based cmorph bld cmorph crt gsmap adj v 6 imerg f v 6 merra2 lnd persiann css cdr persiann cdr tmpa adj v 7 wfdei cru wfdei gpcc p datasets including satellite based reanalysis based and gauge based precipitation estimates chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 finally it is worth mentioning that p dataset estimates are available with temporal latency ranging from hours to months after the observation this is an important feature to take into consideration as p datasets with short temporal latency are adapted for near real time data requirement e g flood or landslides forecasting water resource management for agriculture while the others are better suited to retrospective climate studies also p datasets without gauge based information are available with the shorter temporal latency which ranges from few hours imerg e and l v 6 to few days chirp v 2 tmpa rt v 7 gsmap rt v 6 with few hours temporal latency imerg e and l v 6 would be particularly adapted for near real time requirement for more information about the considered p datasets readers should refer to the main references listed in table 1 fig 2 shows the mean annual precipitation derived from all considered p datasets at their original spatial resolution over the 2001 2010 period although all p datasets are able to represent the south north precipitation pattern they differ in terms of total amount and local patterns these differences may reflect in the evaluation presented in this study the blocky effect observed for gsmap adj v 6 and persiann css cdr may be attributed to the post adjustment of these p datasets based on cpc and gpcp respectively similar effects were observed for imerg f v 3 which was progressively removed along with the development of the updated version 4 5 and now 6 satgé et al 2018 2 4 gleam etp the potential evapotranspiration etp from the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3a gleam v 3a etp martens et al 2017 is selected in this study as forcing data for the hydrological models gleam v 3a estimates are derived from the priestley and taylor equation using era interim as forcing data net radiation and air temperature available at daily time step and 0 25 spatial resolution this dataset was previously validated across the altiplano satgé et al 2019a and used for hydrological modelling across the same region satgé et al 2020 and west africa i e dembélé et al 2020 2 5 hydrological models two lumped hydrological models gr4j perrin et al 2003 and hymod wagener et al 2001 were selected for the analysis to avoid any influence from the models on the gridded p dataset performance both models require etp and p as forcing data gr4j was successfully used in studies conducted over the south american continent satgé et al 2019 2020 however in comparison to 35 hydrological models including gr4j hymod aims at performing relatively better in baseflow dominated catchments without flashy streamflow behavior knoben et al 2020 as observed over the amazonian basin therefore hymod should provide more accurate streamflow simulations and is considered for comparison hymod is a 5 parameter and 5 storage model fig 3 a it is based on a soil moisture storage in order to compute and separate the excess precipitation into quick and slow runoff quick runoff is routed through a nash cascade of three identical linear reservoirs whereas slow runoff is routed in a parallel reservoir the streamflow at the catchment outlet is computed by summing up quick and slow runoff gr4j is a 4 parameter and 2 storage model fig 3b it first computes the amount of water available for runoff i e effective precipitation by using a production module then a routing function splits the effective precipitation into two components 90 and 10 through separate unit hydrographs uh1 and uh2 in order to represent the delayed and direct runoff respectively finally the delayed and direct runoff are summed to get the catchment outlet streamflow 3 method 3 1 spps vs gauge observations to ensure a consistent comparison all p datasets including the reference were previously resampled from their original spatial resolution table 1 to the 0 1 grid cell size this process relies on a bilinear mean interpolation for p datasets with original spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 then based on a weighted average for the grid cells not fully included in the basins the area averaged daily p series were computed for each p dataset and compared to the one derived from the reference pref using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 eq 1 4 kge is commonly used to assess p dataset reliability as it combines the correlation coefficient r bias bias and ratio of variability v r between reference observations in this case the gauge observations and evaluated p datasets all of which are relevant scores to look at for efficient management of water resources 1 kge 1 r 1 2 b i a s 1 2 v r 1 2 2 r 1 n 1 n o n μ o s n μ s σ o σ s 3 bias μ s μ o 4 vr σ s μ s σ o μ o where μ and σ are the distribution mean and standard deviation respectively and s and o stand for the estimate and the reference respectively 3 2 spps vs hydrological modelling the open source modular assessment of rainfall runoff models toolbox v 1 2 marrmot was used to run the gr4j and hymod hydrological models knoben et al 2019 each of the two models was implemented in the 10 basins under study note that each basin is treated independently of the other including for nested watersheds this means that for each basin the precipitation was aggregated over the whole area located upstream of the streamflow gauges marrmot uses the nelder mead simplex algorithm for the objective function optimization to calibrate the models generally kge and or nash shuttle efficiency score nse are used as objective functions for streamflow modelling i e fallah et al 2020 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tarek et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 a previous study assessing p dataset reliability for streamflow modeling has shown that p dataset efficiency ranking remains equal independently of using kge or nse as objective function satgé et al 2020 therefore we only used kge as objective function for this study for each precipitation input pref and p datasets both models i e gr4j and hymod were calibrated over the 2001 2010 period 10 years using the 2001 year as a spin up period as the objective of this study was to assess p dataset reliability for streamflow modelling rather than the hydrological model robustness we did not consider a validation period 4 results 4 1 spps vs gauge observations fig 4 shows reliability of the p datasets in representing daily and monthly average precipitations over the 10 considered basins at the daily time step the 5 most efficient p datasets are cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 era5 chirps v 2 and persiann cdr with kge superior to 0 4 0 56 0 47 0 43 0 41 and 0 4 respectively in terms of r cmorph bld v 1 and gsmap adj v 6 present the highest scores of 0 71 and 0 75 while all other spps have r inferior to 0 6 in terms of bias most of the p datasets present bias close to one however merra2 flx and gsmap rt v 6 perisann cdr chirp v 2 strongly underestimate overestimate precipitation amounts finally in terms of vr all p datasets present higher precipitation variability than reference precipitation with vr superior to 1 among the top 5 p datasets in terms of kge era5 is the only one with vr close to 1 when considering the monthly time step the p dataset ranking changes to chirps v 2 cmorph bld v 1 era5 merra2 lnd and persiann cdr with kge value of 0 95 0 87 0 87 0 87 and 0 86 respectively chirps v 2 ranked first instead of cmorph bld v 1 at daily time step merra2 lnd is now in the top 5 p dataset and gsmap adj v 6 is ranked 7th with a kge value of 0 76 the different ranking observed at daily and monthly time step can partially be attributed to i the time step of the gauge based datasets used for the precipitation adjustment and ii the 24 hours window used to calculate the daily precipitation amount satgé et al 2020 for example cmorph bld v 1 is based on daily gauge based datasets cpc while chirps v 2 uses both daily and monthly gauge based datasets chpclim gauges as a result cmorph bld v 1 is the most efficient at the daily time step while it is chirps v 2 at the monthly time step similarly gsmap adj v 6 uses daily gauge based information and thus ranks in the top 5 daily p datasets but no longer at the monthly time step additionally the 24 hour time window used to retrieve daily precipitation does not systematically match that of the observed data therefore the daily time step reliability might be influenced by this temporal mismatch i e chirps v 2 cmorph bld v 1 persiann cdr css however the monthly comparison is not affected as the temporal mismatch is very low at this time step few hours it is important to note the difference in p dataset performance at daily and monthly time step since the choice of the p dataset may differ according to the intended use fig 5 shows the kge along with the average absolute difference between p dataset and pref in terms of absolute value for simplicity purpose value obtained from all p datasets and for all considered catchments only kge and bias are represented because bias was found to have the dominant influence on kge values satgé et al 2020 in general the reliability of most of the considered p datasets presents a south north gradient with an increasing kge value from south to the north along this gradient the surface extent of the catchments increases showing an improvement between p datasets and pref observations grid cell spatial average vs point observation while chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 include satellite reanalysis and gauge based estimates they do not provide the most reliable daily precipitation estimates across the considered basins fig 5 however when considering the monthly time step chirps v 2 is the most reliable p dataset in terms of kge and mswep v 2 2 is the most reliable in terms of r fig 4 a and b this discrepancy between daily and monthly reliability for chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 may partially be related to the time step of the gauge based information they used indeed chirps v 2 is based on monthly gauge based estimates chpclim and therefore performs better at monthly than daily time step this is in line with previous results obtained across west africa showing the influence of the gauge based information time step over the p dataset reliability satgé et al 2020 similarly mswep v 2 2 uses both daily and monthly gauge based estimates instead of only daily gauge based estimates which may attenuate the daily dataset influence in mswep v 2 2 precipitation estimates additionally the daily gauge based datasets used in mswep v 2 2 rain gauges from different sources differ from the one used by the other p datasets cpc the gauge based information used by mswep v 2 2 might be less reliable than cpc in the juruá basin and accounts for the relatively lower reliability of mswep at the daily time step finally the improvement observed from chirp v 2 gsmap rt v 6 to chirps v 2 gsmap adj v 6 is notable with an increase decrease of the kge bias for all considered basin fig 5 however taking into account gauge based precipitation estimates does not systematically lead to such an improvement indeed considering the imerg e l and f v 6 datasets the daily kge and bias patterns are very similar regardless of the imerg versions fig 5 similarly merra2 flx and lnd present a similar kge pattern and the improvement from merra2 flx to merra2 lnd is limited to a noticeable decrease in bias despite a slight increase in terms of kge from tmpa rt to tmpa adj v 6 the inclusion of gauge precipitation estimates also led to a slight increase of bias value 4 2 spps vs hydrological modelling fig 6 depicts the performance of the 19 p datasets and pref for streamflow modelling using gr4j and hymod for both models imerg f v 6 as forcing data provides the most efficient streamflow simulation with median kge of 0 79 and 0 81 conversely chirp v 2 provides the less efficient streamflow simulation with kge value of 0 36 and 0 11 using gr4j and hymod respectively interestingly pref is not the most efficient option for streamflow modelling over the juruá basin actually half of the considered p datasets provide more realistic streamflow simulations this could be related to the few gauges available across the region which are not able to consistently represent the local precipitation pattern different observations could be achieved across basins with higher gauge density when comparing daily and monthly streamflow simulations for both models the streamflow simulations are closer to the observations at monthly time step than daily interestingly the p dataset ranking efficiency differs between daily and monthly simulations indeed imerg f v 6 tmpa rt v 7 and cmorph bld v 1 imerg f v 6 cmorph bld v 1 and cmorph crt v 1 are the top 3 p datasets for gr4j hymod at daily time step whereas imerg f v 6 gsmap rt v 6 and tmpa adj v 7 imerg f v 6 tmpa adj v 7 and chirps v 2 are the top 3 p datasets at the monthly time step the better performance of tmpa adj v 7 persiann cdr and chirps v 2 at the monthly time step can be partially explained by the adjustment of the precipitation estimates using monthly precipitation datasets despite a precipitation adjustment based on monthly data gpcc imerg f v 6 is the most efficient p dataset at both daily and monthly time step finally when comparing gr4j and hymod performances the use of the hymod model led to a slightly more accurate streamflow simulation than gr4j fig 6 c and d at all basin outlets except at the 3 outlets located in the west central region based on this observation the following analysis only considers hymod model fig 7 shows the p dataset reliability for daily streamflow modeling at the outlet of the 10 considered basins all p datasets including pref are more reliable for the two basins located eastward fig 7 as the hydrograph is smoother fig 1 and therefore easier to simulate actually the p datasets are less reliable for the streamflow simulation of the smallest basins located westward as their hydrographs are much more reactive to daily precipitation variability fig 1 this trend is clearly observable in fig 8 which shows that the fit between modelled and observed streamflow improves with basin area interestingly the incorporation of a precipitation post adjustment in chirps v 2 and imerg f v 6 considerably increases their reliability for daily streamflow modeling compared to their non adjusted version chirp v 2 and imerg e and l v 6 respectively indeed chirp v 2 considerably overestimates streamflow for both high and low flow periods this is even more significant for the small catchments under study fig 8 regarding the imerg datasets the overestimation of imerg e and l v 6 streamflow s observed during the high flow period is consistently corrected in imerg f v 6 showing the benefit of including gauge based precipitation estimates to a lesser extent a similar improvement is observed for tmpa adj v 7 and merra2 lnd compared to their no adjusted versions tmpa rt v 7 and merra2 flx respectively indeed the tmpa rt v 7 merra2 flx streamflow overestimation during the high flow low flow period fig 8 is well corrected in tmpa adj v 7 merra2 lnd fig 8 interestingly kge values are similar for gsmap rt and adj v 6 fig 7 however when examining the streamflow series gsmap rt v 6 presents a time lag consisting in a streamflow overestimation underestimation for the first second part of the hydrological cycle fig 8 thus the positive and negative bias i e streamflow over and underestimation are balanced leading to similar kge value to that of gsmap adj v 6 however despite similar kge values gsmap adj v 6 streamflow simulation are much more reliable as it removes the time lag observed for gsmap rt v 6 fig 8 interestingly even if chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 include satellite reanalysis and gauge based precipitation estimates they do not provide the most reliable streamflow simulation across the considered basins fig 6 as reported in the previous section this might be partially related to the relatively lower reliability of the gauge based precipitation used in chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 when compared to the one used by the other p datasets finally even if the p datasets including gauge based precipitation estimates imerg f v 6 cmorph bld cmorph crt and tmpa adj v 7 generally outperform the other p datasets fig 6 they are not systematically the most reliable for all considered basins fig 7 this shows that p datasets are subject to spatial inconsistency even in a relatively restricted region such as the juruá basin this is consistent with previous results having highlighted the importance of evaluating p datasets in order to ensure that the most reliable p dataset is selected satgé et al 2020 nwachukwu et al 2021 beck et al 2019 finally for long term analysis with approximately 40 years of observations persiann cdr appears as the most interesting option to follow daily streamflow dynamics across the juruá basin despite a higher spatial resolution 0 04 the recently released persiann css cdr is not as reliable as the lower spatial resolution 0 25 persiann cdr indeed even for the smallest basins considered in our study the persiann css cdr product shows worse performance than persiann cdr moreover chirps v 2 which presents the second best spatial resolution among p datasets does not provide the better score across small basins fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 hydrologic model parameter consistency fig 9 shows the median parameters values derived from all p datasets and for all considered basins the values of the parameters b and smax 0 1 b 0 6 808 smax 1606 which control the soil moisture storage capacity are relatively similar among the watersheds except for catchment 5 which has a lower storage capacity parameter a divides the quick and slow flows its value varies between 0 58 and 0 94 parameter kf controls the exchange between the 3 quick flow storages and its value varies between 0 05 up to close 0 77 the highest kf values are found for the headwater basins smallest one ks that controls the slow flow ranges from 0 36 to 0 65 overall all parameter values remain within the range advised by model developers and relatively constant among basins the most variable parameter is kf reflecting the slope change across the study area moreover the parameter b remains low 0 7 while the parameter a is in its upper half range 0 5 for all considered basins especially the headwater ones basins 5 6 7 8 this means that precipitation is more likely to contribute to quick flow than slow flow this feature drastically differs with gr4j model and might explain that hymod performs better than gr4j across the juruá basin indeed in gr4j 90 and 10 of the precipitation are arbitrarily routed as slow and quick flow respectively fig 3 whereas routing is calibrated in hymod this parametrization favors quick flow in the juruá basin 5 2 p dataset reliability for different basins sizes a previous study led across the mediterranean region has shown that p datasets are less reliable for small basin areas camici et al 2018 as a similar pattern emerged from figs 7 and 8 fig 10 shows the p dataset reliability for the different basins and according to their surface areas p dataset reliability grows with the size of the considered basins actually kge superior to 0 8 is observed for basin areas superior to approximately 16 000 km2 fig 10 precipitation aggregation over a large area minimizes the influence of local precipitation variation with a spatial resolution of several km2 the p datasets are not suitable for representing local precipitation dynamics this drawback is less significant when considering larger basin and could explain why p dataset reliability increases with the basin area obviously hydrological models are also more efficient in representing smooth hydrographs as observed over large basins than dynamic ones as observed over smaller basins it is worth mentioning that kge values do not reflect the absolute p dataset reliability because lumped models such as hymod are not the best approach for large basins these values are only given to compare p dataset reliability with each other note that in most cases the best streamflow simulation is always achieved using a p dataset instead of pref fig 10 however this statement is only true for the region under study because only few gauges are available to develop the pref an opposite conclusion could be drawn if more rain gauges were available across the region according to the actual context and for the time being p datasets offer a great opportunity for streamflow simulation 5 3 gauges vs hydrological modeling assessment daily kge is low for most of the considered p datasets kge 0 4 for 14 out of 19 p dataset when comparing to pref indeed p datasets provide spatially average precipitation observation across grid cell superficial extent ranging from 16 km2 persiann cdr css to 3 125 km2 merra2 flx lnd while rain gauges provide point measurement at the exact gauge location across tropical regions precipitation presents high variation in space so that many precipitation events captured at the grid cell level might be unregistered at the gauge level therefore the relationship i e kge in this study between the observations made by the p datasets and the rain gauges improves with the number of rain gauges used to represent the rainfall of the considered grid cell salles et al 2019 tang et al 2018 similar discrepancy between the basin spatially average measurement observed by the p datasets and pref occurs in this study and explains the low relationship between p datasets and pref this discrepancy is less pronounced at the monthly time step as monthly precipitation generally shows lower spatial variation than daily one the mismatch between p dataset grid cell measurement and point gauge observation clearly shows the limit of such p dataset reliability evaluation especially in the case of scarce gauge network such as the juruá amazon basin and the necessity of alternative methods such as the one using hydrological modelling indeed despite being a point measurement the streamflow observation is directly connected to the spatially average precipitation of its corresponding basin with spatially average observations grid cell p datasets are likely to provide more reliable basin spatially average precipitation estimates than pref which relies on the interpolation of scarce gauge network actually the streamflow simulation obtained using pref are less reliable than the one obtained using most of the p datasets 10 and 12 out of 19 if using hymod or gr4j model respectively however p dataset reliability based on hydrological modelling presents some limits such as 1 the influence of the model parameters adjustment which can compensates part of the p dataset uncertainty 2 the model itself as different conclusions should be drawn according to the considered models fig 6 and 3 the impossibility of assessing p dataset at very local scale grid cell to grid cell as precipitation are averaged at the basin scale despite the advantage of using streamflow modelling to assess p dataset reliability in many region p dataset reliability can only be assessed through comparison with rain gauge estimates as streamflow data are not available or because the basin hydrological dynamic is highly influenced by human activities withdraw agriculture cities dams etc in this context it is crucial to use statistical indices leading to the most relevant conclusion that would have been drawn using a streamflow modelling approach a recent study led across europe has shown that common statistic indicators used to assess p dataset reliability against rain gauge observations do not reflect the true p dataset potential for streamflow modeling camici et al 2020 the authors show that relative root mean square error rrmse eq 4 and absolute relative mean error ame eq 5 better reflect p dataset potential than kge in this context we follow the same approach as camici et al 2020 to verify this statement across the region of interest 5 rrmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 1 n i 1 n o i 6 ame 1 n i 1 n s i o i 1 n i 1 n o i where s and o indicate the estimate and the reference respectively fig 11 compares the kge obtained for streamflow modeling kgeq with kge rrmse and ame obtained when comparing basin average precipitation derived from the p dataset with the one derived from pref additionally the median kgeq obtained for successive classes with 0 1 step of kge rrmse and ame is also represented finally we also consider the sum of rrmse and ame in the analysis fig 11d kgeq is less correlated to kge cc 0 4 than to rrmse cc 0 46 and ame cc 0 53 this is in line with the results obtained across europe camici et al 2020 the results suggest that in the absence of streamflow observation p dataset assessment for hydrological modelling should use rrmse and ame metrics instead of kge actually it is even more adapted to consider both rrmse and ame as the correlation with kgeq is higher cc 0 56 across the juruá basin a threshold of 1 1 rrmse and or 0 1 ame and or 1 1 rrmse ame leads to very good p dataset performance for streamflow modelling kgeq 0 75 it is worth to mention here that these thresholds could vary according to the region of interest and basin size as p dataset reliability varies in space i e satgé et al 2020 beck et al 2019 and depends on the basin area i e camici et al 2018 and fig 10 6 conclusion this study assesses for the first time the reliability of 19 p datasets for streamflow modelling across the juruá basin located in the amazon region using two lumped hydrological models over 10 basins the results can be summarized as follows when compared to rain gauge observations all p datasets are more reliable at the monthly than daily time step however the reliability of the p datasets at the daily time step does not systematically reflect its efficiency at the monthly time step in fact the observed ranking at daily and monthly time step differs this is partially explained by the gauge based estimates time step used for the post adjustment using daily monthly gauge based estimates for adjustment improves daily monthly p dataset reliability p dataset reliability increases with the basin surface area this is partially explained by i precipitation aggregation at the basin scale which minimizes p dataset limits to represent local precipitation variations and ii the hydrograph smoothness for large basins which is easier to simulate by the hydrological models in the absence of streamflow data to assess p dataset reliability for streamflow modelling the comparison of p dataset amounts to gauge observations should be based on rrmse and ame statistic metric rather than kge indeed rrmse and ame better reflect p dataset reliability for streamflow modelling than kge among the p datasets under study imerg f v 6 is the most reliable one for daily and monthly streamflow modelling however imerg f v 6 only covers the 2000 present period therefore users interested in longer temporal coverage should consider using persiann cdr chirps v 2 era5 and mswep v 2 2 in this order which cover the last 40 years with shorter delay between observation measurement and availability of the data only the satellite based p datasets tmpa rt v 7 imerg l v 6 and gsmap rt v 6 provide satisfactory streamflow simulation these p datasets should be considered in the case of near real time observation requirement despite a finer spatial resolution than persiann cdr persiann css cdr does not provide more reliable precipitation estimates across the juruá basin overall the results obtained in this study provide very useful information about the application of an exhaustive sample of available p datasets 19 in simulating river discharge at basin scale across the amazon region this should be very helpful for data users facing the selection of the best p datasets for long term and near real time

4225,over the past few decades many gridded p datasets with nearly global coverage have become available these p datasets offer an unprecedented opportunity to constrain hydrological modeling in remote region where the gauge network is sparse however few studies report on p datasets reliability for discharge simulations limiting the use of these datasets this study investigates the reliability of available gridded p datasets for streamflow simulations for 10 basins of the juruá watershed located in the amazon region a total of 19 p datasets including both satellite based and reanalysis based precipitation estimates are considered to provide a comprehensive overview of currently available options used as forcing data in two lumped hydrological models gr4j and hymod some p datasets led to a more realistic simulation of daily and monthly streamflow than the simulation based on precipitation estimates derived from the gauges network p dataset ranking depends on the considered basin and time step i e daily monthly suggesting variability in spatial reliability for all considered p datasets in addition the p dataset reliability increases with the surface area of the considered basins this can be partially explained by the aggregation of precipitation on larger spatial scales counterbalancing potential spatial inconsistencies at more local scales in the p dataset and by the better modeling of smoother hydrographs at the outlets of larger basins overall imerg f v 6 and cmorph bld appear to be the most efficient p datasets for the region under consideration keywords precipitation hydrology streamflow modelling evaluation amazon 1 introduction global warming and increasing anthropogenic pressure threaten the sustainability of water resources in many parts of the world and undermine the integrity of the ecosystems and societies on which they depend in this context observing and quantifying precipitation and its evolution over time is particularly important for estimating the recharge processes of surface and groundwater systems with respect to their use precipitation is traditionally estimated from networks of in situ stations whose data are still collected manually in many regions then digitized and therefore exposed to reporting errors the spatial distribution of the stations constrained by the maintenance costs depending on the accessibility to the installation sites is very heterogeneous and leads to vast areas without any observation the high maintenance cost is often prohibitive for many countries this results in substantial gaps in the surveyed time series and to sparsely populated station networks usually distributed among easily accessible areas the precipitation estimate in remote ungauged areas is then based on the interpolation of scattered and remote stations which are not very representative of the local precipitation dynamics similar difficulties are common in transboundary regions where international conflicts on water resources may limit the access to the data from the national monitoring networks thus in this context open access gridded precipitation datasets p datasets providing near global spatial coverage stand for a particularly attractive alternative over the past 20 years 30 near global scale p datasets with different space time coverage and resolution have been identified sun et al 2018 on a general way the precipitation estimates are derived from different inputs such as gauges observation i e cpc cru gpcc and or satellite information i e imerg tmpa cmorph and or physical and dynamical models output reanalysis dataset i e era5 merra2 wfdei therefore p datasets estimates present discrepancies in space and time depending on the inputs sensitivity to local climate and topographic context for instance gauge based precipitation estimates reliability is closely related to the gauges network density and distribution used for the interpolation process sun et al 2015 satellite based precipitation estimates rely on pmw and ir sensors which measurements are not only influenced by precipitations but also by quick change in topographic and surface emissivity ferraro et al 1998 levizzani et al 2002 satellite based precipitation estimates are generally less reliable across mountainous region hussain et al 2018 satgé et al 2017 snow covered area and big lake river regions paiva et al 2011 satgé et al 2016 tian and peters lidard 2007 moreover the irregular sampling of the satellites hardly capture short term and slight precipitation events gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 finally reanalysis based precipitation estimates reliability vary in space and time as the models are generally more adapted for large scale stratiform systems than small scale convective precipitation cells i e beck et al 2019 satgé et al 2020 in this context p dataset estimates are generally compared to gauges observations to report on p dataset space and time reliability across different regions i e beck et al 2019 maggioni et al 2016 maggioni and massari 2018 satgé et al 2020 in gauge scarce regions this comparison is limited as only one gauge per grid cell is usually available for comparison as a result many precipitation events observed at the grid cell level areal measurement of p datasets may be lost or underestimated at the gauge level point measurement of gauges introducing uncertainties in the comparison i e salles et al 2019 satgé et al 2019 tang et al 2018 to overcome this issue an alternative approach is to compare the simulated streamflow using p datasets as forcing data with the observed streamflow because streamflow is function of basin wide precipitation estimates this comparison overcomes the spatial scale discrepancy between grid cell and rain gauges observation based on this method recent studies use p datasets as forcing data for streamflow modelling to assess the reliability and suitability of p datasets for streamflow modelling accordingly satgé et al 2019 assessed 7 satellite based p datasets sm2rain cci sm2rain ascat imerg e l and f v 6 chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 over 2 basins located in the south american andean plateau results show that daily streamflow modelled with mswep v 2 2 and imerg f v 6 were in close agreement with the observed one another study compared 7 p datasets including satellite based imerg e imerg f prism smap prism smos gpm sm2rain reanalysis based era5 and gauge based gpcc ones for streamflow modelling of 10 basins across europe and africa brocca et al 2020 this work shows that p datasets offer a great opportunity for streamflow modelling over scarcely gauged basins across 15 basins located across the european mediterranean sea region 4 satellite based p datasets tmpa rt v 7 cmorph persiann sm2rain cci provided less realistic streamflow simulation than precipitation gauges observations camici et al 2018 additionally 3 p datasets tmpa rt cmorph and sm2rain ascat were evaluated for the streamflow modelling of 1318 european basins camici et al 2020 according to the authors these p datasets can reasonably be used as forcing data for the considered basins jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 assessed 3 p datasets tmpa adj v 7 imerg e and l v 6 for streamflow modelling of 300 chinese basins and found that imerg p datasets provide comparable streamflow simulations to gauge based precipitation estimates tarek et al 2020 used era5 p dataset to force hydrological modelling for 3138 basins located across north america results show that era5 based hydrological modelling performance is equivalent to the one using gauges observations over most of the considered basins in the above described context p datasets represent a clear opportunity for streamflow modelling especially across remote regions where gauge information is often lacking or missing however the current state of the art only considers a limited number of p datasets up to 7 in the above example with 30 p datasets recently listed sun et al 2018 there is a need for considering a more exhaustive p dataset sample in order to provide a comprehensive reliability overview of the available p datasets in this line of work 17 and 18 p datasets including satellite reanalysis and gauges based p datasets were considered for hydrological modelling across the west african volta basin dembele et al 2020a 2020b and 8 large scale basins mazzoleni et al 2019 respectively according to mazzoleni et al 2019 there is no unique best performing p dataset for all basins and results strongly depend on the basin characteristics in this context the present study assesses 19 p datasets for hydrological modelling across 10 basins located in the juruá watershed one of the large tributary streams of the amazon river the analysis is conducted at both daily and monthly time steps and aims at providing important feedback to support p dataset selection by potential users and improve development of the next generation p datasets 2 materials 2 1 study area juruá basin covers 188 290 km2 of which 93 8 is in brazil and 6 2 in peru the basin has a mean elevation of 203 m ranging from 18 to 760 m in the andean region forming the western border with peru the mean annual basin precipitation is 2 260 mm year 1 with a rainy season from october to april and a dry season from may to september contributing to 77 5 and 22 5 of total annual precipitations ten basins of the juruá river watershed are considered they correspond to the areas drained by each streamflow gauge available in the juruá watershed their surface area ranges from 3 439 km2 to 164 611 km2 at the streamflow station seringal bom futuro and gavião respectively fig 1 c 2 2 reference observation we used the daily gridded precipitation datasets for brazil firstly developed by xavier et al 2016 and updated to version 2 1 by xavier et al 2017 this dataset provides precipitation on a regular 0 25 grid for the 1980 2015 period precipitation estimates are derived from the interpolation angular distance weighting of 9 259 rain gauges operated by the agência nacional de aguas ana and the instituto nacional de meterologia inmet from which 36 are included in the juruá basin the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies datasets for brazil camels br is used for reference streamflow observations chagas et al 2020 camels br consists in 3 679 streamflow gauges with daily observations operated by the ana from which 25 are located in the juruá basin each series comes with a daily flag indicating whether the observation was quality checked by the ana we used this flag to select gauges with more than 95 of daily observations for the 2001 2010 period for a total of 10 streamflow gauges fig 1 2 3 gridded precipitation datasets this study evaluates 19 p datasets covering the 10 years period 2001 2010 with streamflow data for the 10 basins p datasets are based on three main types of input data to retrieve precipitation satellite based precipitation estimates derived from passive active microwaves and infrared sensors reanalysis based precipitation estimates derived from physical and dynamical models gauge based precipitation datasets i e cpc cru gpcc gpcp chpclim and worldclim2 gauge based precipitation datasets are generally used to adjust the precipitation estimates derived from satellite based and or reanalysis based precipitation estimates therefore the p datasets considering gauge based precipitation datasets are expected to provide more reliable precipitation estimates than the other p datasets in this context the 19 p datasets under consideration in this study were divided into 3 main groups p datasets relying only on satellite based and or reanalysis based estimates chirp v 2 era5 gsmap rt v 6 imerg e v 6 imerg l v 6 merra2 flx and tmpa rt v 7 p datasets considering gauge based precipitation datasets and only satellite based or reanalysis based cmorph bld cmorph crt gsmap adj v 6 imerg f v 6 merra2 lnd persiann css cdr persiann cdr tmpa adj v 7 wfdei cru wfdei gpcc p datasets including satellite based reanalysis based and gauge based precipitation estimates chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 finally it is worth mentioning that p dataset estimates are available with temporal latency ranging from hours to months after the observation this is an important feature to take into consideration as p datasets with short temporal latency are adapted for near real time data requirement e g flood or landslides forecasting water resource management for agriculture while the others are better suited to retrospective climate studies also p datasets without gauge based information are available with the shorter temporal latency which ranges from few hours imerg e and l v 6 to few days chirp v 2 tmpa rt v 7 gsmap rt v 6 with few hours temporal latency imerg e and l v 6 would be particularly adapted for near real time requirement for more information about the considered p datasets readers should refer to the main references listed in table 1 fig 2 shows the mean annual precipitation derived from all considered p datasets at their original spatial resolution over the 2001 2010 period although all p datasets are able to represent the south north precipitation pattern they differ in terms of total amount and local patterns these differences may reflect in the evaluation presented in this study the blocky effect observed for gsmap adj v 6 and persiann css cdr may be attributed to the post adjustment of these p datasets based on cpc and gpcp respectively similar effects were observed for imerg f v 3 which was progressively removed along with the development of the updated version 4 5 and now 6 satgé et al 2018 2 4 gleam etp the potential evapotranspiration etp from the global land evaporation amsterdam model version 3a gleam v 3a etp martens et al 2017 is selected in this study as forcing data for the hydrological models gleam v 3a estimates are derived from the priestley and taylor equation using era interim as forcing data net radiation and air temperature available at daily time step and 0 25 spatial resolution this dataset was previously validated across the altiplano satgé et al 2019a and used for hydrological modelling across the same region satgé et al 2020 and west africa i e dembélé et al 2020 2 5 hydrological models two lumped hydrological models gr4j perrin et al 2003 and hymod wagener et al 2001 were selected for the analysis to avoid any influence from the models on the gridded p dataset performance both models require etp and p as forcing data gr4j was successfully used in studies conducted over the south american continent satgé et al 2019 2020 however in comparison to 35 hydrological models including gr4j hymod aims at performing relatively better in baseflow dominated catchments without flashy streamflow behavior knoben et al 2020 as observed over the amazonian basin therefore hymod should provide more accurate streamflow simulations and is considered for comparison hymod is a 5 parameter and 5 storage model fig 3 a it is based on a soil moisture storage in order to compute and separate the excess precipitation into quick and slow runoff quick runoff is routed through a nash cascade of three identical linear reservoirs whereas slow runoff is routed in a parallel reservoir the streamflow at the catchment outlet is computed by summing up quick and slow runoff gr4j is a 4 parameter and 2 storage model fig 3b it first computes the amount of water available for runoff i e effective precipitation by using a production module then a routing function splits the effective precipitation into two components 90 and 10 through separate unit hydrographs uh1 and uh2 in order to represent the delayed and direct runoff respectively finally the delayed and direct runoff are summed to get the catchment outlet streamflow 3 method 3 1 spps vs gauge observations to ensure a consistent comparison all p datasets including the reference were previously resampled from their original spatial resolution table 1 to the 0 1 grid cell size this process relies on a bilinear mean interpolation for p datasets with original spatial resolution 0 1 0 1 then based on a weighted average for the grid cells not fully included in the basins the area averaged daily p series were computed for each p dataset and compared to the one derived from the reference pref using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 eq 1 4 kge is commonly used to assess p dataset reliability as it combines the correlation coefficient r bias bias and ratio of variability v r between reference observations in this case the gauge observations and evaluated p datasets all of which are relevant scores to look at for efficient management of water resources 1 kge 1 r 1 2 b i a s 1 2 v r 1 2 2 r 1 n 1 n o n μ o s n μ s σ o σ s 3 bias μ s μ o 4 vr σ s μ s σ o μ o where μ and σ are the distribution mean and standard deviation respectively and s and o stand for the estimate and the reference respectively 3 2 spps vs hydrological modelling the open source modular assessment of rainfall runoff models toolbox v 1 2 marrmot was used to run the gr4j and hymod hydrological models knoben et al 2019 each of the two models was implemented in the 10 basins under study note that each basin is treated independently of the other including for nested watersheds this means that for each basin the precipitation was aggregated over the whole area located upstream of the streamflow gauges marrmot uses the nelder mead simplex algorithm for the objective function optimization to calibrate the models generally kge and or nash shuttle efficiency score nse are used as objective functions for streamflow modelling i e fallah et al 2020 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 tarek et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 a previous study assessing p dataset reliability for streamflow modeling has shown that p dataset efficiency ranking remains equal independently of using kge or nse as objective function satgé et al 2020 therefore we only used kge as objective function for this study for each precipitation input pref and p datasets both models i e gr4j and hymod were calibrated over the 2001 2010 period 10 years using the 2001 year as a spin up period as the objective of this study was to assess p dataset reliability for streamflow modelling rather than the hydrological model robustness we did not consider a validation period 4 results 4 1 spps vs gauge observations fig 4 shows reliability of the p datasets in representing daily and monthly average precipitations over the 10 considered basins at the daily time step the 5 most efficient p datasets are cmorph bld v 1 gsmap adj v 6 era5 chirps v 2 and persiann cdr with kge superior to 0 4 0 56 0 47 0 43 0 41 and 0 4 respectively in terms of r cmorph bld v 1 and gsmap adj v 6 present the highest scores of 0 71 and 0 75 while all other spps have r inferior to 0 6 in terms of bias most of the p datasets present bias close to one however merra2 flx and gsmap rt v 6 perisann cdr chirp v 2 strongly underestimate overestimate precipitation amounts finally in terms of vr all p datasets present higher precipitation variability than reference precipitation with vr superior to 1 among the top 5 p datasets in terms of kge era5 is the only one with vr close to 1 when considering the monthly time step the p dataset ranking changes to chirps v 2 cmorph bld v 1 era5 merra2 lnd and persiann cdr with kge value of 0 95 0 87 0 87 0 87 and 0 86 respectively chirps v 2 ranked first instead of cmorph bld v 1 at daily time step merra2 lnd is now in the top 5 p dataset and gsmap adj v 6 is ranked 7th with a kge value of 0 76 the different ranking observed at daily and monthly time step can partially be attributed to i the time step of the gauge based datasets used for the precipitation adjustment and ii the 24 hours window used to calculate the daily precipitation amount satgé et al 2020 for example cmorph bld v 1 is based on daily gauge based datasets cpc while chirps v 2 uses both daily and monthly gauge based datasets chpclim gauges as a result cmorph bld v 1 is the most efficient at the daily time step while it is chirps v 2 at the monthly time step similarly gsmap adj v 6 uses daily gauge based information and thus ranks in the top 5 daily p datasets but no longer at the monthly time step additionally the 24 hour time window used to retrieve daily precipitation does not systematically match that of the observed data therefore the daily time step reliability might be influenced by this temporal mismatch i e chirps v 2 cmorph bld v 1 persiann cdr css however the monthly comparison is not affected as the temporal mismatch is very low at this time step few hours it is important to note the difference in p dataset performance at daily and monthly time step since the choice of the p dataset may differ according to the intended use fig 5 shows the kge along with the average absolute difference between p dataset and pref in terms of absolute value for simplicity purpose value obtained from all p datasets and for all considered catchments only kge and bias are represented because bias was found to have the dominant influence on kge values satgé et al 2020 in general the reliability of most of the considered p datasets presents a south north gradient with an increasing kge value from south to the north along this gradient the surface extent of the catchments increases showing an improvement between p datasets and pref observations grid cell spatial average vs point observation while chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 include satellite reanalysis and gauge based estimates they do not provide the most reliable daily precipitation estimates across the considered basins fig 5 however when considering the monthly time step chirps v 2 is the most reliable p dataset in terms of kge and mswep v 2 2 is the most reliable in terms of r fig 4 a and b this discrepancy between daily and monthly reliability for chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 may partially be related to the time step of the gauge based information they used indeed chirps v 2 is based on monthly gauge based estimates chpclim and therefore performs better at monthly than daily time step this is in line with previous results obtained across west africa showing the influence of the gauge based information time step over the p dataset reliability satgé et al 2020 similarly mswep v 2 2 uses both daily and monthly gauge based estimates instead of only daily gauge based estimates which may attenuate the daily dataset influence in mswep v 2 2 precipitation estimates additionally the daily gauge based datasets used in mswep v 2 2 rain gauges from different sources differ from the one used by the other p datasets cpc the gauge based information used by mswep v 2 2 might be less reliable than cpc in the juruá basin and accounts for the relatively lower reliability of mswep at the daily time step finally the improvement observed from chirp v 2 gsmap rt v 6 to chirps v 2 gsmap adj v 6 is notable with an increase decrease of the kge bias for all considered basin fig 5 however taking into account gauge based precipitation estimates does not systematically lead to such an improvement indeed considering the imerg e l and f v 6 datasets the daily kge and bias patterns are very similar regardless of the imerg versions fig 5 similarly merra2 flx and lnd present a similar kge pattern and the improvement from merra2 flx to merra2 lnd is limited to a noticeable decrease in bias despite a slight increase in terms of kge from tmpa rt to tmpa adj v 6 the inclusion of gauge precipitation estimates also led to a slight increase of bias value 4 2 spps vs hydrological modelling fig 6 depicts the performance of the 19 p datasets and pref for streamflow modelling using gr4j and hymod for both models imerg f v 6 as forcing data provides the most efficient streamflow simulation with median kge of 0 79 and 0 81 conversely chirp v 2 provides the less efficient streamflow simulation with kge value of 0 36 and 0 11 using gr4j and hymod respectively interestingly pref is not the most efficient option for streamflow modelling over the juruá basin actually half of the considered p datasets provide more realistic streamflow simulations this could be related to the few gauges available across the region which are not able to consistently represent the local precipitation pattern different observations could be achieved across basins with higher gauge density when comparing daily and monthly streamflow simulations for both models the streamflow simulations are closer to the observations at monthly time step than daily interestingly the p dataset ranking efficiency differs between daily and monthly simulations indeed imerg f v 6 tmpa rt v 7 and cmorph bld v 1 imerg f v 6 cmorph bld v 1 and cmorph crt v 1 are the top 3 p datasets for gr4j hymod at daily time step whereas imerg f v 6 gsmap rt v 6 and tmpa adj v 7 imerg f v 6 tmpa adj v 7 and chirps v 2 are the top 3 p datasets at the monthly time step the better performance of tmpa adj v 7 persiann cdr and chirps v 2 at the monthly time step can be partially explained by the adjustment of the precipitation estimates using monthly precipitation datasets despite a precipitation adjustment based on monthly data gpcc imerg f v 6 is the most efficient p dataset at both daily and monthly time step finally when comparing gr4j and hymod performances the use of the hymod model led to a slightly more accurate streamflow simulation than gr4j fig 6 c and d at all basin outlets except at the 3 outlets located in the west central region based on this observation the following analysis only considers hymod model fig 7 shows the p dataset reliability for daily streamflow modeling at the outlet of the 10 considered basins all p datasets including pref are more reliable for the two basins located eastward fig 7 as the hydrograph is smoother fig 1 and therefore easier to simulate actually the p datasets are less reliable for the streamflow simulation of the smallest basins located westward as their hydrographs are much more reactive to daily precipitation variability fig 1 this trend is clearly observable in fig 8 which shows that the fit between modelled and observed streamflow improves with basin area interestingly the incorporation of a precipitation post adjustment in chirps v 2 and imerg f v 6 considerably increases their reliability for daily streamflow modeling compared to their non adjusted version chirp v 2 and imerg e and l v 6 respectively indeed chirp v 2 considerably overestimates streamflow for both high and low flow periods this is even more significant for the small catchments under study fig 8 regarding the imerg datasets the overestimation of imerg e and l v 6 streamflow s observed during the high flow period is consistently corrected in imerg f v 6 showing the benefit of including gauge based precipitation estimates to a lesser extent a similar improvement is observed for tmpa adj v 7 and merra2 lnd compared to their no adjusted versions tmpa rt v 7 and merra2 flx respectively indeed the tmpa rt v 7 merra2 flx streamflow overestimation during the high flow low flow period fig 8 is well corrected in tmpa adj v 7 merra2 lnd fig 8 interestingly kge values are similar for gsmap rt and adj v 6 fig 7 however when examining the streamflow series gsmap rt v 6 presents a time lag consisting in a streamflow overestimation underestimation for the first second part of the hydrological cycle fig 8 thus the positive and negative bias i e streamflow over and underestimation are balanced leading to similar kge value to that of gsmap adj v 6 however despite similar kge values gsmap adj v 6 streamflow simulation are much more reliable as it removes the time lag observed for gsmap rt v 6 fig 8 interestingly even if chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 include satellite reanalysis and gauge based precipitation estimates they do not provide the most reliable streamflow simulation across the considered basins fig 6 as reported in the previous section this might be partially related to the relatively lower reliability of the gauge based precipitation used in chirps v 2 and mswep v 2 2 when compared to the one used by the other p datasets finally even if the p datasets including gauge based precipitation estimates imerg f v 6 cmorph bld cmorph crt and tmpa adj v 7 generally outperform the other p datasets fig 6 they are not systematically the most reliable for all considered basins fig 7 this shows that p datasets are subject to spatial inconsistency even in a relatively restricted region such as the juruá basin this is consistent with previous results having highlighted the importance of evaluating p datasets in order to ensure that the most reliable p dataset is selected satgé et al 2020 nwachukwu et al 2021 beck et al 2019 finally for long term analysis with approximately 40 years of observations persiann cdr appears as the most interesting option to follow daily streamflow dynamics across the juruá basin despite a higher spatial resolution 0 04 the recently released persiann css cdr is not as reliable as the lower spatial resolution 0 25 persiann cdr indeed even for the smallest basins considered in our study the persiann css cdr product shows worse performance than persiann cdr moreover chirps v 2 which presents the second best spatial resolution among p datasets does not provide the better score across small basins fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 hydrologic model parameter consistency fig 9 shows the median parameters values derived from all p datasets and for all considered basins the values of the parameters b and smax 0 1 b 0 6 808 smax 1606 which control the soil moisture storage capacity are relatively similar among the watersheds except for catchment 5 which has a lower storage capacity parameter a divides the quick and slow flows its value varies between 0 58 and 0 94 parameter kf controls the exchange between the 3 quick flow storages and its value varies between 0 05 up to close 0 77 the highest kf values are found for the headwater basins smallest one ks that controls the slow flow ranges from 0 36 to 0 65 overall all parameter values remain within the range advised by model developers and relatively constant among basins the most variable parameter is kf reflecting the slope change across the study area moreover the parameter b remains low 0 7 while the parameter a is in its upper half range 0 5 for all considered basins especially the headwater ones basins 5 6 7 8 this means that precipitation is more likely to contribute to quick flow than slow flow this feature drastically differs with gr4j model and might explain that hymod performs better than gr4j across the juruá basin indeed in gr4j 90 and 10 of the precipitation are arbitrarily routed as slow and quick flow respectively fig 3 whereas routing is calibrated in hymod this parametrization favors quick flow in the juruá basin 5 2 p dataset reliability for different basins sizes a previous study led across the mediterranean region has shown that p datasets are less reliable for small basin areas camici et al 2018 as a similar pattern emerged from figs 7 and 8 fig 10 shows the p dataset reliability for the different basins and according to their surface areas p dataset reliability grows with the size of the considered basins actually kge superior to 0 8 is observed for basin areas superior to approximately 16 000 km2 fig 10 precipitation aggregation over a large area minimizes the influence of local precipitation variation with a spatial resolution of several km2 the p datasets are not suitable for representing local precipitation dynamics this drawback is less significant when considering larger basin and could explain why p dataset reliability increases with the basin area obviously hydrological models are also more efficient in representing smooth hydrographs as observed over large basins than dynamic ones as observed over smaller basins it is worth mentioning that kge values do not reflect the absolute p dataset reliability because lumped models such as hymod are not the best approach for large basins these values are only given to compare p dataset reliability with each other note that in most cases the best streamflow simulation is always achieved using a p dataset instead of pref fig 10 however this statement is only true for the region under study because only few gauges are available to develop the pref an opposite conclusion could be drawn if more rain gauges were available across the region according to the actual context and for the time being p datasets offer a great opportunity for streamflow simulation 5 3 gauges vs hydrological modeling assessment daily kge is low for most of the considered p datasets kge 0 4 for 14 out of 19 p dataset when comparing to pref indeed p datasets provide spatially average precipitation observation across grid cell superficial extent ranging from 16 km2 persiann cdr css to 3 125 km2 merra2 flx lnd while rain gauges provide point measurement at the exact gauge location across tropical regions precipitation presents high variation in space so that many precipitation events captured at the grid cell level might be unregistered at the gauge level therefore the relationship i e kge in this study between the observations made by the p datasets and the rain gauges improves with the number of rain gauges used to represent the rainfall of the considered grid cell salles et al 2019 tang et al 2018 similar discrepancy between the basin spatially average measurement observed by the p datasets and pref occurs in this study and explains the low relationship between p datasets and pref this discrepancy is less pronounced at the monthly time step as monthly precipitation generally shows lower spatial variation than daily one the mismatch between p dataset grid cell measurement and point gauge observation clearly shows the limit of such p dataset reliability evaluation especially in the case of scarce gauge network such as the juruá amazon basin and the necessity of alternative methods such as the one using hydrological modelling indeed despite being a point measurement the streamflow observation is directly connected to the spatially average precipitation of its corresponding basin with spatially average observations grid cell p datasets are likely to provide more reliable basin spatially average precipitation estimates than pref which relies on the interpolation of scarce gauge network actually the streamflow simulation obtained using pref are less reliable than the one obtained using most of the p datasets 10 and 12 out of 19 if using hymod or gr4j model respectively however p dataset reliability based on hydrological modelling presents some limits such as 1 the influence of the model parameters adjustment which can compensates part of the p dataset uncertainty 2 the model itself as different conclusions should be drawn according to the considered models fig 6 and 3 the impossibility of assessing p dataset at very local scale grid cell to grid cell as precipitation are averaged at the basin scale despite the advantage of using streamflow modelling to assess p dataset reliability in many region p dataset reliability can only be assessed through comparison with rain gauge estimates as streamflow data are not available or because the basin hydrological dynamic is highly influenced by human activities withdraw agriculture cities dams etc in this context it is crucial to use statistical indices leading to the most relevant conclusion that would have been drawn using a streamflow modelling approach a recent study led across europe has shown that common statistic indicators used to assess p dataset reliability against rain gauge observations do not reflect the true p dataset potential for streamflow modeling camici et al 2020 the authors show that relative root mean square error rrmse eq 4 and absolute relative mean error ame eq 5 better reflect p dataset potential than kge in this context we follow the same approach as camici et al 2020 to verify this statement across the region of interest 5 rrmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 1 n i 1 n o i 6 ame 1 n i 1 n s i o i 1 n i 1 n o i where s and o indicate the estimate and the reference respectively fig 11 compares the kge obtained for streamflow modeling kgeq with kge rrmse and ame obtained when comparing basin average precipitation derived from the p dataset with the one derived from pref additionally the median kgeq obtained for successive classes with 0 1 step of kge rrmse and ame is also represented finally we also consider the sum of rrmse and ame in the analysis fig 11d kgeq is less correlated to kge cc 0 4 than to rrmse cc 0 46 and ame cc 0 53 this is in line with the results obtained across europe camici et al 2020 the results suggest that in the absence of streamflow observation p dataset assessment for hydrological modelling should use rrmse and ame metrics instead of kge actually it is even more adapted to consider both rrmse and ame as the correlation with kgeq is higher cc 0 56 across the juruá basin a threshold of 1 1 rrmse and or 0 1 ame and or 1 1 rrmse ame leads to very good p dataset performance for streamflow modelling kgeq 0 75 it is worth to mention here that these thresholds could vary according to the region of interest and basin size as p dataset reliability varies in space i e satgé et al 2020 beck et al 2019 and depends on the basin area i e camici et al 2018 and fig 10 6 conclusion this study assesses for the first time the reliability of 19 p datasets for streamflow modelling across the juruá basin located in the amazon region using two lumped hydrological models over 10 basins the results can be summarized as follows when compared to rain gauge observations all p datasets are more reliable at the monthly than daily time step however the reliability of the p datasets at the daily time step does not systematically reflect its efficiency at the monthly time step in fact the observed ranking at daily and monthly time step differs this is partially explained by the gauge based estimates time step used for the post adjustment using daily monthly gauge based estimates for adjustment improves daily monthly p dataset reliability p dataset reliability increases with the basin surface area this is partially explained by i precipitation aggregation at the basin scale which minimizes p dataset limits to represent local precipitation variations and ii the hydrograph smoothness for large basins which is easier to simulate by the hydrological models in the absence of streamflow data to assess p dataset reliability for streamflow modelling the comparison of p dataset amounts to gauge observations should be based on rrmse and ame statistic metric rather than kge indeed rrmse and ame better reflect p dataset reliability for streamflow modelling than kge among the p datasets under study imerg f v 6 is the most reliable one for daily and monthly streamflow modelling however imerg f v 6 only covers the 2000 present period therefore users interested in longer temporal coverage should consider using persiann cdr chirps v 2 era5 and mswep v 2 2 in this order which cover the last 40 years with shorter delay between observation measurement and availability of the data only the satellite based p datasets tmpa rt v 7 imerg l v 6 and gsmap rt v 6 provide satisfactory streamflow simulation these p datasets should be considered in the case of near real time observation requirement despite a finer spatial resolution than persiann cdr persiann css cdr does not provide more reliable precipitation estimates across the juruá basin overall the results obtained in this study provide very useful information about the application of an exhaustive sample of available p datasets 19 in simulating river discharge at basin scale across the amazon region this should be very helpful for data users facing the selection of the best p datasets for long term and near real time

4226,surface depressions play an important role in overland flow generation infiltration and other hydrologic processes they undergo filling spilling and merging during rainfall snowmelt events affecting hydrologic connectivity and the size of the contributing area however such variability is often ignored or oversimplified in traditional hydrologic models consequently they fail to simulate the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics the goal of this study is to improve hydrologic modeling especially for depression dominated areas by capturing the variable contributing area and the threshold behavior of overland flow to achieve this goal a new depression oriented variable contributing area d vca model is developed to simulate the contributing area runoff dynamics and their likelihood of occurrence specifically the d vca model integrates the simulation of hydrologic processes with a surface topographic analysis procedure which is able to 1 determine the probability distribution functions of depression storage and the corresponding contributing area and 2 examine the intrinsic changing patterns of depression storage and contributing area the model was applied to a depression dominated watershed in north dakota and its performance was evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed discharges at two usgs gaging stations the improved performance of the d vca model was demonstrated by comparing different modeling methods including the widely used lumped depression approach modeling results demonstrated the unique capabilities of the d vca model in simulating depression influenced overland flow dynamics and the associated threshold behavior the new model also provides an improved understanding of the evolution of contributing areas and their influence on overland flow generation across different topographic landscapes keywords hydrologic model depressions variable contributing area overland flow probability distribution 1 introduction surface depressions are important topographic features which have significant influences on overland flow infiltration soil erosion nutrient transport and other hydrologic environmental and ecological processes abedini et al 2006 cavaliere and baulch 2018 chu et al 2013 darboux and huang 2005 gooding and baulch 2017 hansen et al 1999 haque et al 2018 huang and bradford 1990 tayfur et al 1993 some studies have been conducted to examine the hydrologic responses to global climate change for example mahmood et al 2017 and van hoy et al 2019 analyzed the impacts of historical wet and dry periods on hydrologic processes for cold climate prairie pothole regions pokhrel et al 2021 explored the future changes in global terrestrial water storage to investigate the hydrologic role of depressions under the changing climate physically based modeling approaches are needed to quantify the depression oriented rainfall and snowmelt runoff processes microtopography dominated overland flow is characterized by puddle to puddle p2p filling spilling merging and splitting processes which results in a spatiotemporally variable contributing area ca during rainfall and snowmelt events chu et al 2013 dumanski et al 2015 ehsanzadeh et al 2012 golden et al 2019 spence and mengistu 2019 yang and chu 2015 however this time varying feature of the ca is often ignored or oversimplified in many traditional hydrologic models which simply use a pre filled depressionless digital elevation model dem to represent the real topographic surface and assume the entire basin area as its ca recent studies demonstrated that the traditional model configuration tends to overestimate streamflow mekonnen et al 2016a rajib et al 2020 tahmasebi nasab et al 2017a tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 and affect the simulation results associated with the spatial patterns of water yields and root zone wetness conditions rajib et al 2020 for areas with substantive depression storages thus it is of significance to improve hydrologic modeling for depression dominated areas in recent decades modeling efforts have been made for the simulation of the depression influenced hydrologic processes amoah et al 2013 arnold et al 1998 du et al 2005 fossey et al 2015 markstrom et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2007 tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 van hoy et al 2020 some hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat incorporate a lumped depression storage water depth with a constant ca for a subbasin to simulate the influence of surface depressions these models may provide good satisfactory results on the simulated streamflow after calibration mekonnen et al 2016a rajib et al 2020 while the underestimation of peak flows was observed in some studies mekonnen et al 2016a wang et al 2008 zeng et al 2020 this can be attributed to the lumped representation of numerous depressions with different storage capacities in which surface runoff in depressional areas is not initiated until this lumped depression storage is reached in addition the simulated ca of the subbasin outlet instantaneously increases to 100 of the subbasin area when the lumped depression spills antoine et al 2009 wang et al 2019 as a result the real hydrologic effects of depressions cannot be reflected in these hydrologic models thus a critical question remains to be addressed how to incorporate the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics and the variability in ca in a physically based hydrologic model to further investigate the depression oriented dynamic hydrologic processes individual depressions have been used as basic modeling units in some hydrologic models where the filling spilling merging and or splitting of depressions are tracked and thus the depression induced discontinuous overland flow is simulated for instance darboux et al 2002 proposed a conditioned walker method to simulate the gradual filling of depressions as well as the hydrologic connectivity of fully filled depressions and downstream boundaries they used this model to evaluate the impacts of surface roughness on overland flow generation chu et al 2013 and yang and chu 2015 developed a physically based spatially distributed p2p modeling framework to simulate overland flow over microtopographic surfaces the p2p model incorporated a puddle delineation pd algorithm chu et al 2010 to provide detailed microtopographic characteristics of depressions and simulate the filling spilling merging splitting of depressions the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics and the variations of the ca to the outlet similarly appels et al 2011 developed an algorithm to simulate the filling merging and connecting of depressions as well as the microtopography controlled overland flow during a rainfall event antoine et al 2009 developed a depression filling algorithm to simulate simplified hydrographs and quantified hydrologic connectivity by proposing a relative surface connection function in which the ca was represented by a runoff coefficient instantaneous outflow inflow the relative surface connection function was further integrated with two corrective procedures to account for the influence of depression storage and surface runoff generation in distributed hydrologic models at an inter rill scale antoine et al 2011 costa et al 2016 simulated the hydrodynamics of surface water during rainfall events by solving the 2d shallow water equations in a spatially distributed finite volume model fluxos which was further adapted to account for the sub grid storage volume and simulate the impact of variable contributing areas for small basins during snowmelt events costa et al 2020 similarly yu and harbor 2019 used a 2d hydraulic model to simulate the overland flow connectivity during rainfall events these spatially distributed models that consider the detailed water movement over individual depressions are mostly applied to field scale plots or smaller surfaces due to their demands for high resolution input data and high computational capacity to quantify the hydrologic influence of depressions in a watershed scale model evenson et al 2015 evenson et al 2016 improved the swat model to simulate the filling spilling of geographically isolated wetlands giws by redefining hydrologic response units hrus as regular hrus giw hrus and catchment hrus i e cas of giws however for a depression dominated area such a model results in a large number of hrus which increases challenges for input data preparation and model calibration and validation especially for longer simulation time periods with the development of surface delineation algorithms and analysis tools surface topographic characteristics and the changing patterns of hydrologic variables have been investigated which further provides important insights into hydrologic modeling for example ullah and dickinson 1979a analyzed the frequency distributions of three geometric properties of depressions i e maximum depth surface area and depression storage based on depression characterization results from a digital surface model ullah and dickinson 1979b abedini 1998 used an exponential function to represent the probability distribution of depression storage and developed a probability distributed model pdm to simulate rainfall runoff and estimate the ca depression storage and outlet discharge for depression dominated areas the pdm was further integrated with swat for the simulation of depression influenced overland flow sediment transport mekonnen et al 2016b and nutrient fate and transport mekonnen et al 2017 in cold climate prairie watersheds to consider the influence of potential merge of individual depressions and their contributing areas zeng et al 2020 utilized the puddle based unit pbu which contains all depressions that have the potential to merge and their contributing areas as the basic modeling unit and developed a pbu pdm to simulate the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics and variable contributing areas for a depression dominated watershed under cold climate conditions wang et al 2019 obtained the relationship between ponding area and depression storage from a depression dominated delineation d cubed algorithm tahmasebi nasab et al 2017b and further developed a depression oriented hydrologic hydrol d model to simulate water release from depressions and to quantify the ca of the watershed outlet incorporating topographic relationships into hydrologic models can facilitate the simulation of depression influenced overland flow dynamics some researchers costa et al 2020 ehsanzadeh et al 2012 grimm and chu 2018 spence and mengistu 2019 analyzed the relationships between outlet ca and hydrologic variables e g streamflow and runoff peak for different depression dominated watersheds to date however the intrinsic properties of dynamic cas e g the changing pattern of cas dominated by the hierarchical relationships of surface depressions and their filling spilling and merging processes have not been directly incorporated in watershed scale hydrologic modeling and the probability distribution of the occurrences of ca has not been investigated the specific objectives of this study are to 1 detect the intrinsic characteristics of cas including the changing pattern and probability distribution function during depression filling and 2 improve the modeling of depression influenced surface runoff generation processes to achieve these objectives a new depression oriented variable contributing area d vca model is developed in which a surface topographic analysis is performed to 1 determine the probability distribution functions of depression storage and the corresponding ca and 2 examine the changing patterns of depression storage and ca this information is then used in the simulation of the ca depression storage and surface runoff as well as their occurrence probabilities the d vca model is applied to a depression dominated watershed in north dakota to evaluate its performance and highlight its capabilities in mimicking the threshold controlled surface runoff generation processes in this depression dominated watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of surface topography the hud dc an arcgis based algorithm for the delineation of hydrologic units associated with depressions and channels wang and chu 2020 was used to obtain detailed characteristic parameters of surface topography for the d vca modeling individual depressions consist of centers cells and thresholds and they may have hierarchical relationships with surrounding depressions that is if two individual depressions share a common threshold they have the potential to merge as a larger depression which is defined as a second level depression following the same fashion all higher level depressions can be formed chu et al 2013 chu 2017 during the surface topographic delineation processes in the hud dc all highest level depressions are identified by using the arcgis filling function and the algorithm searches cells as well as thresholds for all highest level depressions and all channel cells through a series of cell loops then the hud dc determines cas of all highest level depressions and channel segments by employing the arcgis watershed function specifically the highest level depressions and their cas are defined as puddle based units pbus while the channel segments and their cas are termed as channel based units cbus thus a subbasin is divided into a number of interconnected pbus and cbus the hud dc also calculates a set of topographic parameters such as the number of highest level depressions and channel segments the maximum depression storage mds the cas of all highest level depressions and the cas of all channel segments 2 2 new d vca modeling framework the d vca model is a semi distributed event based watershed model that simulates depression influenced overland flow dynamics fig 1 the model input data include meteorological data basic model parameters e g curve number and time of concentration topographic parameters obtained from the hud dc algorithm and the upstream downstream relationships of the channel network in the d vca model a watershed is divided into many subbasins based on a prefilled dem for each subbasin the d vca model couples a topographic analysis procedure with the simulation of threshold controlled filling spilling overland flow processes the topographic analysis procedure takes advantage of the surface delineation results from the hud dc algorithm which divides a subbasin into a set of interconnected cbus and pbus in this study cbus which are non depressional areas are lumped together and assumed to contribute runoff water to the subbasin outlet directly for depressional areas pbus are used as the basic modeling units as detailed in the following subsections the surface topographic analysis procedure determines the probability distributions of the occurrences of fully filled depression storage and the corresponding ca as well as the curves of fully filled depression storage and ca versus depression filling such information is then incorporated into the simulation procedure which determines ca depression storage and surface runoff as well as their occurrence probabilities for all time steps during a rainfall snowmelt event once the simulations are performed for all subbasins their outlet discharges are further routed through the entire channel network to the watershed outlet in the d vca model precipitation in a subbasin is classified as rainfall or snowfall based on the threshold snowfall temperature and snowmelt is simulated by employing the degree day method the snowmelt water is combined with rainfall in the model and the total rainfall is further used for simulating infiltration and rainfall excess by using the soil conservation service scs curve number method based on the available rainfall excess depression storage and surface runoff are simulated by the unique integrated algorithm of the d vca model together with the baseflow simulated by the recession method chow et al 1988 usace hec 2000 the total discharge at the subbasin outlet is obtained which is further routed to the watershed outlet using the lag method pilgrim and cordery 1993 the major model outputs include the water balance for all subbasins and channels hydrographs for all subbasins and outlets as well as depression storage cas and their occurrence probabilities for all subbasins 2 3 topographic analysis in the d vca model fig 2 a g illustrate the detailed methodology for creating the probability distribution functions of the storages and cas of the fully filled depressions as well as their intrinsic property curves for a subbasin as aforementioned a subbasin consists of a lumped cbu and a number of pbus during a rainfall snowmelt event when the condition of a pbu shifts from filling to spilling it starts to contribute runoff water to the subbasin outlet under such a condition the ca of the subbasin contains the lumped cbu and all fully filled pbus to calculate the ca and the total depression storage of these fully filled pbus referred to as fds all topographic units i e the lumped cbu and all pbus are arranged in an ascending order based on their mds values and assigned unique unit numbers or ranking numbers ranging from 0 to the maximum number of the units in the subbasin fig 2a thus the lumped cbu with an mds of 0 has a unit number of 0 the pbu with the smallest mds has a unit number of 1 and the pbu with the largest mds has the maximum unit number the ca and the fds can be respectively calculated by 1 c a i j unit l 0 i a l j unit 2 f s i j unit l 0 i m d s l j unit where c a i j unit is the ca of subbasin j when pbu i starts to contribute runoff l2 l is the number of the units with an mds smaller than the mds of pbu i a l j unit is the area of unit l in subbasin j l2 f s i j unit is the fds of subbasin j when unit i starts to contribute runoff l3 and m d s l j unit is the mds of pbu l in subbasin j l3 fig 2b shows the relationship between the normalized ca i e ca subbasin area and the normalized fds i e fds subbasin depression storage at the beginning of a rainfall snowmelt event all pbus are under a filling condition i e fds 0 and the normalized ca represents the non depressional area i e the area of the lumped cbu with increasing rainfall snowmelt the fds and ca increase until all pbus are fully filled and the entire subbasin contributes surface runoff to the outlet in a subbasin the unit with a smaller mds has a higher probability to contribute surface runoff thus the probability of a unit being fully filled is calculated by 3 p i j 1 m i j m j where p i j is the probability of unit i in subbasin j being fully filled m i j is the ranking number of unit i in subbasin j and m j is the total number of the units in subbasin j together with the paired relationship of ca and fds fig 2b the probability distributions of ca and fds can be obtained fig 2c and d with a positive rainfall excess there is a 100 probability that ca is larger than or equal to the lumped cbu s area and fds is larger than or equal to zero both probability curves exhibit a decreasing trend with an increase in ca and fds and their probabilities reach their minimum values when all pbus are fully filled to analyze the evolution of ca and fds during the depression filling process a steady and uniform net water input is applied to the depression dominated subbasin fig 2e the intensity and duration of the net water input are determined to ensure that the gradual changes in ca and fds can be represented until all pbus are fully filled the volume of water applied to each unit is given by 4 v i j k unit i k j a i j unit where i k j is the depth of net water applied to subbasin j during time step k l and v i j k unit is the volume of net water applied to unit i of subbasin j at time step k l3 then the ca and fds at a time step are determined by comparing all units available depression storage values at the beginning of the time step and the volume of net water input during this time interval for example fig 2f shows the comparison for one time step while other units are still filling during a time step the scatter points located at the x axis represent the units that form the outlet ca at the beginning of this time step and the scatter points located between the x axis and the 45 line represent the units that contribute surface runoff during this time step the ca fds and cumulative net water input of subbasin j at the end of time step k can be calculated by 5 c a j k sub i 0 m j a i j unit f o r ads i j k 1 unit v i j k unit 6 f s j k sub i 1 m j m d s i j unit f o r ads i j k 1 unit v i j k unit 7 c i j k sub c i j k 1 sub i k j where c a j k sub is the outlet ca of subbasin j at time step k l2 ads i j k 1 unit is the available depression storage of unit i in subbasin j at the beginning of time step k l3 f s j k sub is the fds of subbasin j at time step k l3 and c i j k 1 sub and c i j k sub are the cumulative net water input of subbasin j at time step k 1 and k l respectively then the available depression storage of a unit at time step k is updated by 8 ads i j k unit m a x 0 ads i j k 1 unit v i j k unit as a result the changing patterns of the outlet ca and the normalized fds with the cumulative water input are obtained for the subbasin fig 2g which are referred to as the ca cumulative net water input cai curve and the fds cumulative net water input fdi curve respectively both curves exhibit an increasing trend their increasing rates reflect the impacts of the dynamic properties of pbus e g their cas and mds in addition it is worth noting that unlike the fdi curve with a starting point of 0 the starting value of the cai curve is greater than 0 which represents the area of the lumped cbu 2 4 surface runoff simulation in the d vca model once the surface topographic analysis of a subbasin is completed the hydrologic processes of a subbasin are simulated through a time loop fig 1 fig 2h l illustrate the simulation of surface runoff generation processes for each time step the incremental and cumulative rainfall excess values are first calculated fig 2h and i based on the calculated cumulative rainfall excess fig 2i as well as the fdi and cai curves fig 2g the ca and fds of the subbasin are calculated fig 2j if the normalized ca reaches 1 the entire subbasin is hydrologically connected to its outlet and the depression storage and the surface runoff generated from the subbasin are respectively given by 9 d s j k sub d s j sub 10 r j k sub p j k sub a j sub d s j sub d s j k 1 sub where d s j k sub is the depression storage of subbasin j at time step k l3 d s j sub is the total depression storage of subbasin j l3 r j k sub is the surface runoff generated from subbasin j at time step k l3 p j k sub is the depth of rainfall excess of subbasin j at time step k l a j sub is the area of subbasin j l2 and d s j k 1 sub is the depression storage of subbasin j at time step k 1 l3 if the normalized ca is less than 1 the subbasin consists of a ca and a partially filled area fig 2k since only the ca contributes surface runoff depression storage and surface runoff are calculated for the ca and the partially filled area separately fig 2k for a ca all pbus within it are fully filled and the corresponding depression storage is given by 11 d s j k ca f s j k ca where d s j k ca is the depression storage of the pbus within the ca in subbasin j at time step k l3 and f s j k ca is the fds corresponding to the ca in subbasin j at time step k l3 to simulate surface runoff the depression storage within the ca at the beginning of time step k is calculated thus the new ca at time step k consists of the ca at time step k 1 and the expanded ca during time step k and the depression storage corresponding to this new ca can be expressed as 12 d s 0 j k ca f s j k 1 ca a j k ca a j k 1 ca c p j k 1 sub where d s 0 j k ca is the depression storage within the ca in subbasin j at the beginning of time step k l3 f s j k 1 ca is the fds associated with the ca in subbasin j at time step k 1 l3 a j k 1 ca and a j k ca are the cas in subbasin j at time step k 1 and k respectively l2 and c p j k 1 sub is the cumulative rainfall excess of subbsin j at time step k 1 l the generated surface runoff fig 2k equals the difference between the volume of rainfall excess in the ca and the available depression storage of this ca which is mathematically expressed as 13 r j k sub p j k sub a j k ca d s j k ca d s 0 j k ca for the partially filled area no surface runoff is generated and all rainfall excess of this area becomes depression storage the total depression storage of the partially filled area at the end of this time step is given by 14 d s j k pfa c p j k sub a j sub a j k ca where d s j k pfa is the depression storage of the partially filled area of subbasin j at time step k l3 and c p j k sub is the cumulative rainfall excess of subbasin j at time step k l the total depression storage of the subbasin including the depression storages of both fully filled and partially filled pbus is given by 15 d s j k sub d s j k ca d s j k pfa in the d vca model the seepage and evapotranspiration of depressions are not simulated thus for a time step without rainfall excess e g time step 5 in fig 2h the ca and depression storage are the same as those at the previous time step and no surface runoff is generated for a time step with rainfall excess the occurrence probabilities of ca depression storage and or surface runoff fig 2l are obtained based on the probability distribution function of ca fig 2c or the fully filled depression storage fig 2d and the corresponding ca or fds at that time step 2 5 model application and evaluation to test the new d vca model a watershed located in the prairie pothole region ppr of north dakota nd was selected fig 3 the watershed is the upper portion of the upper sheyenne river watershed and covers about 4619 7 km2 the watershed outlet is located at the usgs gaging station 05055300 at the sheyenne river above the devils lake outlet near flora nd latitude 47 54 28 n longitude 99 24 56 w this watershed is dominated by numerous depressions fig 3b indicating that the evolution of ca and surface runoff generation processes are subject to the influence of surface depressions in this study a 10 m dem was downloaded from the usgs national map tnm based on the prefilled depressionless dem the watershed was divided into 13 subbasins in addition the original dem of each subbasin was delineated by using the hud dc algorithm to compute all topographic parameters the land use and land cover lulc data and the soil type data which were used to calculate curve numbers were obtained from the national land cover database nlcd 2011 and the state soil geographic statsgo2 dataset respectively hourly rainfall and temperature data were acquired from the north dakota agriculture weather network ndawn and fig 3 shows the ndawn stations in and around the watershed since snowfall data were not available for the ndawn stations the daily snowfall data for the watershed were download from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism and used in the modeling the d vca model was calibrated and validated by using three storm events and one snowmelt event with an hourly time interval the calibration event event 1 ranged from 6 26 2009 18 00 to 7 2 2009 8 00 and the three validation events ranged from 9 20 2019 18 00 to 9 24 2019 0 00 event 2 from 6 13 2017 4 00 to 6 18 2017 10 00 event 3 and from 4 1 2013 0 00 to 5 12 2013 0 00 event 4 the three storm events were selected for evaluating the d vca model since they represented different rainfall conditions in terms of the magnitude duration and distribution in addition they had long antecedent dry periods to minimize the potential impacts of other rainfall events thus the outlet discharge at the beginning of each rainfall event was considered as the initial baseflow due to the small rainfall amount of the real rainfall events the snowmelt event was also selected to evaluate the d vca model for this snowmelt event the initial snowpack water equivalent of each subbasin was obtained from the noaa national weather service s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas which provided the best possible estimates of snow cover and related data for hydrologic modeling and analysis a set of major parameters were selected for calibration and their initial values were estimated specifically the scs curve numbers were calculated for all subbasins of the watershed based on the land use and soil type gis data the time of concentration was calculated by using the scs lag method and the lag time of a channel was calculated based on the length of the channel and the velocity estimated by using the manning equation the model was evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed discharges at the usgs gaging stations 05054500 within the watershed fig 3 and 05055300 at the watershed outlet and the observed discharge data for these two gaging stations

demonstrate the improvement of the new modeling method developed in this study the d vca model was applied for three modeling scenarios ms1 d vca model with no depressions ms2 d vca model with a lumped depression and ms3 d vca model ms1 represented a configuration of traditional hydrologic modeling in which depressions were not considered ms1 was implemented by setting the depression storage values of all pbus to zero in the d vca model ms2 utilized an approach that has been adopted in many hydrologic models e g swat in which all depressions in a subbasin are aggregated as a lumped storage with a constant contributing area in the d vca model in this scenario a subbasin contains a lumped cbu and a lumped pbu and surface runoff is generated from depressional areas once the lumped depression is fully filled in ms3 the intrinsic changing patterns of cas and depression storages were identified by the d vca model and the depression oriented overland flow dynamics and the formation of cas were simulated in addition to the comparison of the simulated and observed discharges the simulated cas depression storage and surface runoff were also evaluated specifically the simulation results were analyzed and different modeling approaches were discussed to demonstrate the improvement of the d vca model and the reasonability of simulation results the cas and depression storages of all subbasins were calculated for both calibration and validation events based on the surface delineation results then the 95 confidence intervals of the cas and depression storages were identified and compared with the corresponding values simulated by the d vca model to further assess the accuracy of the simulations note that some large depressions were not completely filled under the three real rainfall events and the snowmelt event selected for the model calibration and validation to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the d vca model in simulating the formation and evolution of cas and the surface runoff generation dynamics influenced by topographic depressions a 30 hr design storm with an intensity of 5 cm h was selected and the d vca simulation was performed for the selected watershed using the well calibrated parameters the simulation results were analyzed and new findings were summarized 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of surface topography in this study the watershed was divided into 13 subbasins which were further delineated into 338 132 pbus and cbus fig 4 a depressions dominate a large portion of the watershed and their distribution varies among all subbasins fig 4a fig 4b displays the topographic details for the non depressional areas i e cbus and depressional areas i e pbus of all subbasins specifically the percentages of the depressional areas of all subbasins range from 73 to 92 and the total mds values of the subbasins range from 9 6 106 m3 to 5 8 108 m3 indicating that the surface runoff generation processes in the watershed are controlled by depressions the mds values of individual pbus are important because the pbus with a smaller mds can be fully filled quickly and then contribute surface runoff while the pbus with a larger mds take a longer time to become an effective ca therefore the cumulative distributions of mds of individual pbus were analyzed for all subbasins fig 5 a the mds values of individual pbus in the watershed range from 3 10 3 m3 to 5 8 106 m3 these cumulative distribution curves increase rapidly when the mds ranges between 1 m3 to 100 m3 and for all subbasins the pbus with an mds larger than 100 m3 only account for 15 5 to 31 4 fig 5a suggesting that the subbasins mostly contain depressions with a small mds fig 5b shows the probability distributions of the normalized cas i e ca subbasin area for all subbasins obtained by frequency analyses of the modeling units i e pbus and cbus being part of cas eq 3 therefore these relationships are static and only dependent on the topographic characteristics i e mds and areas of individual pbus eqs 1 3 of each subbasin as shown in fig 5b the normalized cas of all subbasins are greater than zero when the probability is equal to 1 which reflect their non depressional areas and are consistent with the area percentages of their cbus in fig 4b since the depressions with a smaller mds have a higher chance to contribute surface runoff the probability distributions of the cas of all subbasins have a decreasing trend compared to the corresponding cumulative distributions of mds fig 5a as shown in the inset of fig 5b the probability distribution curves are generally not smooth because the entire surface area of a pbu is added to the ca when it is fully filled in addition the probabilities of cas decrease rapidly at smaller ca values which can be attributed to the large number of pbus that can be easily fully filled and become part of the ca fig 5a the decreasing rates of these curves fig 5b gradually decrease with an increase in the ca due to the reduced number of pbus with a larger mds fig 5a the fewer pbus an mds includes the smaller the decreasing rate of the probability of ca is based on these probability distribution curves fig 5b the occurrence probability of a ca during a rainfall snowmelt event can be determined once the ca is simulated 3 2 intrinsic changing patterns of ca and depression storage fig 6 a shows the cai curves for all subbasins which illustrate the changing patterns of ca during the depression filling processes these curves follow a similar increasing trend the cas increase rapidly along a smooth curve at the beginning of depression filling due to the large number of small depressions fig 5 then the increasing rates decrease as the number of small depressions decreases and the curves exhibit a stepwise changing pattern due to the existence of the pbus that take a longer time to be fully filled and to contribute runoff therefore such intrinsic changing patterns of cas stem from the impact of varying topography e g the depression storages and cas of pbus for example subbasin 11 mostly shows gradual and slight stepwise changes in ca while subbasin 12 exhibits sudden and large stepwise increases in ca the occurrence and timing of the gradual and slight or sudden and large stepwise changes in cas are affected by the surface areas and depression storages of individual pbus fig 5b however the stepwise changes in fig 6 are more significant than those in fig 5b because one or more pbus become part of ca when a net water input is applied fig 6 whereas only one pbu is added as a newly expanded ca when calculating the occurrence probability of ca fig 5b fig 6b shows the intrinsic evolutions of fds during depression filling for all subbasins which has a similar increasing pattern like the corresponding cai curve specifically the timing of the stepwise changes is exactly the same in both curves for each subbasin due to the relationship between ca and fds fig 2a and b however the extent of each stepwise increase in fds is greater than that of ca because the magnitude of the mds of pbus is greater than that of their ca therefore in the temporal changes in ca and depression storage the occurrence and timing of smooth stepwise and rapid slow increasing patterns depend on the components of pbus including the mds and surface areas of individual pbus as well as the number of pbus with different sizes the influence of topographic features is in agreement with the finding of grimm and chu 2018 who analyzed the intrinsic relationship between topographic characteristics and ca and quantified the hydrologic connectivity of three different land surfaces located in the ppr of north dakota using a physically based fully distributed model chu et al 2013 yang and chu 2015 3 3 evaluation of model performance fig 7 shows the comparisons of the simulated and observed hydrographs at the usgs gaging stations i e at the outlets of subbasin 13 and the watershed for the calibration event event 1 and the three validation events events 2 4 the results demonstrate the ability of the new d vca model to simulate the hydrograph for these four events the simulated hydrographs follow the general shapes of the observed hydrographs specifically the simulated peak discharges and the time to peak at the watershed outlet were reasonably captured for these three events fig 7 the comparisons indicated that the d vca model did reproduce the depression oriented outlet discharges while the hydrographs showed certain overestimation underestimation which may be caused by the uncertainties in model parameters model simplifications or assumptions and model input data specifically due to the lack of model evaluation against intermediate processes and the non uniqueness of parameters the modeling results are subject to the uncertainties associated with the model parameters the rising limb of the hydrograph at the outlet of subbasin 13 for rainfall event 2 cannot match the observed one very well fig 7d which can be attributed to the lack of accounting for the real spatial temporal variability in rainfall the insufficient characterization for the recession limbs of the hydrographs at the outlet of subbasin 13 and the watershed outlet for event 4 fig 7g and 7 h can be attributed the simplified simulation methods of baseflow recession and channel routing for instance the inundation and backflow effects during spring snowmelt induced flooding cannot be properly simulated by using the lag method for channel routing in addition the second peak of the hydrograph at the outlet of subbasin 13 for event 4 fig 7h was not reproduced because of the lack of the observed rainfall at the ndawn stations to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the d vca model three statistical parameters including rsr nse and pbias were calculated table 1 for the simulated discharges at the watershed outlet the rsr nse and pbias indicated a good agreement between the simulated and observed hydrographs for these four events moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 despite the slight underestimation pbias 0 and the overestimation pbias 0 for the calibration and validation events the pbias values still fell into the recommended range moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 the differences between the simulated and observed discharges at the outlet of subbasin 13 for the three storm events fig 7b d and f were small while the rsr and nse values did not suggest a good performance which is because the small values of the observed discharges at the outlet of subbasin 13 resulted in large numbers of the fractions in eqs 16 and 17 to reveal the influence of surface depressions during the real rainfall and snowmelt events the ca depression storage and surface runoff were analyzed for the calibration and validation events the model performances were evaluated by using the data at two usgs gaging stations and thus the simulation results of the watershed were analyzed for two major areas area i subbasins 6 7 8 9 12 and 13 and area ii subbasins 1 2 3 4 5 10 11 fig 8 a shows the percentages of non depressional areas and depressional cas for areas i and ii indicating that only a small portion of the depressional area contributed surface runoff to the outlet during these four events e g the normalized depressional cas of the snowmelt event for areas i and ii were 0 24 and 0 32 respectively the differences in the connected depressional areas i e the areas that contribute runoff to the drainage system of different major areas subbasins can be attributed to their distinct rainfall snowmelt intensity soil types and land use which affect the amount of rainfall excess and the filling spilling conditions of depressions resulting in significant differences in the depressional cas fig 5a fig 8b shows the depths of depression storage and surface runoff of areas i and ii for the calibration and validation events it can be observed that depressions intercepted a large quantity of excess water suggesting that most excess water was retained by the depressions instead of flowing to the subbasin outlet 3 4 threshold control of depressions on ca the capabilities of the new d vca model were highlighted by examining the dynamic variations in ca during the depression filling spilling processes as shown in fig 6 subbasins 2 6 and 12 are three representative subbasins that had different increasing rates of ca at the beginning of depression filling and different timing of reaching full hydrologic connectivity the 30 hr design storm was applied to these three subbasins fig 9 shows the formation of hydrologic connectivity for subbasins 2 6 and 12 revealing the unique threshold controls of different topographic features the changes in ca and fds of these three subbasins follow a rapid slow and or stepwise trend similar to that of their intrinsic cai and fdi curves fig 6 at the beginning of the simulation the cas of all three subbasins ca 0 represent their non depressional areas cbus with an increase in depression storage subbasin 6 exhibited a rapid increase in ca before 6 of the total depression storage fig 9a which was mainly associated with the pbus with smaller depression storages was filled these pbus accounted for 57 of the subbasin area fig 9a and only 1 of the depression storage of this subbasin fig 9b then the increasing rate of ca decreased since larger pbus took a longer time to be fully filled thus a 20 increase in ca occurred when depression storage increased from 6 to 47 fig 9a and these pbus newly added to the ca accounted for 10 of the total depression storage of the subbasin fig 9b due to the existence of the depressions with a large depression storage the stepwise changing patterns can be observed in both ca and fds fig 9 the plateaus in fig 9 indicate that all partially filled pbus were under the filling condition and they made no contributions to the subbasin outlet at the end of the simulation 96 of the subbasin area fig 9a contributed runoff water to the outlet and the remaining 4 area accounted for 38 of the total depression storage fig 9b subbasin 2 also underwent a rapid slow and stepwise increase in ca during this design storm event the ca increased rapidly at the beginning of depression filling and then the increasing rate of ca decreased this rapid and slow increases occurred until 54 of the depression storage was filled making 88 of the subbasin area connected to its outlet fig 9a which had only 31 of the total depression storage fig 9b the filling spilling processes of the remaining pbus led to the stepwise increasing patterns of ca fig 9 following the rapid and slow increases in ca subbasin 12 underwent slight stepwise increases in ca during this design storm fig 9 and more significant stepwise increases may occur under a larger storm according to fig 6a therefore the ca may increase rapidly slowly and or in a stepwise manner and the occurrence and timing depend on the topographic properties e g the depression storages and cas of pbus the unique changing pattern of ca simulated by the d vca in this study is different from the findings in some other studies e g menkenon et al 2014 in which the simulated ca increased smoothly with an increase in rainfall this is because they estimated the ca using statistical methods which simulated the evolution of ca based on probability distribution functions the results from other studies e g andrés peñuela et al 2016 grimm and chu 2018 wang et al 2019 support the findings from this study regarding the rapid slow and stepwise increasing patterns of ca across different topographic surfaces therefore the simulated ca and depression filling spilling processes reflect the surface runoff generation and allow the model to mimic the threshold controlled overland flow 3 5 threshold control of depressions on overland flow to understand the influence of surface depressions on outlet discharge the simulated surface runoff was normalized by rainfall excess the temporal variations in the normalized runoff were compared for the three selected subbasins subbasins 2 6 and 12 fig 10 a without considering the impact of depressions all rainfall excess would be transferred to surface runoff thus the curves indicate the ratios of rainfall excess transferred to surface runoff and the differences between r pe 1 and the curves represent the part of rainfall excess trapped in depressions surface runoff was generated from the ca and thus the generated surface runoff changed similarly to the ca fig 9a and fig 10a at the beginning of the simulation all depressions were disconnected to the subbasin outlets once rainfall excess occurred non depressional areas and the fully filled pbus contributed runoff water to the outlet with an increase in rainfall excess more pbus were fully filled and thus the transfer ratio of rainfall excess to surface runoff increased subbasins 2 and 6 mostly had higher percentages of ca than subbasin 12 resulting in larger transfer ratios of rainfall excess to surface runoff in subbasins 2 and 6 fig 10a the surface runoff generated from subbasin 2 exceeded that of subbasin 6 after time step 7 fig 10a which was consistent with the changing patterns of the normalized cas of both subbasins fig 9a when smaller depressions were fully filled and larger depressions were still in the filling stage i e the plateaus in fig 9a and b the ca and surface runoff remained constant fig 9a and 10a as a result there was also a stepwise trend in the surface runoff generation process at the end of the design storm event the transfer ratios for subbasins 2 and 6 were 0 94 and 0 96 respectively while the transfer ratio of subbasin 12 was only 0 64 fig 10a these results demonstrate the ability of the new d vca model to simulate the dynamic water release influenced by depressions similar increasing patterns of surface runoff across different types of surface topography were also identified by grimm and chu 2018 who simulated threshold controlled surface runoff for three different land surfaces in the ppr of north dakota to quantify the influence of ca on surface runoff generation fig 10b shows the normalized surface runoff versus the normalized ca these two variables have a proportional relationship which can be explained by eq 13 this finding improved our understanding of the mechanisms of surface runoff generation and provided a method for fast prediction of surface runoff under storm events this linear relationship was also used by antoine et al 2009 to develop the relative surface connection function by using a filling algorithm in their work the ca was equal to the ratio of instantaneous outflow to instantaneous inflow since infiltration and transfer time were not considered and rainfall was uniformly distributed in this study however both infiltration and rainfall excess were simulated and the routing method was employed to account for the transfer time therefore the linear relationship between the normalized surface runoff and the normalized ca is suitable for a permeable soil surface and can be further used to improve hydrologic modeling for depression dominated areas similar to other studies andrés peñuela et al 2016 antoine et al 2011 3 6 more discussions on the features of the d vca model in this study a new modeling method was proposed to mimic depression oriented variable cas and overland flow dynamics and the simulation results showed its good performance in simulating depression influenced watershed responses to further demonstrate the improvement of the d vca model and the reasonability of the simulated ca formation and overland flow generation the simulation results were analyzed and different modeling approaches were compared fig 7 shows the simulated hydrographs at the outlets of subbasin 13 and the watershed during the four selected events for ms1 and ms2 without considering depressions ms1 the model tended to overestimate the streamflow fig 7 by using the lumped depression approach ms2 the model did provide reasonable simulations of the hydrographs at the outlet of subbasin 13 for the three rainfall events while the snowmelt induced streamflow at the outlet of subbasin 13 and the discharges of the four events at the watershed outlet were underestimated in this scenario the underestimation is due to the lumped representation of numerous depressions with different depression storage capacities in which surface runoff was not generated from depressional areas until the lumped depression was fully filled the reasonable simulation results for the rainfall events at the outlet of subbasin 13 is because its direct runoff mainly came from the surface runoff generated on the non depressional areas fig 8 in this simulation ms2 the excess water on the depressional areas of area i subbasins 6 7 8 9 12 and 13 was trapped in depressions and the outlet ca remained the non depressional areas of these subbasins however the new d vca model which accounts for the intrinsic changing patterns of depression storage and ca was able to track the progressive expansion of the ca fig 9 and facilitate the simulation of hierarchical gradual water release from the depression dominated area figs 7 and 10 as shown in fig 8 in the d vca modeling ms3 the ca of area i consists of not only the non depressional areas but also a part of the depressional areas mekonnen et al 2014 and zeng et al 2020 improved depression dominated hydrologic modeling by using probability distribution functions of depression storages fig 11 created based on the data from mekonnen et al 2016a schematically shows the probability density function of depression storage capacities and the corresponding normalized surface areas in a watershed in their methods the threshold depression storage corresponding to overflow spilling under a rainfall condition was first calculated and then the outlet ca was determined which consisted of the non depressional area and the depressional areas where the depression storages were less than the threshold depression storage under this condition the proportion of the outlet ca in the watershed was equal to the total probability of occurrence of the non depressional area and the depressional areas with their depression storages smaller than the threshold depression storage i e the cumulative probability at the threshold depression storage in fig 11b in the d vca model the outlet ca calculated by referring to the intrinsic cai curve equals the areas of the lumped cbu and the pbus with fully filled highest level depressions fig 9a thus the outlet ca estimated by using the probability distribution functions can be different from the real one in contrast the d vca model accounts for the actual variations in ca and characterizes its stepwise changes fig 9a furthermore the accuracy of the cas and depression storages simulated by the d vca model for all subbasins during the selected events was evaluated fig 12 by analyzing the filling spilling of depressions under the same rainfall snowmelt conditions the cas and depression storages at the end of the selected events were identified for all subbasins fig 12 shows the 95 confidence intervals of the cas and depression storages of all subbasins at the end of the selected events the cas and depression storages simulated by the d vca model fell into their 95 ranges respectively implying that the d vca model reasonably accounted for surface depressions and precisely simulated their impacts on the overland flow dynamics as expected during these three rainfall events in june and september the simulated cas were formed only by a small portion of the subbasin areas and most of rainfall excess became depression storage fig 8 this finding is consistent with those from other studies for depression dominated areas e g evenson et al 2015 evenson et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 for example zeng et al 2020 incorporated the probability distribution functions of depression storages into watershed hydrologic modeling and found that the depressional cas were 0 42 of the watershed area for rainfall events in summer and fall months in north dakota evenson et al 2015 simulated water movement across individual depressions for a depression dominated watershed over a 4 year period and showed that more rainfall excess was routed to depression storage and less excess water became surface runoff for the snowmelt event the normalized cas of subbasins vary from 0 30 to 0 59 fig 12 which is consistent with the simulated cas during spring snowmelt periods in other cold climate prairie regions spence and mengistu 2019 van hoy et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 for example van hoy et al 2020 simulated the cold region hydrologic processes in the depression dominated mauvais coulee basin located a few kilometers north of the watershed selected in this study and the simulated fractional cas of the mauvais coulee basin during spring snowmelt periods from 2005 to 2017 ranged from 0 1 to 0 95 particularly the simulated fractional ca during the 2013 spring snowmelt period was about 0 5 the ca simulated for the 2013 spring snowmelt period in the current study is also comparable to the corresponding value for a median flood in a canadian prairie watershed obtained by spence and mengistu 2019 van hoy et al 2020 also reported the variations of depression storage of the mauvais coulee basin during 2014 2017 and described the annual depression storage changes note that as an event based model the d vca model only simulated the changes in depression storage during rainfall snowmelt events it was found from this study that the simulated depression storage at the end of the 2013 snowmelt event varied from 5 mm to 16 mm while the d vca model is capable of simulating the detailed formation of cas and surface runoff generation it should be noted that at this stage the model focuses on the simulation of the depression oriented overland flow dynamics during a rainfall snowmelt event and the influences of depressions on cas and surface runoff analyzed and discussed in this study are based on the simulation results it is expected in future studies to extend the d vca model for continuous simulations over longer time periods including both wet and dry periods and modeling of water losses from depressions e g seepage and evaporation to explore the complex influences of surface depressions on depression dominated hydrologic processes in addition several aspects can be further improved for example the spatial distributions of surface depressions and their influences can be incorporated in the determination of the probability distribution of cas and the routing of surface runoff more tests and applications to a variety of watersheds under various climatic conditions can be used for model evaluation and the model performance can be evaluated by using subbasin level high resolution observed data 4 summary and conclusions in this study a new d vca model was developed to simulate the hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas in the model surface topographic parameters were first analyzed to obtain 1 the probability distribution functions of fully filled depression storage and the corresponding ca and 2 the intrinsic relationships of depression storage versus its net water input i e fdi and ca versus its net water input i e cai both relationship curves were further incorporated in the modeling to determine the ca simulate the filling spilling of depressions and mimic the surface runoff generation processes then the occurrence probabilities of ca depression storage and generated surface runoff were obtained by referring to the probability distribution functions the final outlet hydrograph was simulated by routing the generated surface runoff the d vca model was applied to a depression dominated watershed located in the ppr in north dakota and the major conclusions can be summarized as follows the comparisons between the simulated and observed discharges at the two usgs gaging stations suggested that the d vca model had a good performance in simulating the threshold controlled rainfall and snowmelt runoff processes and the reasonability and accuracy of the simulated cas and depression storages were also indicated in this study the improvement of the d vca model was demonstrated by comparing different modeling methods including the lumped depression approach and the probability distributed model it was found that the ca and depression storage followed a trend similar to that of the corresponding intrinsic cai and fdi curves suggesting that the cai and fdi curves were able to represent the surface runoff generation processes impacted by depressions and their filling and spilling surface runoff followed a trend similar to that of the corresponding ca indicating the significance of considering variable cas in the modeling of depression dominated areas the identified linear relationship between the normalized surface runoff and ca potentially provides an enhanced understanding of the surface runoff generation processes under the influence of surface depressions the linear relationship together with the cai curve can be used for efficient prediction of variable ca and surface runoff in storm events and in particular can also improve hydrologic

4226,surface depressions play an important role in overland flow generation infiltration and other hydrologic processes they undergo filling spilling and merging during rainfall snowmelt events affecting hydrologic connectivity and the size of the contributing area however such variability is often ignored or oversimplified in traditional hydrologic models consequently they fail to simulate the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics the goal of this study is to improve hydrologic modeling especially for depression dominated areas by capturing the variable contributing area and the threshold behavior of overland flow to achieve this goal a new depression oriented variable contributing area d vca model is developed to simulate the contributing area runoff dynamics and their likelihood of occurrence specifically the d vca model integrates the simulation of hydrologic processes with a surface topographic analysis procedure which is able to 1 determine the probability distribution functions of depression storage and the corresponding contributing area and 2 examine the intrinsic changing patterns of depression storage and contributing area the model was applied to a depression dominated watershed in north dakota and its performance was evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed discharges at two usgs gaging stations the improved performance of the d vca model was demonstrated by comparing different modeling methods including the widely used lumped depression approach modeling results demonstrated the unique capabilities of the d vca model in simulating depression influenced overland flow dynamics and the associated threshold behavior the new model also provides an improved understanding of the evolution of contributing areas and their influence on overland flow generation across different topographic landscapes keywords hydrologic model depressions variable contributing area overland flow probability distribution 1 introduction surface depressions are important topographic features which have significant influences on overland flow infiltration soil erosion nutrient transport and other hydrologic environmental and ecological processes abedini et al 2006 cavaliere and baulch 2018 chu et al 2013 darboux and huang 2005 gooding and baulch 2017 hansen et al 1999 haque et al 2018 huang and bradford 1990 tayfur et al 1993 some studies have been conducted to examine the hydrologic responses to global climate change for example mahmood et al 2017 and van hoy et al 2019 analyzed the impacts of historical wet and dry periods on hydrologic processes for cold climate prairie pothole regions pokhrel et al 2021 explored the future changes in global terrestrial water storage to investigate the hydrologic role of depressions under the changing climate physically based modeling approaches are needed to quantify the depression oriented rainfall and snowmelt runoff processes microtopography dominated overland flow is characterized by puddle to puddle p2p filling spilling merging and splitting processes which results in a spatiotemporally variable contributing area ca during rainfall and snowmelt events chu et al 2013 dumanski et al 2015 ehsanzadeh et al 2012 golden et al 2019 spence and mengistu 2019 yang and chu 2015 however this time varying feature of the ca is often ignored or oversimplified in many traditional hydrologic models which simply use a pre filled depressionless digital elevation model dem to represent the real topographic surface and assume the entire basin area as its ca recent studies demonstrated that the traditional model configuration tends to overestimate streamflow mekonnen et al 2016a rajib et al 2020 tahmasebi nasab et al 2017a tahmasebi nasab et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 and affect the simulation results associated with the spatial patterns of water yields and root zone wetness conditions rajib et al 2020 for areas with substantive depression storages thus it is of significance to improve hydrologic modeling for depression dominated areas in recent decades modeling efforts have been made for the simulation of the depression influenced hydrologic processes amoah et al 2013 arnold et al 1998 du et al 2005 fossey et al 2015 markstrom et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2007 tahmasebi nasab and chu 2020 van hoy et al 2020 some hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat incorporate a lumped depression storage water depth with a constant ca for a subbasin to simulate the influence of surface depressions these models may provide good satisfactory results on the simulated streamflow after calibration mekonnen et al 2016a rajib et al 2020 while the underestimation of peak flows was observed in some studies mekonnen et al 2016a wang et al 2008 zeng et al 2020 this can be attributed to the lumped representation of numerous depressions with different storage capacities in which surface runoff in depressional areas is not initiated until this lumped depression storage is reached in addition the simulated ca of the subbasin outlet instantaneously increases to 100 of the subbasin area when the lumped depression spills antoine et al 2009 wang et al 2019 as a result the real hydrologic effects of depressions cannot be reflected in these hydrologic models thus a critical question remains to be addressed how to incorporate the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics and the variability in ca in a physically based hydrologic model to further investigate the depression oriented dynamic hydrologic processes individual depressions have been used as basic modeling units in some hydrologic models where the filling spilling merging and or splitting of depressions are tracked and thus the depression induced discontinuous overland flow is simulated for instance darboux et al 2002 proposed a conditioned walker method to simulate the gradual filling of depressions as well as the hydrologic connectivity of fully filled depressions and downstream boundaries they used this model to evaluate the impacts of surface roughness on overland flow generation chu et al 2013 and yang and chu 2015 developed a physically based spatially distributed p2p modeling framework to simulate overland flow over microtopographic surfaces the p2p model incorporated a puddle delineation pd algorithm chu et al 2010 to provide detailed microtopographic characteristics of depressions and simulate the filling spilling merging splitting of depressions the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics and the variations of the ca to the outlet similarly appels et al 2011 developed an algorithm to simulate the filling merging and connecting of depressions as well as the microtopography controlled overland flow during a rainfall event antoine et al 2009 developed a depression filling algorithm to simulate simplified hydrographs and quantified hydrologic connectivity by proposing a relative surface connection function in which the ca was represented by a runoff coefficient instantaneous outflow inflow the relative surface connection function was further integrated with two corrective procedures to account for the influence of depression storage and surface runoff generation in distributed hydrologic models at an inter rill scale antoine et al 2011 costa et al 2016 simulated the hydrodynamics of surface water during rainfall events by solving the 2d shallow water equations in a spatially distributed finite volume model fluxos which was further adapted to account for the sub grid storage volume and simulate the impact of variable contributing areas for small basins during snowmelt events costa et al 2020 similarly yu and harbor 2019 used a 2d hydraulic model to simulate the overland flow connectivity during rainfall events these spatially distributed models that consider the detailed water movement over individual depressions are mostly applied to field scale plots or smaller surfaces due to their demands for high resolution input data and high computational capacity to quantify the hydrologic influence of depressions in a watershed scale model evenson et al 2015 evenson et al 2016 improved the swat model to simulate the filling spilling of geographically isolated wetlands giws by redefining hydrologic response units hrus as regular hrus giw hrus and catchment hrus i e cas of giws however for a depression dominated area such a model results in a large number of hrus which increases challenges for input data preparation and model calibration and validation especially for longer simulation time periods with the development of surface delineation algorithms and analysis tools surface topographic characteristics and the changing patterns of hydrologic variables have been investigated which further provides important insights into hydrologic modeling for example ullah and dickinson 1979a analyzed the frequency distributions of three geometric properties of depressions i e maximum depth surface area and depression storage based on depression characterization results from a digital surface model ullah and dickinson 1979b abedini 1998 used an exponential function to represent the probability distribution of depression storage and developed a probability distributed model pdm to simulate rainfall runoff and estimate the ca depression storage and outlet discharge for depression dominated areas the pdm was further integrated with swat for the simulation of depression influenced overland flow sediment transport mekonnen et al 2016b and nutrient fate and transport mekonnen et al 2017 in cold climate prairie watersheds to consider the influence of potential merge of individual depressions and their contributing areas zeng et al 2020 utilized the puddle based unit pbu which contains all depressions that have the potential to merge and their contributing areas as the basic modeling unit and developed a pbu pdm to simulate the threshold controlled overland flow dynamics and variable contributing areas for a depression dominated watershed under cold climate conditions wang et al 2019 obtained the relationship between ponding area and depression storage from a depression dominated delineation d cubed algorithm tahmasebi nasab et al 2017b and further developed a depression oriented hydrologic hydrol d model to simulate water release from depressions and to quantify the ca of the watershed outlet incorporating topographic relationships into hydrologic models can facilitate the simulation of depression influenced overland flow dynamics some researchers costa et al 2020 ehsanzadeh et al 2012 grimm and chu 2018 spence and mengistu 2019 analyzed the relationships between outlet ca and hydrologic variables e g streamflow and runoff peak for different depression dominated watersheds to date however the intrinsic properties of dynamic cas e g the changing pattern of cas dominated by the hierarchical relationships of surface depressions and their filling spilling and merging processes have not been directly incorporated in watershed scale hydrologic modeling and the probability distribution of the occurrences of ca has not been investigated the specific objectives of this study are to 1 detect the intrinsic characteristics of cas including the changing pattern and probability distribution function during depression filling and 2 improve the modeling of depression influenced surface runoff generation processes to achieve these objectives a new depression oriented variable contributing area d vca model is developed in which a surface topographic analysis is performed to 1 determine the probability distribution functions of depression storage and the corresponding ca and 2 examine the changing patterns of depression storage and ca this information is then used in the simulation of the ca depression storage and surface runoff as well as their occurrence probabilities the d vca model is applied to a depression dominated watershed in north dakota to evaluate its performance and highlight its capabilities in mimicking the threshold controlled surface runoff generation processes in this depression dominated watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of surface topography the hud dc an arcgis based algorithm for the delineation of hydrologic units associated with depressions and channels wang and chu 2020 was used to obtain detailed characteristic parameters of surface topography for the d vca modeling individual depressions consist of centers cells and thresholds and they may have hierarchical relationships with surrounding depressions that is if two individual depressions share a common threshold they have the potential to merge as a larger depression which is defined as a second level depression following the same fashion all higher level depressions can be formed chu et al 2013 chu 2017 during the surface topographic delineation processes in the hud dc all highest level depressions are identified by using the arcgis filling function and the algorithm searches cells as well as thresholds for all highest level depressions and all channel cells through a series of cell loops then the hud dc determines cas of all highest level depressions and channel segments by employing the arcgis watershed function specifically the highest level depressions and their cas are defined as puddle based units pbus while the channel segments and their cas are termed as channel based units cbus thus a subbasin is divided into a number of interconnected pbus and cbus the hud dc also calculates a set of topographic parameters such as the number of highest level depressions and channel segments the maximum depression storage mds the cas of all highest level depressions and the cas of all channel segments 2 2 new d vca modeling framework the d vca model is a semi distributed event based watershed model that simulates depression influenced overland flow dynamics fig 1 the model input data include meteorological data basic model parameters e g curve number and time of concentration topographic parameters obtained from the hud dc algorithm and the upstream downstream relationships of the channel network in the d vca model a watershed is divided into many subbasins based on a prefilled dem for each subbasin the d vca model couples a topographic analysis procedure with the simulation of threshold controlled filling spilling overland flow processes the topographic analysis procedure takes advantage of the surface delineation results from the hud dc algorithm which divides a subbasin into a set of interconnected cbus and pbus in this study cbus which are non depressional areas are lumped together and assumed to contribute runoff water to the subbasin outlet directly for depressional areas pbus are used as the basic modeling units as detailed in the following subsections the surface topographic analysis procedure determines the probability distributions of the occurrences of fully filled depression storage and the corresponding ca as well as the curves of fully filled depression storage and ca versus depression filling such information is then incorporated into the simulation procedure which determines ca depression storage and surface runoff as well as their occurrence probabilities for all time steps during a rainfall snowmelt event once the simulations are performed for all subbasins their outlet discharges are further routed through the entire channel network to the watershed outlet in the d vca model precipitation in a subbasin is classified as rainfall or snowfall based on the threshold snowfall temperature and snowmelt is simulated by employing the degree day method the snowmelt water is combined with rainfall in the model and the total rainfall is further used for simulating infiltration and rainfall excess by using the soil conservation service scs curve number method based on the available rainfall excess depression storage and surface runoff are simulated by the unique integrated algorithm of the d vca model together with the baseflow simulated by the recession method chow et al 1988 usace hec 2000 the total discharge at the subbasin outlet is obtained which is further routed to the watershed outlet using the lag method pilgrim and cordery 1993 the major model outputs include the water balance for all subbasins and channels hydrographs for all subbasins and outlets as well as depression storage cas and their occurrence probabilities for all subbasins 2 3 topographic analysis in the d vca model fig 2 a g illustrate the detailed methodology for creating the probability distribution functions of the storages and cas of the fully filled depressions as well as their intrinsic property curves for a subbasin as aforementioned a subbasin consists of a lumped cbu and a number of pbus during a rainfall snowmelt event when the condition of a pbu shifts from filling to spilling it starts to contribute runoff water to the subbasin outlet under such a condition the ca of the subbasin contains the lumped cbu and all fully filled pbus to calculate the ca and the total depression storage of these fully filled pbus referred to as fds all topographic units i e the lumped cbu and all pbus are arranged in an ascending order based on their mds values and assigned unique unit numbers or ranking numbers ranging from 0 to the maximum number of the units in the subbasin fig 2a thus the lumped cbu with an mds of 0 has a unit number of 0 the pbu with the smallest mds has a unit number of 1 and the pbu with the largest mds has the maximum unit number the ca and the fds can be respectively calculated by 1 c a i j unit l 0 i a l j unit 2 f s i j unit l 0 i m d s l j unit where c a i j unit is the ca of subbasin j when pbu i starts to contribute runoff l2 l is the number of the units with an mds smaller than the mds of pbu i a l j unit is the area of unit l in subbasin j l2 f s i j unit is the fds of subbasin j when unit i starts to contribute runoff l3 and m d s l j unit is the mds of pbu l in subbasin j l3 fig 2b shows the relationship between the normalized ca i e ca subbasin area and the normalized fds i e fds subbasin depression storage at the beginning of a rainfall snowmelt event all pbus are under a filling condition i e fds 0 and the normalized ca represents the non depressional area i e the area of the lumped cbu with increasing rainfall snowmelt the fds and ca increase until all pbus are fully filled and the entire subbasin contributes surface runoff to the outlet in a subbasin the unit with a smaller mds has a higher probability to contribute surface runoff thus the probability of a unit being fully filled is calculated by 3 p i j 1 m i j m j where p i j is the probability of unit i in subbasin j being fully filled m i j is the ranking number of unit i in subbasin j and m j is the total number of the units in subbasin j together with the paired relationship of ca and fds fig 2b the probability distributions of ca and fds can be obtained fig 2c and d with a positive rainfall excess there is a 100 probability that ca is larger than or equal to the lumped cbu s area and fds is larger than or equal to zero both probability curves exhibit a decreasing trend with an increase in ca and fds and their probabilities reach their minimum values when all pbus are fully filled to analyze the evolution of ca and fds during the depression filling process a steady and uniform net water input is applied to the depression dominated subbasin fig 2e the intensity and duration of the net water input are determined to ensure that the gradual changes in ca and fds can be represented until all pbus are fully filled the volume of water applied to each unit is given by 4 v i j k unit i k j a i j unit where i k j is the depth of net water applied to subbasin j during time step k l and v i j k unit is the volume of net water applied to unit i of subbasin j at time step k l3 then the ca and fds at a time step are determined by comparing all units available depression storage values at the beginning of the time step and the volume of net water input during this time interval for example fig 2f shows the comparison for one time step while other units are still filling during a time step the scatter points located at the x axis represent the units that form the outlet ca at the beginning of this time step and the scatter points located between the x axis and the 45 line represent the units that contribute surface runoff during this time step the ca fds and cumulative net water input of subbasin j at the end of time step k can be calculated by 5 c a j k sub i 0 m j a i j unit f o r ads i j k 1 unit v i j k unit 6 f s j k sub i 1 m j m d s i j unit f o r ads i j k 1 unit v i j k unit 7 c i j k sub c i j k 1 sub i k j where c a j k sub is the outlet ca of subbasin j at time step k l2 ads i j k 1 unit is the available depression storage of unit i in subbasin j at the beginning of time step k l3 f s j k sub is the fds of subbasin j at time step k l3 and c i j k 1 sub and c i j k sub are the cumulative net water input of subbasin j at time step k 1 and k l respectively then the available depression storage of a unit at time step k is updated by 8 ads i j k unit m a x 0 ads i j k 1 unit v i j k unit as a result the changing patterns of the outlet ca and the normalized fds with the cumulative water input are obtained for the subbasin fig 2g which are referred to as the ca cumulative net water input cai curve and the fds cumulative net water input fdi curve respectively both curves exhibit an increasing trend their increasing rates reflect the impacts of the dynamic properties of pbus e g their cas and mds in addition it is worth noting that unlike the fdi curve with a starting point of 0 the starting value of the cai curve is greater than 0 which represents the area of the lumped cbu 2 4 surface runoff simulation in the d vca model once the surface topographic analysis of a subbasin is completed the hydrologic processes of a subbasin are simulated through a time loop fig 1 fig 2h l illustrate the simulation of surface runoff generation processes for each time step the incremental and cumulative rainfall excess values are first calculated fig 2h and i based on the calculated cumulative rainfall excess fig 2i as well as the fdi and cai curves fig 2g the ca and fds of the subbasin are calculated fig 2j if the normalized ca reaches 1 the entire subbasin is hydrologically connected to its outlet and the depression storage and the surface runoff generated from the subbasin are respectively given by 9 d s j k sub d s j sub 10 r j k sub p j k sub a j sub d s j sub d s j k 1 sub where d s j k sub is the depression storage of subbasin j at time step k l3 d s j sub is the total depression storage of subbasin j l3 r j k sub is the surface runoff generated from subbasin j at time step k l3 p j k sub is the depth of rainfall excess of subbasin j at time step k l a j sub is the area of subbasin j l2 and d s j k 1 sub is the depression storage of subbasin j at time step k 1 l3 if the normalized ca is less than 1 the subbasin consists of a ca and a partially filled area fig 2k since only the ca contributes surface runoff depression storage and surface runoff are calculated for the ca and the partially filled area separately fig 2k for a ca all pbus within it are fully filled and the corresponding depression storage is given by 11 d s j k ca f s j k ca where d s j k ca is the depression storage of the pbus within the ca in subbasin j at time step k l3 and f s j k ca is the fds corresponding to the ca in subbasin j at time step k l3 to simulate surface runoff the depression storage within the ca at the beginning of time step k is calculated thus the new ca at time step k consists of the ca at time step k 1 and the expanded ca during time step k and the depression storage corresponding to this new ca can be expressed as 12 d s 0 j k ca f s j k 1 ca a j k ca a j k 1 ca c p j k 1 sub where d s 0 j k ca is the depression storage within the ca in subbasin j at the beginning of time step k l3 f s j k 1 ca is the fds associated with the ca in subbasin j at time step k 1 l3 a j k 1 ca and a j k ca are the cas in subbasin j at time step k 1 and k respectively l2 and c p j k 1 sub is the cumulative rainfall excess of subbsin j at time step k 1 l the generated surface runoff fig 2k equals the difference between the volume of rainfall excess in the ca and the available depression storage of this ca which is mathematically expressed as 13 r j k sub p j k sub a j k ca d s j k ca d s 0 j k ca for the partially filled area no surface runoff is generated and all rainfall excess of this area becomes depression storage the total depression storage of the partially filled area at the end of this time step is given by 14 d s j k pfa c p j k sub a j sub a j k ca where d s j k pfa is the depression storage of the partially filled area of subbasin j at time step k l3 and c p j k sub is the cumulative rainfall excess of subbasin j at time step k l the total depression storage of the subbasin including the depression storages of both fully filled and partially filled pbus is given by 15 d s j k sub d s j k ca d s j k pfa in the d vca model the seepage and evapotranspiration of depressions are not simulated thus for a time step without rainfall excess e g time step 5 in fig 2h the ca and depression storage are the same as those at the previous time step and no surface runoff is generated for a time step with rainfall excess the occurrence probabilities of ca depression storage and or surface runoff fig 2l are obtained based on the probability distribution function of ca fig 2c or the fully filled depression storage fig 2d and the corresponding ca or fds at that time step 2 5 model application and evaluation to test the new d vca model a watershed located in the prairie pothole region ppr of north dakota nd was selected fig 3 the watershed is the upper portion of the upper sheyenne river watershed and covers about 4619 7 km2 the watershed outlet is located at the usgs gaging station 05055300 at the sheyenne river above the devils lake outlet near flora nd latitude 47 54 28 n longitude 99 24 56 w this watershed is dominated by numerous depressions fig 3b indicating that the evolution of ca and surface runoff generation processes are subject to the influence of surface depressions in this study a 10 m dem was downloaded from the usgs national map tnm based on the prefilled depressionless dem the watershed was divided into 13 subbasins in addition the original dem of each subbasin was delineated by using the hud dc algorithm to compute all topographic parameters the land use and land cover lulc data and the soil type data which were used to calculate curve numbers were obtained from the national land cover database nlcd 2011 and the state soil geographic statsgo2 dataset respectively hourly rainfall and temperature data were acquired from the north dakota agriculture weather network ndawn and fig 3 shows the ndawn stations in and around the watershed since snowfall data were not available for the ndawn stations the daily snowfall data for the watershed were download from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism and used in the modeling the d vca model was calibrated and validated by using three storm events and one snowmelt event with an hourly time interval the calibration event event 1 ranged from 6 26 2009 18 00 to 7 2 2009 8 00 and the three validation events ranged from 9 20 2019 18 00 to 9 24 2019 0 00 event 2 from 6 13 2017 4 00 to 6 18 2017 10 00 event 3 and from 4 1 2013 0 00 to 5 12 2013 0 00 event 4 the three storm events were selected for evaluating the d vca model since they represented different rainfall conditions in terms of the magnitude duration and distribution in addition they had long antecedent dry periods to minimize the potential impacts of other rainfall events thus the outlet discharge at the beginning of each rainfall event was considered as the initial baseflow due to the small rainfall amount of the real rainfall events the snowmelt event was also selected to evaluate the d vca model for this snowmelt event the initial snowpack water equivalent of each subbasin was obtained from the noaa national weather service s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc snow data assimilation system snodas which provided the best possible estimates of snow cover and related data for hydrologic modeling and analysis a set of major parameters were selected for calibration and their initial values were estimated specifically the scs curve numbers were calculated for all subbasins of the watershed based on the land use and soil type gis data the time of concentration was calculated by using the scs lag method and the lag time of a channel was calculated based on the length of the channel and the velocity estimated by using the manning equation the model was evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed discharges at the usgs gaging stations 05054500 within the watershed fig 3 and 05055300 at the watershed outlet and the observed discharge data for these two gaging stations were downloaded from the usgs national water information system the model performances were quantitatively evaluated by using three statistical metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the observed data rsr moriasi et al 2007 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 the nse rsr and pbias are respectively given by 16 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 17 rsr i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 18 pbias i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i 100 where n is the total number of discharge observations q obs i is the ith observed outlet discharge l3 t q sim i is the ith simulated outlet discharge l3 t and q obs is the mean of the observed outlet discharges l3 t to demonstrate the improvement of the new modeling method developed in this study the d vca model was applied for three modeling scenarios ms1 d vca model with no depressions ms2 d vca model with a lumped depression and ms3 d vca model ms1 represented a configuration of traditional hydrologic modeling in which depressions were not considered ms1 was implemented by setting the depression storage values of all pbus to zero in the d vca model ms2 utilized an approach that has been adopted in many hydrologic models e g swat in which all depressions in a subbasin are aggregated as a lumped storage with a constant contributing area in the d vca model in this scenario a subbasin contains a lumped cbu and a lumped pbu and surface runoff is generated from depressional areas once the lumped depression is fully filled in ms3 the intrinsic changing patterns of cas and depression storages were identified by the d vca model and the depression oriented overland flow dynamics and the formation of cas were simulated in addition to the comparison of the simulated and observed discharges the simulated cas depression storage and surface runoff were also evaluated specifically the simulation results were analyzed and different modeling approaches were discussed to demonstrate the improvement of the d vca model and the reasonability of simulation results the cas and depression storages of all subbasins were calculated for both calibration and validation events based on the surface delineation results then the 95 confidence intervals of the cas and depression storages were identified and compared with the corresponding values simulated by the d vca model to further assess the accuracy of the simulations note that some large depressions were not completely filled under the three real rainfall events and the snowmelt event selected for the model calibration and validation to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the d vca model in simulating the formation and evolution of cas and the surface runoff generation dynamics influenced by topographic depressions a 30 hr design storm with an intensity of 5 cm h was selected and the d vca simulation was performed for the selected watershed using the well calibrated parameters the simulation results were analyzed and new findings were summarized 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of surface topography in this study the watershed was divided into 13 subbasins which were further delineated into 338 132 pbus and cbus fig 4 a depressions dominate a large portion of the watershed and their distribution varies among all subbasins fig 4a fig 4b displays the topographic details for the non depressional areas i e cbus and depressional areas i e pbus of all subbasins specifically the percentages of the depressional areas of all subbasins range from 73 to 92 and the total mds values of the subbasins range from 9 6 106 m3 to 5 8 108 m3 indicating that the surface runoff generation processes in the watershed are controlled by depressions the mds values of individual pbus are important because the pbus with a smaller mds can be fully filled quickly and then contribute surface runoff while the pbus with a larger mds take a longer time to become an effective ca therefore the cumulative distributions of mds of individual pbus were analyzed for all subbasins fig 5 a the mds values of individual pbus in the watershed range from 3 10 3 m3 to 5 8 106 m3 these cumulative distribution curves increase rapidly when the mds ranges between 1 m3 to 100 m3 and for all subbasins the pbus with an mds larger than 100 m3 only account for 15 5 to 31 4 fig 5a suggesting that the subbasins mostly contain depressions with a small mds fig 5b shows the probability distributions of the normalized cas i e ca subbasin area for all subbasins obtained by frequency analyses of the modeling units i e pbus and cbus being part of cas eq 3 therefore these relationships are static and only dependent on the topographic characteristics i e mds and areas of individual pbus eqs 1 3 of each subbasin as shown in fig 5b the normalized cas of all subbasins are greater than zero when the probability is equal to 1 which reflect their non depressional areas and are consistent with the area percentages of their cbus in fig 4b since the depressions with a smaller mds have a higher chance to contribute surface runoff the probability distributions of the cas of all subbasins have a decreasing trend compared to the corresponding cumulative distributions of mds fig 5a as shown in the inset of fig 5b the probability distribution curves are generally not smooth because the entire surface area of a pbu is added to the ca when it is fully filled in addition the probabilities of cas decrease rapidly at smaller ca values which can be attributed to the large number of pbus that can be easily fully filled and become part of the ca fig 5a the decreasing rates of these curves fig 5b gradually decrease with an increase in the ca due to the reduced number of pbus with a larger mds fig 5a the fewer pbus an mds includes the smaller the decreasing rate of the probability of ca is based on these probability distribution curves fig 5b the occurrence probability of a ca during a rainfall snowmelt event can be determined once the ca is simulated 3 2 intrinsic changing patterns of ca and depression storage fig 6 a shows the cai curves for all subbasins which illustrate the changing patterns of ca during the depression filling processes these curves follow a similar increasing trend the cas increase rapidly along a smooth curve at the beginning of depression filling due to the large number of small depressions fig 5 then the increasing rates decrease as the number of small depressions decreases and the curves exhibit a stepwise changing pattern due to the existence of the pbus that take a longer time to be fully filled and to contribute runoff therefore such intrinsic changing patterns of cas stem from the impact of varying topography e g the depression storages and cas of pbus for example subbasin 11 mostly shows gradual and slight stepwise changes in ca while subbasin 12 exhibits sudden and large stepwise increases in ca the occurrence and timing of the gradual and slight or sudden and large stepwise changes in cas are affected by the surface areas and depression storages of individual pbus fig 5b however the stepwise changes in fig 6 are more significant than those in fig 5b because one or more pbus become part of ca when a net water input is applied fig 6 whereas only one pbu is added as a newly expanded ca when calculating the occurrence probability of ca fig 5b fig 6b shows the intrinsic evolutions of fds during depression filling for all subbasins which has a similar increasing pattern like the corresponding cai curve specifically the timing of the stepwise changes is exactly the same in both curves for each subbasin due to the relationship between ca and fds fig 2a and b however the extent of each stepwise increase in fds is greater than that of ca because the magnitude of the mds of pbus is greater than that of their ca therefore in the temporal changes in ca and depression storage the occurrence and timing of smooth stepwise and rapid slow increasing patterns depend on the components of pbus including the mds and surface areas of individual pbus as well as the number of pbus with different sizes the influence of topographic features is in agreement with the finding of grimm and chu 2018 who analyzed the intrinsic relationship between topographic characteristics and ca and quantified the hydrologic connectivity of three different land surfaces located in the ppr of north dakota using a physically based fully distributed model chu et al 2013 yang and chu 2015 3 3 evaluation of model performance fig 7 shows the comparisons of the simulated and observed hydrographs at the usgs gaging stations i e at the outlets of subbasin 13 and the watershed for the calibration event event 1 and the three validation events events 2 4 the results demonstrate the ability of the new d vca model to simulate the hydrograph for these four events the simulated hydrographs follow the general shapes of the observed hydrographs specifically the simulated peak discharges and the time to peak at the watershed outlet were reasonably captured for these three events fig 7 the comparisons indicated that the d vca model did reproduce the depression oriented outlet discharges while the hydrographs showed certain overestimation underestimation which may be caused by the uncertainties in model parameters model simplifications or assumptions and model input data specifically due to the lack of model evaluation against intermediate processes and the non uniqueness of parameters the modeling results are subject to the uncertainties associated with the model parameters the rising limb of the hydrograph at the outlet of subbasin 13 for rainfall event 2 cannot match the observed one very well fig 7d which can be attributed to the lack of accounting for the real spatial temporal variability in rainfall the insufficient characterization for the recession limbs of the hydrographs at the outlet of subbasin 13 and the watershed outlet for event 4 fig 7g and 7 h can be attributed the simplified simulation methods of baseflow recession and channel routing for instance the inundation and backflow effects during spring snowmelt induced flooding cannot be properly simulated by using the lag method for channel routing in addition the second peak of the hydrograph at the outlet of subbasin 13 for event 4 fig 7h was not reproduced because of the lack of the observed rainfall at the ndawn stations to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the d vca model three statistical parameters including rsr nse and pbias were calculated table 1 for the simulated discharges at the watershed outlet the rsr nse and pbias indicated a good agreement between the simulated and observed hydrographs for these four events moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 despite the slight underestimation pbias 0 and the overestimation pbias 0 for the calibration and validation events the pbias values still fell into the recommended range moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 the differences between the simulated and observed discharges at the outlet of subbasin 13 for the three storm events fig 7b d and f were small while the rsr and nse values did not suggest a good performance which is because the small values of the observed discharges at the outlet of subbasin 13 resulted in large numbers of the fractions in eqs 16 and 17 to reveal the influence of surface depressions during the real rainfall and snowmelt events the ca depression storage and surface runoff were analyzed for the calibration and validation events the model performances were evaluated by using the data at two usgs gaging stations and thus the simulation results of the watershed were analyzed for two major areas area i subbasins 6 7 8 9 12 and 13 and area ii subbasins 1 2 3 4 5 10 11 fig 8 a shows the percentages of non depressional areas and depressional cas for areas i and ii indicating that only a small portion of the depressional area contributed surface runoff to the outlet during these four events e g the normalized depressional cas of the snowmelt event for areas i and ii were 0 24 and 0 32 respectively the differences in the connected depressional areas i e the areas that contribute runoff to the drainage system of different major areas subbasins can be attributed to their distinct rainfall snowmelt intensity soil types and land use which affect the amount of rainfall excess and the filling spilling conditions of depressions resulting in significant differences in the depressional cas fig 5a fig 8b shows the depths of depression storage and surface runoff of areas i and ii for the calibration and validation events it can be observed that depressions intercepted a large quantity of excess water suggesting that most excess water was retained by the depressions instead of flowing to the subbasin outlet 3 4 threshold control of depressions on ca the capabilities of the new d vca model were highlighted by examining the dynamic variations in ca during the depression filling spilling processes as shown in fig 6 subbasins 2 6 and 12 are three representative subbasins that had different increasing rates of ca at the beginning of depression filling and different timing of reaching full hydrologic connectivity the 30 hr design storm was applied to these three subbasins fig 9 shows the formation of hydrologic connectivity for subbasins 2 6 and 12 revealing the unique threshold controls of different topographic features the changes in ca and fds of these three subbasins follow a rapid slow and or stepwise trend similar to that of their intrinsic cai and fdi curves fig 6 at the beginning of the simulation the cas of all three subbasins ca 0 represent their non depressional areas cbus with an increase in depression storage subbasin 6 exhibited a rapid increase in ca before 6 of the total depression storage fig 9a which was mainly associated with the pbus with smaller depression storages was filled these pbus accounted for 57 of the subbasin area fig 9a and only 1 of the depression storage of this subbasin fig 9b then the increasing rate of ca decreased since larger pbus took a longer time to be fully filled thus a 20 increase in ca occurred when depression storage increased from 6 to 47 fig 9a and these pbus newly added to the ca accounted for 10 of the total depression storage of the subbasin fig 9b due to the existence of the depressions with a large depression storage the stepwise changing patterns can be observed in both ca and fds fig 9 the plateaus in fig 9 indicate that all partially filled pbus were under the filling condition and they made no contributions to the subbasin outlet at the end of the simulation 96 of the subbasin area fig 9a contributed runoff water to the outlet and the remaining 4 area accounted for 38 of the total depression storage fig 9b subbasin 2 also underwent a rapid slow and stepwise increase in ca during this design storm event the ca increased rapidly at the beginning of depression filling and then the increasing rate of ca decreased this rapid and slow increases occurred until 54 of the depression storage was filled making 88 of the subbasin area connected to its outlet fig 9a which had only 31 of the total depression storage fig 9b the filling spilling processes of the remaining pbus led to the stepwise increasing patterns of ca fig 9 following the rapid and slow increases in ca subbasin 12 underwent slight stepwise increases in ca during this design storm fig 9 and more significant stepwise increases may occur under a larger storm according to fig 6a therefore the ca may increase rapidly slowly and or in a stepwise manner and the occurrence and timing depend on the topographic properties e g the depression storages and cas of pbus the unique changing pattern of ca simulated by the d vca in this study is different from the findings in some other studies e g menkenon et al 2014 in which the simulated ca increased smoothly with an increase in rainfall this is because they estimated the ca using statistical methods which simulated the evolution of ca based on probability distribution functions the results from other studies e g andrés peñuela et al 2016 grimm and chu 2018 wang et al 2019 support the findings from this study regarding the rapid slow and stepwise increasing patterns of ca across different topographic surfaces therefore the simulated ca and depression filling spilling processes reflect the surface runoff generation and allow the model to mimic the threshold controlled overland flow 3 5 threshold control of depressions on overland flow to understand the influence of surface depressions on outlet discharge the simulated surface runoff was normalized by rainfall excess the temporal variations in the normalized runoff were compared for the three selected subbasins subbasins 2 6 and 12 fig 10 a without considering the impact of depressions all rainfall excess would be transferred to surface runoff thus the curves indicate the ratios of rainfall excess transferred to surface runoff and the differences between r pe 1 and the curves represent the part of rainfall excess trapped in depressions surface runoff was generated from the ca and thus the generated surface runoff changed similarly to the ca fig 9a and fig 10a at the beginning of the simulation all depressions were disconnected to the subbasin outlets once rainfall excess occurred non depressional areas and the fully filled pbus contributed runoff water to the outlet with an increase in rainfall excess more pbus were fully filled and thus the transfer ratio of rainfall excess to surface runoff increased subbasins 2 and 6 mostly had higher percentages of ca than subbasin 12 resulting in larger transfer ratios of rainfall excess to surface runoff in subbasins 2 and 6 fig 10a the surface runoff generated from subbasin 2 exceeded that of subbasin 6 after time step 7 fig 10a which was consistent with the changing patterns of the normalized cas of both subbasins fig 9a when smaller depressions were fully filled and larger depressions were still in the filling stage i e the plateaus in fig 9a and b the ca and surface runoff remained constant fig 9a and 10a as a result there was also a stepwise trend in the surface runoff generation process at the end of the design storm event the transfer ratios for subbasins 2 and 6 were 0 94 and 0 96 respectively while the transfer ratio of subbasin 12 was only 0 64 fig 10a these results demonstrate the ability of the new d vca model to simulate the dynamic water release influenced by depressions similar increasing patterns of surface runoff across different types of surface topography were also identified by grimm and chu 2018 who simulated threshold controlled surface runoff for three different land surfaces in the ppr of north dakota to quantify the influence of ca on surface runoff generation fig 10b shows the normalized surface runoff versus the normalized ca these two variables have a proportional relationship which can be explained by eq 13 this finding improved our understanding of the mechanisms of surface runoff generation and provided a method for fast prediction of surface runoff under storm events this linear relationship was also used by antoine et al 2009 to develop the relative surface connection function by using a filling algorithm in their work the ca was equal to the ratio of instantaneous outflow to instantaneous inflow since infiltration and transfer time were not considered and rainfall was uniformly distributed in this study however both infiltration and rainfall excess were simulated and the routing method was employed to account for the transfer time therefore the linear relationship between the normalized surface runoff and the normalized ca is suitable for a permeable soil surface and can be further used to improve hydrologic modeling for depression dominated areas similar to other studies andrés peñuela et al 2016 antoine et al 2011 3 6 more discussions on the features of the d vca model in this study a new modeling method was proposed to mimic depression oriented variable cas and overland flow dynamics and the simulation results showed its good performance in simulating depression influenced watershed responses to further demonstrate the improvement of the d vca model and the reasonability of the simulated ca formation and overland flow generation the simulation results were analyzed and different modeling approaches were compared fig 7 shows the simulated hydrographs at the outlets of subbasin 13 and the watershed during the four selected events for ms1 and ms2 without considering depressions ms1 the model tended to overestimate the streamflow fig 7 by using the lumped depression approach ms2 the model did provide reasonable simulations of the hydrographs at the outlet of subbasin 13 for the three rainfall events while the snowmelt induced streamflow at the outlet of subbasin 13 and the discharges of the four events at the watershed outlet were underestimated in this scenario the underestimation is due to the lumped representation of numerous depressions with different depression storage capacities in which surface runoff was not generated from depressional areas until the lumped depression was fully filled the reasonable simulation results for the rainfall events at the outlet of subbasin 13 is because its direct runoff mainly came from the surface runoff generated on the non depressional areas fig 8 in this simulation ms2 the excess water on the depressional areas of area i subbasins 6 7 8 9 12 and 13 was trapped in depressions and the outlet ca remained the non depressional areas of these subbasins however the new d vca model which accounts for the intrinsic changing patterns of depression storage and ca was able to track the progressive expansion of the ca fig 9 and facilitate the simulation of hierarchical gradual water release from the depression dominated area figs 7 and 10 as shown in fig 8 in the d vca modeling ms3 the ca of area i consists of not only the non depressional areas but also a part of the depressional areas mekonnen et al 2014 and zeng et al 2020 improved depression dominated hydrologic modeling by using probability distribution functions of depression storages fig 11 created based on the data from mekonnen et al 2016a schematically shows the probability density function of depression storage capacities and the corresponding normalized surface areas in a watershed in their methods the threshold depression storage corresponding to overflow spilling under a rainfall condition was first calculated and then the outlet ca was determined which consisted of the non depressional area and the depressional areas where the depression storages were less than the threshold depression storage under this condition the proportion of the outlet ca in the watershed was equal to the total probability of occurrence of the non depressional area and the depressional areas with their depression storages smaller than the threshold depression storage i e the cumulative probability at the threshold depression storage in fig 11b in the d vca model the outlet ca calculated by referring to the intrinsic cai curve equals the areas of the lumped cbu and the pbus with fully filled highest level depressions fig 9a thus the outlet ca estimated by using the probability distribution functions can be different from the real one in contrast the d vca model accounts for the actual variations in ca and characterizes its stepwise changes fig 9a furthermore the accuracy of the cas and depression storages simulated by the d vca model for all subbasins during the selected events was evaluated fig 12 by analyzing the filling spilling of depressions under the same rainfall snowmelt conditions the cas and depression storages at the end of the selected events were identified for all subbasins fig 12 shows the 95 confidence intervals of the cas and depression storages of all subbasins at the end of the selected events the cas and depression storages simulated by the d vca model fell into their 95 ranges respectively implying that the d vca model reasonably accounted for surface depressions and precisely simulated their impacts on the overland flow dynamics as expected during these three rainfall events in june and september the simulated cas were formed only by a small portion of the subbasin areas and most of rainfall excess became depression storage fig 8 this finding is consistent with those from other studies for depression dominated areas e g evenson et al 2015 evenson et al 2016 zeng et al 2020 for example zeng et al 2020 incorporated the probability distribution functions of depression storages into watershed hydrologic modeling and found that the depressional cas were 0 42 of the watershed area for rainfall events in summer and fall months in north dakota evenson et al 2015 simulated water movement across individual depressions for a depression dominated watershed over a 4 year period and showed that more rainfall excess was routed to depression storage and less excess water became surface runoff for the snowmelt event the normalized cas of subbasins vary from 0 30 to 0 59 fig 12 which is consistent with the simulated cas during spring snowmelt periods in other cold climate prairie regions spence and mengistu 2019 van hoy et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 for example van hoy et al 2020 simulated the cold region hydrologic processes in the depression dominated mauvais coulee basin located a few kilometers north of the watershed selected in this study and the simulated fractional cas of the mauvais coulee basin during spring snowmelt periods from 2005 to 2017 ranged from 0 1 to 0 95 particularly the simulated fractional ca during the 2013 spring snowmelt period was about 0 5 the ca simulated for the 2013 spring snowmelt period in the current study is also comparable to the corresponding value for a median flood in a canadian prairie watershed obtained by spence and mengistu 2019 van hoy et al 2020 also reported the variations of depression storage of the mauvais coulee basin during 2014 2017 and described the annual depression storage changes note that as an event based model the d vca model only simulated the changes in depression storage during rainfall snowmelt events it was found from this study that the simulated depression storage at the end of the 2013 snowmelt event varied from 5 mm to 16 mm while the d vca model is capable of simulating the detailed formation of cas and surface runoff generation it should be noted that at this stage the model focuses on the simulation of the depression oriented overland flow dynamics during a rainfall snowmelt event and the influences of depressions on cas and surface runoff analyzed and discussed in this study are based on the simulation results it is expected in future studies to extend the d vca model for continuous simulations over longer time periods including both wet and dry periods and modeling of water losses from depressions e g seepage and evaporation to explore the complex influences of surface depressions on depression dominated hydrologic processes in addition several aspects can be further improved for example the spatial distributions of surface depressions and their influences can be incorporated in the determination of the probability distribution of cas and the routing of surface runoff more tests and applications to a variety of watersheds under various climatic conditions can be used for model evaluation and the model performance can be evaluated by using subbasin level high resolution observed data 4 summary and conclusions in this study a new d vca model was developed to simulate the hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas in the model surface topographic parameters were first analyzed to obtain 1 the probability distribution functions of fully filled depression storage and the corresponding ca and 2 the intrinsic relationships of depression storage versus its net water input i e fdi and ca versus its net water input i e cai both relationship curves were further incorporated in the modeling to determine the ca simulate the filling spilling of depressions and mimic the surface runoff generation processes then the occurrence probabilities of ca depression storage and generated surface runoff were obtained by referring to the probability distribution functions the final outlet hydrograph was simulated by routing the generated surface runoff the d vca model was applied to a depression dominated watershed located in the ppr in north dakota and the major conclusions can be summarized as follows the comparisons between the simulated and observed discharges at the two usgs gaging stations suggested that the d vca model had a good performance in simulating the threshold controlled rainfall and snowmelt runoff processes and the reasonability and accuracy of the simulated cas and depression storages were also indicated in this study the improvement of the d vca model was demonstrated by comparing different modeling methods including the lumped depression approach and the probability distributed model it was found that the ca and depression storage followed a trend similar to that of the corresponding intrinsic cai and fdi curves suggesting that the cai and fdi curves were able to represent the surface runoff generation processes impacted by depressions and their filling and spilling surface runoff followed a trend similar to that of the corresponding ca indicating the significance of considering variable cas in the modeling of depression dominated areas the identified linear relationship between the normalized surface runoff and ca potentially provides an enhanced understanding of the surface runoff generation processes under the influence of surface depressions the linear relationship together with the cai curve can be used for efficient prediction of variable ca and surface runoff in storm events and in particular can also improve hydrologic

4227,the natural occurrence of acid waters in mountainous porphyry cu systems poses challenges for water management considering the increasing water demand and global environmental change unraveling the transport and fate of minerals and metals in these types of acidic river systems is crucial for environmental management to this purpose we develop a transport and a hydrogeochemical model by coupling five components i hydrology ii hydrodynamics iii sediment transport iv solute transport and v hydrogeochemistry our study domain is the yerba loca creek a high altitude acid rock drainage ard basin located in the central andes chile water in the upper basin shows a low ph around 3 and high aluminum copper iron manganese and sulfate concentrations our model reproduced the observed mineralogical and chemical processes by inducing the expected ph dependence on mineral precipitation along the river results showed good agreement between modeled and field data highlighting the main processes that control the transport and fate of minerals and metals in mountainous river systems keywords hydrodynamics acid rock drainage ard hydrogeochemistry integrated numerical modeling reactive transport model 1 introduction snow dominated mountainous areas play an essential role in downstream regions sustaining natural systems populations and industrial activities barnett et al 2005 viviroli et al 2007 together with their role in the hydrological cycle mountain ranges are related to many types of rich mineral deposits especially those with hydrothermally altered rocks on porphyry copper cu stocks areas sillitoe 2010 these porphyry cu systems currently supply nearly three quarters of the world s cu half of the molybdenum mo and approximately one fifth of the gold au sillitoe 2010 these deposits are associated with arc magmatism in active subduction margins such as the andean margin once the hydrothermally altered rocks reach the earth s surface due to a combination of erosion and uplift they undergo weathering processes that in the presence of water typically lead to the generation of acid rock drainage ard bigham and nordstrom 2000 nordstrom and alpers 1999 the resulting exposed rocks have a great potential to be considered an ore deposit with the subsequent possibility of generating a mining complex to benefit from the different metals in them in addition mining activity can increase the exposure of the mineralized rocks to atmospheric weathering processes by increasing the surface area in contact with water and oxygen e g by creating open pits or tunnels reducing individual rock block size and generating highly reactive residues in waste rock dumps or tailings consequently these enhanced weathering processes typically generate acid drainage with high metal and sulfate concentrations which is known as acid mine drainage amd bigham and nordstrom 2000 caraballo et al 2011 caraballo et al 2016 nordstrom and alpers 1999 the andes mountain range especially in chile and argentina has plenty of examples of porphyry cu mineral deposits and hydrothermal alteration zones that in most cases lead to some extent of ard or amd galán et al mar 2003 nieto et al 2007 olías et al 2004 understanding the effect of ard or amd systems on water quality is required to assist decision makers regarding environmental issues such as the impact assessment eia on water systems this can be achieved by developing integrated and interdisciplinary models to adequately represent the different processes involved in the mobility of metals and therefore in the river water quality lechner et al 2017 the mobility of metals in a watershed results from complex interactions between physical chemical and biological processes affecting the solid e

dissolution of watershed rocks mainly due to the dissolution of carbonate minerals and to a lesser extent of some silicates and mixing with neutral waters are the two main mechanisms involved in the natural attenuation of ard and amd neutralization by carbonate dissolution has a marginal effect on porphyry cu systems in contrast mixing has an important impact and is primarily controlled by flow rates and the water chemistry of tributaries along the catchment babiarz et al 1998 shafer et al 1997 in mountain basins the different water sources mainly depend on the rainfall snowfall events and water storage across the watershed williams et al 2015 the streamflow response is concentrated in time flash events and distributed across the watershed area for rainfall dominated basins in contrast for snow dominated basins the snowmelt distributes the flow contribution in both area and time stream sources are fairly concentrated in the area for glacier dominated basins and distributed across several time scales jansson et al 2003 jones et al 2019 considering that hydrochemistry depends on water rock interaction along the watershed the source and timing of water flows are significant to water quality along the river commonly more than 90 of metal contaminants in rivers are transported in a particulate associated form martin and meybeck 1979 and follow the same transport pathways as the natural sediment load of a river hence to understand the fate of metals and minerals across the river it is necessary to characterize the river flow and sediment transport flow is normally characterized by solving the average 1d continuity and momentum equations along the longitudinal axis in rivers these equations are commonly known as saint venant equations and their key parameters are those related to river morphology e g slope channel width and frictional losses chow 1959 hodges 2019 szymkiewicz 1991 the transport of sediment and solutes can be estimated through advection dispersion equations ade with some modifications to represent the temporal delay of solutes typically observed in heterogeneous natural rivers bencala and walters 1983 depending on the flow rate erosion sedimentation processes can be important to represent metal transport typically during low medium flows the precipitates move in small colloids following the same path as dissolved phases however for higher flows high turbulence and shear stress resuspend sand clay particles hosting different mineral phases making metals follow the path of the suspended sediment transport hydrochemistry has a direct control not only on the speciation of the dissolved chemical elements but also on the mineral composition of suspended particles and bottom sediments hydrogeochemical processes in natural water are typically covered by i the sorption desorption of metals in solid phases of the system i e minerals and organic matter and ii mineral precipitation dissolution the above problem in ard or amd is normally addressed in two ways i using a dimensionless partition coefficient k d to relate dissolved and particulate concentration for each metal allison et al 2005 garneau et al 2015 garneau et al 2017 and ii using a more complex chemical model including speciation of elements calculation of mineral saturation index and batch reactions e g using phreeqc or minteqa2 geochemical models allison et al 1991 papassiopi et al 2014 parkhurst and appelo 1999 runkel 2010 runkel et al 2012 different models and approaches have been used to model and study metals mobility garneau et al 2015 garneau et al 2017 kimball et al 2010 massoudieh et al 2010 papassiopi et al 2014 runkel 2010 runkel et al 2012 for example garneau et al 2015 developed a transient model focused on solute and sediment transport phenomena including erosion and sedimentation and a simplified model for chemical processes through a constant k d coefficient allison et al 2005 garneau et al 2017 improved their model using a time space variable k d estimated by the windermere humic aqueous model wham tipping et al 2011 parkhurst and appelo 1999 developed the phreeqc model which calculates chemical speciation on different physicochemical conditions considering the effect of chemical processes such as mineral precipitation or dissolution phreeqc includes a transport module designed for flow in porous media however this transport module is not valid for mountain rivers runkel 2010 developed the oteq model which couples otis runkel 1998 a solute transport model and the chemical model minteq allison et al 1991 to the best of our knowledge none of these studies have quantified at the same time the importance of the different processes involved in metals mobility such as precipitation dissolution hydrological variability and sedimentation erosion this paper introduces an integrated modeling approach to study and predict metal and mineral transport in mountainous rivers affected by acid rock drainage specifically we aim to estimate water acidity and relevant element concentrations both dissolved and particulate along the river and determine the influence of the different processes on the system s behavior we evaluated our modeling framework in a natural acid rock drainage basin in the chilean central andes 2 case study yerba loca creek the yerba loca yl creek is a tributary of the mapocho river which flows across santiago chile fig 1 yl creek is a natural protected alpine catchment located in the central andes range with a mean elevation of 3416 m a s l and a mean slope of 28 4 it covers 109 km2 with nearly 8 1 of the basin area covered by glaciers the upper catchment is characterized by the presence of surface hydrothermal altered rock systems causing ard fig 1 2 1 available data creek topography was obtained from a lidar survey campaign in april 2016 corresponding to a low flow period thus we assume that the obtained topography is representative of the creek bathymetry hourly streamflow at the outlet of the yl basin from 1986 87 to the present is available from the chilean national water agency dga fig 2 b since 2016 flow measurements have been made along the creek using the chloride tracer technique covering different seasons benischke and harum 1990 this technique consists of instantaneously injecting a known amount of salt nacl into the stream while recording dissolved chloride concentration downstream the flow rate is obtained by integrating the measured chloride concentration curve bencala and walters 1983 hydrochemical parameters including ph electrical conductivity and alkalinity along with major ions and trace metal concentrations were measured at different sampling points along the creek fig 1 the total concentration of trace metals was separated into dissolved elements and elements hosted in suspended particles by taking two different water samples at each sampling point one unfiltered and one filtered using a 0 45 μ m pore size syringe filter the chemical analyses of the filtered water samples were considered as dissolved elemental concentrations the concentration of the elements comprising the suspended particles was obtained by subtracting the chemical composition of the filtered samples from the composition of the unfiltered samples every sample was collected in polyethylene bottles preserved with hno 3 to maintain ph below 2 and stored in coolers with ice packs to keep the temperature close to 4 c until arrival at the laboratory in situ parameters electrical conductivity ph oxide reduction potential and temperature were measured with a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter calibrated before each field campaign the analyses were conducted at the als laboratory in chile and acmelab in canada additional information about the field and analytical methods can be found at valenzuela diaz et al 2020 we used the calculation of the charge balance error method cbe nordstrom et al 2009 to control the quality of the analytical data we obtained a cbe 10 for all water samples which is considered reliable for further interpretations fig 3 shows the representative water quality data for the yl creek and its main tributaries valenzuela diaz et al 2020 2 1 1 hydrological characterization precipitation at the yl basin mainly occurs during the fall winter period almost 91 of the annual precipitation is concentrated between april and august mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm year with a strong annual variability 46 of the mean annual precipitation the mean annual temperature is 7 6 0 38 c with the highest mean monthly temperature occurring in january 15 1 c and the lowest in july 0 3 c air relative humidity fluctuates between 5 and 100 and averages 30 whereas the mean cloud fraction is 0 52 and reaches its maximum in winter and minimum in summer the maximum daily mean streamflow occurs in december january reaching about 3 m 3 s during the snow glacier melting season in contrast the daily mean streamflow drops to less than 0 5 m 3 s during the snow accumulation season in winter due to its high altitude between 1600 to 4900 m a s l precipitation mainly occurs as snow in the yl basin consequently hydrology is dominated by snow and glacier processes snowmelt starts in september reaching its maximum contribution between december to january whereas glacial melt becomes a significant component of the total flow discharge at the end of the summer fig 2 2 1 2 hydrogeochemical characterization the upper yl creek is characterized by natural ard i e low ph and high sulfate and metals concentrations at the outlet yl creek shows a high ph seasonal variability valenzuela diaz et al 2020 dominated by the mixing between the upper ard and neutral water tributaries at the middle low yl basin fig 1 and fig 3 the high acidity at the upper yl basin has been reported by several authors barceló 1984 ginocchio et al 2008 gutiérrez et al 2015 valenzuela diaz et al 2020 its origin has been attributed to the oxidation of sulfides at hydrothermal alteration zones associated with the río blanco los bronces porphyry copper molybdenum deposit and the consequent dissolution of these minerals when interacting with snow and glacial meltwaters previous experiments show that when mixing distilled water with soil rock samples from the upper yl creek containing sulfides such as pyrite and chalcopyrite ph values decrease to 1 8 gutiérrez et al 2015 in this research minimum ph values 2 8 were measured at yl 0 upper yl creek and yl 3 chorrillos del plomo during the summer season the chemical composition of water entering the yl creek can be attributed to three main zones in the catchment labeled a b c in fig 1 two at the upper basin a b and one covering the middle and lower basin c zone a uppermost eastern sub basin fig 1 enclosing the hydrothermal alteration zone is characterized by waters with high acidity ph 3 and metal concentration water chemistry measured at yl 0 and yl 3 estero chorrillos del plomo represent tributaries entering the main creek at this zone zone b upper western sub basin is characterized by mild acid waters ph 5 with intermediate to low metal concentration hydrochemistry measured at yl 1 estero rincón represents waters entering the yl creek at this zone finally zone c middle and lower basin is characterized by tributaries with neutral to alkaline water low metal concentrations and relatively high alkalinity these tributaries can play a key role in the neutralization process of the acidic waters of the main creek in this zone the water chemistry of the tributaries is well represented by the hydrochemistry measured at yl 5 estero leonera in situ precipitation of minerals of different colors can be observed along the creek as the ph tends to increase downstream due to water neutralization sediments color changes from orange reddish in the upper or middle basin to white in the middle or lower part of the basin and a few times to greenish white in the lower basin correa burrows et al 2021 performed different chemical and mineralogical analyses on the river precipitates showing that all of them were comprised of very poorly crystalline minerals with iron fe sulfur s or aluminum al as its main constituents specifically the reddish orange precipitates are made of fe s the white precipitates of al s and the greenish white precipitates of cu al s correa burrows et al 2021 characterized the bulk chemistry by mineral acid digestion followed by wet chemical analysis using icp ms and the mineralogy of the precipitates using x ray diffraction they proposed schwertmannite and hydrobasaluminite as the most plausible mineral phases responsible for fe and al precipitation in yl respectively reported precipitation values for schwertmannite range from ph 1 93 to ph 4 71 caraballo et al 2013 whereas the reported precipitation values for hydrobasaluminite range from ph 4 0 to ph 5 5 caraballo et al 2013 españa 2007 sánchez españa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018 in yl fe precipitation has been observed in a ph range greater than the reported for schwertmannite thus considering that ferrihydrite has been broadly observed in ard rivers in the ph range from 5 to 8 bigham and nordstrom 2000 kimball et al 2010 nordstrom and alpers 1999 sánchez españa et al 2011 we included ferrihydrite as a plausible fe bearing mineral phase on the other hand cu behavior can be different from al and fe cu is very commonly associated with sorption processes into precipitated hydrous ferric oxides hfo runkel et al 1999 and hydrobasaluminite carrero et al 2015 recent evidence supports the sorption of cu into hydrobasaluminite at yl creek s outlet navarrete calvo et al 2018 and downstream after its confluence with a neutral alkaline river call san francisco montecinos et al 2020 as far as we know there are no cu sorption numerical models available for hydrobasaluminite hence we evaluate considering cu sorption only into hydrous ferric oxide precipitates hfo runkel et al 1999 therefore for cu we considered sorption into ferrihydrite using the diffuse double layer model dzombak and morel 1990 and precipitation into a cu mineral cu hydroxysulfate was selected as the most plausible cu mineral in yl creek the selection for this latter mineral took into account the high dissolved sulfate concentration on yl creek and thermodynamics calculations saturation index 0 runkel et al 1999 reaction equations for these minerals are shown in table 1 water samples in the yl creek and its tributaries show particulate al at ph 3 3 5 however hydrobasaluminite is normally undersaturated at ph 4 sánchez españa et al 2011 thus particulate al in these acid conditions is probably not related to hydrobasaluminite and could be due to other al sulfates like alunite or rostite caraballo et al 2011 besides those al sulfates are typically quite soluble at higher ph therefore the observed particulate al in acid waters is most likely to be hosted in al bearing minerals with low dissolving rates thus we assumed that all the particulate al entering the yl creek from tributaries with water ph 4 is attributed to a mineral phase of al unable to chemically react along the yl creek 3 model similar to garneau et al 2015 and runkel et al 1996 we used a sub models approach to solve the mineral and metal transport the model is composed of five sub models i hydrological ii hydrodynamic iii solute transport iv sediment transport and v hydrogeochemical sub models are solved in the order listed above assuming that each sub model depends on the previous one but is independent of the next fig 4 first i is solved to obtain streamflows distribution along the creek q l secondly ii is solved to obtain the river hydrodynamics flow height area and velocity along the creek we assume that the results from these two initial submodels are independent of subsequent ones i e solute transport sediment transport and hydrogeochemical processes do not produce changes in hydrology either hydrodynamics lastly having the streamflow and hydrodynamics along the creek the rest of the sub models are solved with an iterative method at a small time step 1 5 min details are shown in section 3 6 sub models iii and iv are solved to determine the transport and mixing of both dissolved and particulate phases and finally v determines whether a phase change occurs precipitation dissolution sorption due to water chemistry

bottom bucket represents a deep layer that regulates the base flow generation yates 1996 yates et al 2005 snowmelt is modeled through a degree day approach hock 2003 while glaciers mass balance is modeled with a simplified radiative approach condom et al 2012 meteorological forcings were distributed throughout the sub catchment units spatially distributed daily precipitation and temperature

meteorological stations morphological characteristics and era interim reanalysis for continental chile dee et al 2011 wind velocity and relative humidity at 2 meter height were obtained at a daily

on gafurov and bardoyy 2009 a multi objective calibration was implemented at a daily time step to represent both snow accumulation and streamflow maximizing the determination coefficient r 2 of the

experienced a megadrought boisier 2015 leading to a lower equivalent accumulation of snow water in the andes cornwell et al 2016 garreaud et al 2017 to better represent the low snow accumulation and streamflows observed during this period part of it was considered for the model calibration therefore the warm up calibration and validation periods were respectively 1998 1999 2006 2015 and 2000 2005 3 2 hydrodynamic sub model the yl creek is a long narrow and shallow river system where the main momentum changes occur in the longitudinal direction therefore the hydrodynamics along the river were obtained from the 1 d model hec ras version 5 03 brunner 2010 the river cross sections were obtained every 30 m from the lidar survey data providing a good representation of the river geometry along the creek hec ras solves the energy balance between consecutive cross sections estimating frictional losses using the manning equation eq 1 1 qn s f ar h 2 3 where q is the flow rate m 3 s 1 s f is the friction slope a is the flow cross section area m 2 r h is the hydraulics radius m and n is the manning friction coefficient s m 1 3 n can be estimated as a function of the surface roughness represented in armor mountain rivers by the sediment diameter d 90 90 of the particles in the sediment sample are finer than the d 90 grain size using the strickler eq 2 chow 1959 2 s t 0 12 g n d 90 1 6 where g ms 2 is the gravitational acceleration this relation eq 2 is not valid when flow depths are not much higher than the bottom roughness d 90 niño et al 2018 this condition known as macro roughness is typically found in mountain rivers resulting in higher values of s t thus for r h d 90 10 s t values can be estimated as eq 3 limerinos 1970 3 s t r h d 90 1 6 k 1 r h d 90 k 2 where k 1 and k 2 are empirical coefficients we use k 1 3 3 and k 2 0 57 these values were reported by niño 2002 for the mapocho basin according to eq 3 s t increase asymptotically when r h d 90 0 resulting in extremely high and not physically possible n values eq 3 thus we impose r h d 90 1 to constrain n values an iterative methodology was implemented in hec ras to estimate manning coefficients at each cross section for a given flow rate 3 3 solute transport sub model solute transport is conceptually based on runkel 1998 the model defines two zones for the river i the water column wc where advection dispersion are the dominant transport mechanisms and ii the storage zone sz hyporheic or stagnant zones where the main transport mechanism is diffusion while advection dispersion processes are negligible fig 4 due to the yl creek morphology narrow and shallow river solutes are expected to be well mixed in the transverse and vertical directions thus solute transport is solved in the longitudinal direction 1d in the same 1d grid used for modeling the system hydrodynamics transport is solved for each dissolved species and river zone using eqs 4 and 5 for wc and sz respectively 4 c

sediment transport sub model sediment transport sub model is similar to the 1d solute transport sub model but the exchange mass process between wc and sz is different we assume that the exchange of sediments between wc and sz are dominated by erosion and sedimentation garneau et al 2015 for each particulate species we solve eqs 6 and 7 for wc and sz respectively 6 c p t uc p x a x ad l c p x w r

garneau et al 2015 however this approach does not consider the effects of ph and ionic strength both important to properly model the precipitation of fe and al mineral phases in the water bethke and brady 2000 runkel et al 1999 consequently we relax the constant k d assumption in our model and use phreeqc to simulate the main hydrogeochemical processes these processes respond to mixing waters with different compositions between the main creek and tributaries including dilution and neutralization effects mineral precipitation dissolution and sorption of cu on hfo furthermore based on calculating chemical speciation this methodology allows estimating the evolution of ph metal and other chemical compounds concentrations along the main creek mineral precipitation or dissolution is focused on previously selected minerals section 2 1 2 schwertmannite ferryhidrite hydrobasaluminite and cu hydroxysulfate mineral precipitation occurs almost instantaneously in places where neutralization happens via alkaline tributary inflows diz et al 1999 wanner et al 2018 for example using the expression proposed by diz et al 1999 eq 11 we estimate that schwertmannite precipitation occurs in nearly 0 5 min in the yerba loca creek 11 log t ind 6 7 1 29 ph 0 94 log so 4 2 0 36 log fe where t ind is the induction time in seconds refer to the time of appearance of the first schwertmannite precipitates diz et al 1999 and so 4 2 and fe are sulfate and iron molar concentrations on the other hand wanner et al 2018 and caraballo et al 2019 showed that hydrobasaluminite precipitation occurs instantaneously also our field observations showed that the neoformed precipitates appear immediately after the confluence of the main river with alkaline tributaries thus we assumed that mineral precipitation occurs fast enough to be modeled as instantaneous to evaluate the potential dissolution of the selected minerals we performed simulations on phreeqc we simulate the water s chemical compositions obtained from samples along the yl creek assuming chemical equilibrium we found that hydrobasaluminite begins to redissolve for ph values above 6 5 while schwertmannite for ph values above 4 usually mineral dissolution at these ph values is very slow for example sánchez españa et al 2011 studied hydrobasaluminite and schwertmannite precipitation and for ph 4 they did not observe mineral dissolution in the time scale of hours acero and hudson edwards 2018 proposed the following expression to obtain basaluminite which is formed due to the spontaneous dehydration under atmospheric conditions of hydrobasaluminite brydon and singh 1969 dissolution rates 12 rate al 10 7 3 a h 0 64 e 78 rt where rate al is al release from dissolving basaluminite mol m 2 s 1 a h is the activity of hydrogen ion r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature k using eq 12 we obtained that dissolving 1 mg of hydrobasaluminite at ph 6 takes more than 52 h thus considering that the water transit time in the main yl creek is around 5 h mineral dissolution at relatively high ph would be negligible therefore we neglect mineral dissolution for ph 6 5 in the case of hydrobasaluminite and ph 4 in the case of schwertmannite chemical reactions in water are faster than advection dispersion processes rubin 1983 toro 1976 thus and considering that mineral precipitation and dissolution are almost instantaneous we assume chemical equilibrium with mineral phases at each time step of the numerical model and along the creek except for the dissolution of hydrobasaluminite and schwertmannite for ph 6 5 and ph 4 respectively which are neglected as the ph cannot be transported explicitly h hydrogen ion molar concentration is estimated and transported using the solute transport model eqs 4 and 5 then ph is calculated from eq 13 13 ph t log 10 h t γ t 1 where γ t 1 is the hydrogen ion activity coefficient calculated from phreeqc in the previous model time step 3 6 sub models coupling methodology first we use the daily simulated streamflows from the hydrological sub model to solve the hydrodynamics sub model on the same daily scale assuming a steady flow for each day secondly hydrogeochemistry solute transport and sediment transport sub models are coupled using a two step methodology i particulate and dissolved reference concentrations are obtained by solving transport equations eqs 4 5 6 and 7 assuming r 0 and r s 0 then ii chemistry speciation and dissolution precipitation sorption for particulate and dissolved concentrations and ph values is solved using the hydrogeochemical sub model and reference concentrations obtained in i this allows to estimate r and r s and to calculate particulate and dissolved concentrations an implicit finite volume method is implemented with the leonard quick high order numerical scheme leonard 1979 to solve the solutes and sediment transport equations leonard s quick scheme uses a three point upstream weighted quadratic interpolation for cell face values a dirichlet boundary condition is used upstream considering a fixed concentration value c x 0 c 0 while a neumann boundary condition is considered downstream i e dc dx 0 the hydrochemistry and flow rates of lateral creeks draining to yl creek were considered as boundary conditions in the model the hydrochemistry of the tributaries was considered according to the zone to which they belong figs 1 and 3 since we are interested in acid water conditions we analyzed summer periods where acidity increases due to water rock interactions in the upper basin in the hydrothermal alteration zone during snow and glacier melting fig 2 we simulated three different days during the summer of 2013 2014 and 2015 where we have coincident field measurements during the day in all the sampling points along the yerba loca catchment to study the expected hydrochemical variability we additionally modeled 15 days before and 15 days after the selected days 31 days in total the hydrological and hydrodynamics sub models were simulated on a daily scale within each period the other modules hydrogeochemistry solutes transport and sediment transport were solved using a time step equals to 100 s 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrology the comparison between simulated and observed mean daily streamflows at the yl outlet is shown in fig 2 b simulated daily streamflows show a good correlation with observed data along the year representing snow accumulation and snow glacial melting high kge values for both the calibration 2006 2015 and validation 2000 2005 periods were obtained kge cal 0 767 and kge val 0 698 weap simulated streamflows well represent the flow variability α cal 1 025 and α val 1 036 and mean flow β cal 1 01 and β val 1 25 however a small mean flow overestimation β 1 is observed for the validation period also the relatively low streamflow linear correlation r cal 0 76 and r val 0 835 indicates problems representing the timing of daily streamflows during the melting season this is reflected in the moderately low r values obtained for fsca r fsca 0 839 and r fsca 0 839 for calibration and validation periods respectively model calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 streamflows along the yl creek have a marked variability throughout the year fig 5 a shows mean seasonal streamflows along the yl main channel defined as fall march april may mam winter june july august jja spring september october november son and summer december january february djf throughout fall mam and winter jja periods the simulated streamflows are low and stable suggesting that baseflow is the main component of the hydrograph on the other hand higher and more time variable streamflows are observed during spring son and summer djf where snow and glacier melting from the upper basin mainly contribute to the total runoff fig 2 snowmelt begins at low medium altitudes in september while at the upper catchments start in november fig 5 b following the snowmelt seasonality and the start of the glacial melting yl streamflow reaches its maximum in december fig 2 as shown in fig 2 increasing streamflow is correlated with a decreasing ph the minimum ph values is reached in december showing that ph values mainly respond to waters from the upper catchment particularly from the hydrothermal alteration zones fig 1 at low altitude sub basins the center time runoff of main daily streamflows occurs between august and september due to rain and early snowmelt however despite low altitude sub basins cover near 26 of the total basin area their flow discharge only represents 15 of the total annual streamflow on the other hand at high altitude sub basins the center time runoff of mean daily streamflow occurs between december and january showing the contribution of high altitude snow and glacial melting to the total runoff despite only covering near 28 of the basin area this zone contributes to near 37 of the total annual streamflow particularly during djf high altitude sub basins contribute to near 50 of the total runoff a transition is observed for medium altitude sub basins as the center time runoff of mean daily streamflows moves between november and december medium altitude sub basins contribute 48 of the total annual streamflow and cover 46 of the basin area 4 2 hydrodynamics fig 6 shows the model results of the main hydraulic variables for simulated days during december 2013 this figure shows that macro roughness r h d 90 10 persists along the whole creek resulting in high n values mean flow velocity and flow depth are around 2 m s and 0 3 m respectively these results match with observed flow velocities and flow depths in the same period field measured flow depths ranges between 0 15 0 40 m while flow velocities between 1 0 2 5 m s high flow velocities v 10 m s are particularly observed along the steepest sections of the creek these results are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as hec ras is recommended for river slopes lower than 0 18 m m however these results are restricted to short sections so they do not significantly impact the transport model results characteristic parameters needed for the solute and sediment transport model a s α and d l were calibrated through chloride tracer experiments bencala and walters 1983 obtained values are in the range of α 0 0001 0 0007 s 1 a s a 0 2 1 and d l 0 5 2 m 2 s 1 high values of a s a are related to high friction coefficients bencala and walters 1983 which in the case of the yl creek are explained by the presence of macro roughness for the model we used α 0 0005 s 1 a s a 0 5 and d l 1 m 2 s 1 which provided good results along the creek at the daily scales 4 3 hydrogeochemistry we evaluated the performance of our phreeqc hydrogeochemical model by comparing the model results with chemical data obtained from water samples at the yl creek during 2013 2015 we analyzed if the model represents the neutralization and partition processes observed in yl water samples to this end chemical equilibrium and mineral dissolution precipitation were calculated using phreeqc and assuming an initial ph of 2 5 regardless of the field measured ph this calculation was repeated for small ph increments until ph 8 was reached thus we obtained dissolved concentration curves for each sample as a function of ph lines in fig 7 at low ph values these curves remain horizontal as the metals stay dissolved however when ph increases and precipitation occurs the dissolved concentrations decrease the model shows that hydrobasaluminite precipitation occurs on a ph range of 4 6 5 3 fig 7 this ph range acts as a barrier for the presence of dissolved al in water and most field samples show none or almost none al dissolved concentrations at greater ph values this modeled ph range induced by hydrobasaluminite precipitation has also been reported on other mountainous areas like the swiss alps and rocky mountains caraballo et al 2019 wanner et al 2018 regarding dissolved fe concentrations this element almost disappears after the precipitation barrier generated by schwertmannite at a ph range of 3 0 4 5 the remaining dissolved iron tends to completely disappear in the region of the ferrihydrite precipitation barrier ph 4 5 5 0 these observations agree with previous studies for example sánchez españa et al 2011 reported schwertmannite precipitation starting around ph 3 0 and finishing at around ph 3 5 cu sorption into ferrihydrite accounts only for 0 1 2 0 of the total cu partition this is explained as most of the dissolved fe precipitates at low ph values generating schwertmannite while small amounts of fe precipitation occurs in the range of ph values necessary to generate ferrihydrite this generates a low amount of ferrihydrite available for cu sorption thus we neglect cu sorpotion into ferrihydrite for our analysis the overlap in ph ranges for hydrobasaluminite precipitation and cu partitioning shaded areas in fig 7 indicate a possible relation between hydrobasaluminite precipitation and cu partition fig 7 carrero et al 2015 proposed hydrobasaluminite as a cu sink while montecinos et al 2020 discuss the possibility of cu sorption in hydrobasaluminite at the mapocho basin cu sorption into hydrobasaluminite is not well established and thus further research is necessary to incorporate this process in our model 4 4 mineral and metal transport results for december 2013 are shown in fig 8 see graphical results for december 2014 and december 2015 in appendix modeled flow discharge in december 2013 varies between 15 450 l s at the upper section of the model and between 700 and 1250 l s at the catchment outlet on december 11 2013 simulated flow rates are near the minimum values obtained for the month period and underestimate instantaneous field measurements the streamflow underestimation can partially be explained due to significant intraday flow variations observed during the melting season with maximum values occurring afternoon however flow underestimation is also observed in results associated with dissolved sulfates s 0 4 2 since it can be considered as a conservative tracer in the system bigham and nordstrom 2000 nordstrom 2011 thus underestimating s 0 4 2 along the creek reveals the underestimation of flow rates from tributaries particularly from the upper catchment where s 0 4 2 concentrations are higher fig 3 also for 2014 and 2015 the simulated streamflows are underestimated in the upper catchment fig a 1 and fig a 2 in appendix a at the upper basin s hydrology which is dominated by snow and glacial melting intraday variations of meteorological forcing temperature and solar radiation among others significantly affect the discharges thus the simple degree day and radiative approach used to simulate snow and glacial melting are insufficient to represent streamflows in the upper yl catchment accurately however at the scale of the entire catchment the hydrological model is suitable to represent the mean deviation and temporal variability of the observed flows the implementation of a more complex hydrological model is beyond the scope of this work despite the observed differences between simulated and measured flow rates modeled ph and metals mineral concentrations show good agreement with measured values also model results show significant variation in water quality through the month period shaded areas these variations are mainly due to the ph control on mineral precipitation for example in days where low ph values were simulated ph 4 5 the al remains dissolved along the entire yl creek as hydrobasaluminite precipitation is not likely at those ph values contrary in days where higher ph values were simulated metals partition change along the yl creek thus dissolved concentration decreases or even disappears at the yl outlet simulated metals and minerals variability directly respond to the simulated stream variability significantly lower metals and mineral variability are reported in fig a 1 november december 2015 which is consistent with the simulated low flows variability for that period our results suggest significant amounts of particulate al and fe concentrations in the riverbed sediments these results are not validated against field measurements but they are consistent with the observed distribution of orange reddish fe and white al precipitates along the creek during the field campaigns particulate al and fe concentrations in the riverbed sediments are greatly controlled by the ph neutralization along the yerba loca creek and follow the same tendency observed in the water column with higher values of fe concentrations after the confluence with chorrillos yl 3 and higher values of al concentrations after the confluence with leonera yl 5 however both particulate fe and al show significantly higher concentration in the bottom sediments than in the water column suggesting bottom sediments as a sink of fe and al in the system table 3 shows three criteria for evaluating the model performance when daily field data is available the used criteria are the normalized root mean square error nrmse normalized with mean observation values the coefficient of determination r 2 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 in terms of r 2 all parameters show a good correlation with observations evidencing that the model represents the increase or decrease in element metal concentrations mainly ph r 2 values are high which shows that the model represents the ph changes when the river is neutralized or acidified moreover except for the kge value for ph in 2013 both nrmse and kge indicators are good for ph showing that the model can represent the ph along the stream in general all the other variables show good kge and nrmse values with some exceptions mainly in 2014 where negative values of kge are obtained for some variables to test the relative importance of the different sub models we performed simulations for a specific period while neglecting one sub model fig 9 shows three comparative cases regarding fe during december 2013 along the creek cm refers to the entire model showed in fig 8 wh indicates the simulation without considering the hydrogeochemical sub model while wes the simulations without considering the erosion sedimentation sub model for dissolved fe there are no considerable differences between cases cm and wes as the erosion sedimentation process mainly affects the particulate phase however the wh case overestimates dissolved fe concentrations in near 500 as mineral precipitation transfers mass from the dissolved to the particulate phase this explains the underestimation of particulate fe for the wh case the erosion sedimentation sub model wes effect is evident in particulate fe concentrations showing a decrease in near 25 70 respect to the complete model cm these results suggest a dominant mass transfer from the storage zone sz to the water column wc generated by erosion 4 5 environmental implications understanding and predicting water quality in amd and ard environments is fundamental for characterizing river systems and developing practical pollution management strategies our model approach shows to be a valuable tool for these objectives in the short term our model can help develop emergency plans in case of accidents i e spills tailing dam breach etc or in predicting when contaminants will reach a certain point in the river for example a drinking or irrigation water intake in the long term the strong linkage with the catchment hydrology will help projecting water quality under future climate scenarios also this modeling approach can assist the management of river systems by analyzing the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities in the medium and long term for example under ard and amd environments high metal concentrations are stored in the sediments these sediments can remain a source of metals for an extended period so it is important to analyze and consider this effect when implementing decontamination strategies the explicit link between hydrology or anthropogenic water discharges with transport processes results in a valuable approach to assessing the relative impact of each water source on water quality throughout the river system thus the proposed model could be used to develop water quality baselines or pre mining conditions for example to determine water quality baselines in ard systems valenzuela diaz et al 2020 finally and with a back analysis approach the model could be helpful to identify unknown contaminant sources 5 conclusions we developed an integrated model composed of five different sub models combining hydrology hydrodynamic hydrogeochemical and sediment transport to study and predict the transport and fate of metals and minerals along a mountainous river system our proposed integrated model can generate realistic representations of main variables controlling ard and amd i e ph metal and mineral concentrations along the ard yerba loca creek in central chile fig 8 the water hydrochemistry in particular ph values varies significantly along the channel and in time showing a strong correlation with the catchment hydrology mineral precipitation controlling ph values appears as a critical process for correctly representing the system hydrochemistry a significant amount of fe and al precipitation occurs for specific ph values our results suggest that an essential portion of these metals sink into the bottom sediments the contribution of both hydrogeochemical and erosion sedimentation sub models to the integrated model is significant fig 9 for acidic mountainous rivers like yl creek the hydrogeochemical sub model is essential to estimate metal and mineral concentrations for example if the hydrochemical sub model is not considered fe dissolved metal concentrations could be overestimated in near 500 in the yl creek to a lower extent a similar effect was observed for al and cu as higher ph values are needed for the precipitation of al and cu minerals i e hydrobasaluminite and cu hydroxysulfate however for higher ph systems as is observed at the mapocho river downstream of the yl creek outlet al and cu precipitation would become more relevant regarding the erosion sedimentation submodel it has an essential contribution to the transfer of minerals from the riverbed to the water column for example resuspension of fe minerals accounts for near 25 70 of the particulate fe in the water column of yl in summary the integrated model presented in this article provides a valuable tool to understand an acid drainage system regarding its ph and metals concentrations also it allows estimating the spatial and temporal evolution of the river water chemistry resulting from complex interactions between the hydrology hydrodynamic hydrogeochemical and sediment transport future work will explore the effect of high flow events and water quality changes due to climate change for this purpose we need to improve the representation of physical processes relevant to snow dominated catchments representing simulations of distributed discharge in the yl creek on a sub daily scale can further enhance the system understanding furthermore proper characterization of water flow and hydrological connectivity can provide more reliable estimates of rock water interaction in space and time also further mineralogical studies are necessary to characterize the partition of cu on the system data availability gis information and simulated streamflow series and water samples used in our simulations are available at https doi org 10 6084 m9

4227,the natural occurrence of acid waters in mountainous porphyry cu systems poses challenges for water management considering the increasing water demand and global environmental change unraveling the transport and fate of minerals and metals in these types of acidic river systems is crucial for environmental management to this purpose we develop a transport and a hydrogeochemical model by coupling five components i hydrology ii hydrodynamics iii sediment transport iv solute transport and v hydrogeochemistry our study domain is the yerba loca creek a high altitude acid rock drainage ard basin located in the central andes chile water in the upper basin shows a low ph around 3 and high aluminum copper iron manganese and sulfate concentrations our model reproduced the observed mineralogical and chemical processes by inducing the expected ph dependence on mineral precipitation along the river results showed good agreement between modeled and field data highlighting the main processes that control the transport and fate of minerals and metals in mountainous river systems keywords hydrodynamics acid rock drainage ard hydrogeochemistry integrated numerical modeling reactive transport model 1 introduction snow dominated mountainous areas play an essential role in downstream regions sustaining natural systems populations and industrial activities barnett et al 2005 viviroli et al 2007 together with their role in the hydrological cycle mountain ranges are related to many types of rich mineral deposits especially those with hydrothermally altered rocks on porphyry copper cu stocks areas sillitoe 2010 these porphyry cu systems currently supply nearly three quarters of the world s cu half of the molybdenum mo and approximately one fifth of the gold au sillitoe 2010 these deposits are associated with arc magmatism in active subduction margins such as the andean margin once the hydrothermally altered rocks reach the earth s surface due to a combination of erosion and uplift they undergo weathering processes that in the presence of water typically lead to the generation of acid rock drainage ard bigham and nordstrom 2000 nordstrom and alpers 1999 the resulting exposed rocks have a great potential to be considered an ore deposit with the subsequent possibility of generating a mining complex to benefit from the different metals in them in addition mining activity can increase the exposure of the mineralized rocks to atmospheric weathering processes by increasing the surface area in contact with water and oxygen e g by creating open pits or tunnels reducing individual rock block size and generating highly reactive residues in waste rock dumps or tailings consequently these enhanced weathering processes typically generate acid drainage with high metal and sulfate concentrations which is known as acid mine drainage amd bigham and nordstrom 2000 caraballo et al 2011 caraballo et al 2016 nordstrom and alpers 1999 the andes mountain range especially in chile and argentina has plenty of examples of porphyry cu mineral deposits and hydrothermal alteration zones that in most cases lead to some extent of ard or amd galán et al mar 2003 nieto et al 2007 olías et al 2004 understanding the effect of ard or amd systems on water quality is required to assist decision makers regarding environmental issues such as the impact assessment eia on water systems this can be achieved by developing integrated and interdisciplinary models to adequately represent the different processes involved in the mobility of metals and therefore in the river water quality lechner et al 2017 the mobility of metals in a watershed results from complex interactions between physical chemical and biological processes affecting the solid e

dissolution of watershed rocks mainly due to the dissolution of carbonate minerals and to a lesser extent of some silicates and mixing with neutral waters are the two main mechanisms involved in the natural attenuation of ard and amd neutralization by carbonate dissolution has a marginal effect on porphyry cu systems in contrast mixing has an important impact and is primarily controlled by flow rates and the water chemistry of tributaries along the catchment babiarz et al 1998 shafer et al 1997 in mountain basins the different water sources mainly depend on the rainfall snowfall events and water storage across the watershed williams et al 2015 the streamflow response is concentrated in time flash events and distributed across the watershed area for rainfall dominated basins in contrast for snow dominated basins the snowmelt distributes the flow contribution in both area and time stream sources are fairly concentrated in the area for glacier dominated basins and distributed across several time scales jansson et al 2003 jones et al 2019 considering that hydrochemistry depends on water rock interaction along the watershed the source and timing of water flows are significant to water quality along the river commonly more than 90 of metal contaminants in rivers are transported in a particulate associated form martin and meybeck 1979 and follow the same transport pathways as the natural sediment load of a river hence to understand the fate of metals and minerals across the river it is necessary to characterize the river flow and sediment transport flow is normally characterized by solving the average 1d continuity and momentum equations along the longitudinal axis in rivers these equations are commonly known as saint venant equations and their key parameters are those related to river morphology e g slope channel width and frictional losses chow 1959 hodges 2019 szymkiewicz 1991 the transport of sediment and solutes can be estimated through advection dispersion equations ade with some modifications to represent the temporal delay of solutes typically observed in heterogeneous natural rivers bencala and walters 1983 depending on the flow rate erosion sedimentation processes can be important to represent metal transport typically during low medium flows the precipitates move in small colloids following the same path as dissolved phases however for higher flows high turbulence and shear stress resuspend sand clay particles hosting different mineral phases making metals follow the path of the suspended sediment transport hydrochemistry has a direct control not only on the speciation of the dissolved chemical elements but also on the mineral composition of suspended particles and bottom sediments hydrogeochemical processes in natural water are typically covered by i the sorption desorption of metals in solid phases of the system i e minerals and organic matter and ii mineral precipitation dissolution the above problem in ard or amd is normally addressed in two ways i using a dimensionless partition coefficient k d to relate dissolved and particulate concentration for each metal allison et al 2005 garneau et al 2015 garneau et al 2017 and ii using a more complex chemical model including speciation of elements calculation of mineral saturation index and batch reactions e g using phreeqc or minteqa2 geochemical models allison et al 1991 papassiopi et al 2014 parkhurst and appelo 1999 runkel 2010 runkel et al 2012 different models and approaches have been used to model and study metals mobility garneau et al 2015 garneau et al 2017 kimball et al 2010 massoudieh et al 2010 papassiopi et al 2014 runkel 2010 runkel et al 2012 for example garneau et al 2015 developed a transient model focused on solute and sediment transport phenomena including erosion and sedimentation and a simplified model for chemical processes through a constant k d coefficient allison et al 2005 garneau et al 2017 improved their model using a time space variable k d estimated by the windermere humic aqueous model wham tipping et al 2011 parkhurst and appelo 1999 developed the phreeqc model which calculates chemical speciation on different physicochemical conditions considering the effect of chemical processes such as mineral precipitation or dissolution phreeqc includes a transport module designed for flow in porous media however this transport module is not valid for mountain rivers runkel 2010 developed the oteq model which couples otis runkel 1998 a solute transport model and the chemical model minteq allison et al 1991 to the best of our knowledge none of these studies have quantified at the same time the importance of the different processes involved in metals mobility such as precipitation dissolution hydrological variability and sedimentation erosion this paper introduces an integrated modeling approach to study and predict metal and mineral transport in mountainous rivers affected by acid rock drainage specifically we aim to estimate water acidity and relevant element concentrations both dissolved and particulate along the river and determine the influence of the different processes on the system s behavior we evaluated our modeling framework in a natural acid rock drainage basin in the chilean central andes 2 case study yerba loca creek the yerba loca yl creek is a tributary of the mapocho river which flows across santiago chile fig 1 yl creek is a natural protected alpine catchment located in the central andes range with a mean elevation of 3416 m a s l and a mean slope of 28 4 it covers 109 km2 with nearly 8 1 of the basin area covered by glaciers the upper catchment is characterized by the presence of surface hydrothermal altered rock systems causing ard fig 1 2 1 available data creek topography was obtained from a lidar survey campaign in april 2016 corresponding to a low flow period thus we assume that the obtained topography is representative of the creek bathymetry hourly streamflow at the outlet of the yl basin from 1986 87 to the present is available from the chilean national water agency dga fig 2 b since 2016 flow measurements have been made along the creek using the chloride tracer technique covering different seasons benischke and harum 1990 this technique consists of instantaneously injecting a known amount of salt nacl into the stream while recording dissolved chloride concentration downstream the flow rate is obtained by integrating the measured chloride concentration curve bencala and walters 1983 hydrochemical parameters including ph electrical conductivity and alkalinity along with major ions and trace metal concentrations were measured at different sampling points along the creek fig 1 the total concentration of trace metals was separated into dissolved elements and elements hosted in suspended particles by taking two different water samples at each sampling point one unfiltered and one filtered using a 0 45 μ m pore size syringe filter the chemical analyses of the filtered water samples were considered as dissolved elemental concentrations the concentration of the elements comprising the suspended particles was obtained by subtracting the chemical composition of the filtered samples from the composition of the unfiltered samples every sample was collected in polyethylene bottles preserved with hno 3 to maintain ph below 2 and stored in coolers with ice packs to keep the temperature close to 4 c until arrival at the laboratory in situ parameters electrical conductivity ph oxide reduction potential and temperature were measured with a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter calibrated before each field campaign the analyses were conducted at the als laboratory in chile and acmelab in canada additional information about the field and analytical methods can be found at valenzuela diaz et al 2020 we used the calculation of the charge balance error method cbe nordstrom et al 2009 to control the quality of the analytical data we obtained a cbe 10 for all water samples which is considered reliable for further interpretations fig 3 shows the representative water quality data for the yl creek and its main tributaries valenzuela diaz et al 2020 2 1 1 hydrological characterization precipitation at the yl basin mainly occurs during the fall winter period almost 91 of the annual precipitation is concentrated between april and august mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm year with a strong annual variability 46 of the mean annual precipitation the mean annual temperature is 7 6 0 38 c with the highest mean monthly temperature occurring in january 15 1 c and the lowest in july 0 3 c air relative humidity fluctuates between 5 and 100 and averages 30 whereas the mean cloud fraction is 0 52 and reaches its maximum in winter and minimum in summer the maximum daily mean streamflow occurs in december january reaching about 3 m 3 s during the snow glacier melting season in contrast the daily mean streamflow drops to less than 0 5 m 3 s during the snow accumulation season in winter due to its high altitude between 1600 to 4900 m a s l precipitation mainly occurs as snow in the yl basin consequently hydrology is dominated by snow and glacier processes snowmelt starts in september reaching its maximum contribution between december to january whereas glacial melt becomes a significant component of the total flow discharge at the end of the summer fig 2 2 1 2 hydrogeochemical characterization the upper yl creek is characterized by natural ard i e low ph and high sulfate and metals concentrations at the outlet yl creek shows a high ph seasonal variability valenzuela diaz et al 2020 dominated by the mixing between the upper ard and neutral water tributaries at the middle low yl basin fig 1 and fig 3 the high acidity at the upper yl basin has been reported by several authors barceló 1984 ginocchio et al 2008 gutiérrez et al 2015 valenzuela diaz et al 2020 its origin has been attributed to the oxidation of sulfides at hydrothermal alteration zones associated with the río blanco los bronces porphyry copper molybdenum deposit and the consequent dissolution of these minerals when interacting with snow and glacial meltwaters previous experiments show that when mixing distilled water with soil rock samples from the upper yl creek containing sulfides such as pyrite and chalcopyrite ph values decrease to 1 8 gutiérrez et al 2015 in this research minimum ph values 2 8 were measured at yl 0 upper yl creek and yl 3 chorrillos del plomo during the summer season the chemical composition of water entering the yl creek can be attributed to three main zones in the catchment labeled a b c in fig 1 two at the upper basin a b and one covering the middle and lower basin c zone a uppermost eastern sub basin fig 1 enclosing the hydrothermal alteration zone is characterized by waters with high acidity ph 3 and metal concentration water chemistry measured at yl 0 and yl 3 estero chorrillos del plomo represent tributaries entering the main creek at this zone zone b upper western sub basin is characterized by mild acid waters ph 5 with intermediate to low metal concentration hydrochemistry measured at yl 1 estero rincón represents waters entering the yl creek at this zone finally zone c middle and lower basin is characterized by tributaries with neutral to alkaline water low metal concentrations and relatively high alkalinity these tributaries can play a key role in the neutralization process of the acidic waters of the main creek in this zone the water chemistry of the tributaries is well represented by the hydrochemistry measured at yl 5 estero leonera in situ precipitation of minerals of different colors can be observed along the creek as the ph tends to increase downstream due to water neutralization sediments color changes from orange reddish in the upper or middle basin to white in the middle or lower part of the basin and a few times to greenish white in the lower basin correa burrows et al 2021 performed different chemical and mineralogical analyses on the river precipitates showing that all of them were comprised of very poorly crystalline minerals with iron fe sulfur s or aluminum al as its main constituents specifically the reddish orange precipitates are made of fe s the white precipitates of al s and the greenish white precipitates of cu al s correa burrows et al 2021 characterized the bulk chemistry by mineral acid digestion followed by wet chemical analysis using icp ms and the mineralogy of the precipitates using x ray diffraction they proposed schwertmannite and hydrobasaluminite as the most plausible mineral phases responsible for fe and al precipitation in yl respectively reported precipitation values for schwertmannite range from ph 1 93 to ph 4 71 caraballo et al 2013 whereas the reported precipitation values for hydrobasaluminite range from ph 4 0 to ph 5 5 caraballo et al 2013 españa 2007 sánchez españa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018 in yl fe precipitation has been observed in a ph range greater than the reported for schwertmannite thus considering that ferrihydrite has been broadly observed in ard rivers in the ph range from 5 to 8 bigham and nordstrom 2000 kimball et al 2010 nordstrom and alpers 1999 sánchez españa et al 2011 we included ferrihydrite as a plausible fe bearing mineral phase on the other hand cu behavior can be different from al and fe cu is very commonly associated with sorption processes into precipitated hydrous ferric oxides hfo runkel et al 1999 and hydrobasaluminite carrero et al 2015 recent evidence supports the sorption of cu into hydrobasaluminite at yl creek s outlet navarrete calvo et al 2018 and downstream after its confluence with a neutral alkaline river call san francisco montecinos et al 2020 as far as we know there are no cu sorption numerical models available for hydrobasaluminite hence we evaluate considering cu sorption only into hydrous ferric oxide precipitates hfo runkel et al 1999 therefore for cu we considered sorption into ferrihydrite using the diffuse double layer model dzombak and morel 1990 and precipitation into a cu mineral cu hydroxysulfate was selected as the most plausible cu mineral in yl creek the selection for this latter mineral took into account the high dissolved sulfate concentration on yl creek and thermodynamics calculations saturation index 0 runkel et al 1999 reaction equations for these minerals are shown in table 1 water samples in the yl creek and its tributaries show particulate al at ph 3 3 5 however hydrobasaluminite is normally undersaturated at ph 4 sánchez españa et al 2011 thus particulate al in these acid conditions is probably not related to hydrobasaluminite and could be due to other al sulfates like alunite or rostite caraballo et al 2011 besides those al sulfates are typically quite soluble at higher ph therefore the observed particulate al in acid waters is most likely to be hosted in al bearing minerals with low dissolving rates thus we assumed that all the particulate al entering the yl creek from tributaries with water ph 4 is attributed to a mineral phase of al unable to chemically react along the yl creek 3 model similar to garneau et al 2015 and runkel et al 1996 we used a sub models approach to solve the mineral and metal transport the model is composed of five sub models i hydrological ii hydrodynamic iii solute transport iv sediment transport and v hydrogeochemical sub models are solved in the order listed above assuming that each sub model depends on the previous one but is independent of the next fig 4 first i is solved to obtain streamflows distribution along the creek q l secondly ii is solved to obtain the river hydrodynamics flow height area and velocity along the creek we assume that the results from these two initial submodels are independent of subsequent ones i e solute transport sediment transport and hydrogeochemical processes do not produce changes in hydrology either hydrodynamics lastly having the streamflow and hydrodynamics along the creek the rest of the sub models are solved with an iterative method at a small time step 1 5 min details are shown in section 3 6 sub models iii and iv are solved to determine the transport and mixing of both dissolved and particulate phases and finally v determines whether a phase change occurs precipitation dissolution sorption due to water chemistry conditions 3 1 hydrological sub model streamflows along yl creek were obtained from a semi distributed hydrological model weap water evaluation and planning yates et al 2005 this model was configured for the whole yerba loca basin and was discretized in 17 sub catchments to represent several inflows along the river weap allow representing snow and glacial process using a simple approach and with minimum data requirements each sub catchment represents a hydrological response unit hru with homogeneous properties and parameters in each hru the water balance is solved through the soil moisture method hansen 1994 using two vertically stratified buckets the top bucket represents the topsoil it includes the surface water balance evapotranspiration precipitation snowmelt and runoff whereas the bottom bucket represents a deep layer that regulates the base flow generation yates 1996 yates et al 2005 snowmelt is modeled through a degree day approach hock 2003 while glaciers mass balance is modeled with a simplified radiative approach condom et al 2012 meteorological forcings were distributed throughout the sub catchment units spatially distributed daily precipitation and temperature data were obtained from cr2met a gridded meteorological product with a spatial resolution of 0 05 alvarez garreton et al 2018 this deterministic dataset was developed considering several meteorological stations morphological characteristics and era interim reanalysis for continental chile dee et al 2011 wind velocity and relative humidity at 2 meter height were obtained at a daily time step from era interim fractional snow covered area fsca series were obtained as an average between the aqua terra myd10a and mod10a products hall et al 2006 using a cloud removal algorithm based on gafurov and bardoyy 2009 a multi objective calibration was implemented at a daily time step to represent both snow accumulation and streamflow maximizing the determination coefficient r 2 of the simulated fsca and the kling gupta efficiency criteria kge gupta et al 2009 for mean daily streamflow at the outlet kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 combines metrics for r the linear correlation between observations and simulations α a measure of the standard deviation between observed and simulated values and β the ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed flows since 2010 central chile has experienced a megadrought boisier 2015 leading to a lower equivalent accumulation of snow water in the andes cornwell et al 2016 garreaud et al 2017 to better represent the low snow accumulation and streamflows observed during this period part of it was considered for the model calibration therefore the warm up calibration and validation periods were respectively 1998 1999 2006 2015 and 2000 2005 3 2 hydrodynamic sub model the yl creek is a long narrow and shallow river system where the main momentum changes occur in the longitudinal direction therefore the hydrodynamics along the river were obtained from the 1 d model hec ras version 5 03 brunner 2010 the river cross sections were obtained every 30 m from the lidar survey data providing a good representation of the river geometry along the creek hec ras solves the energy balance between consecutive cross sections estimating frictional losses using the manning equation eq 1 1 qn s f ar h 2 3 where q is the flow rate m 3 s 1 s f is the friction slope a is the flow cross section area m 2 r h is the hydraulics radius m and n is the manning friction coefficient s m 1 3 n can be estimated as a function of the surface roughness represented in armor mountain rivers by the sediment diameter d 90 90 of the particles in the sediment sample are finer than the d 90 grain size using the strickler eq 2 chow 1959 2 s t 0 12 g n d 90 1 6 where g ms 2 is the gravitational acceleration this relation eq 2 is not valid when flow depths are not much higher than the bottom roughness d 90 niño et al 2018 this condition known as macro roughness is typically found in mountain rivers resulting in higher values of s t thus for r h d 90 10 s t values can be estimated as eq 3 limerinos 1970 3 s t r h d 90 1 6 k 1 r h d 90 k 2 where k 1 and k 2 are empirical coefficients we use k 1 3 3 and k 2 0 57 these values were reported by niño 2002 for the mapocho basin according to eq 3 s t increase asymptotically when r h d 90 0 resulting in extremely high and not physically possible n values eq 3 thus we impose r h d 90 1 to constrain n values an iterative methodology was implemented in hec ras to estimate manning coefficients at each cross section for a given flow rate 3 3 solute transport sub model solute transport is conceptually based on runkel 1998 the model defines two zones for the river i the water column wc where advection dispersion are the dominant transport mechanisms and ii the storage zone sz hyporheic or stagnant zones where the main transport mechanism is diffusion while advection dispersion processes are negligible fig 4 due to the yl creek morphology narrow and shallow river solutes are expected to be well mixed in the transverse and vertical directions thus solute transport is solved in the longitudinal direction 1d in the same 1d grid used for modeling the system hydrodynamics transport is solved for each dissolved species and river zone using eqs 4 and 5 for wc and sz respectively 4 c

cross section of the sz m 2 and r s is the precipitation and dissolution rate in the sz kg m 3 s 1 parameters a s α and d l are estimated using chloride tracer data bencala and walters 1983 3 4 sediment transport sub model sediment transport sub model is similar to the 1d solute transport sub model but the exchange mass process between wc and sz is different we assume that the exchange of sediments between wc and sz are dominated by erosion and sedimentation garneau et al 2015 for each particulate species we solve eqs 6 and 7 for wc and sz respectively 6 c p t uc p x a x ad l c p x w r

viscosity m 2 s 1 garcia and parker 1991 3 5 hydrogeochemical sub model a typical approach for solving metal transfer in river environments is based on partition coefficients k d allison et al 2005 garneau et al 2015 however this approach does not consider the effects of ph and ionic strength both important to properly model the precipitation of fe and al mineral phases in the water bethke and brady 2000 runkel et al 1999 consequently we relax the constant k d assumption in our model and use phreeqc to simulate the main hydrogeochemical processes these processes respond to mixing waters with different compositions between the main creek and tributaries including dilution and neutralization effects mineral precipitation dissolution and sorption of cu on hfo furthermore based on calculating chemical speciation this methodology allows estimating the evolution of ph metal and other chemical compounds concentrations along the main creek mineral precipitation or dissolution is focused on previously selected minerals section 2 1 2 schwertmannite ferryhidrite hydrobasaluminite and cu hydroxysulfate mineral precipitation occurs almost instantaneously in places where neutralization happens via alkaline tributary inflows diz et al 1999 wanner et al 2018 for example using the expression proposed by diz et al 1999 eq 11 we estimate that schwertmannite precipitation occurs in nearly 0 5 min in the yerba loca creek 11 log t ind 6 7 1 29 ph 0 94 log so 4 2 0 36 log fe where t ind is the induction time in seconds refer to the time of appearance of the first schwertmannite precipitates diz et al 1999 and so 4 2 and fe are sulfate and iron molar concentrations on the other hand wanner et al 2018 and caraballo et al 2019 showed that hydrobasaluminite precipitation occurs instantaneously also our field observations showed that the neoformed precipitates appear immediately after the confluence of the main river with alkaline tributaries thus we assumed that mineral precipitation occurs fast enough to be modeled as instantaneous to evaluate the potential dissolution of the selected minerals we performed simulations on phreeqc we simulate the water s chemical compositions obtained from samples along the yl creek assuming chemical equilibrium we found that hydrobasaluminite begins to redissolve for ph values above 6 5 while schwertmannite for ph values above 4 usually mineral dissolution at these ph values is very slow for example sánchez españa et al 2011 studied hydrobasaluminite and schwertmannite precipitation and for ph 4 they did not observe mineral dissolution in the time scale of hours acero and hudson edwards 2018 proposed the following expression to obtain basaluminite which is formed due to the spontaneous dehydration under atmospheric conditions of hydrobasaluminite brydon and singh 1969 dissolution rates 12 rate al 10 7 3 a h 0 64 e 78 rt where rate al is al release from dissolving basaluminite mol m 2 s 1 a h is the activity of hydrogen ion r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature k using eq 12 we obtained that dissolving 1 mg of hydrobasaluminite at ph 6 takes more than 52 h thus considering that the water transit time in the main yl creek is around 5 h mineral dissolution at relatively high ph would be negligible therefore we neglect mineral dissolution for ph 6 5 in the case of hydrobasaluminite and ph 4 in the case of schwertmannite chemical reactions in water are faster than advection dispersion processes rubin 1983 toro 1976 thus and considering that mineral precipitation and dissolution are almost instantaneous we assume chemical equilibrium with mineral phases at each time step of the numerical model and along the creek except for the dissolution of hydrobasaluminite and schwertmannite for ph 6 5 and ph 4 respectively which are neglected as the ph cannot be transported explicitly h hydrogen ion molar concentration is estimated and transported using the solute transport model eqs 4 and 5 then ph is calculated from eq 13 13 ph t log 10 h t γ t 1 where γ t 1 is the hydrogen ion activity coefficient calculated from phreeqc in the previous model time step 3 6 sub models coupling methodology first we use the daily simulated streamflows from the hydrological sub model to solve the hydrodynamics sub model on the same daily scale assuming a steady flow for each day secondly hydrogeochemistry solute transport and sediment transport sub models are coupled using a two step methodology i particulate and dissolved reference concentrations are obtained by solving transport equations eqs 4 5 6 and 7 assuming r 0 and r s 0 then ii chemistry speciation and dissolution precipitation sorption for particulate and dissolved concentrations and ph values is solved using the hydrogeochemical sub model and reference concentrations obtained in i this allows to estimate r and r s and to calculate particulate and dissolved concentrations an implicit finite volume method is implemented with the leonard quick high order numerical scheme leonard 1979 to solve the solutes and sediment transport equations leonard s quick scheme uses a three point upstream weighted quadratic interpolation for cell face values a dirichlet boundary condition is used upstream considering a fixed concentration value c x 0 c 0 while a neumann boundary condition is considered downstream i e dc dx 0 the hydrochemistry and flow rates of lateral creeks draining to yl creek were considered as boundary conditions in the model the hydrochemistry of the tributaries was considered according to the zone to which they belong figs 1 and 3 since we are interested in acid water conditions we analyzed summer periods where acidity increases due to water rock interactions in the upper basin in the hydrothermal alteration zone during snow and glacier melting fig 2 we simulated three different days during the summer of 2013 2014 and 2015 where we have coincident field measurements during the day in all the sampling points along the yerba loca catchment to study the expected hydrochemical variability we additionally modeled 15 days before and 15 days after the selected days 31 days in total the hydrological and hydrodynamics sub models were simulated on a daily scale within each period the other modules hydrogeochemistry solutes transport and sediment transport were solved using a time step equals to 100 s 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrology the comparison between simulated and observed mean daily streamflows at the yl outlet is shown in fig 2 b simulated daily streamflows show a good correlation with observed data along the year representing snow accumulation and snow glacial melting high kge values for both the calibration 2006 2015 and validation 2000 2005 periods were obtained kge cal 0 767 and kge val 0 698 weap simulated streamflows well represent the flow variability α cal 1 025 and α val 1 036 and mean flow β cal 1 01 and β val 1 25 however a small mean flow overestimation β 1 is observed for the validation period also the relatively low streamflow linear correlation r cal 0 76 and r val 0 835 indicates problems representing the timing of daily streamflows during the melting season this is reflected in the moderately low r values obtained for fsca r fsca 0 839 and r fsca 0 839 for calibration and validation periods respectively model calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 streamflows along the yl creek have a marked variability throughout the year fig 5 a shows mean seasonal streamflows along the yl main channel defined as fall march april may mam winter june july august jja spring september october november son and summer december january february djf throughout fall mam and winter jja periods the simulated streamflows are low and stable suggesting that baseflow is the main component of the hydrograph on the other hand higher and more time variable streamflows are observed during spring son and summer djf where snow and glacier melting from the upper basin mainly contribute to the total runoff fig 2 snowmelt begins at low medium altitudes in september while at the upper catchments start in november fig 5 b following the snowmelt seasonality and the start of the glacial melting yl streamflow reaches its maximum in december fig 2 as shown in fig 2 increasing streamflow is correlated with a decreasing ph the minimum ph values is reached in december showing that ph values mainly respond to waters from the upper catchment particularly from the hydrothermal alteration zones fig 1 at low altitude sub basins the center time runoff of main daily streamflows occurs between august and september due to rain and early snowmelt however despite low altitude sub basins cover near 26 of the total basin area their flow discharge only represents 15 of the total annual streamflow on the other hand at high altitude sub basins the center time runoff of mean daily streamflow occurs between december and january showing the contribution of high altitude snow and glacial melting to the total runoff despite only covering near 28 of the basin area this zone contributes to near 37 of the total annual streamflow particularly during djf high altitude sub basins contribute to near 50 of the total runoff a transition is observed for medium altitude sub basins as the center time runoff of mean daily streamflows moves between november and december medium altitude sub basins contribute 48 of the total annual streamflow and cover 46 of the basin area 4 2 hydrodynamics fig 6 shows the model results of the main hydraulic variables for simulated days during december 2013 this figure shows that macro roughness r h d 90 10 persists along the whole creek resulting in high n values mean flow velocity and flow depth are around 2 m s and 0 3 m respectively these results match with observed flow velocities and flow depths in the same period field measured flow depths ranges between 0 15 0 40 m while flow velocities between 1 0 2 5 m s high flow velocities v 10 m s are particularly observed along the steepest sections of the creek these results are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty as hec ras is recommended for river slopes lower than 0 18 m m however these results are restricted to short sections so they do not significantly impact the transport model results characteristic parameters needed for the solute and sediment transport model a s α and d l were calibrated through chloride tracer experiments bencala and walters 1983 obtained values are in the range of α 0 0001 0 0007 s 1 a s a 0 2 1 and d l 0 5 2 m 2 s 1 high values of a s a are related to high friction coefficients bencala and walters 1983 which in the case of the yl creek are explained by the presence of macro roughness for the model we used α 0 0005 s 1 a s a 0 5 and d l 1 m 2 s 1 which provided good results along the creek at the daily scales 4 3 hydrogeochemistry we evaluated the performance of our phreeqc hydrogeochemical model by comparing the model results with chemical data obtained from water samples at the yl creek during 2013 2015 we analyzed if the model represents the neutralization and partition processes observed in yl water samples to this end chemical equilibrium and mineral dissolution precipitation were calculated using phreeqc and assuming an initial ph of 2 5 regardless of the field measured ph this calculation was repeated for small ph increments until ph 8 was reached thus we obtained dissolved concentration curves for each sample as a function of ph lines in fig 7 at low ph values these curves remain horizontal as the metals stay dissolved however when ph increases and precipitation occurs the dissolved concentrations decrease the model shows that hydrobasaluminite precipitation occurs on a ph range of 4 6 5 3 fig 7 this ph range acts as a barrier for the presence of dissolved al in water and most field samples show none or almost none al dissolved concentrations at greater ph values this modeled ph range induced by hydrobasaluminite precipitation has also been reported on other mountainous areas like the swiss alps and rocky mountains caraballo et al 2019 wanner et al 2018 regarding dissolved fe concentrations this element almost disappears after the precipitation barrier generated by schwertmannite at a ph range of 3 0 4 5 the remaining dissolved iron tends to completely disappear in the region of the ferrihydrite precipitation barrier ph 4 5 5 0 these observations agree with previous studies for example sánchez españa et al 2011 reported schwertmannite precipitation starting around ph 3 0 and finishing at around ph 3 5 cu sorption into ferrihydrite accounts only for 0 1 2 0 of the total cu partition this is explained as most of the dissolved fe precipitates at low ph values generating schwertmannite while small amounts of fe precipitation occurs in the range of ph values necessary to generate ferrihydrite this generates a low amount of ferrihydrite available for cu sorption thus we neglect cu sorpotion into ferrihydrite for our analysis the overlap in ph ranges for hydrobasaluminite precipitation and cu partitioning shaded areas in fig 7 indicate a possible relation between hydrobasaluminite precipitation and cu partition fig 7 carrero et al 2015 proposed hydrobasaluminite as a cu sink while montecinos et al 2020 discuss the possibility of cu sorption in hydrobasaluminite at the mapocho basin cu sorption into hydrobasaluminite is not well established and thus further research is necessary to incorporate this process in our model 4 4 mineral and metal transport results for december 2013 are shown in fig 8 see graphical results for december 2014 and december 2015 in appendix modeled flow discharge in december 2013 varies between 15 450 l s at the upper section of the model and between 700 and 1250 l s at the catchment outlet on december 11 2013 simulated flow rates are near the minimum values obtained for the month period and underestimate instantaneous field measurements the streamflow underestimation can partially be explained due to significant intraday flow variations observed during the melting season with maximum values occurring afternoon however flow underestimation is also observed in results associated with dissolved sulfates s 0 4 2 since it can be considered as a conservative tracer in the system bigham and nordstrom 2000 nordstrom 2011 thus underestimating s 0 4 2 along the creek reveals the underestimation of flow rates from tributaries particularly from the upper catchment where s 0 4 2 concentrations are higher fig 3 also for 2014 and 2015 the simulated streamflows are underestimated in the upper catchment fig a 1 and fig a 2 in appendix a at the upper basin s hydrology which is dominated by snow and glacial melting intraday variations of meteorological forcing temperature and solar radiation among others significantly affect the discharges thus the simple degree day and radiative approach used to simulate snow and glacial melting are insufficient to represent streamflows in the upper yl catchment accurately however at the scale of the entire catchment the hydrological model is suitable to represent the mean deviation and temporal variability of the observed flows the implementation of a more complex hydrological model is beyond the scope of this work despite the observed differences between simulated and measured flow rates modeled ph and metals mineral concentrations show good agreement with measured values also model results show significant variation in water quality through the month period shaded areas these variations are mainly due to the ph control on mineral precipitation for example in days where low ph values were simulated ph 4 5 the al remains dissolved along the entire yl creek as hydrobasaluminite precipitation is not likely at those ph values contrary in days where higher ph values were simulated metals partition change along the yl creek thus dissolved concentration decreases or even disappears at the yl outlet simulated metals and minerals variability directly respond to the simulated stream variability significantly lower metals and mineral variability are reported in fig a 1 november december 2015 which is consistent with the simulated low flows variability for that period our results suggest significant amounts of particulate al and fe concentrations in the riverbed sediments these results are not validated against field measurements but they are consistent with the observed distribution of orange reddish fe and white al precipitates along the creek during the field campaigns particulate al and fe concentrations in the riverbed sediments are greatly controlled by the ph neutralization along the yerba loca creek and follow the same tendency observed in the water column with higher values of fe concentrations after the confluence with chorrillos yl 3 and higher values of al concentrations after the confluence with leonera yl 5 however both particulate fe and al show significantly higher concentration in the bottom sediments than in the water column suggesting bottom sediments as a sink of fe and al in the system table 3 shows three criteria for evaluating the model performance when daily field data is available the used criteria are the normalized root mean square error nrmse normalized with mean observation values the coefficient of determination r 2 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 in terms of r 2 all parameters show a good correlation with observations evidencing that the model represents the increase or decrease in element metal concentrations mainly ph r 2 values are high which shows that the model represents the ph changes when the river is neutralized or acidified moreover except for the kge value for ph in 2013 both nrmse and kge indicators are good for ph showing that the model can represent the ph along the stream in general all the other variables show good kge and nrmse values with some exceptions mainly in 2014 where negative values of kge are obtained for some variables to test the relative importance of the different sub models we performed simulations for a specific period while neglecting one sub model fig 9 shows three comparative cases regarding fe during december 2013 along the creek cm refers to the entire model showed in fig 8 wh indicates the simulation without considering the hydrogeochemical sub model while wes the simulations without considering the erosion sedimentation sub model for dissolved fe there are no considerable differences between cases cm and wes as the erosion sedimentation process mainly affects the particulate phase however the wh case overestimates dissolved fe concentrations in near 500 as mineral precipitation transfers mass from the dissolved to the particulate phase this explains the underestimation of particulate fe for the wh case the erosion sedimentation sub model wes effect is evident in particulate fe concentrations showing a decrease in near 25 70 respect to the complete model cm these results suggest a dominant mass transfer from the storage zone sz to the water column wc generated by erosion 4 5 environmental implications understanding and predicting water quality in amd and ard environments is fundamental for characterizing river systems and developing practical pollution management strategies our model approach shows to be a valuable tool for these objectives in the short term our model can help develop emergency plans in case of accidents i e spills tailing dam breach etc or in predicting when contaminants will reach a certain point in the river for example a drinking or irrigation water intake in the long term the strong linkage with the catchment hydrology will help projecting water quality under future climate scenarios also this modeling approach can assist the management of river systems by analyzing the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities in the medium and long term for example under ard and amd environments high metal concentrations are stored in the sediments these sediments can remain a source of metals for an extended period so it is important to analyze and consider this effect when implementing decontamination strategies the explicit link between hydrology or anthropogenic water discharges with transport processes results in a valuable approach to assessing the relative impact of each water source on water quality throughout the river system thus the proposed model could be used to develop water quality baselines or pre mining conditions for example to determine water quality baselines in ard systems valenzuela diaz et al 2020 finally and with a back analysis approach the model could be helpful to identify unknown contaminant sources 5 conclusions we developed an integrated model composed of five different sub models combining hydrology hydrodynamic hydrogeochemical and sediment transport to study and predict the transport and fate of metals and minerals along a mountainous river system our proposed integrated model can generate realistic representations of main variables controlling ard and amd i e ph metal and mineral concentrations along the ard yerba loca creek in central chile fig 8 the water hydrochemistry in particular ph values varies significantly along the channel and in time showing a strong correlation with the catchment hydrology mineral precipitation controlling ph values appears as a critical process for correctly representing the system hydrochemistry a significant amount of fe and al precipitation occurs for specific ph values our results suggest that an essential portion of these metals sink into the bottom sediments the contribution of both hydrogeochemical and erosion sedimentation sub models to the integrated model is significant fig 9 for acidic mountainous rivers like yl creek the hydrogeochemical sub model is essential to estimate metal and mineral concentrations for example if the hydrochemical sub model is not considered fe dissolved metal concentrations could be overestimated in near 500 in the yl creek to a lower extent a similar effect was observed for al and cu as higher ph values are needed for the precipitation of al and cu minerals i e hydrobasaluminite and cu hydroxysulfate however for higher ph systems as is observed at the mapocho river downstream of the yl creek outlet al and cu precipitation would become more relevant regarding the erosion sedimentation submodel it has an essential contribution to the transfer of minerals from the riverbed to the water column for example resuspension of fe minerals accounts for near 25 70 of the particulate fe in the water column of yl in summary the integrated model presented in this article provides a valuable tool to understand an acid drainage system regarding its ph and metals concentrations also it allows estimating the spatial and temporal evolution of the river water chemistry resulting from complex interactions between the hydrology hydrodynamic hydrogeochemical and sediment transport future work will explore the effect of high flow events and water quality changes due to climate change for this purpose we need to improve the representation of physical processes relevant to snow dominated catchments representing simulations of distributed discharge in the yl creek on a sub daily scale can further enhance the system understanding furthermore proper characterization of water flow and hydrological connectivity can provide more reliable estimates of rock water interaction in space and time also further mineralogical studies are necessary to characterize the partition of cu on the system data availability gis information and simulated streamflow series and water samples used in our simulations are available at https doi org 10 6084 m9

4228,water diplomacy is gaining increasing attention among both researchers and policy makers the interest is understandable given that the concept brings together themes such as shifting geopolitics new types of diplomacy and increasing water scarcity yet there is no common definition for water diplomacy and actual water diplomacy actions typically vary across multiple tracks and scales in this article we seek to contribute to the practice of water diplomacy by introducing a step wise water diplomacy paths approach for analysing different water diplomacy contexts and related water diplomacy actions to facilitate this we recognise five key aspects for water diplomacy political preventive integrative cooperative technical and propose a general definition for water diplomacy we also discuss the possible distinctions between the related concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation the use of the water diplomacy paths approach is demonstrated with brief case studies focusing on central asia the mekong region and the finnish russian water cooperation the work builds on an extensive literature review and comparative analysis of water diplomacy approaches as well as on a series of workshops and interviews among selected water diplomacy actors including career diplomats the suggested water diplomacy paths approach envisions possible ways forward through four main steps 1 identification of key themes and related actors 2 analysis of the current state 3 recognition of undesired drivers and related scenarios and 4 identification of possible water diplomacy actions we see that the approach has potential to support water diplomacy processes with the help of the distinction it makes between water and diplomacy focused activities as well as its consideration of tensions and related actions such characteristics also emphasise the complementarity that water diplomacy actions have with more traditional transboundary water cooperation arrangements we argue that water diplomacy as a concept and as a practical approach provides an example of the future of foreign policy and diplomacy where the use of shared waters is likely to be of increasing importance keywords water diplomacy transboundary waters water security foreign policy regional cooperation diplomacy 1 introduction tackling climate change and increasing scarcity of natural resources is the sustainability challenge of our time e g conca and dabelko 2002 gleeson et al 2020 ipcc 2019 kummu et al 2016 raleigh and kniveton 2012 rockström et al 2009 while these global challenges amplify the need for international and regional collaboration we are also witnessing an increasing disregard of international agreements as well as an enhanced role of geopolitics eilstrup

2020 water is arguably the most crucial natural resource for society and also a resource that crosses country borders in a manner that is relatively easy to measure this makes its use and allocation often political and has led to the establishment of various transboundary water cooperation arrangements particularly in the river basins shared by several countries e g altingoz et al 2018 mccracken

emphasise the importance of transboundary cooperation united nations 2015 and there is a strong body of literature on the functioning of joint bodies such as river basin organisations kittikhoun and staubli 2018 schmeier et al 2016 yet despite all positive implications of transboundary cooperation it is not always able to prevent tensions between riparian countries and may even sustain them allouche 2020 cascão and zeitoun 2010 molle et al 2009 vij et al 2020a 2020b warner 2006 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 water diplomacy is an emerging concept to address the political nature of transboundary cooperation and to link water with broader regional cooperation geopolitics and foreign policy 1 1 the increasing interest towards water diplomacy is visible through a simple google scholar search for term water diplomacy which provided 99 results for 2005 09 344 results for 2010 14 and 882 results for 2015 19 there are also at least three recent special issues on the concept with the first one published in journal of hydrology klimes et al 2019 the argument is that diplomacy as an established process for a country to communicate and collaborate with as well as influence foreign governments and peoples across multiple diplomacy tracks diamond and mcdonald 1996 marks and freeman 2019 can provide additional means to tackle water related tensions and facilitate collaboration between countries sharing joint water bodies water diplomacy is considered in both policy arenas e g council of the european union 2018 ggreta project 2016 molnar et al 2017 pangare 2014 pohl 2014 and by the academic community e g grech madin et al 2018 islam and susskind 2013 klimes et al 2019 molnar et al 2017 vij et al 2020b some important conceptual contributions include the multi track water diplomacy framework huntjens et al 2016 yasuda et al 2018 the water diplomacy framework islam and susskind 2013 as well as initiatives linking water and peace blue peace 2020 huntjens and de man 2017 siwi 2020 the main water diplomacy actors typically consist of riparian country governments and related intergovernmental organisations such as river basin commissions often coupled with other actors across multiple diplomacy tracks e g diamond and mcdonald 1996 huntjens et al 2016 pangare 2014 several documents also imply the engagement of so called third party actors such as external countries networks or organisations in the water diplomacy processes beardsley et al 2006 dixon 1996 van genderen and rood 2011 häkkinen 2020 leb et al 2018 lehti and lepomäki 2017 these actors can build trust and facilitate water diplomacy related processes through e g joint capacity and knowledge building network activities facilitation and mediation for example the european union and its different member states have plans towards such a role in varying diplomacy and peace mediation contexts karjalainen 2020 niemann et al 2018 despite the increasing interest water diplomacy still lacks a commonly agreed definition the concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation are at times even used interchangeably although water diplomacy studies typically focus more on conflict prevention and diplomatic engagement ggreta project 2016 grech madin et al 2018 huntjens et al 2016 islam and susskind 2013 molnar et al 2017 schmeier 2018 yildiz et al 2016 the literature remains sparse in regard to practical guidance on actual water diplomacy actions as well the existing guidance builds primarily on context specific examples e g al saidi and hefny 2018 barua 2018 kattelus et al 2015 koff et al 2020 or on the activities of transboundary water cooperation and management e g kittikhoun and staubli 2018 pohl 2014 salmoral et al 2019 which cover only partly the actual water diplomacy actions the literature also tends to focus on positive development that would stem from enhanced cooperation rather than the potential challenges but also new openings resulting from escalating tensions time wise the literature tends to focus on current activities and or relatively short term developments although the consideration of longer term aspects is also important given the implications that for example climate change and increasing resource scarcities is estimated to have in several shared basins considering these research and policy gaps this study seeks to contribute to the practice of water diplomacy through the following main research question what kind of approach can help to analyse differing water diplomacy contexts and to recognise potential water diplomacy actions that enhance collaboration and prevent future water related tensions related to this we also ask what are the key aspects of water diplomacy and how does the concept of water diplomacy help to complement the more thoroughly studied concept of transboundary water cooperation in order to answer these questions we first present the methodological basis of our study section 2 and review the existing literature to recognise key aspects of water diplomacy as well as to provide a general definition for water diplomacy section 3 we then introduce a water diplomacy paths approach section 4 and demonstrate its use with desk based case studies on central asian shared waters the mekong river basin and finnish russian water cooperation section 5 detailed central asian case in annex b finally we discuss the broader implications of our study section 6 and provide some concluding thoughts section 7 2 materials and methods this article applies a mixed methods approach that consists of the following main research methods i a structured literature review of relevant academic literature reports and policy documents ii a set of semi structured expert interviews in total 25 interviews with 21 interviewees from 10 different organisations in 2018 20 and iii a series of four group discussions and four workshops among finnish water diplomacy actors including experts from water sector peace mediation as well as foreign policy and diplomacy annex a additional research methods included participatory observation in selected water diplomacy processes and meetings see annex a as well as a benchmark study of existing major water diplomacy initiatives and actors from the netherlands sweden switzerland and germany salminen et al 2020 the key method for conceptual discussion on water diplomacy section 3 was the literature review complemented by the relevant findings from the interviews and workshops the literature was analytically reviewed to identify definitions and descriptions of water diplomacy and related concepts such as transboundary water cooperation or hydro diplomacy the identified descriptions were then compared and analysed to recognise the most common conceptual elucidations as well as their differences this led to the categorisation of five typical aspects for water diplomacy section 3 as well as comparison between the related concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation section 3 1 in addition to the literature the categorisation presented in section 3 benefited from the analytical framings related to adaptive governance peace research and multi track diplomacy e g cleaver and whaley 2018 diamond and mcdonald 1996 ide 2018 the development of the water diplomacy paths approach section 4 benefited particularly from the expert interviews and workshops annex a and utilised the findings from the benchmark study and the participatory observation the approach also made use of existing water diplomacy literature particularly those focusing on water related conflicts and possible ways forward for water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation e g farinosi et al 2018 huntjens et al 2016 islam and susskind 2013 mirumachi 2010 pohl 2014 zeitoun et al 2020b given the future orientation of the approach literature related to futures research and scenarios was important as well e g cairns et al 2016 mahmoud et al 2009 maier et al 2016 the earlier version of the approach was developed as a tool for an external third party facilitator in two reports done for the finnish ministry for foreign affairs salminen et al 2019a salminen et al 2020 the approach has therefore a linkage to finnish experience on transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy honkonen and lipponen 2018 kotkasaari 2008 ministry of agriculture and forestry 2018 finally the three descriptive case studies that demonstrate the use of the suggested approach build on the interviews and workshops as well as relevant literature on the study areas see section 5 the case studies also benefit from the authors prior experience on transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy in the three areas see references in section 5 3 context recognising key aspects of water diplomacy water diplomacy is a blurry affair the concept has no standard definition but it is defined in policy documents and scientific publications in several ways depending on the context as well as the authors perspective e g council of the european union 2018 honkonen and lipponen 2018 huntjens and de man 2017 islam and madani 2017 islam and susskind 2013 klimes et al 2019 milman and gerlak 2020 molnar et al 2017 mumme 2020 pangare 2014 pohl 2014 salminen et al 2019b vij et al 2020b water diplomacy consortium 2013 wilder et al 2020 xie et al 2018 zeitoun et al 2020a also the very term used varies with hydrodiplomacy and blue diplomacy also emerging from literature klimes et al 2019 pangare 2014 pohl 2014 salman 2015 vlachos 1996 we consider them here synonymous for water diplomacy the diversity of definitions is understandable given the variety of water diplomacy contexts and the number of theoretical frameworks related to shared waters and their governance yet noting the increasing calls to include water diplomacy as a part of foreign policy perhaps most prominently by the european union and its member states council of the european union 2018 such conceptual ambiguity may hinder both the recognition and implementation of water diplomacy actions the close connection and overlaps that water diplomacy has with transboundary water cooperation may create additional confusion particularly among actors coming outside water field we discuss next key aspects that we found to be most regularly highlighted separately or together in relation to water diplomacy there are altogether five such aspects that we refer to with following one word terms that seek to describe their main characteristics political preventive integrative cooperative and technical table 1 2 2 the five aspects bring together elements from several existing documents for example four purposes of water diplomacy suggested by molnar et al 2017 are largely similar with the first four of our water diplomacy aspects while the three characteristics recognised by grech madin et al 2018 can be linked to the first three aspects presented the two main aspects so called technical and political tracks recognised for water diplomacy e g klimes et al 2019 are directly included in the five aspects among more policy oriented documents the three general themes that council of the european union 2018 uses for water diplomacy outcomes are part of the suggested aspects as well more process oriented approaches e g huntjens et al 2016 islam and susskind 2013 recognise the actual diplomatic action situations and the connection to broader diplomatic settings emphasising political preventive and integrative aspects of the diplomacy the categorisation provides a simple but relatively comprehensive view on key aspects of water diplomacy and related approaches related to this we also discuss the differences that water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation have as two distinct but complementary concepts section 3 1 for we see that clarifying the differences between the two concepts can help to recognise water diplomacy actions that complement existing cooperative activities table 3 in section 3 1 therefore summarises suggested differences between transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy related to their physical basis key governance attributes legal basis actors structures processes as well as their main assumptions and aims all five aspects consider water diplomacy as a process that in comparison with other sub types of diplomacy sees shared waters as a subject of political consideration with the help of diplomatic methods this also lays the normative foundation for water diplomacy as the concept values the existence of diplomatic relations interaction and trust between parties while acknowledging their differing interests and positions and consistent with the key principles of transboundary water cooperation un 1997 unece 1992 sees reasonable and equitable use of shared waters as something to seek for the first one of the five aspects which we here refer to as political aspect sees water diplomacy as a process of inherently political interactions that occur among stakeholders with different often conflicting interests positions and agenda the aspect thus links closely to politics and power relations between and also within the riparian states this viewpoint seems so evident that it is often not explicitly mentioned in different definitions but rather seen as an overarching theme and indeed a reason for water diplomacy water diplomacy is here seen as a part of the broader political milieu considering political goals that extend beyond basin boundaries hocking et al 2012 islam and susskind 2018 molnar et al 2017 sadoff and grey 2002 varady et al 2014 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 while the broader political context therefore greatly influences water diplomacy the relation works also other way round with water diplomacy potentially facilitating regional interaction van genderen and rood 2011 keskinen et al 2014 this aspect links with processes typical for example for foreign policy regional cooperation and critical hydro politics table 1 see e g islam and susskind 2013 pohl 2014 schmeier and shubber 2018 unep 2016 varady et al 2014 vij et al 2020a 2020b zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 zeitoun and warner 2006 the second aspect preventive views water diplomacy as an approach for peace mediation as well as conflict prevention and mitigation in this way the aspect includes both preventive in terms of preventing future conflicts and restorative elements in terms of reconciliation and reduction of existing tensions a large number of research papers primarily consider water as a form of preventive diplomacy linking it to the promotion of regional stability and peace these two are together with reasonable and equitable water use typically considered as the normative foundation of water diplomacy e g blue peace 2020 carmi et al 2019 schmeier 2018 yildiz et al 2016 this also means that preventive aspect makes often use of relevant tools and mechanisms of peace mediation and conflict resolution abdi and mason 2019 e g carmi et al 2019 conca and dabelko 2002 de bruyne and fischhendler 2013 ggreta project 2016 mason and blank 2013 phillips et al 2006 yildiz et al 2016 zyck and muggah 2012 conflict prevention and peace mediation activities 3 3 conflict prevention typically includes preventive actions in forms of humanitarian development cooperation or operations to improve government administration zyck and muggah 2012 there is also a conceptual difference between peace mediation peace keeping and peace building with peace mediation the focus of this article emphasising the achievement of resolution to end the existing political disputes and related conflicts peace keeping aims to maintain the state of non violence while peace building is then about establishing the conditions for sustainable long term peace bercovitch and kadayifci 2002 boutros ghali 1992 papagianni 2010 can thus create enabling conditions for water diplomacy and other types of preventive diplomacy and vice versa water diplomacy may enhance conflict prevention and peace mediation pohl 2014 zyck and muggah 2012 the third aspect integrative builds on the notion that several publications describe contemporary water diplomacy as a process comprising of many stakeholders across multiple societal and thematic sectors in both formal and informal settings diamond and mcdonald 1996 huntjens et al 2016 yasuda et al 2018 water diplomacy goes therefore beyond the conventional regional treaties and transboundary cooperation mechanisms between riparian country governments involving also other actors and themes this aspect sees water diplomacy as a multi disciplinary concept that is located at the intersection of science policy and practice klimes et al 2019 assuming participation from all these domains the integrative aspect emphasises this crosscutting and connecting nature of water diplomacy and therefore links to integrated approaches related to both water and diplomacy including for example integrated water resources management iwrm water energy food security nexus multi track diplomacy integrative diplomacy and more generally knowledge co production grech madin et al 2018 hocking et al 2012 huntjens and de man 2017 islam and madani 2017 keskinen et al 2016 milman and gerlak 2020 norström et al 2020 stepanova et al 2020 the fourth aspect cooperative sees water diplomacy as a process that promotes and relies on mutual cooperation and the idea of shared benefits bringing it thus close to the common definitions for transboundary water cooperation water cooperation can be seen as an operative end product of the process of water diplomacy with the very aim of the cooperation defined by the diplomatic process this aspect makes use of concepts such as benefit sharing cooperation continuum and general water governance frameworks bréthaut and pflieger 2020 dore et al 2012 furlong 2006 ggreta project 2016 molnar et al 2017 oecd 2015 sadoff and grey 2002 sadoff and grey 2005 unece 2015a unece 2015b varady et al 2014 wolf 1998 the international agreements on transboundary waters un 1997 unece 1992 link closely to the cooperative aspect as well including their key principles related to the duty to cooperate the use of transboundary waters in reasonable and equitable manner and the principle of not causing significant harm ideally this aspect therefore recognises the value of cooperation willingness to cooperate and communication between key actors as a means to promote sustainable and socially just use of shared waters yet water cooperation may not result from mutual agreement but also from coercion this in turn indicates that cooperation is not always able to prevent tensions but can actually sustain them allouche 2020 cascão and zeitoun 2010 koff et al 2020 zeitoun et al 2020b exposing the fundamental linkage that cooperation has with the political setting the fifth aspect technical is based on the recognition of the so called technical track contrasting with the other so called political track of water diplomacy that focuses on water as a resource and as a physical substance that generates the hydrological cycle water availability allocation and use and the related monitoring management and knowledge production processes are therefore in the core of this aspect klimes and yaari 2019 klimes et al 2019 yasuda et al 2018 the aspect thus provides an information basis for shared waters and their role for national and regional development including both current and future developments as well as trends related particularly to water use and climate change huntjens et al 2016 klimes and yaari 2019 kummu et al 2016 yasuda et al 2018 this aspect has a particularly strong link to knowledge production as well as related knowledge products such as hydrological models and impact assessments hocking et al 2012 käkönen and hirsch 2009 kittikhoun and staubli 2018 klimes and yaari 2019 klimes et al 2019 the royal society 2010 despite its name the technical aspect is not unpolitical allouche et al 2015 ide and detges 2018 käkönen and hirsch 2009 keskinen et al 2014 klimes and yaari 2019 klimes et al 2019 knowledge can generally be considered as a political asset and thus control over knowledge and its production may be used as ideational tactics in hydro politics zeitoun and warner 2006 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 linking the technical and political aspects of water diplomacy elementary together we suggest that together these aspects can help to better understand the broad concept of water diplomacy as they bring together the key dimensions from the current water diplomacy literature out of the five aspects the political and technical aspects cross cut the entire concept while the technical aspect emphasises the role of water and related knowledge production processes as a subject of the diplomacy the political aspect emphasises the inherently political nature of the interaction between the water diplomacy actors the three other aspects integrative preventive and cooperative can then be seen as characterisations of the key motivations and mechanisms of water diplomacy fig 1 in practice the five aspects are typically all present in water diplomacy contexts but with different emphases that may also change over time similarly the different parties engaged in a water diplomacy process may have differing expectations and also expertise regarding the five aspects the five aspects help us also to suggest a general definition for water diplomacy building on earlier definitions water diplomacy is a dynamic process of inherently political interaction political aspect across multiple diplomacy tracks and sectors in both formal and informal settings integrative with an aim to prevent and resolve tensions and conflicts preventive through the use of diplomatic tools and cooperation mechanisms cooperative as well as knowledge on shared waters and related resources technical or more concisely water diplomacy is a dynamic politically oriented process that aims to prevent mitigate and resolve water related tensions in shared waters by making simultaneous use of diplomatic tools water related know how and cooperation mechanisms across multiple diplomacy tracks 3 1 transboundary water cooperation vs water diplomacy water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation are closely connected but separate concepts yet literature often considers the two concepts in an undefined manner and even interchangeably mainly because both concepts are used in multitude of ways and address largely similar settings related to the interactions in shared waters we argue that clarifying the key differences between transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy can help to advance both concepts and importantly to recognise practical water diplomacy actions that complement existing cooperative activities section 4 as a result table 3 presents our view on the key differences between transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy across categories related to their physical basis main governance attributes legal basis actors structures processes as well as main assumptions and aims while the different characteristics in the table are described to be clearly distinct they are naturally closely connected and typically also enable each other for example an intergovernmental river basin commission is typically established through a broader diplomacy process while negotiations on e g regional energy or food security issues build also on water related information it is also important to note that both concepts link to the so called technical and political tracks related to shared waters klimes et al 2019 with cooperation typically focusing mainly on the technical track and diplomacy more on the political track this means that transboundary water cooperation while often technically oriented and building on established institutions works under a politically defined mandate and its processes take place in both formal and informal settings that also involve a varying degree of politically oriented decision making and vice versa while water diplomacy is often inherently political and takes place across multiple diplomacy tracks it is typically facilitated by technical track knowledge production processes as well as existing cooperative institutions as a result despite the differences between their characteristics we suggest that the main aim of water cooperation and water diplomacy is ultimately the same emphasising the complementarity of the two concepts 4 water diplomacy paths approach in this section we propose a four step approach called water diplomacy paths wdp for analysing a given water diplomacy context and recognising potential water diplomacy actions to provoke thinking and to complement existing transboundary water cooperation activities the approach has an emphasis on both water related and political tensions as well as related preventive and mitigative actions this way the approach has a particularly close connection with political and preventive aspects of water diplomacy section 3 given that the approach aims to provide a general analytical framework it can be a useful analysis tool for an external actor e g a third party facilitator that seeks to understand better a certain water diplomacy context yet we see that the approach could also be suitable for the actual water diplomacy actors e g an intergovernmental organisation as an additional fresh way to view the potential tensions and related actions in a given water diplomacy context in such situations the joint application of the approach itself may even be seen as a water diplomacy action and the way the approach is used can guide also the actors engaged in its implementation the four linear steps described in fig 2 as well as in the following sections aim to provide a clear structure for the analysis with first two steps focusing on the analysis of the context and two latter steps helping to recognise possible tensions and related water diplomacy actions yet the steps are indicative only as in reality any process related to water diplomacy is likely to develop in an iterative cyclical manner the approach has a strong temporal dimension and it seeks to consider both the historical trajectory and possible future paths forward such an emphasis seeks to help envision alternative future scenarios moving beyond the potential present day challenges the long term view is important also to remind the actors about the dynamic evolving nature of the shared waterbody while water allocation and management decisions are often based on current or even past flow regimes changing climate is likely to alter both the quantity and timing of the flows 4 1 step 1 identifying key water diplomacy themes and actors the first step in the proposed approach is to identify the most relevant themes and related actors for the specific water diplomacy context in addition to the use and development of shared water resource typical themes to be considered include water related sectors e g agriculture and energy as well as broader themes related to regional cooperation e g trade the environment political relations to ensure sufficient consideration of all relevant themes the identification may be initiated by recognising first broad regional settings such as biophysical societal and institutional and then identifying the key themes and actors for such settings see example in annex b to ensure a comprehensive deliberation of the key themes and actors this step would ideally build on a facilitated stakeholder process that utilises established stakeholder identification and engagement methods such as knowledge mapping and social network analysis reed et al 2009 to ensure a wide participation from different actors in some situations however the actual actors and themes to be included and excluded from a given water diplomacy process may be defined by a given actor such as a river basin organisation as an established facilitator of the process in such situations the key actors and themes may be based for example on the existing regional agreement related to shared waters 4 2 step 2 analysing the current state the second step aims to analyse the current state of the given water diplomacy context building on the themes and actors recognised in step 1 the analysis should preferably include also a consideration of the past trends including those related to water use infrastructure development and broader political relations between the riparian countries such historical trajectory deepens the understanding of the present situation and also helps to recognise alternative future paths in the following steps the suggested method for this step includes a comparative analysis and joint synthesis of existing studies in this specific context as it is likely that there already exists relevant but potentially conflicting information among the actors such comparative analysis could be carried out for example through a joint technical working group with experts from all countries and other relevant parties through an independent expert panel or through a combination e g keskinen et al 2012 the analysis can thus build on the process of joint fact finding islam and susskind 2018 mccreary et al 2007 bringing together existing data as well as carrying out new studies when needed the analysis should preferably be carried out in a facilitated process where the parties can discuss and agree on the current baseline situation in the given context this is important given that knowledge and different knowledge products such as models and impact assessment results can become highly contested in transboundary settings e g käkönen and hirsch 2009 klimes and yaari 2019 4 3 step 3 recognising key drivers and related future scenarios the third step seeks first to recognise key drivers e g biophysical social economic and or political that are likely to impact the current status within a given timeframe after the step envisions possible future scenarios on how water related interactions could unfold in a given context based on a set of assumptions on how current state may evolve due to key drivers and evolving relationships between the parties the key drivers and related scenarios defined in this step are therefore likely to include both positive desired and negative undesired views on future yet given that water diplomacy builds on the premise of differing national interests this step should include discussion on potential water related tensions as well even when such discussion is difficult and often avoided we therefore suggest that this step also includes intentional consideration of undesired negative drivers and related conflict scenarios step 3 followed by a set of actions that can be used to prevent and mitigate such tensions step 4 the suggested method for both third and fourth step is a participatory scenario process that creates alternative scenarios for the context there is a plethora of scenario approaches available including those already used in transboundary water contexts e g farinosi et al 2018 gorgoglione et al 2019 keskinen et al 2015 mrc 2011 phillips et al 2008 warner and van buuren 2016 scenario approaches can generally be divided into different categories such as exploratory and anticipatory mahmoud et al 2009 or predictive explorative and normative maier et al 2016 the suggested water diplomacy paths approach aims to make a simultaneous use of the key scenario types with step 3 focusing more on predictive and explorative scenarios what is likely to happen given the current state and future developments and drivers and step 4 on anticipatory and normative scenarios how can we achieve together a specific normative i e peaceful future and mitigate the tensions envisioned in step 3 4 4 step 4 identifying possible water diplomacy actions the fourth step focuses on the identification of possible water diplomacy actions that build on the key drivers and future scenarios recognised from step 3 the actions can thus strengthen the positive mutually beneficial activities envisioned as well as to ease the possible water related and or political tensions recognised in step 3 given the varying aspects related to water diplomacy fig 1 such actions should preferably cover both water related knowledge making processes and key diplomacy processes this will better ensure that the recognised water diplomacy actions consider so called technical and political tracks of water diplomacy klimes et al 2019 one way to consider both the technical and political tracks is to use a simple matrix to frame the discussion and link step 3 with step 4 fig 3 the matrix considers the water diplomacy process through two main aspects focusing on i water and related knowledge production mechanisms and ii politics differing national interests and related diplomacy processes while these two aspects are strongly connected we see that considering them also separately can help to recognise the full potential of different water diplomacy actions including those that do no stem directly from water field and or transboundary cooperation similarly to complement more traditional cooperative mechanisms and to strengthen the motivation for water diplomacy actions the matrix also considers undesired scenarios where water related and or political drivers may lead to increasing tensions and even conflict step 3 the matrix includes two such conflict paths with the grey path on left in fig 3 called politics to water indicating a scenario where increasing political tensions between the countries affect also the use of shared waters the grey conflict path on right is then called water to politics indicating an scenario where water related drivers and related tensions e g construction of an upstream dam and its impacts to downstream countries in a shared water body lead to broader political tensions fig 3 after establishing these undesired scenarios step 4 views the matrix other way focusing on water diplomacy actions that aim to prevent and mitigate the envisioned tensions building on both existing and novel activities fig 3 the focus is on two main sets of actions as well with the more technical set of water diplomacy actions related to water know how and cooperation mechanisms and institutions their aim is to reduce water related tensions and to ensure that political processes have understanding of key water related issues consistent particularly with technical cooperative and integrative aspects of water diplomacy section 3 if there is already existing transboundary water cooperation mechanism the recognised actions are likely to build on those activities the other more political set of water diplomacy actions in fig 3 consist then of broader diplomacy focused actions that aim to strengthen the political trust and interaction between the parties the actions can thus make use of both existing and new diplomacy processes as well as peace mediation and conflict resolution activities such actions aim to reduce political tensions and to bring a stronger political understanding to water focused processes corresponding to political integrative and preventive aspects of water diplomacy section 3 the end result is thus a set of water diplomacy actions that aim to turn the undesired conflict paths envisioned in step 3 into desired water diplomacy paths such paths seek simultaneously to strengthen the cooperation between the parties as well as to avoid and mitigate water related conflicts through a set of joint actions in this way the recognised actions are also likely to have a linkage to one or several water diplomacy aspects described in section 3 the actions recognised can then be compared with the existing activities in the studied water diplomacy context providing a view on those activities that are important to maintain as well as on novel actions that could be initiated either by external actors such as a third party facilitator or the water diplomacy parties themselves 5 water diplomacy paths approach three cases our aim is to provide a practical approach for analysing different water diplomacy contexts in a way that complements existing activities with its focus on water related tensions and related actions that can be used to reduce those tensions to demonstrate the potential use of the water diplomacy paths approach we next apply it briefly in three descriptive cases from transboundary settings related to central asia the mekong region in southeast asia and finnish russian water cooperation the three cases showcase the variety of possible water diplomacy contexts from bilateral setting with several transboundary rivers finnish russian to major transboundary river basin with several countries mekong and a region with several shared waters central asia the results from the three case studies are based on our own past research in those regions e g altingoz et al 2018 haapala 2013 jalilov et al 2016 kattelus et al 2015 keskinen 2008 keskinen et al 2014 salminen et al 2019b as well as relevant literature e g abbasova et al 2018 altingoz et al 2018 biba 2018 devlaeminck and huang 2020 dore et al 2012 gerlak and haefner 2017 honkonen and lipponen 2018 kittikhoun and staubli 2018 korjonen kuusipuro 2013 kotkasaari

annex b provides a general introduction for all three case study areas together with a detailed example from central asia with a focus on amu darya and syr darya rivers and related aral sea basin table 2 summarises the key results for the three case study areas following the four steps of water diplomacy paths approach presented in section 4 to enhance clarity only three most relevant themes and actors were recognised in step 1 while step 3 and step 4 are structured according to the water diplomacy matrix presented in fig 3 with a focus on undesired drivers and related scenarios for more detailed example on the use of the proposed approach see the central asian case in annex b the results presented in table 2 show both similarities and differences between the case study areas the analysis presented in steps 1 and 2 showcase the key dynamics of the current water diplomacy contexts in three cases despite their differing geographical contexts all cases have close link to the broader geopolitics in the region emphasising how water diplomacy context typically reaches beyond water per se steps 3 and 4 help then to understand how a set of undesired drivers related to water and politics may increase the tensions in the case study areas and what kind of water diplomacy actions both existing and novel and related to both water and diplomacy could help to ease them the potential tensions related to hydropower and climate change are present in all three cases step 3 underlining the role that energy sector and related actors typically have in transboundary settings yet their engagement in actual water cooperation processes remains often limited providing one potential way forward for complementary water diplomacy actions the possible diplomacy related tensions differ between the cases having links to the diversity of institutional settings in relation to both bilateral regional cooperation and transboundary waters it should be noted that the analysis of the three cases is very concise and simplified and annex b provides a more detailed example from central asia on the application of the water diplomacy paths approach 6 discussion 6 1 implications of the water diplomacy paths approach the water diplomacy paths approach aims to provide a way to analyse a given water diplomacy context and to both motivate and recognise possible water diplomacy actions we see that the strength of the approach is its step wise structure as well as simultaneous consideration of water related and political tensions and related preventive and mitigating water diplomacy actions the recognised actions also aim to have a link to both technical more water focused track and political more diplomacy focused track related to water diplomacy in this way the approach seeks to make visible the key role that general diplomatic actions and actors even when not directly water related may have in shared waters we also see the future orientation of the approach important as it emphasises the need to consider longer term developments and climate change implications these benefits were evident also in our discussion with different water diplomacy actors with career diplomats and other non water experts seeing the approach particularly useful in clarifying the distinct but related actions on water cooperation and diplomacy as well as enhancing their interest and motivation to engage in water diplomacy processes salminen et al 2019a salminen et al 2020 the recognised key drivers and scenarios step 3 as well as the related water diplomacy actions step 4 provide also a link to the five water diplomacy aspects defined in section 3 while the water diplomacy actions identified as part of the approach are likely to cover all five aspects we see that the approach is helpful to address particularly political and preventive aspects we see that this is important for three reasons first of all the other three aspects integrative cooperative technical are often well covered already by existing transboundary water cooperation activities that water diplomacy actions seek to complement secondly the discussion about the political track is often more difficult to initiate due to the parties differing interests and the issues with internal politics and sovereignty and actions related to this track may therefore be more difficult to initiate thirdly we suggest that the current water diplomacy activities could make better use of the experience that peace mediation and conflict resolution literature provides on preventive diplomacy actions the three demonstrative cases section 5 and annex b provide interesting points for consideration as well the case results emphases on e g energy security and regional trade indicate that the approach s focus on potential water related and political tensions step 3 and required actions step 4 can help to complement the more dominant and largely technical water cooperation activities with actions that consider also the broader aspects of regional cooperation and foreign policy this in turn can provide novel viewpoints for both the existing diplomatic relations and on going water cooperation activities the results also emphasise the importance of key water using sectors such as energy and food given the critical role of both sectors for national security and development the future orientation can also be seen to help to contemplate the long term developments in the areas putting present day tensions into a perspective and linking the actions to the future trajectories related to water scarcity and climate change at the same time the recognised actions do build largely on already existing cooperation activities emphasising the close connection that water diplomacy has with transboundary cooperation finally while we do see that the characteristics described above entail novelty for our suggested approach it does share also some similarities with other water diplomacy tools and approaches for example the water diplomacy framework by islam and susskind 2013 considers scenario planning and joint fact finding as important methods and views negotiation and mediation as a key for solving complex water conflicts the multi track water diplomacy framework by huntjens et al 2016 on the other hand emphasises the importance of multiple tracks and time scales when thinking of past current and future action situations related to water diplomacy finally the recent book by zeitoun et al 2020b provides an interesting critical view to water conflicts and discuss how transformative analysis may be used in situations with particularly significant power asymmetries such analysis may also include the mapping of alternative pathways which bit similarly to our suggested steps 3 and 4 can lead from status quo either to degradation through destructive conflict or destructive cooperation or to improvement with the help of reformist or transformative approaches and through constructive conflict or risk taking cooperation zeitoun et al 2020a 6 2 water diplomacy connecting sustainability and security ultimately the aim of water diplomacy is to prevent and mitigate water related tensions with the help of cooperative mechanisms and water and diplomacy related actions but do parties have genuine willingness for cooperation it is evident that the actors differing interests direct the ways of interaction in water diplomacy and cooperation can take place only as far as the actors allow this means that it is also important to consider what would be the motivation of say an upstream country and or a regional hegemon to participate in the entire process given it is likely to expose it to criticism towards its potentially contested actions or other way round why a less powerful riparian country would want to engage in such a process given it may just maintain the existing power imbalances both of these questions are valid and ultimately at the core of diplomatic engagement we see that the maintenance of diplomatic relations and the opportunities it brings to all parties should be considered valuable as such for water diplomacy and our suggested approach seeks to strengthen that view by envisioning undesired future paths that would result from the lack of such relations it also means that the benefits from cooperation are typically seen to be more significant than the benefits from water resources management alone extending from water use to broader issues of economic cooperation politics and security and facilitating trade offs beyond water sector at the same time the interaction can be considered as a means to build mutual understanding and trust between the parties both in relation to shared waters and more broadly this also indicates that water diplomacy both as a concept and as practical approach can facilitate the link between sustainability and security while the maintenance of internal and external security remains the ultimate justification for the present day states the planetary scale challenges such as climate change and water scarcity are connecting security increasingly to the global scale and to the use of natural resources keskinen et al 2019 ligtvoet et al 2017 schlag et al 2015 world economic forum 2017 within this emerging international security agenda water and related resources such as energy and food are gaining increasing attention the related resource flows and value chains cross national boundaries making their governance both intersectoral and transnational and linking sustainability and national security tightly together this in turn emphasises the importance of systemic and adaptive approaches to understand the complexities included in such connections and the related actor networks as well as the dynamic evolving nature of the resource flows and the actors relations this dynamism challenges the ways diplomacy is being practiced emphasising a more diverse and adaptive forms of diplomatic actions we therefore suggest that water diplomacy provides an example of the future of foreign policy where the use of shared waters is likely to be of increasing importance for both bilateral and multilateral relations between the countries and where diplomacy actions across sectors and themes and by a diversity of actors are increasingly a norm rather than an exception see e g constantinou et al 2016 diamond and mcdonald 1996 hocking et al 2012 6 3 limitations and ways forward there are naturally limitations in our work first and foremost any categorisation is inevitably a simplification and able to only partially capture the multi faceted reality related to shared waters and geopolitics for the same reason the different elements in our classifications are strongly complementary and partly overlapping even when we have emphasised their distinct characteristics we also do recognise that diplomatic processes are rarely linear but evolve in dynamic cyclical ways while the four steps of the suggested water diplomacy paths approach provide a structure for the analytical framework they do not represent the actual water diplomacy processes similarly the examples we provide are indicative only and for example the participatory scenario process suggested for steps 3 and 4 should preferably consist of several phases and in depth background analyses and make use of both forecasting and backcasting techniques to explore alternative future scenarios instead of the simplified scenario building process that makes use of selected key drivers only we also acknowledge that the paths approach s strong attention to undesired drivers and related potential conflicts can be problematic as it can maintain or even escalate the tensions in the studied context yet we argue that in order to consider and build motivation for all possible water diplomacy actions including those not directly related to water it is important to consider also the tensions building on a structured and context sensitive discussion of different options this is important as existing water cooperation even when based on formal agreements and technically functional may not be able to solve the underlying political contradictions or can even be destructive or used as a technical veil for an actors political intentions allouche et al 2015 allouche et al 2019 ide and detges 2018 käkönen and hirsch 2009 zeitoun et al 2020b in some situations the existing or emerging conflicts may even provide a more fruitful and possibly transformative way forward than mere cooperative arrangements zeitoun et al 2020b the spatial and temporal scales of our study merit attention as well while the focus is generally on shared waters the three case studies as well as a majority of the literature used focuses on transboundary river basins shared by two or more countries other types of transboundary waters exist as well including shared groundwaters and lakes as well as coastal waters and seas in addition water diplomacy as a process can be used within a country to mitigate tensions between for example ethnic groups or different water users while the suggested approach considers water diplomacy as a long term process water diplomacy can also act as an acute short term dimension for longer term cooperation with an aim to solve particularly contested situations the various temporal and spatial scales of water diplomacy would thus require further study finally despite the fact that we emphasise the importance of seeing beyond water and engaging non water experts this study is largely located within water governance tradition as such the study is similar to most other water diplomacy studies and continues the tradition of water related approaches most prominently the iwrm and water energy food security nexus that emphasise the need for integration views but nevertheless do this from a sectoral viewpoint more effort is therefore needed to ensure that other disciplines contribute to the theory of water diplomacy and to engage practitioners such as diplomats as well as peace mediation and conflict resolution professionals into its conceptualisation and implementation 4 4 the key role that water sector play in the conceptual development of water diplomacy is visible e g in the web of science where a majority of the 62 publications listed by july 2021 under the topic search water diplomacy publications link to the field of water resources in total 33 publications with just three publications linked to political science and four publications to international relations 7 conclusions this article has aimed to contribute to the practice of water diplomacy by suggesting a simple step wise approach called water diplomacy paths to analyse different water diplomacy contexts through the recognition of potential water related and political tensions as well as a related set of water diplomacy actions across both technical and political tracks klimes et al 2019 to facilitate this we recognised five key aspects for water diplomacy from the current literature suggested a general definition for water diplomacy and sought to clarify the key difference between the related concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation section 3 1 we also demonstrated the use of water diplomacy paths approach with brief case studies in three different transboundary settings given its practical focus the work builds on a set of interviews and workshops with water diplomacy actors including career diplomats we see such a practical link important due to the increasing emphasis that water diplomacy is gaining in foreign policy as exemplified by the recent eu council conclusions on water diplomacy council of the european union 2018 and the on going difficult negotiation process between ethiopia egypt and sudan regarding the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd in the nile river basin cascão 2021 roussi 2020 wheeler et al 2020 we do reckon that the reality of water diplomacy is messy multi faceted dynamic and context dependent and efforts to conceptualise and define it inevitably miss some viewpoints actors engaged in water diplomacy are diverse and may not even consider themselves as water diplomacy actors similarly the presence of existing or potential conflict between countries does not warrant water diplomacy sometimes even vice versa on the other hand our analysis reminds that the linkage of water diplomacy and water cooperation is often reciprocal while cooperation is needed for meaningful water diplomacy political actions may be required to open cooperation deadlocks or to bring politics into the forefront when cooperation is intentionally or not hiding the underlying politics for these reasons we argue that systematic categorisations of water diplomacy can clarify its role among the diverse and potentially contested actors we suggest that discussion on possible tensions that the lack of water diplomacy can lead to can help to provide motivation for the actual water diplomacy actions we provide one example of such approach namely the water diplomacy paths which aims to establish a way to recognise the key interconnections contradictions and complementarities within the conceptual space of water diplomacy while building on existing water diplomacy approaches and related methods such as joint fact finding and scenario building the paths approach also seeks to provide novel views through its emphasis on water related and political tensions and actions in this way the paths approach also seeks to address the distinct but complementary role that water diplomacy actions can have for more conventional transboundary water cooperation arrangements section 3 1 by providing an analytical framework to understand a given water diplomacy process the approach can also offer a third party actor a possibility to find entry points to meaningfully engage in the process such understanding is important given that there rarely is just one on going water diplomacy process but rather a multitude of simultaneous partly connected processes across multiple tracks and scales the title of this article refers to water diplomacy as a set of paths this aims to convey two messages firstly water diplomacy is a continuous long term process between the parties sharing a water body we thus see that water diplomacy resembles first and foremost a marathon with several up hills and downhills reaching a common goal requires consideration of changing environmental economic social and political dynamics as well as a jointly agreed set of activities we do however reckon that water diplomacy may also require more intensive rapid set of actions spurts that are needed to tackle a particularly problematic situation in a shared waterbody potentially with the help of a trusted third party facilitator secondly the plural of paths indicates that there are always multiple ways forward in a given shared waters context both in terms of potential tensions and the respective solutions we therefore see that establishing a future oriented process that brings together transboundary water cooperation and foreign policy can help to enhance the success of water diplomacy funding this research is partly based on two projects

4228,water diplomacy is gaining increasing attention among both researchers and policy makers the interest is understandable given that the concept brings together themes such as shifting geopolitics new types of diplomacy and increasing water scarcity yet there is no common definition for water diplomacy and actual water diplomacy actions typically vary across multiple tracks and scales in this article we seek to contribute to the practice of water diplomacy by introducing a step wise water diplomacy paths approach for analysing different water diplomacy contexts and related water diplomacy actions to facilitate this we recognise five key aspects for water diplomacy political preventive integrative cooperative technical and propose a general definition for water diplomacy we also discuss the possible distinctions between the related concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation the use of the water diplomacy paths approach is demonstrated with brief case studies focusing on central asia the mekong region and the finnish russian water cooperation the work builds on an extensive literature review and comparative analysis of water diplomacy approaches as well as on a series of workshops and interviews among selected water diplomacy actors including career diplomats the suggested water diplomacy paths approach envisions possible ways forward through four main steps 1 identification of key themes and related actors 2 analysis of the current state 3 recognition of undesired drivers and related scenarios and 4 identification of possible water diplomacy actions we see that the approach has potential to support water diplomacy processes with the help of the distinction it makes between water and diplomacy focused activities as well as its consideration of tensions and related actions such characteristics also emphasise the complementarity that water diplomacy actions have with more traditional transboundary water cooperation arrangements we argue that water diplomacy as a concept and as a practical approach provides an example of the future of foreign policy and diplomacy where the use of shared waters is likely to be of increasing importance keywords water diplomacy transboundary waters water security foreign policy regional cooperation diplomacy 1 introduction tackling climate change and increasing scarcity of

external countries networks or organisations in the water diplomacy processes beardsley et al 2006 dixon 1996 van genderen and rood 2011 häkkinen 2020 leb et al 2018 lehti and lepomäki 2017 these actors can build trust and facilitate water diplomacy related processes through e g joint capacity and knowledge building network activities facilitation and mediation for example the european union and its different member states have plans towards such a role in varying diplomacy and peace mediation contexts karjalainen 2020 niemann et al 2018 despite the increasing interest water diplomacy still lacks a commonly agreed definition the concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation are at times even used interchangeably although water diplomacy studies typically focus more on conflict prevention and diplomatic engagement ggreta project 2016 grech madin et al 2018 huntjens et al 2016 islam and susskind 2013 molnar et al 2017 schmeier 2018 yildiz et al 2016 the literature remains sparse in regard to practical guidance on actual water diplomacy actions as well the existing guidance builds primarily on context specific examples e g al saidi and hefny 2018 barua 2018 kattelus et al 2015 koff et al 2020 or on the activities of transboundary water cooperation and management e g kittikhoun and staubli 2018 pohl 2014 salmoral et al 2019 which cover only partly the actual water diplomacy actions the literature also tends to focus on positive development that would stem from enhanced cooperation rather than the potential challenges but also new openings resulting from escalating tensions time wise the literature tends to focus on current activities and or relatively short term developments although the consideration of longer term aspects is also important given the implications that for example climate change and increasing resource scarcities is estimated to have in several shared basins considering these research and policy gaps this study seeks to contribute to the practice of water diplomacy through the following main research question what kind of approach can help to analyse differing water diplomacy contexts and to recognise potential water diplomacy actions that enhance collaboration and prevent future water related tensions related to this we also ask what are the key aspects of water diplomacy and how does the concept of water diplomacy help to complement the more thoroughly studied concept of transboundary water cooperation in order to answer these questions we first present the methodological basis of our study section 2 and review the existing literature to recognise key aspects of water diplomacy as well as to provide a general definition for water diplomacy section 3 we then introduce a water diplomacy paths approach section 4 and demonstrate its use with desk based case studies on central asian shared waters the mekong river basin and finnish russian water cooperation section 5 detailed central asian case in annex b finally we discuss the broader implications of our study section 6 and provide some concluding thoughts section 7 2 materials and methods this article applies a mixed methods approach that consists of the following main research methods i a structured literature review of relevant academic literature reports and policy documents ii a set of semi structured expert interviews in total 25 interviews with 21 interviewees from 10 different organisations in 2018 20 and iii a series of four group discussions and four workshops among finnish water diplomacy actors including experts from water sector peace mediation as well as foreign policy and diplomacy annex a additional research methods included participatory observation in selected water diplomacy processes and meetings see annex a as well as a benchmark study of existing major water diplomacy initiatives and actors from the netherlands sweden switzerland and germany salminen et al 2020 the key method for conceptual discussion on water diplomacy section 3 was the literature review complemented by the relevant findings from the interviews and workshops the literature was analytically reviewed to identify definitions and descriptions of water diplomacy and related concepts such as transboundary water cooperation or hydro diplomacy the identified descriptions were then compared and analysed to recognise the most common conceptual elucidations as well as their differences this led to the categorisation of five typical aspects for water diplomacy section 3 as well as comparison between the related concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation section 3 1 in addition to the literature the categorisation presented in section 3 benefited from the analytical framings related to adaptive governance peace research and multi track diplomacy e g cleaver and whaley 2018 diamond and mcdonald 1996 ide 2018 the development of the water diplomacy paths approach section 4 benefited particularly from the expert interviews and workshops annex a and utilised the findings from the benchmark study and the participatory observation the approach also made use of existing water diplomacy literature particularly those focusing on water related conflicts and possible ways forward for water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation e g farinosi et al 2018 huntjens et al 2016 islam and susskind 2013 mirumachi 2010 pohl 2014 zeitoun et al 2020b given the future orientation of the approach literature related to futures research and scenarios was important as well e g cairns et al 2016 mahmoud et al 2009 maier et al 2016 the earlier version of the approach was developed as a tool for an external third party facilitator in two reports done for the finnish ministry for foreign affairs salminen et al 2019a salminen et al 2020 the approach has therefore a linkage to finnish experience on transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy honkonen and lipponen 2018 kotkasaari 2008 ministry of agriculture and forestry 2018 finally the three descriptive case studies that demonstrate the use of the suggested approach build on the interviews and workshops as well as relevant literature on the study areas see section 5 the case studies also benefit from the authors prior experience on transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy in the three areas see references in section 5 3 context recognising key aspects of water diplomacy water diplomacy is a blurry affair the concept has no standard definition but it is defined in policy documents and scientific publications in several ways depending on the context as well as the authors perspective e g council of the european union 2018 honkonen and lipponen 2018 huntjens and de man 2017 islam and madani 2017 islam and susskind 2013 klimes et al 2019 milman and gerlak 2020 molnar et al 2017 mumme 2020 pangare 2014 pohl 2014 salminen et al 2019b vij et al 2020b water diplomacy consortium 2013 wilder et al 2020 xie et al 2018 zeitoun et al 2020a also the very term used varies with hydrodiplomacy and blue diplomacy also emerging from literature klimes et al 2019 pangare 2014 pohl 2014 salman 2015 vlachos 1996 we consider them here synonymous for water diplomacy the diversity of definitions is understandable given the variety of water diplomacy contexts and the number of theoretical frameworks related to shared waters and their governance yet noting the increasing calls to include water diplomacy as a part of foreign policy perhaps most prominently by the european union and its member states council of the european union 2018 such conceptual ambiguity may hinder both the recognition and implementation of water diplomacy actions the close connection and overlaps that water diplomacy has with transboundary water cooperation may create additional confusion particularly among actors coming outside water field we discuss next key aspects that we found to be most regularly highlighted separately or together in relation to water diplomacy there are altogether five such aspects that we refer to with following one word terms that seek to describe their main characteristics political preventive integrative cooperative and technical table 1 2 2 the five aspects bring together elements from several existing documents for example four purposes of water diplomacy suggested by molnar et al 2017 are largely similar with the first four of our water diplomacy aspects while the three characteristics recognised by grech madin et al 2018 can be linked to the first three aspects presented the two main aspects so called technical and political tracks recognised for water diplomacy e g klimes et al 2019 are directly included in the five aspects among more policy oriented documents the three general themes that council of the european union 2018 uses for water diplomacy outcomes are part of the suggested aspects as well more process oriented approaches e g huntjens et al 2016 islam and susskind 2013 recognise the actual diplomatic action situations and the connection to broader diplomatic settings emphasising political preventive and integrative aspects of the diplomacy the categorisation provides a simple but relatively comprehensive view on key aspects of water diplomacy and related approaches related to this we also discuss the differences that water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation have as two distinct but complementary concepts section 3 1 for we see that clarifying the differences between the two concepts can help to recognise water diplomacy actions that complement existing cooperative activities table 3 in section 3 1 therefore summarises suggested differences between transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy related to their physical basis key governance attributes legal basis actors structures processes as well as their main assumptions and aims all five aspects consider water diplomacy as a process that in comparison with other sub types of diplomacy sees shared waters as a subject of political consideration with the help of diplomatic methods this also lays the normative foundation for water diplomacy as the concept values the existence of diplomatic relations interaction and trust between parties while acknowledging their differing interests and positions and consistent with the key principles of transboundary water cooperation un 1997 unece 1992 sees reasonable and equitable use of shared waters as something to seek for the first one of the five aspects which we here refer to as political aspect sees water diplomacy as a process of inherently political interactions that occur among stakeholders with different often conflicting interests positions and agenda the aspect thus links closely to politics and power relations between and also within the riparian states this viewpoint seems so evident that it is often not explicitly mentioned in different definitions but rather seen as an overarching theme and indeed a reason for water diplomacy water diplomacy is here seen as a part of the broader political milieu considering political goals that extend beyond basin boundaries hocking et al 2012 islam and susskind 2018 molnar et al 2017 sadoff and grey 2002 varady et al 2014 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 while the broader political context therefore greatly influences water diplomacy the relation works also other way round with water diplomacy potentially facilitating regional interaction van genderen and rood 2011 keskinen et al 2014 this aspect links with processes typical for example for foreign policy regional cooperation and critical hydro politics table 1 see e g islam and susskind 2013 pohl 2014 schmeier and shubber 2018 unep 2016 varady et al 2014 vij et al 2020a 2020b zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 zeitoun and warner 2006 the second aspect preventive views water diplomacy as an approach for peace mediation as well as conflict prevention and mitigation in this way the aspect includes both preventive in terms of preventing future conflicts and restorative elements in terms of reconciliation and reduction of existing tensions a large number of research papers primarily consider water as a form of preventive diplomacy linking it to the promotion of regional stability and peace these two are together with reasonable and equitable water use typically considered as the normative foundation of water diplomacy e g blue peace 2020 carmi et al 2019 schmeier 2018 yildiz et al 2016 this also means that preventive aspect makes often use of relevant tools and mechanisms of peace mediation and conflict resolution abdi and mason 2019 e g carmi et al 2019 conca and dabelko 2002 de bruyne and fischhendler 2013 ggreta project 2016 mason and blank 2013 phillips et al 2006 yildiz et al 2016 zyck and muggah 2012 conflict prevention and peace mediation activities 3 3 conflict prevention typically includes preventive actions in forms of humanitarian development cooperation or operations to improve government administration zyck and muggah 2012 there is also a conceptual difference between peace mediation peace keeping and peace building with peace mediation the focus of this article emphasising the achievement of resolution to end the existing political disputes and related conflicts peace keeping aims to maintain the state of non violence while peace building is then about establishing the conditions for sustainable long term peace bercovitch and kadayifci 2002 boutros ghali 1992 papagianni 2010 can thus create enabling conditions for water diplomacy and other types of preventive diplomacy and vice versa water diplomacy may enhance conflict prevention and peace mediation pohl 2014 zyck and muggah 2012 the third aspect integrative builds on the notion that several publications describe contemporary water diplomacy as a process comprising of many stakeholders across multiple societal and thematic sectors in both formal and informal settings diamond and mcdonald 1996 huntjens et al 2016 yasuda et al 2018 water diplomacy goes therefore beyond the conventional regional treaties and transboundary cooperation mechanisms between riparian country governments involving also other actors and themes this aspect sees water diplomacy as a multi disciplinary concept that is located at the intersection of science policy and practice klimes et al 2019 assuming participation from all these domains the integrative aspect emphasises this crosscutting and connecting nature of water diplomacy and therefore links to integrated approaches related to both water and diplomacy including for example integrated water resources management iwrm water energy food security nexus multi track diplomacy integrative diplomacy and more generally knowledge co production grech madin et al 2018 hocking et al 2012 huntjens and de man 2017 islam and madani 2017 keskinen et al 2016 milman and gerlak 2020 norström et al 2020 stepanova et al 2020 the fourth aspect cooperative sees water diplomacy as a process that promotes and relies on mutual cooperation and the idea of shared benefits bringing it thus close to the common definitions for transboundary water cooperation water cooperation can be seen as an operative end product of the process of water diplomacy with the very aim of the cooperation defined by the diplomatic process this aspect makes use of concepts such as benefit sharing cooperation continuum and general water governance frameworks bréthaut and pflieger 2020 dore et al 2012 furlong 2006 ggreta project 2016 molnar et al 2017 oecd 2015 sadoff and grey 2002 sadoff and grey 2005 unece 2015a unece 2015b varady et al 2014 wolf 1998 the international agreements on transboundary waters un 1997 unece 1992 link closely to the cooperative aspect as well including their key principles related to the duty to cooperate the use of transboundary waters in reasonable and equitable manner and the principle of not causing significant harm ideally this aspect therefore recognises the value of cooperation willingness to cooperate and communication between key actors as a means to promote sustainable and socially just use of shared waters yet water cooperation may not result from mutual agreement but also from coercion this in turn indicates that cooperation is not always able to prevent tensions but can actually sustain them allouche 2020 cascão and zeitoun 2010 koff et al 2020 zeitoun et al 2020b exposing the fundamental linkage that cooperation has with the political setting the fifth aspect technical is based on the recognition of the so called technical track contrasting with the other so called political track of water diplomacy that focuses on water as a resource and as a physical substance that generates the hydrological cycle water availability allocation and use and the related monitoring management and knowledge production processes are therefore in the core of this aspect klimes and yaari 2019 klimes et al 2019 yasuda et al 2018 the aspect thus provides an information basis for shared waters and their role for national and regional development including both current and future developments as well as trends related particularly to water use and climate change huntjens et al 2016 klimes and yaari 2019 kummu et al 2016 yasuda et al 2018 this aspect has a particularly strong link to knowledge production as well as related knowledge products such as hydrological models and impact assessments hocking et al 2012 käkönen and hirsch 2009 kittikhoun and staubli 2018 klimes and yaari 2019 klimes et al 2019 the royal society 2010 despite its name the technical aspect is not unpolitical allouche et al 2015 ide and detges 2018 käkönen and hirsch 2009 keskinen et al 2014 klimes and yaari 2019 klimes et al 2019 knowledge can generally be considered as a political asset and thus control over knowledge and its production may be used as ideational tactics in hydro politics zeitoun and warner 2006 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 linking the technical and political aspects of water diplomacy elementary together we suggest that together these aspects can help to better understand the broad concept of water diplomacy as they bring together the key dimensions from the current water diplomacy literature out of the five aspects the political and technical aspects cross cut the entire concept while the technical aspect emphasises the role of water and related knowledge production processes as a subject of the diplomacy the political aspect emphasises the inherently political nature of the interaction between the water diplomacy actors the three other aspects integrative preventive and cooperative can then be seen as characterisations of the key motivations and mechanisms of water diplomacy fig 1 in practice the five aspects are typically all present in water diplomacy contexts but with different emphases that may also change over time similarly the different parties engaged in a water diplomacy process may have differing expectations and also expertise regarding the five aspects the five aspects help us also to suggest a general definition for water diplomacy building on earlier definitions water diplomacy is a dynamic process of inherently political interaction political aspect across multiple diplomacy tracks and sectors in both formal and informal settings integrative with an aim to prevent and resolve tensions and conflicts preventive through the use of diplomatic tools and cooperation mechanisms cooperative as well as knowledge on shared waters and related resources technical or more concisely water diplomacy is a dynamic politically oriented process that aims to prevent mitigate and resolve water related tensions in shared waters by making simultaneous use of diplomatic tools water related know how and cooperation mechanisms across multiple diplomacy tracks 3 1 transboundary water cooperation vs water diplomacy water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation are closely connected but separate concepts yet literature often considers the two concepts in an undefined manner and even interchangeably mainly because both concepts are used in multitude of ways and address largely similar settings related to the interactions in shared waters we argue that clarifying the key differences between transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy can help to advance both concepts and importantly to recognise practical water diplomacy actions that complement existing cooperative activities section 4 as a result table 3 presents our view on the key differences between transboundary water cooperation and water diplomacy across categories related to their physical basis main governance attributes legal basis actors structures processes as well as main assumptions and aims while the different characteristics in the table are described to be clearly distinct they are naturally closely connected and typically also enable each other for example an intergovernmental river basin commission is typically established through a broader diplomacy process while negotiations on e g regional energy or food security issues build also on water related information it is also important to note that both concepts link to the so called technical and political tracks related to shared waters klimes et al 2019 with cooperation typically focusing mainly on the technical track and diplomacy more on the political track this means that transboundary water cooperation while often technically oriented and building on established institutions works under a politically defined mandate and its processes take place in both formal and informal settings that also involve a varying degree of politically oriented decision making and vice versa while water diplomacy is often inherently political and takes place across multiple diplomacy tracks it is typically facilitated by technical track knowledge production processes as well as existing cooperative institutions as a result despite the differences between their characteristics we suggest that the main aim of water cooperation and water diplomacy is ultimately the same emphasising the complementarity of the two concepts 4 water diplomacy paths approach in this section we propose a four step approach called water diplomacy paths wdp for analysing a given water diplomacy context and recognising potential water diplomacy actions to provoke thinking and to complement existing transboundary water cooperation activities the approach has an emphasis on both water related and political tensions as well as related preventive and mitigative actions this way the approach has a particularly close connection with political and preventive aspects of water diplomacy section 3 given that the approach aims to provide a general analytical framework it can be a useful analysis tool for an external actor e g a third party facilitator that seeks to understand better a certain water diplomacy context yet we see that the approach could also be suitable for the actual water diplomacy actors e g an intergovernmental organisation as an additional fresh way to view the potential tensions and related actions in a given water diplomacy context in such situations the joint application of the approach itself may even be seen as a water diplomacy action and the way the approach is used can guide also the actors engaged in its implementation the four linear steps described in fig 2 as well as in the following sections aim to provide a clear structure for the analysis with first two steps focusing on the analysis of the context and two latter steps helping to recognise possible tensions and related water diplomacy actions yet the steps are indicative only as in reality any process related to water diplomacy is likely to develop in an iterative cyclical manner the approach has a strong temporal dimension and it seeks to consider both the historical trajectory and possible future paths forward such an emphasis seeks to help envision alternative future scenarios moving beyond the potential present day challenges the long term view is important also to remind the actors about the dynamic evolving nature of the shared waterbody while water allocation and management decisions are often based on current or even past flow regimes changing climate is likely to alter both the quantity and timing of the flows 4 1 step 1 identifying key water diplomacy themes and actors the first step in the proposed approach is to identify the most relevant themes and related actors for the specific water diplomacy context in addition to the use and development of shared water resource typical themes to be considered include water related sectors e g agriculture and energy as well as broader themes related to regional cooperation e g trade the environment political relations to ensure sufficient consideration of all relevant themes the identification may be initiated by recognising first broad regional settings such as biophysical societal and institutional and then identifying the key themes and actors for such settings see example in annex b to ensure a comprehensive deliberation of the key themes and actors this step would ideally build on a facilitated stakeholder process that utilises established stakeholder identification and engagement methods such as knowledge mapping and social network analysis reed et al 2009 to ensure a wide participation from different actors in some situations however the actual actors and themes to be included and excluded from a given water diplomacy process may be defined by a given actor such as a river basin organisation as an established facilitator of the process in such situations the key actors and themes may be based for example on the existing regional agreement related to shared waters 4 2 step 2 analysing the current state the second step aims to analyse the current state of the given water diplomacy context building on the themes and actors recognised in step 1 the analysis should preferably include also a consideration of the past trends including those related to water use infrastructure development and broader political relations between the riparian countries such historical trajectory deepens the understanding of the present situation and also helps to recognise alternative future paths in the following steps the suggested method for this step includes a comparative analysis and joint synthesis of existing studies in this specific context as it is likely that there already exists relevant but potentially conflicting information among the actors such comparative analysis could be carried out for example through a joint technical working group with experts from all countries and other relevant parties through an independent expert panel or through a combination e g keskinen et al 2012 the analysis can thus build on the process of joint fact finding islam and susskind 2018 mccreary et al 2007 bringing together existing data as well as carrying out new studies when needed the analysis should preferably be carried out in a facilitated process where the parties can discuss and agree on the current baseline situation in the given context this is important given that knowledge and different knowledge products such as models and impact assessment results can become highly contested in transboundary settings e g käkönen and hirsch 2009 klimes and yaari 2019 4 3 step 3 recognising key drivers and related future scenarios the third step seeks first to recognise key drivers e g biophysical social economic and or political that are likely to impact the current status within a given timeframe after the step envisions possible future scenarios on how water related interactions could unfold in a given context based on a set of assumptions on how current state may evolve due to key drivers and evolving relationships between the parties the key drivers and related scenarios defined in this step are therefore likely to include both positive desired and negative undesired views on future yet given that water diplomacy builds on the premise of differing national interests this step should include discussion on potential water related tensions as well even when such discussion is difficult and often avoided we therefore suggest that this step also includes intentional consideration of undesired negative drivers and related conflict scenarios step 3 followed by a set of actions that can be used to prevent and mitigate such tensions step 4 the suggested method for both third and fourth step is a participatory scenario process that creates alternative scenarios for the context there is a plethora of scenario approaches available including those already used in transboundary water contexts e g farinosi et al 2018 gorgoglione et al 2019 keskinen et al 2015 mrc 2011 phillips et al 2008 warner and van buuren 2016 scenario approaches can generally be divided into different categories such as exploratory and anticipatory mahmoud et al 2009 or predictive explorative and normative maier et al 2016 the suggested water diplomacy paths approach aims to make a simultaneous use of the key scenario types with step 3 focusing more on predictive and explorative scenarios what is likely to happen given the current state and future developments and drivers and step 4 on anticipatory and normative scenarios how can we achieve together a specific normative i e peaceful future and mitigate the tensions envisioned in step 3 4 4 step 4 identifying possible water diplomacy actions the fourth step focuses on the identification of possible water diplomacy actions that build on the key drivers and future scenarios recognised from step 3 the actions can thus strengthen the positive mutually beneficial activities envisioned as well as to ease the possible water related and or political tensions recognised in step 3 given the varying aspects related to water diplomacy fig 1 such actions should preferably cover both water related knowledge making processes and key diplomacy processes this will better ensure that the recognised water diplomacy actions consider so called technical and political tracks of water diplomacy klimes et al 2019 one way to consider both the technical and political tracks is to use a simple matrix to frame the discussion and link step 3 with step 4 fig 3 the matrix considers the water diplomacy process through two main aspects focusing on i water and related knowledge production mechanisms and ii politics differing national interests and related diplomacy processes while these two aspects are strongly connected we see that considering them also separately can help to recognise the full potential of different water diplomacy actions including those that do no stem directly from water field and or transboundary cooperation similarly to complement more traditional cooperative mechanisms and to strengthen the motivation for water diplomacy actions the matrix also considers undesired scenarios where water related and or political drivers may lead to increasing tensions and even conflict step 3 the matrix includes two such conflict paths with the grey path on left in fig 3 called politics to water indicating a scenario where increasing political tensions between the countries affect also the use of shared waters the grey conflict path on right is then called water to politics indicating an scenario where water related drivers and related tensions e g construction of an upstream dam and its impacts to downstream countries in a shared water body lead to broader political tensions fig 3 after establishing these undesired scenarios step 4 views the matrix other way focusing on water diplomacy actions that aim to prevent and mitigate the envisioned tensions building on both existing and novel activities fig 3 the focus is on two main sets of actions as well with the more technical set of water diplomacy actions related to water know how and cooperation mechanisms and institutions their aim is to reduce water related tensions and to ensure that political processes have understanding of key water related issues consistent particularly with technical cooperative and integrative aspects of water diplomacy section 3 if there is already existing transboundary water cooperation mechanism the recognised actions are likely to build on those activities the other more political set of water diplomacy actions in fig 3 consist then of broader diplomacy focused actions that aim to strengthen the political trust and interaction between the parties the actions can thus make use of both existing and new diplomacy processes as well as peace mediation and conflict resolution activities such actions aim to reduce political tensions and to bring a stronger political understanding to water focused processes corresponding to political integrative and preventive aspects of water diplomacy section 3 the end result is thus a set of water diplomacy actions that aim to turn the undesired conflict paths envisioned in step 3 into desired water diplomacy paths such paths seek simultaneously to strengthen the cooperation between the parties as well as to avoid and mitigate water related conflicts through a set of joint actions in this way the recognised actions are also likely to have a linkage to one or several water diplomacy aspects described in section 3 the actions recognised can then be compared with the existing activities in the studied water diplomacy context providing a view on those activities that are important to maintain as well as on novel actions that could be initiated either by external actors such as a third party facilitator or the water diplomacy parties themselves 5 water diplomacy paths approach three cases our aim is to provide a practical approach for analysing different water diplomacy contexts in a way that complements existing activities with its focus on water related tensions and related actions that can be used to reduce those tensions to demonstrate the potential use of the water diplomacy paths approach we next apply it briefly in three descriptive cases from transboundary settings related to central asia the mekong region in southeast asia and finnish russian water cooperation the three cases showcase the variety of possible water diplomacy contexts from bilateral setting with several transboundary rivers finnish russian to major transboundary river basin with several countries mekong and a region with several shared waters central asia the results from the three case studies are based on our own past research in those regions e g altingoz et al 2018 haapala 2013 jalilov et al 2016 kattelus et al 2015 keskinen 2008 keskinen et al 2014 salminen et al 2019b as well as relevant literature e g abbasova et al 2018 altingoz et al 2018 biba 2018 devlaeminck and huang 2020 dore et al 2012 gerlak and haefner 2017 honkonen and lipponen 2018 kittikhoun and staubli 2018 korjonen kuusipuro 2013 kotkasaari 2008 lancang mekong water resources cooperation 2020 middleton and allouche 2016 mirimanova et al 2018 mirumachi 2020 molle et al 2009 räsänen 2020 russel 2018 suhardiman et al 2012 thu and tinh 2019 annex b provides a general introduction for all three case study areas together with a detailed example from central asia with a focus on amu darya and syr darya rivers and related aral sea basin table 2 summarises the key results for the three case study areas following the four steps of water diplomacy paths approach presented in section 4 to enhance clarity only three most relevant themes and actors were recognised in step 1 while step 3 and step 4 are structured according to the water diplomacy matrix presented in fig 3 with a focus on undesired drivers and related scenarios for more detailed example on the use of the proposed approach see the central asian case in annex b the results presented in table 2 show both similarities and differences between the case study areas the analysis presented in steps 1 and 2 showcase the key dynamics of the current water diplomacy contexts in three cases despite their differing geographical contexts all cases have close link to the broader geopolitics in the region emphasising how water diplomacy context typically reaches beyond water per se steps 3 and 4 help then to understand how a set of undesired drivers related to water and politics may increase the tensions in the case study areas and what kind of water diplomacy actions both existing and novel and related to both water and diplomacy could help to ease them the potential tensions related to hydropower and climate change are present in all three cases step 3 underlining the role that energy sector and related actors typically have in transboundary settings yet their engagement in actual water cooperation processes remains often limited providing one potential way forward for complementary water diplomacy actions the possible diplomacy related tensions differ between the cases having links to the diversity of institutional settings in relation to both bilateral regional cooperation and transboundary waters it should be noted that the analysis of the three cases is very concise and simplified and annex b provides a more detailed example from central asia on the application of the water diplomacy paths approach 6 discussion 6 1 implications of the water diplomacy paths approach the water diplomacy paths approach aims to provide a way to analyse a given water diplomacy context and to both motivate and recognise possible water diplomacy actions we see that the strength of the approach is its step wise structure as well as simultaneous consideration of water related and political tensions and related preventive and mitigating water diplomacy actions the recognised actions also aim to have a link to both technical more water focused track and political more diplomacy focused track related to water diplomacy in this way the approach seeks to make visible the key role that general diplomatic actions and actors even when not directly water related may have in shared waters we also see the future orientation of the approach important as it emphasises the need to consider longer term developments and climate change implications these benefits were evident also in our discussion with different water diplomacy actors with career diplomats and other non water experts seeing the approach particularly useful in clarifying the distinct but related actions on water cooperation and diplomacy as well as enhancing their interest and motivation to engage in water diplomacy processes salminen et al 2019a salminen et al 2020 the recognised key drivers and scenarios step 3 as well as the related water diplomacy actions step 4 provide also a link to the five water diplomacy aspects defined in section 3 while the water diplomacy actions identified as part of the approach are likely to cover all five aspects we see that the approach is helpful to address particularly political and preventive aspects we see that this is important for three reasons first of all the other three aspects integrative cooperative technical are often well covered already by existing transboundary water cooperation activities that water diplomacy actions seek to complement secondly the discussion about the political track is often more difficult to initiate due to the parties differing interests and the issues with internal politics and sovereignty and actions related to this track may therefore be more difficult to initiate thirdly we suggest that the current water diplomacy activities could make better use of the experience that peace mediation and conflict resolution literature provides on preventive diplomacy actions the three demonstrative cases section 5 and annex b provide interesting points for consideration as well the case results emphases on e g energy security and regional trade indicate that the approach s focus on potential water related and political tensions step 3 and required actions step 4 can help to complement the more dominant and largely technical water cooperation activities with actions that consider also the broader aspects of regional cooperation and foreign policy this in turn can provide novel viewpoints for both the existing diplomatic relations and on going water cooperation activities the results also emphasise the importance of key water using sectors such as energy and food given the critical role of both sectors for national security and development the future orientation can also be seen to help to contemplate the long term developments in the areas putting present day tensions into a perspective and linking the actions to the future trajectories related to water scarcity and climate change at the same time the recognised actions do build largely on already existing cooperation activities emphasising the close connection that water diplomacy has with transboundary cooperation finally while we do see that the characteristics described above entail novelty for our suggested approach it does share also some similarities with other water diplomacy tools and approaches for example the water diplomacy framework by islam and susskind 2013 considers scenario planning and joint fact finding as important methods and views negotiation and mediation as a key for solving complex water conflicts the multi track water diplomacy framework by huntjens et al 2016 on the other hand emphasises the importance of multiple tracks and time scales when thinking of past current and future action situations related to water diplomacy finally the recent book by zeitoun et al 2020b provides an interesting critical view to water conflicts and discuss how transformative analysis may be used in situations with particularly significant power asymmetries such analysis may also include the mapping of alternative pathways which bit similarly to our suggested steps 3 and 4 can lead from status quo either to degradation through destructive conflict or destructive cooperation or to improvement with the help of reformist or transformative approaches and through constructive conflict or risk taking cooperation zeitoun et al 2020a 6 2 water diplomacy connecting sustainability and security ultimately the aim of water diplomacy is to prevent and mitigate water related tensions with the help of cooperative mechanisms and water and diplomacy related actions but do parties have genuine willingness for cooperation it is evident that the actors differing interests direct the ways of interaction in water diplomacy and cooperation can take place only as far as the actors allow this means that it is also important to consider what would be the motivation of say an upstream country and or a regional hegemon to participate in the entire process given it is likely to expose it to criticism towards its potentially contested actions or other way round why a less powerful riparian country would want to engage in such a process given it may just maintain the existing power imbalances both of these questions are valid and ultimately at the core of diplomatic engagement we see that the maintenance of diplomatic relations and the opportunities it brings to all parties should be considered valuable as such for water diplomacy and our suggested approach seeks to strengthen that view by envisioning undesired future paths that would result from the lack of such relations it also means that the benefits from cooperation are typically seen to be more significant than the benefits from water resources management alone extending from water use to broader issues of economic cooperation politics and security and facilitating trade offs beyond water sector at the same time the interaction can be considered as a means to build mutual understanding and trust between the parties both in relation to shared waters and more broadly this also indicates that water diplomacy both as a concept and as practical approach can facilitate the link between sustainability and security while the maintenance of internal and external security remains the ultimate justification for the present day states the planetary scale challenges such as climate change and water scarcity are connecting security increasingly to the global scale and to the use of natural resources keskinen et al 2019 ligtvoet et al 2017 schlag et al 2015 world economic forum 2017 within this emerging international security agenda water and related resources such as energy and food are gaining increasing attention the related resource flows and value chains cross national boundaries making their governance both intersectoral and transnational and linking sustainability and national security tightly together this in turn emphasises the importance of systemic and adaptive approaches to understand the complexities included in such connections and the related actor networks as well as the dynamic evolving nature of the resource flows and the actors relations this dynamism challenges the ways diplomacy is being practiced emphasising a more diverse and adaptive forms of diplomatic actions we therefore suggest that water diplomacy provides an example of the future of foreign policy where the use of shared waters is likely to be of increasing importance for both bilateral and multilateral relations between the countries and where diplomacy actions across sectors and themes and by a diversity of actors are increasingly a norm rather than an exception see e g constantinou et al 2016 diamond and mcdonald 1996 hocking et al 2012 6 3 limitations and ways forward there are naturally limitations in our work first and foremost any categorisation is inevitably a simplification and able to only partially capture the multi faceted reality related to shared waters and geopolitics for the same reason the different elements in our classifications are strongly complementary and partly overlapping even when we have emphasised their distinct characteristics we also do recognise that diplomatic processes are rarely linear but evolve in dynamic cyclical ways while the four steps of the suggested water diplomacy paths approach provide a structure for the analytical framework they do not represent the actual water diplomacy processes similarly the examples we provide are indicative only and for example the participatory scenario process suggested for steps 3 and 4 should preferably consist of several phases and in depth background analyses and make use of both forecasting and backcasting techniques to explore alternative future scenarios instead of the simplified scenario building process that makes use of selected key drivers only we also acknowledge that the paths approach s strong attention to undesired drivers and related potential conflicts can be problematic as it can maintain or even escalate the tensions in the studied context yet we argue that in order to consider and build motivation for all possible water diplomacy actions including those not directly related to water it is important to consider also the tensions building on a structured and context sensitive discussion of different options this is important as existing water cooperation even when based on formal agreements and technically functional may not be able to solve the underlying political contradictions or can even be destructive or used as a technical veil for an actors political intentions allouche et al 2015 allouche et al 2019 ide and detges 2018 käkönen and hirsch 2009 zeitoun et al 2020b in some situations the existing or emerging conflicts may even provide a more fruitful and possibly transformative way forward than mere cooperative arrangements zeitoun et al 2020b the spatial and temporal scales of our study merit attention as well while the focus is generally on shared waters the three case studies as well as a majority of the literature used focuses on transboundary river basins shared by two or more countries other types of transboundary waters exist as well including shared groundwaters and lakes as well as coastal waters and seas in addition water diplomacy as a process can be used within a country to mitigate tensions between for example ethnic groups or different water users while the suggested approach considers water diplomacy as a long term process water diplomacy can also act as an acute short term dimension for longer term cooperation with an aim to solve particularly contested situations the various temporal and spatial scales of water diplomacy would thus require further study finally despite the fact that we emphasise the importance of seeing beyond water and engaging non water experts this study is largely located within water governance tradition as such the study is similar to most other water diplomacy studies and continues the tradition of water related approaches most prominently the iwrm and water energy food security nexus that emphasise the need for integration views but nevertheless do this from a sectoral viewpoint more effort is therefore needed to ensure that other disciplines contribute to the theory of water diplomacy and to engage practitioners such as diplomats as well as peace mediation and conflict resolution professionals into its conceptualisation and implementation 4 4 the key role that water sector play in the conceptual development of water diplomacy is visible e g in the web of science where a majority of the 62 publications listed by july 2021 under the topic search water diplomacy publications link to the field of water resources in total 33 publications with just three publications linked to political science and four publications to international relations 7 conclusions this article has aimed to contribute to the practice of water diplomacy by suggesting a simple step wise approach called water diplomacy paths to analyse different water diplomacy contexts through the recognition of potential water related and political tensions as well as a related set of water diplomacy actions across both technical and political tracks klimes et al 2019 to facilitate this we recognised five key aspects for water diplomacy from the current literature suggested a general definition for water diplomacy and sought to clarify the key difference between the related concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation section 3 1 we also demonstrated the use of water diplomacy paths approach with brief case studies in three different transboundary settings given its practical focus the work builds on a set of interviews and workshops with water diplomacy actors including career diplomats we see such a practical link important due to the increasing emphasis that water diplomacy is gaining in foreign policy as exemplified by the recent eu council conclusions on water diplomacy council of the european union 2018 and the on going difficult negotiation process between ethiopia egypt and sudan regarding the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd in the nile river basin cascão 2021 roussi 2020 wheeler et al 2020 we do reckon that the reality of water diplomacy is messy multi faceted dynamic and context dependent and efforts to conceptualise and define it inevitably miss some viewpoints actors engaged in water diplomacy are diverse and may not even consider themselves as water diplomacy actors similarly the presence of existing or potential conflict between countries does not warrant water diplomacy sometimes even vice versa on the other hand our analysis reminds that the linkage of water diplomacy and water cooperation is often reciprocal while cooperation is needed for meaningful water diplomacy political actions may be required to open cooperation deadlocks or to bring politics into the forefront when cooperation is intentionally or not hiding the underlying politics for these reasons we argue that systematic categorisations of water diplomacy can clarify its role among the diverse and potentially contested actors we suggest that discussion on possible tensions that the lack of water diplomacy can lead to can help to provide motivation for the actual water diplomacy actions we provide one example of such approach namely the water diplomacy paths which aims to establish a way to recognise the key interconnections contradictions and complementarities within the conceptual space of water diplomacy while building on existing water diplomacy approaches and related methods such as joint fact finding and scenario building the paths approach also seeks to provide novel views through its emphasis on water related and political tensions and actions in this way the paths approach also seeks to address the distinct but complementary role that water diplomacy actions can have for more conventional transboundary water cooperation arrangements section 3 1 by providing an analytical framework to understand a given water diplomacy process the approach can also offer a third party actor a possibility to find entry points to meaningfully engage in the process such understanding is important given that there rarely is just one on going water diplomacy process but rather a multitude of simultaneous partly connected processes across multiple tracks and scales the title of this article refers to water diplomacy as a set of paths this aims to convey two messages firstly water diplomacy is a continuous long term process between the parties sharing a water body we thus see that water diplomacy resembles first and foremost a marathon with several up hills and downhills reaching a common goal requires consideration of changing environmental economic social and political dynamics as well as a jointly agreed set of activities we do however reckon that water diplomacy may also require more intensive rapid set of actions spurts that are needed to tackle a particularly problematic situation in a shared waterbody potentially with the help of a trusted third party facilitator secondly the plural of paths indicates that there are always multiple ways forward in a given shared waters context both in terms of potential tensions and the respective solutions we therefore see that establishing a future oriented process that brings together transboundary water cooperation and foreign policy can help to enhance the success of water diplomacy funding this research is partly based on two projects

4229,the goal of low impact development lid is to restore and maintain the pre development flow regime the static storage capacity which is often used as a parameter in lid designs provides the maximum capacity of an lid type and is easily quantifiable already at the design phase however the static storage approach does not consider the inter event recovery of storage capacity by infiltration and evapotranspiration this study investigated dynamic storage capacities of three stormwater management designs with increasing proportions of lid units on a 1 2 ha urban residential block in southern finland to compare their cost efficiency as well as their potential in restoring the pre development flow regime the cost efficiency of lid designs was assessed based on their ability to contribute to water losses and on the additional construction costs required when comparing them to conventional solutions e g asphalt replaced with permeable pavement the design with a small storage capacity and a large capture ratio i e the ratio of contributing area to lid area was the least efficient albeit its small construction cost the design with an appropriate balance between the capture ratio and the lid provided storage capacity was the most efficient option in assessing the potential of stormwater designs in restoring the pre development flow regime the sum of infiltration and flow in storm sewer networks was more representative of the catchment total runoff than flow alone finally an extensive simulation of a large set of differently placed lid units proved useful in a priori identification of the most influential units in the treatment train keywords storage capacity pre development flow regime performance efficiency 1 introduction urbanized catchments with a large fraction of impervious cover drastically disrupt the natural flow dynamics compared with undisturbed catchments guan et al 2015b sillanpää 2013 the hydrological impacts of urbanization have globally become a major management concern for cities motivation for stormwater management is the need to restore a part of those natural hydrological functions that were lost by construction of impervious and nearly impervious surfaces and efficient stormwater drainage and conveyance systems accordingly there is an increasing interest towards economically and hydrologically efficient approaches to manage stormflow with low impact development lid solutions lid types that enhance infiltration evapotranspiration and storage of stormwater have become increasingly popular in landscape architectural designs and urban planning due to their potential to mimic natural hydrological processes the current design guidelines for lid types are mostly based on the static storage capacity i e surface storage volume and soil media void space volume which are dimensioned according to the rainfall intensity for a design storm or a short term event ebrahimian et al 2019 in areas where precipitation intensities are moderate and back to back storms are rare this approach may lead to over dimensioning of lid systems traver and ebrahimian 2017 although the benefits of lid provided static storage capacity in reducing peak flows and volumes of stormflow have been studied haghighatafshar et al 2018 walsh et al 2014 the role of stormwater losses during inter event dry periods in restoring the capacity of lid systems to store stormwater for the next rainfall event has received limited attention accordingly there is a need for continuous simulation of lid systems to assess the role of stormwater losses via dynamic processes i e infiltration and evapotranspiration landscape architectural design procedure would benefit from hydrological information that is rarely available for a design site but can be produced with stormwater models to support design of various lid alternatives a substantial body of research has focused on short term hydrological performance at an individual lid level e g jia et al 2012 qin et al 2013 or for a combination of lid types e g guan et al 2015a haghighatafshar et al 2018 optimization studies to assess the cost efficiency of individual lid units based on design storms also exist e g jia et al 2012 chui et al 2016 however stormwater management designs which involve several different lid types arranged in a treatment train can be particularly efficient for newly developed areas where design of lid networks can be included already in the development plan jefferson et al 2017 the combinations of lid types have been reported to be economically and hydrologically more efficient than individual lid types e g joksimovic alam 2014 leimgruber et al 2019 however understanding the mechanisms that enable serially connected lid types to achieve better economic benefits compared to individual types have received limited attention evidently a model based assessment of design alternatives is an attractive option to quantify the mechanisms and compare the hydrological and cost performance of the solutions modelling also offers the means to generate a large set of lid design alternatives to reveal where the key lid units are located in the treatment train this study was motivated by the need to explore the extent to which a range of lid designs can control urban water balance and restore natural behaviour of an urban constructed area the study explores how long term dynamic evolution of the lid provided storage controls water losses and stormwater generation at a block scale and what the relationship between lid performance and their construction costs is across design alternatives the assessment was based on a model based analysis of lid designs that were outlined by a landscape architect and on a large set of automatically generated lid combinations the modelling application was targeted into an urban block for detecting lid performance and constructions costs in detail in addition the response of urban catchment to rainfall for alternative stormwater management designs was compared against available measured runoff depths from rural watersheds within the study region the simulations were carried out for summer may to august and autumn september to november periods to detect seasonal differences in the performance of alternative stormwater management designs the study objectives were 1 to evaluate static and dynamic storage provided by lid designs and reveal the role of storage recovery during summer and autumn periods with changing evaporative losses 2 to quantify lid impacts on stormwater losses for alternative designs and to assess the potential of urban stormwater management designs in restoring the natural runoff regime 3 to explore relationship between hydrological performance and construction costs of lid designs using a large set of automatically generated combinations of lid types 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and data the study area is located at the southwestern coast of finland fig 1 c comprising three sites with different land use distributions and scales ranging from one hectare to hundreds of square kilometers the urban kirstinpuisto site 14 8 ha is located in the city of turku at the border of kuninkoja and aurajoki watersheds fig 1a b although the kirstinpuisto site comprises two catchments with separate stormwater drainage outlets it will be referred as the kirstinpuisto catchment hereafter fig 1a rainfall data at a one minute resolution from the city of turku operated weather station 1 5 km northeast of the kirstinpuisto catchment was available for a seven month period from may to november 2012 table 1 the summer period from may to august p1 ended with an intensive rain event having a return period of ca 100 years the autumn period from september to november p2 included another significant rain event with a return period of ca 30 years outlets of a rural stream savijoki and a semi urban stream kuninkoja define the reference watersheds fig 1b savijoki is a tributary of the aurajoki river fig 1b the savijoki watershed has an area of 130 km2 50 of which is covered by agricultural land 46 by forest and other vegetation and the remaining 3 by urban fabrics corine 2018 the total imperviousness of savijoki watershed is 1 eea 2018 the discharge data for the rural savijoki watershed was obtained from the stream monitoring station operated by the finnish environment institute table 1 fig 1b kuninkoja is a semi urban watershed with an area of 33 km2 urban fabrics cover 68 of the watershed area forest and urban greens 26 of the area and the remaining 6 is agricultural land corine 2018 the total imperviousness of kuninkoja is 24 the discharge data for the semi urban kuninkoja watershed was obtained from the monitoring station operated by the turku university of applied sciences table 1 fig 1b 2 2 swmm parameterization the stormwater management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 is a widely used tool to simulate urban water balance components i e surface runoff flooding infiltration and evapotranspiration avellaneda et al 2017 khadka et al 2019 the model can also simulate lid structures where each lid type is represented with a combination of vertical layers such as surface layer or pavement soil layer and storage layer fig 2 parameterization of the three alternative stormwater management designs with an increasing intensity of lid units was based on a previously calibrated swmm model for the kirstinpuisto catchment the calibrated imperviousness fraction manning s roughness and depression storage parameters for paved surface gravelled surface roofs and train tracks used in this study can be found in table 4 in khadka et al 2019 infiltration was modelled using the green ampt equation for lid types with vertical layers fig 2 the water lost from the storage layer to the underlying soil layer forms the infiltration component in the water balance the exchange of groundwater with the drainage network was not modelled the initial moisture condition at the beginning of p1 was considered to be equal to the wilting point moisture content of the soil layer whereas the initial condition for p2 was set according to the end of period storage values of p1 the vegetated areas within the kirstinpuisto catchment were parameterized with the aim to realistically produce the division of losses into evapotranspiration and infiltration the existing vegetation in the kirstinpuisto catchment was described as a rain garden with a 60 vegetation coverage on a 60 cm of underlying clay soil and a 3 cm surface layer to represent urban herbaceous plants tahvonen 2018 manning s roughness of the surface layer and infiltration parameters of the green ampt equation i e hydraulic conductivity conductivity slope and suction head of the soil layer table 2 were adjusted so that the simulated green area evapotranspiration values match with values reported for agricultural and peatland forest catchments in turunen 2017 and sarkkola et al 2013 a residential block of 1 2 ha was extracted from the kirstinpuisto catchment for a detailed analysis of the stormwater management designs at the block scale figs 2 and 3 the block offers a computationally economic way to evaluate the performance of lid types arranged in a treatment train without the need to simulate the entire catchment an urban area can be considered as a collection of blocks so examining the hydrological behaviour of one block yields results that are indicative of the behaviour of a larger urban development in design a the block consisted of six 4 6 storey apartment buildings stone paved yards and an asphalt parking space adjacent to green elements i e a vegetated swale and a rain garden fig 3 in stormwater management designs b and c more lid types were added to supplement the vegetated swale of design a 2 3 lid cost estimation the investment costs including materials and works of each lid type table 3 were estimated according to german design guidelines dwa 2014 cost estimation frameworks manfred 2012 and implementation guidelines for lid types behörde für stadtentwicklung und umwelt freie und hansestadt hamburg 2006 these sources consider design and construction requirements set by the german institute for standardization in a newly developed area either an lid type or its conventional counterpart can be implemented i e a permeable pavement or a bioretention cell instead of asphalt and a green roof instead of a conventional flat roof however the property developers are still hesitant to choose lid types over conventional solutions due to their concerns for higher initial investment costs and uncertain efficiencies thus this study estimated the cost of lid types per unit area as the additional cost of implementing lid types instead of their conventional counterparts based on initial investment costs table 3 operational and maintenance costs were excluded from the cost estimation as they are highly site specific and poorly transferable to other regions the cost of underlying land was also ignored as it would not affect the cost difference between lid and conventional structures the cost difference between an lid type and a conventional solution is referred to as investment cost hereafter 2 4 performance evaluation 2 4 1 storage capacity and dynamics stormwater management designs a c were assessed for their maximum capacity to store stormwater in lid structures storage capacity m tot was computed using eqs 1 3 based on the physical characteristics of the vertical layers in each lid type fig 2 1 d i z 1 θ 1 z 2 θ 2 θ r z 3 θ 3 2 m i d i a i a 3 m tot i 1 n m i where d i is the storage depth of an lid type i in water column depth mm z 1 z 2 and z 3 are the depths of surface soil and storage layers mm respectively θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are the porosities of the surface soil and storage layers θ r is the wilting point in the soil layer m i is the lid specific storage capacity for an lid type i for the residential block mm a i is the surface area of an lid type i m2 a is the total surface area of the residential block m2 and n is the total number of lid types in order to present the dynamic aspect of the lid specific storage capacity the time series and the exceedance frequency of storage in lid types during the 7 month simulation period for designs a c were visualised depth of stormwater stored in an lid type i at time t s i t was computed from the simulated water balance components as follows 4 s i t s i t 1 δ t f i t e i t i i t r i t a i a where s i t 1 is the storage state of an lid type i at time t 1 mm f i t is the inflow from the contributing area of an lid type i at time t mm min e i t is the evaporation loss from an lid type i at time t mm min i i t is the infiltration loss from an lid type i at time t mm min r i t is the runoff from an lid type i at time t mm min and δ t is the time step min when assessing the storage behaviour of the alternative designs at the block scale the contributing area for each lid type i was also considered to account for the fact that it is not merely the water column storage depth d i eq 1 that determines the lid efficiency the contributing area a c i was defined by tracing the drainage network upstream from the subcatchment with an lid unit capture ratio of an lid type i c r i and capture ratio of stormwater management designs a c c r t o t at residential block scale were computed using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 c r i a c i

individual lid types and for the residential block the losses were studied separately for periods p1 and p2 to detect seasonal differences in addition the extent to which stormwater management at kirstinpuisto catchment can help in restoring the natural hydrological behaviour was assessed by comparing runoff coefficients and model simulation results with flow measurements from two reference watersheds for the 7 month simulation period including p1 and p2 periods for the kirstinpuisto catchment stormwater runoff was computed as the sum of simulated stormflow at the two outlets of the drainage network divided by the catchment areas for the reference watersheds runoff means measured streamflow divided by the watershed area in the reference watersheds including the semi urban reference watershed runoff therefore refers to flow in a stream or in an urban brook but not in the piped network the runoff coefficient is the ratio of runoff depth to rainfall depth 2 4 3 sensitivity of outflow to lid investment costs the cost efficiency of different lid types was expressed as stormwater runoff volume reduction per additional investment cost defined as 7 e c i t 1 t e i t i i t δ t a i i where e c i l is the cost efficiency and the water balance components are the same as defined in eq 4 and i is the investment cost for lid type i sensitivity of stormwater outflow to investment costs associated with different lid setups was assessed by conducting model simulations for all possible lid combinations of either activating or deactivating planned lid units pp gr and rg in design c the subarea delineated by a red line in fig 3 was used for the sensitivity analysis this resulted in 2 048 different lid combinations vs was not included in the analysis as it serves as the conveyance structure directing stormwater away from the block area in all designs ideally one would sample all possible combinations for the entire block but this would have led to 262 143 model runs which was deemed infeasible due to the computational burden 3 results 3 1 storage capacity and dynamics the block charts in fig 4 depict the lid specific storage capacity m i computed using eq 2 for all lid types in the alternative stormwater management designs a c at the residential block m i indicates the maximum capacity of an lid type i to store stormwater without consideration for the decreasing storage volume due to recharge from precipitation or for the inter event recovery of the storage volume pp covering almost the same area as rg in design b fig 3 had three times larger specific storage capacity fig 4 which was facilitated by the larger water column depth d i in design c pp with 7 smaller areal coverage had three times larger storage capacity than gr fig 4 shows the exceedance frequency for the dynamic storage eq 4 during the seven month simulation period the gr storage capacity was exhausted for ca 20 of the time for other lid structures exhaustion of storage capacity occurred only for very short time periods vs and rg for design a rg bc and pp for design b and rg for design c or not at all vs for design b and vs and pp for design c in fact for most lid types the state of the dynamic storage remained predominantly well below the static capacity fig 4 also reveals a clear change in the storage dynamics of pp between designs b and c which can be attributed to the increase in capture ratio from design b to c table 4 and a consequent increase in stormwater inflow to pp regardless of the same capture ratio vs had different maximum dynamic storage values for designs a c due to the difference in the percentage of upstream lid coverage table 4 for design a vs demonstrated quick storage and inter event recovery responses fig 5 a b consistently storing and losing stormwater within about 15 h rg had a much slower storage and inter event recovery responses compared to vs eventually returning to the wilting point moisture content during p1 however storage did not recover to the wilting point moisture content in p2 due to the reduced evapotranspiration rate in the autumn fig 5a the storage capacities of vs and rg were completely depleted in design a at the end of p1 fig 5b bc gr and pp in design b as well as rg and gr in design c exhausted their storage capacities after the intense event occurring at the end of p1 fig 5d and f however pp still had about 39 mm of the 70 mm specific storage capacity m i remaining at the end of p1 in design c figs 4 and 5e gr and pp in design c demonstrated similar storage and inter event recovery responses prior to a significant rain event in early october fig 5e however after the early october event the responses for gr and pp were different primarily due to the lack of infiltration in the former and initiation of infiltration from the storage layer in the latter before october in design c stormwater in pp was mostly stored in soil layer and lost to evapotranspiration as suggested by the receding limbs with slow depletion rates fig 5e this was also the case in design b with less storage capacity in pp until the intense end of august event during which infiltration was initiated fig 5c gr remained close to saturation for both designs b and c during p2 as evapotranspiration was reduced during colder months fig 5c and e 3 2 restoring natural hydrological behaviour fig 6 shows the stormwater runoff depth reduction by lid types due to infiltration and evapotranspiration for p1 and p2 at the residential block scale in p1 stormwater runoff reduction was dominated by evapotranspiration for all lid types except for vs and bc where infiltration was prominent the larger evapotranspiration for gr and pp in design c when compared to design b is explained by the larger lid specific storage capacity fig 4 when moving from p1 to p2 the mechanism of stormwater runoff reduction shifted towards infiltration for all lid types except for gr and vs due to the reduced evapotranspiration during colder months stormwater runoff reduction for vs was infiltration dominated in both periods and for gr resulted solely from evapotranspiration due to the lack of infiltration capacity since the area of lids upstream of vs increased from design a to c the stormwater inflow to vs decreased leaving less water for infiltration the extent to which stormwater runoff reduction by alternative stormwater management designs at catchment scale restores the natural hydrological behaviour was studied by comparing runoff coefficients table 5 and cumulative plots of runoff depths at the outlets of the kirstinpuisto catchment and the two reference watersheds fig 7 stormwater runoff coefficients decreased from designs a to b to c for both summer p1 and autumn p2 periods due to the increasing coverage of lid types facilitating disconnection of the impervious area from the drainage network table 5 during p1 stormwater runoff coefficients for designs b and c closely resembled runoff coefficients of the semi urban and rural reference watersheds respectively however there was no resemblance of runoff coefficients between designs b and c and reference watersheds during p2 interestingly the stormwater runoff coefficient of design a with an imperviousness of 70 was comparable to the runoff coefficient of the semi urban reference watershed with an imperviousness of 24 during p2 the simulated stormwater runoff depths for designs b and c fig 7a accumulated gradually compared to the steep slopes of the measured runoff depths of the reference watersheds during autumn period p2 this was because the amount of water infiltrating into the underlying soil was higher during autumn p2 compared to summer period p1 for designs a c see fig 6a and 6c the infiltrated water did not appear as stormflow in the drainage network for designs a c although in the reference watersheds some of it eventually emerges as streamflow fig 7a however when the sum of the simulated stormwater runoff and infiltration was compared against the measured runoff of the reference watersheds fig 7b the autumn accumulation of the kirstinpuisto catchment also became steeper resembling more the shape of the reference watersheds design c with the largest contribution to evapotranspiration fig 6b and d and lowest imperviousness of 23 produced now an accumulation curve closely resembling the flow dynamics of the reference semi urban watershed with an imperviousness of 24 fig 7b adopting cumulative runoff plots as a vehicle of comparison rather than the often used flow frequency curves was motivated by the large discrepancy between catchment sizes in kirstinpuisto and reference areas a smaller catchment is more prone to produce small and large runoff values than a larger catchment where baseflow plays a role and there is more lag in the system which would lead to different flow frequency curves merely due to catchment size discrepancies cumulative runoff depth curves fig 7 provide a more robust basis for runoff comparison between differently sized catchments as they integrate runoff values from a longer time rather than focus on snapshots of momentary flow values transition to wet state occurs later in the rural savijoki than in the semi urban kuninkoja watershed this is explained by a higher moisture deficit created by summer evapotranspiration in the former the larger moisture deficit can be seen as a delayed initiation of autumn runoff despite autumn rains and decreasing evapotranspiration groundwater flow was not simulated in this study while activation of the swmm groundwater module could affect the proportions of computed stormwater flow and infiltration there is no reason to assume that the sum of the two would significantly change in fact even the proportions are unlikely to change as swmm groundwater module does not allow lateral movement of groundwater between subcatchments and most of the vegetated areas do not have stormwater pipes which could receive water when groundwater table rises above the drain level 3 3 sensitivity of outflow to lid investment costs fig 8 compares the efficiency of lid types in designs a c to reduce stormwater runoff volume via infiltration and evapotranspiration per unit cost the cost efficiency of lid types is computed according to eq 7 when comparing vs and rg for design a vs was the more cost efficient type at reducing stormwater volume in design b bc was the most cost efficient type although the investment cost for bc was almost twice that of pp table 3 the cost efficiency of bc in reducing stormwater volume was higher because of a higher capture ratio of bc table 4 the cost efficiency of vs with a constant capture ratio of 6 1 in all designs decreases from a to b to c fig 8 due to the increasing percentage of lid coverage upstream of vs table 4 rg having a relatively low capture ratio table 4 but bearing a low investment cost table 3 was the second cost efficient lid type in design b and the most cost efficient lid type in design c results depicting the impact of lid setup on investments costs fig 9 show that for design c there was no runoff from the block subarea used in the analysis fig 3 the entire block generated a small amount of runoff 26 mm originating mainly from the southern bank of the swale it is evident that design c blue square in fig 9 was overly intensive as negligible runoff was also achieved with a design alternative having a smaller number of lid units and bearing a lower investment cost e g brown square in fig 9 the large jump in the runoff reduction between ellipses e1 and e2 fig 9 was attributed to the activation of pp numbered 4 and rg numbered 2 fig 3 these two structures alone provided a cost efficient setup by greatly reducing runoff at a modest additional cost magenta square in fig 9 the pronounced role of these units is explained by their large treatment area i e the sum of their own area and the contributing area the rain garden has a large capture ratio of 6 6 while its own area is relatively small 80 m2 the permeable pavement has a large area 1420 m2 and a capture ratio of 2 1 the combined treatment area for these two units is 5800 m2 which is 42 of the area used in the sensitivity analysis 4 discussion 4 1 storage capacity and dynamics the static storage approach fig 4 eqs 2 and 3 serves as a simple performance evaluation criterion that can be easily discerned already during the design phase from the physical characteristics and areal coverage of lid structures this approach was adopted in several earlier studies to evaluate the performance of lid types in reducing peak flow runoff volume and occurrence of flooding guan et al 2015a qin et al 2013 walsh et al 2014 however lid designs based on static storage capacity can overestimate the retention capacity at the onset of a rain event because the initial volume of water stored in lid structures is not accounted for in contrast to the static storage approach the dynamic storage approach involving continuous simulations over several months provided information to understand the inter event restoration of lid storage capacity through stormwater losses as can be seen from storage exceedance curves fig 4 the amount of available storage can be significantly smaller than the capacity for prolonged periods and for some lid types the capacity is occasionally exceeded on the other hand despite the fact that the available storage is smaller than the capacity for nearly all lid types the state of the dynamic storage is most of the time well below the static capacity modelling is one way to explore whether planned lid dimensions dictating the static storage capacity are sufficient but not excessive jia et al 2012 studied lid designs for the beijing olympic village and suggested decreased dimensions for lid structures after optimization when compared to initial designs the results of long term swmm simulations depicted how storage capacity recovery of lid types was highly influenced by the seasonal differences in weather controlling infiltration and evapotranspiration rates swmm lid module however has been shown to suffer from uncertainties in describing the storage recovery platz et al 2020 found out that particularly for deep lid types swmm was prone to underestimate outflow due to its inability to account for lateral flow into the soil at the sides of the structure baek et al 2020 coupled swmm with hydrus 1d model which lead to improved accuracy in simulation of green roof soil moisture and outflow from an urban catchment despite these inherent uncertainties in swmm lid module it still represents the state of the art that has been widely adopted by researchers and environmental consultants 4 2 restoring natural hydrological behaviour the sum of computed stormwater runoff and infiltration resembled more closely the reference watershed flow measurements fig 7b than the computed stormwater runoff alone fig 7a evidently runoff in streams draining urban areas has been conveyed either via the fast responding stormwater drainage network or through a slower soil water route the split between these two routes is affected by the connectivity of urban surfaces with the pipe network and by the season these findings are consistent with the results presented by walsh et al 2012 and bonneau et al 2018 the former reported decreased baseflow in receiving urban streams for conventionally drained urban areas in comparison with areas with informal drainage to adjacent permeable areas the latter noticed distinct seasonality with a higher share of infiltrated stormwater reaching an urban stream over the autumn season consequently the results of this study support the view that it is arguable how restoration of the natural flow regime can be evaluated using only stormwater network measurements when the goal is to mimic the undeveloped flow regime care needs to be taken when designing lid types restoring hydrological regime of an urban area requires bringing the evapotranspiration rates back to the undeveloped conditions design c in figs 6 and 7b otherwise there can even be the risk to overcompensate by increasing the amount of infiltration and hence baseflow to exceed the undeveloped state by reducing evapotranspiration and conveying stormwater from impervious surfaces to infiltration based lid structures bhaskar et al 2016 4 3 sensitivity of outflow to lid investment costs results presented here showed that the capture ratio i e the ratio of the contributing area to the area covered by an lid type the recovery rate of storage capacity the associated investment costs and the percentage of upstream lid coverage were essential in defining the cost efficiency of an lid type bioretention cell bc with the largest capture ratio followed by rain garden rg with the smallest associated investment costs and permeable pavement pp in design b with the highest storage capacity were the most cost efficient lid types fig 8 the cost efficiency of the vegetated swale at the downstream end of the treatment train decreased with the increasing upstream lid coverage this is neither visible for rain garden nor for green roofs gr rg areas are mostly located on the southern bank of the swale with no contributing upstream area and green roofs are at the upstream end of the treatment train with no contributing area while gr has a relatively modest cost efficiency compared to other structures it is worth noting that gr can be a viable type in densely constructed areas where space is limiting construction of other types of lid structures hamouz et al 2020 huang et al 2018 identified gr along with bc as the main components in their cost benefit analysis for the optimal design to mitigate urban flooding in taipei investigation of the lid impacts on streamflow when alternatively activating and deactivating lid units revealed the most efficient units within the study region activating the two most influential lid units having a high storage capacity and a capture ratio one permeable pavement storage capacity 28 mm and one rain garden capture ratio 6 6 lead to a drastic drop in stormwater outflow with a relatively low investment cost fig 9 from the tested designs a b and c the most intensive design c is overly intensive as the same impact on stormwater outflow could be achieved at a considerably lower cost jia et al 2012 reported decreased dimensions for lid structures following an optimization with regard to lid costs the results showed that a treatment train requiring the minimal cost i e design a was not the most cost efficient fig 8 because runoff reduction was the smallest fig 7 in addition the large capture ratios of lid types in design a may result in high inflows leading to clogging and increased operation costs cost evaluation throughout the lifecycle including operation and maintenance costs is evidently essential liu et al 2014 however earlier cost efficiency studies based on realistic construction operation and maintenance costs for lid types have shown inconsistent results due to differences in local contexts system designs and analysis boundaries e g bixler et al 2020 chui et al 2016 the operation and maintenance costs omc are further affected by the assumed lifespan of the lid types the assumed average lifespan of lid types varies between 15 years huang et al 2018 and 50 years ossa moreno et al 2017 with 30 year being the commonly used average lifespan chui et al 2016 this results in omc estimations ranging from 1 5 of the initial investment costs joshi et al 2021 up to 19 houle et al 2013 while a comprehensive lifecycle cost evaluation would be optimal it is clearly complex case specific and poorly transferable to other regions and therefore outside the scope of this research this study focused on investment costs for decreasing stormwater flow volumes using combinations of lid types yang and chui 2018 applied a large set of swmm simulations to optimize areal coverage of bioretention cells bc and their capture areas in addition to reducing runoff volume they included the decrease of peak flow and the first flush flow volume as optimization criteria the most efficient bc designs were efficient for flow volume control but the efficiency varied for reducing intensive peak flows results from yang and chui 2018 and from the current study suggest that with a moderate coverage of critical lid types a part of the natural retention and detention functions can be restored when evaluated in terms of the flow volume control 5 conclusions to facilitate the adoption of lid types it is necessary to provide methods for their quantitative performance evaluation this study highlights that dynamic performance evaluation based on long term simulations conducted already during the design phase can prove essential in assessing efficiencies of lid types dynamic lid storage assessment in contrast to the static storage approach accounts for infiltration and evapotranspiration fluxes and incorporates storage restoration rate into the lid performance evaluation the main benefit of the dynamic storage approach is the realistic estimation of runoff volume reduction via infiltration and evapotranspiration compared to dimensioning lid structures using the size of the static storage alone the static storage approach can lead to non optimal lid dimensioning which was seen as too large capacities for most lid types in this study to improve the design of lid types it is important to incorporate storage restoration rate in the design process through continuous simulations extending over several months the simulations together with reference data enable comparing the resemblance of the flow regime of the constructed area to its more natural counterparts in small urban catchments use of stormflow alone can be misleading when comparing the flow regime to the undeveloped state infiltrated water can also eventually emerge as a flow in the receiving stream without ever entering the stormwater drainage network simple comparison of the volume of piped stormflow with volume of gauged natural streamflow can lead to misleading results the main benefit of arranging lid types in a treatment train is the augmented stormwater volume reduction facilitated by efficient utilization of the available storage capacity as overflowing water from one lid unit is treated by the next unit in the chain a treatment train with either a small storage capacity or a small capture ratio can have a limited stormwater reduction resulting in lower cost efficiency compared to the train where storage capacity and capture ratio are in balance an extensive simulation of a large set of differently placed lid units within a treatment train provides an attractive way to identify those critical units that yield the most cost efficient lid design credit authorship contribution statement ambika khadka conceptualization methodology software

4229,the goal of low impact development lid is to restore and maintain the pre development flow regime the static storage capacity which is often used as a parameter in lid designs provides the maximum capacity of an lid type and is easily quantifiable already at the design phase however the static storage approach does not consider the inter event recovery of storage capacity by infiltration and evapotranspiration this study investigated dynamic storage capacities of three stormwater management designs with increasing proportions of lid units on a 1 2 ha urban residential block in southern finland to compare their cost efficiency as well as their potential in restoring the pre development flow regime the cost efficiency of lid designs was assessed based on their ability to contribute to water losses and on the additional construction costs required when comparing them to conventional solutions e g asphalt replaced with permeable pavement the design with a small storage capacity and a large capture ratio i e the ratio of contributing area to lid area was the least efficient albeit its small construction cost the design with an appropriate balance between the capture ratio and the lid provided storage capacity was the most efficient option in assessing the potential of stormwater designs in restoring the pre development flow regime the sum of infiltration and flow in storm sewer networks was more representative of the catchment total runoff than flow alone finally an extensive simulation of a large set of differently placed lid units proved useful in a priori identification of the most influential units in the treatment train keywords storage capacity pre development flow regime performance efficiency 1 introduction urbanized catchments with a large fraction of impervious cover drastically disrupt the natural flow dynamics compared with undisturbed catchments guan et al 2015b sillanpää 2013 the hydrological impacts of urbanization have globally become a major management concern for cities motivation for stormwater management is the need to restore a part of those natural hydrological functions that were lost by construction of impervious and nearly impervious surfaces and efficient stormwater drainage and conveyance systems accordingly there is an increasing interest towards economically and hydrologically efficient approaches to manage stormflow with low impact development lid solutions lid types that enhance infiltration evapotranspiration and storage of stormwater have become increasingly popular in landscape architectural designs and urban planning due to their potential to mimic natural hydrological processes the current design guidelines for lid types are mostly based on the static storage capacity i e surface storage volume and soil media void space volume which are dimensioned according to the rainfall intensity for a design storm or a short term event ebrahimian et al 2019 in areas where precipitation intensities are moderate and back to back storms are rare this approach may lead to over dimensioning of lid systems traver and ebrahimian 2017 although the benefits of lid provided static storage capacity in reducing peak flows and volumes of stormflow have been studied haghighatafshar et al 2018 walsh et al 2014 the role of stormwater losses during inter event dry periods in restoring the capacity of lid systems to store stormwater for the next rainfall event has received limited attention accordingly there is a need for continuous simulation of lid systems to assess the role of stormwater losses via dynamic processes i e infiltration and evapotranspiration landscape architectural design procedure would benefit from hydrological information that is rarely available for a design site but can be produced with stormwater models to support design of various lid alternatives a substantial body of research has focused on short term hydrological performance at an individual lid level e g jia et al 2012 qin et al 2013 or for a combination of lid types e g guan et al 2015a haghighatafshar et al 2018 optimization studies to assess the cost efficiency of individual lid units based on design storms also exist e g jia et al 2012 chui et al 2016 however stormwater management designs which involve several different lid types arranged in a treatment train can be particularly efficient for newly developed areas where design of lid networks can be included already in the development plan jefferson et al 2017 the combinations of lid types have been reported to be economically and hydrologically more efficient than individual lid types e g joksimovic alam 2014 leimgruber et al 2019 however understanding the mechanisms that enable serially connected lid types to achieve better economic benefits compared to individual types have received limited attention evidently a model based assessment of design alternatives is an attractive option to quantify the mechanisms and compare the hydrological and cost performance of the solutions modelling also offers the means to generate a large set of lid design alternatives to reveal where the key lid units are located in the treatment train this study was motivated by the need to explore the extent to which a range of lid designs can control urban water balance and restore natural behaviour of an urban constructed area the study explores how long term dynamic evolution of the lid provided storage controls water losses and stormwater generation at a block scale and what the relationship between lid performance and their construction costs is across design alternatives the assessment was based on a model based analysis of lid designs that were outlined by a landscape architect and on a large set of automatically generated lid combinations the modelling application was targeted into an urban block for detecting lid performance and constructions costs in detail in addition the response of urban catchment to rainfall for alternative stormwater management designs was compared against available measured runoff depths from rural watersheds within the study region the simulations were carried out for summer may to august and autumn september to november periods to detect seasonal differences in the performance of alternative stormwater management designs the study objectives were 1 to evaluate static and dynamic storage provided by lid designs and reveal the role of storage recovery during summer and autumn periods with changing evaporative losses 2 to quantify lid impacts on stormwater losses for alternative designs and to assess the potential of urban stormwater management designs in restoring the natural runoff regime 3 to explore relationship between hydrological performance and construction costs of lid designs using a large set of automatically generated combinations of lid types 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and data the study area is located at the southwestern coast of finland fig 1 c comprising three sites with different land use distributions and scales ranging from one hectare to hundreds of square kilometers the urban kirstinpuisto site 14 8 ha is located in the city of turku at the border of kuninkoja and aurajoki watersheds fig 1a b although the kirstinpuisto site comprises two catchments with separate stormwater drainage outlets it will be referred as the kirstinpuisto catchment hereafter fig 1a rainfall data at a one minute resolution from the city of turku operated weather station 1 5 km northeast of the kirstinpuisto catchment was available for a seven month period from may to november 2012 table 1 the summer period from may to august p1 ended with an intensive rain event having a return period of ca 100 years the autumn period from september to november p2 included another significant rain event with a return period of ca 30 years outlets of a rural stream savijoki and a semi urban stream kuninkoja define the reference watersheds fig 1b savijoki is a tributary of the aurajoki river fig 1b the savijoki watershed has an area of 130 km2 50 of which is covered by agricultural land 46 by forest and other vegetation and the remaining 3 by urban fabrics corine 2018 the total imperviousness of savijoki watershed is 1 eea 2018 the discharge data for the rural savijoki watershed was obtained from the stream monitoring station operated by the finnish environment institute table 1 fig 1b kuninkoja is a semi urban watershed with an area of 33 km2 urban fabrics cover 68 of the watershed area forest and urban greens 26 of the area and the remaining 6 is agricultural land corine 2018 the total imperviousness of kuninkoja is 24 the discharge data for the semi urban kuninkoja watershed was obtained from the monitoring station operated by the turku university of applied sciences table 1 fig 1b 2 2 swmm parameterization the stormwater management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 is a widely used tool to simulate urban water balance components i e surface runoff flooding infiltration and evapotranspiration avellaneda et al 2017 khadka et al 2019 the model can also simulate lid structures where each lid type is represented with a combination of vertical layers such as surface layer or pavement soil layer and storage layer fig 2 parameterization of the three alternative stormwater management designs with an increasing intensity of lid units was based on a previously calibrated swmm model for the kirstinpuisto catchment the calibrated imperviousness fraction manning s roughness and depression storage parameters for paved surface gravelled surface roofs and train tracks used in this study can be found in table 4 in khadka et al 2019 infiltration was modelled using the green ampt equation for lid types with vertical layers fig 2 the water lost from the storage layer to the underlying soil layer forms the infiltration component in the water balance the exchange of groundwater with the drainage network was not modelled the initial moisture condition at the beginning of p1 was considered to be equal to the wilting point moisture content of the soil layer whereas the initial condition for p2 was set according to the end of period storage values of p1 the vegetated areas within the kirstinpuisto catchment were parameterized with the aim to realistically produce the division of losses into evapotranspiration and infiltration the existing vegetation in the kirstinpuisto catchment was described as a rain garden with a 60 vegetation coverage on a 60 cm of underlying clay soil and a 3 cm surface layer to represent urban herbaceous plants tahvonen 2018 manning s roughness of the surface layer and infiltration parameters of the green ampt equation i e hydraulic conductivity conductivity slope and suction head of the soil layer table 2 were adjusted so that the simulated green area evapotranspiration values match with values reported for agricultural and peatland forest catchments in turunen 2017 and sarkkola et al 2013 a residential block of 1 2 ha was extracted from the kirstinpuisto catchment for a detailed analysis of the stormwater management designs at the block scale figs 2 and 3 the block offers a computationally economic way to evaluate the performance of lid types arranged in a treatment train without the need to simulate the entire catchment an urban area can be considered as a collection of blocks so examining the hydrological behaviour of one block yields results that are indicative of the behaviour of a larger urban development in design a the block consisted of six 4 6 storey apartment buildings stone paved yards and an asphalt parking space adjacent to green elements i e a vegetated swale and a rain garden fig 3 in stormwater management designs b and c more lid types were added to supplement the vegetated swale of design a 2 3 lid cost estimation the investment costs including materials and works of each lid type table 3 were estimated according to german design guidelines dwa 2014 cost estimation frameworks manfred 2012 and implementation guidelines for lid types behörde für stadtentwicklung und umwelt freie und hansestadt hamburg 2006 these sources consider design and construction requirements set by the german institute for standardization in a newly developed area either an lid type or its conventional counterpart can be implemented i e a permeable pavement or a bioretention cell instead of asphalt and a green roof instead of a conventional flat roof however the property developers are still hesitant to choose lid types over conventional solutions due to their concerns for higher initial investment costs and uncertain efficiencies thus this study estimated the cost of lid types per unit area as the additional cost of implementing lid types instead of their conventional counterparts based on initial investment costs table 3 operational and maintenance costs were excluded from the cost estimation as they are highly site specific and poorly transferable to other regions the cost of underlying land was also ignored as it would not affect the cost difference between lid and conventional structures the cost difference between an lid type and a conventional solution is referred to as investment cost hereafter 2 4 performance evaluation 2 4 1 storage capacity and dynamics stormwater management designs a c were assessed for their maximum capacity to store stormwater in lid structures storage capacity m tot was computed using eqs 1 3 based on the physical characteristics of the vertical layers in each lid type fig 2 1 d i z 1 θ 1 z 2 θ 2 θ r z 3 θ 3 2 m i d i a i a 3 m tot i 1 n m i where d i is the storage depth of an lid type i in water column depth mm z 1 z 2 and z 3 are the depths of surface soil and storage layers mm respectively θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are the porosities of the surface soil and storage layers θ r is the wilting point in the soil layer m i is the lid specific storage capacity for an lid type i for the residential block mm a i is the surface area of an lid type i m2 a is the total surface area of the residential block m2 and n is the total number of lid types in order to present the dynamic aspect of the lid specific storage capacity the time series and the exceedance frequency of storage in lid types during the 7 month simulation period for designs a c were visualised depth of stormwater stored in an lid type i at time t s i t was computed from the simulated water balance components as follows 4 s i t s i t 1 δ t f i t e i t i i t r i t a i a where s i t 1 is the storage state of an lid type i at time t 1 mm f i t is the inflow from the contributing area of an lid type i at time t

δ t is the time step min when assessing the storage behaviour of the alternative designs at the block scale the contributing area for each lid type i was also considered to account for the fact that it is not merely the water column storage depth d i eq 1 that determines the lid efficiency the contributing area a c i was defined by tracing the drainage network upstream from the subcatchment with an lid unit capture ratio of an lid type i c r i and capture ratio of stormwater management designs a c c r t o t at residential block scale were computed using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 c r i a c i

individual lid types and for the residential block the losses were studied separately for periods p1 and p2 to detect seasonal differences in addition the extent to which stormwater management at kirstinpuisto catchment can help in restoring the natural hydrological behaviour was assessed by comparing runoff coefficients and model simulation results with flow measurements from two reference watersheds for the 7 month simulation period including p1 and p2 periods for the kirstinpuisto catchment stormwater runoff was computed as the sum of simulated stormflow at the two outlets of the drainage network divided by the catchment areas for the reference watersheds runoff means measured streamflow divided by the watershed area in the reference watersheds including the semi urban reference watershed runoff therefore refers to flow in a stream or in an urban brook but not in the piped network the runoff coefficient is the ratio of runoff depth to rainfall depth 2 4 3 sensitivity of outflow to lid investment costs the cost efficiency of different lid types was expressed as stormwater runoff volume reduction per additional investment cost defined as 7 e c i t 1 t e i t i i t δ t a i i where e c i l is the cost efficiency and the water balance components are the same as defined in eq 4 and i is the investment cost for lid type i sensitivity of stormwater outflow to investment costs associated with different lid setups was assessed by conducting model simulations for all possible lid combinations of either activating or deactivating planned lid units pp gr and rg in design c the subarea delineated by a red line in fig 3 was used for the sensitivity analysis this resulted in 2 048 different lid combinations vs was not included in the analysis as it serves as the conveyance structure directing stormwater away from the block area in all designs ideally one would sample all possible combinations for the entire block but this would have led to 262 143 model runs which was deemed infeasible due to the computational burden 3 results 3 1 storage capacity and dynamics the block charts in fig 4 depict the lid specific storage capacity m i computed using eq 2 for all lid types in the alternative stormwater management designs a c at the residential block m i indicates the maximum capacity of an lid type i to store stormwater without consideration for the decreasing storage volume due to recharge from precipitation or for the inter event recovery of the storage volume pp covering almost the same area as rg in design b fig 3 had three times larger specific storage capacity fig 4 which was facilitated by the larger water column depth d i in design c pp with 7 smaller areal coverage had three times larger storage capacity than gr fig 4 shows the exceedance frequency for the dynamic storage eq 4 during the seven month simulation period the gr storage capacity was exhausted for ca 20 of the time for other lid structures exhaustion of storage capacity occurred only for very short time periods vs and rg for design a rg bc and pp for design b and rg for design c or not at all vs for design b and vs and pp for design c in fact for most lid types the state of the dynamic storage remained predominantly well below the static capacity fig 4 also reveals a clear change in the storage dynamics of pp between designs b and c which can be attributed to the increase in capture ratio from design b to c table 4 and a consequent increase in stormwater inflow to pp regardless of the same capture ratio vs had different maximum dynamic storage values for designs a c due to the difference in the percentage of upstream lid coverage table 4 for design a vs demonstrated quick storage and inter event recovery responses fig 5 a b consistently storing and losing stormwater within about 15 h rg had a much slower storage and inter event recovery responses compared to vs eventually returning to the wilting point moisture content during p1 however storage did not recover to the wilting point moisture content in p2 due to the reduced evapotranspiration rate in the autumn fig 5a the storage capacities of vs and rg were completely depleted in design a at the end of p1 fig 5b bc gr and pp in design b as well as rg and gr in design c exhausted their storage capacities after the intense event occurring at the end of p1 fig 5d and f however pp still had about 39 mm of the 70 mm specific storage capacity m i remaining at the end of p1 in design c figs 4 and 5e gr and pp in design c demonstrated similar storage and inter event recovery responses prior to a significant rain event in early october fig 5e however after the early october event the responses for gr and pp were different primarily due to the lack of infiltration in the former and initiation of infiltration from the storage layer in the latter before october in design c stormwater in pp was mostly stored in soil layer and lost to evapotranspiration as suggested by the receding limbs with slow depletion rates fig 5e this was also the case in design b with less storage capacity in pp until the intense end of august event during which infiltration was initiated fig 5c gr remained close to saturation for both designs b and c during p2 as evapotranspiration was reduced during colder months fig 5c and e 3 2 restoring natural hydrological behaviour fig 6 shows the stormwater runoff depth reduction by lid types due to infiltration and evapotranspiration for p1 and p2 at the residential block scale in p1 stormwater runoff reduction was dominated by evapotranspiration for all lid types except for vs and bc where infiltration was prominent the larger evapotranspiration for gr and pp in design c when compared to design b is explained by the larger lid specific storage capacity fig 4 when moving from p1 to p2 the mechanism of stormwater runoff reduction shifted towards infiltration for all lid types except for gr and vs due to the reduced evapotranspiration during colder months stormwater runoff reduction for vs was infiltration dominated in both periods and for gr resulted solely from evapotranspiration due to the lack of infiltration capacity since the area of lids upstream of vs increased from design a to c the stormwater inflow to vs decreased leaving less water for infiltration the extent to which stormwater runoff reduction by alternative stormwater management designs at catchment scale restores the natural hydrological behaviour was studied by comparing runoff coefficients table 5 and cumulative plots of runoff depths at the outlets of the kirstinpuisto catchment and the two reference watersheds fig 7 stormwater runoff coefficients decreased from designs a to b to c for both summer p1 and autumn p2 periods due to the increasing coverage of lid types facilitating disconnection of the impervious area from the drainage network table 5 during p1 stormwater runoff coefficients for designs b and c closely resembled runoff coefficients of the semi urban and rural reference watersheds respectively however there was no resemblance of runoff coefficients between designs b and c and reference watersheds during p2 interestingly the stormwater runoff coefficient of design a with an imperviousness of 70 was comparable to the runoff coefficient of the semi urban reference watershed with an imperviousness of 24 during p2 the simulated stormwater runoff depths for designs b and c fig 7a accumulated gradually compared to the steep slopes of the measured runoff depths of the reference watersheds during autumn period p2 this was because the amount of water infiltrating into the underlying soil was higher during autumn p2 compared to summer period p1 for designs a c see fig 6a and 6c the infiltrated water did not appear as stormflow in the drainage network for designs a c although in the reference watersheds some of it eventually emerges as streamflow fig 7a however when the sum of the simulated stormwater runoff and infiltration was compared against the measured runoff of the reference watersheds fig 7b the autumn accumulation of the kirstinpuisto catchment also became steeper resembling more the shape of the reference watersheds design c with the largest contribution to evapotranspiration fig 6b and d and lowest imperviousness of 23 produced now an accumulation curve closely resembling the flow dynamics of the reference semi urban watershed with an imperviousness of 24 fig 7b adopting cumulative runoff plots as a vehicle of comparison rather than the often used flow frequency curves was motivated by the large discrepancy between catchment sizes in kirstinpuisto and reference areas a smaller catchment is more prone to produce small and large runoff values than a larger catchment where baseflow plays a role and there is more lag in the system which would lead to different flow frequency curves merely due to catchment size discrepancies cumulative runoff depth curves fig 7 provide a more robust basis for runoff comparison between differently sized catchments as they integrate runoff values from a longer time rather than focus on snapshots of momentary flow values transition to wet state occurs later in the rural savijoki than in the semi urban kuninkoja watershed this is explained by a higher moisture deficit created by summer evapotranspiration in the former the larger moisture deficit can be seen as a delayed initiation of autumn runoff despite autumn rains and decreasing evapotranspiration groundwater flow was not simulated in this study while activation of the swmm groundwater module could affect the proportions of computed stormwater flow and infiltration there is no reason to assume that the sum of the two would significantly change in fact even the proportions are unlikely to change as swmm groundwater module does not allow lateral movement of groundwater between subcatchments and most of the vegetated areas do not have stormwater pipes which could receive water when groundwater table rises above the drain level 3 3 sensitivity of outflow to lid investment costs fig 8 compares the efficiency of lid types in designs a c to reduce stormwater runoff volume via infiltration and evapotranspiration per unit cost the cost efficiency of lid types is computed according to eq 7 when comparing vs and rg for design a vs was the more cost efficient type at reducing stormwater volume in design b bc was the most cost efficient type although the investment cost for bc was almost twice that of pp table 3 the cost efficiency of bc in reducing stormwater volume was higher because of a higher capture ratio of bc table 4 the cost efficiency of vs with a constant capture ratio of 6 1 in all designs decreases from a to b to c fig 8 due to the increasing percentage of lid coverage upstream of vs table 4 rg having a relatively low capture ratio table 4 but bearing a low investment cost table 3 was the second cost efficient lid type in design b and the most cost efficient lid type in design c results depicting the impact of lid setup on investments costs fig 9 show that for design c there was no runoff from the block subarea used in the analysis fig 3 the entire block generated a small amount of runoff 26 mm originating mainly from the southern bank of the swale it is evident that design c blue square in fig 9 was overly intensive as negligible runoff was also achieved with a design alternative having a smaller number of lid units and bearing a lower investment cost e g brown square in fig 9 the large jump in the runoff reduction between ellipses e1 and e2 fig 9 was attributed to the activation of pp numbered 4 and rg numbered 2 fig 3 these two structures alone provided a cost efficient setup by greatly reducing runoff at a modest additional cost magenta square in fig 9 the pronounced role of these units is explained by their large treatment area i e the sum of their own area and the contributing area the rain garden has a large capture ratio of 6 6 while its own area is relatively small 80 m2 the permeable pavement has a large area 1420 m2 and a capture ratio of 2 1 the combined treatment area for these two units is 5800 m2 which is 42 of the area used in the sensitivity analysis 4 discussion 4 1 storage capacity and dynamics the static storage approach fig 4 eqs 2 and 3 serves as a simple performance evaluation criterion that can be easily discerned already during the design phase from the physical characteristics and areal coverage of lid structures this approach was adopted in several earlier studies to evaluate the performance of lid types in reducing peak flow runoff volume and occurrence of flooding guan et al 2015a qin et al 2013 walsh et al 2014 however lid designs based on static storage capacity can overestimate the retention capacity at the onset of a rain event because the initial volume of water stored in lid structures is not accounted for in contrast to the static storage approach the dynamic storage approach involving continuous simulations over several months provided information to understand the inter event restoration of lid storage capacity through stormwater losses as can be seen from storage exceedance curves fig 4 the amount of available storage can be significantly smaller than the capacity for prolonged periods and for some lid types the capacity is occasionally exceeded on the other hand despite the fact that the available storage is smaller than the capacity for nearly all lid types the state of the dynamic storage is most of the time well below the static capacity modelling is one way to explore whether planned lid dimensions dictating the static storage capacity are sufficient but not excessive jia et al 2012 studied lid designs for the beijing olympic village and suggested decreased dimensions for lid structures after optimization when compared to initial designs the results of long term swmm simulations depicted how storage capacity recovery of lid types was highly influenced by the seasonal differences in weather controlling infiltration and evapotranspiration rates swmm lid module however has been shown to suffer from uncertainties in describing the storage recovery platz et al 2020 found out that particularly for deep lid types swmm was prone to underestimate outflow due to its inability to account for lateral flow into the soil at the sides of the structure baek et al 2020 coupled swmm with hydrus 1d model which lead to improved accuracy in simulation of green roof soil moisture and outflow from an urban catchment despite these inherent uncertainties in swmm lid module it still represents the state of the art that has been widely adopted by researchers and environmental consultants 4 2 restoring natural hydrological behaviour the sum of computed stormwater runoff and infiltration resembled more closely the reference watershed flow measurements fig 7b than the computed stormwater runoff alone fig 7a evidently runoff in streams draining urban areas has been conveyed either via the fast responding stormwater drainage network or through a slower soil water route the split between these two routes is affected by the connectivity of urban surfaces with the pipe network and by the season these findings are consistent with the results presented by walsh et al 2012 and bonneau et al 2018 the former reported decreased baseflow in receiving urban streams for conventionally drained urban areas in comparison with areas with informal drainage to adjacent permeable areas the latter noticed distinct seasonality with a higher share of infiltrated stormwater reaching an urban stream over the autumn season consequently the results of this study support the view that it is arguable how restoration of the natural flow regime can be evaluated using only stormwater network measurements when the goal is to mimic the undeveloped flow regime care needs to be taken when designing lid types restoring hydrological regime of an urban area requires bringing the evapotranspiration rates back to the undeveloped conditions design c in figs 6 and 7b otherwise there can even be the risk to overcompensate by increasing the amount of infiltration and hence baseflow to exceed the undeveloped state by reducing evapotranspiration and conveying stormwater from impervious surfaces to infiltration based lid structures bhaskar et al 2016 4 3 sensitivity of outflow to lid investment costs results presented here showed that the capture ratio i e the ratio of the contributing area to the area covered by an lid type the recovery rate of storage capacity the associated investment costs and the percentage of upstream lid coverage were essential in defining the cost efficiency of an lid type bioretention cell bc with the largest capture ratio followed by rain garden rg with the smallest associated investment costs and permeable pavement pp in design b with the highest storage capacity were the most cost efficient lid types fig 8 the cost efficiency of the vegetated swale at the downstream end of the treatment train decreased with the increasing upstream lid coverage this is neither visible for rain garden nor for green roofs gr rg areas are mostly located on the southern bank of the swale with no contributing upstream area and green roofs are at the upstream end of the treatment train with no contributing area while gr has a relatively modest cost efficiency compared to other structures it is worth noting that gr can be a viable type in densely constructed areas where space is limiting construction of other types of lid structures hamouz et al 2020 huang et al 2018 identified gr along with bc as the main components in their cost benefit analysis for the optimal design to mitigate urban flooding in taipei investigation of the lid impacts on streamflow when alternatively activating and deactivating lid units revealed the most efficient units within the study region activating the two most influential lid units having a high storage capacity and a capture ratio one permeable pavement storage capacity 28 mm and one rain garden capture ratio 6 6 lead to a drastic drop in stormwater outflow with a relatively low investment cost fig 9 from the tested designs a b and c the most intensive design c is overly intensive as the same impact on stormwater outflow could be achieved at a considerably lower cost jia et al 2012 reported decreased dimensions for lid structures following an optimization with regard to lid costs the results showed that a treatment train requiring the minimal cost i e design a was not the most cost efficient fig 8 because runoff reduction was the smallest fig 7 in addition the large capture ratios of lid types in design a may result in high inflows leading to clogging and increased operation costs cost evaluation throughout the lifecycle including operation and maintenance costs is evidently essential liu et al 2014 however earlier cost efficiency studies based on realistic construction operation and maintenance costs for lid types have shown inconsistent results due to differences in local contexts system designs and analysis boundaries e g bixler et al 2020 chui et al 2016 the operation and maintenance costs omc are further affected by the assumed lifespan of the lid types the assumed average lifespan of lid types varies between 15 years huang et al 2018 and 50 years ossa moreno et al 2017 with 30 year being the commonly used average lifespan chui et al 2016 this results in omc estimations ranging from 1 5 of the initial investment costs joshi et al 2021 up to 19 houle et al 2013 while a comprehensive lifecycle cost evaluation would be optimal it is clearly complex case specific and poorly transferable to other regions and therefore outside the scope of this research this study focused on investment costs for decreasing stormwater flow volumes using combinations of lid types yang and chui 2018 applied a large set of swmm simulations to optimize areal coverage of bioretention cells bc and their capture areas in addition to reducing runoff volume they included the decrease of peak flow and the first flush flow volume as optimization criteria the most efficient bc designs were efficient for flow volume control but the efficiency varied for reducing intensive peak flows results from yang and chui 2018 and from the current study suggest that with a moderate coverage of critical lid types a part of the natural retention and detention functions can be restored when evaluated in terms of the flow volume control 5 conclusions to facilitate the adoption of lid types it is necessary to provide methods for their quantitative performance evaluation this study highlights that dynamic performance evaluation based on long term simulations conducted already during the design phase can prove essential in assessing efficiencies of lid types dynamic lid storage assessment in contrast to the static storage approach accounts for infiltration and evapotranspiration fluxes and incorporates storage restoration rate into the lid performance evaluation the main benefit of the dynamic storage approach is the realistic estimation of runoff volume reduction via infiltration and evapotranspiration compared to dimensioning lid structures using the size of the static storage alone the static storage approach can lead to non optimal lid dimensioning which was seen as too large capacities for most lid types in this study to improve the design of lid types it is important to incorporate storage restoration rate in the design process through continuous simulations extending over several months the simulations together with reference data enable comparing the resemblance of the flow regime of the constructed area to its more natural counterparts in small urban catchments use of stormflow alone can be misleading when comparing the flow regime to the undeveloped state infiltrated water can also eventually emerge as a flow in the receiving stream without ever entering the stormwater drainage network simple comparison of the volume of piped stormflow with volume of gauged natural streamflow can lead to misleading results the main benefit of arranging lid types in a treatment train is the augmented stormwater volume reduction facilitated by efficient utilization of the available storage capacity as overflowing water from one lid unit is treated by the next unit in the chain a treatment train with either a small storage capacity or a small capture ratio can have a limited stormwater reduction resulting in lower cost efficiency compared to the train where storage capacity and capture ratio are in balance an extensive simulation of a large set of differently placed lid units within a treatment train provides an attractive way to identify those critical units that yield the most cost efficient lid design credit authorship contribution statement ambika khadka conceptualization methodology software
