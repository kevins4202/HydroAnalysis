3960,the infiltration process in slopes is an essential issue in geotechnical engineering a new green ampt model for describing the two stage infiltration in slopes based on fractional derivatives was proposed in this paper the green and ampt 1911 s model and chen and young 2006 s model are two special cases of the proposed model a 1d loess soil column test in the literature as well as a laboratory rainfall test of loess slope were used to validate the proposed model the travel curve of wetting front obtained by the proposed model was obviously closer to the actual test value than that obtained by the chen and young s model indicating that the performance of the proposed model is superior to the chen and young s model due to the use of fractional derivatives the proposed green ampt model was combined with a rigorous 3d limit equilibrium method to obtain the real time safety factor of the slope during rainfall the calculated failure time of the loess slope by the proposed method is close to the actual failure time of the laboratory test while the corresponding of chen and young s model is obviously shorter than the actual status six parameters are included in the proposed model and sensitivity analysis shows that the fractional derivative has the most significant impact on the wetting front depth followed by the permeability coefficient moisture content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle keywords green ampt model two stage infiltration slopes fractional derivatives limit equilibrium method 1 introduction the green ampt model proposed by green and ampt 1911 is a conceptually robust physically based mathematical model applied to describe the infiltration process in soils due to its simple principle and computational expediency it has been widely used in a variety of hydrological applications such as infiltration computation in rainfall runoff modelling groundwater transportation modelling and irrigation management studies etc julien et al 1995 golian et al 2010 baiamonte and singh 2015 another important model that reflects the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity based on the green ampt model was proposed by mein and larsen 1973 since the original green ampt method is applicable only for a single ponding period ogden and saghafian 1997 also developed an explicit green and ampt redistribution gar technique to estimate soil water redistribution and allow multiple ponding simulations using the ga method some approximate solutions useful for engineering applications born out of green ampt model were given by barry et al 2005 utilizing the numerical solution to richards equation an improved green ampt model that can consider the effect of the groundwater level was developed by liu et al 2011 considering the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity an explicit solution to the green ampt model was developed by almedeij and esen 2014 the application range of green ampt model was extended from homogeneous to layered soils by deng and zhu 2016 an improved green ampt model considering capillary pressure was proposed by zhang et al 2019 the piston assumption in the original green ampt model simplified the soil moisture distribution thus a new method to modify the green ampt model by the soil infiltration amount was developed by mao et al 2016 the above i e mein and larsen s model liu s model almedeij and esen s model deng and zhu s model zhang s model and mao s model are modified green ampt models based on physical concepts different from the previous studies a fractional form of the green ampt model which introduced a new operation rule was written by voller 2011 and this approach was cited by fernández pato et al 2018 however most of these studies focus on the infiltration in horizontal soils but increasing attention has been poured into the infiltration in slopes which affects the stability of slopes and then leads to geological disasters li et al 2020 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 infiltration processes driven by overlying water in the horizontal soil and slope are shown in fig 1 water flows downward under the action of the gradient difference δh of total energy the sum of elevation energy and matrix potential energy in slopes water cannot pond at the surface due to the inclined topography wu et al 2020 rainfall infiltration can be divided into runoff component and infiltration component perpendicular to the slope surface although water flow in slopes can be obtained by solving richards equation with numerical methods lai and ogden 2015 it is necessary to develop some green ampt models of slopes for simple applications by engineers a modified green ampt model for slopes was proposed by chen and young 2006 the green ampt model has been generally used in conjunction with an infinite slope model 1 dimensional 1d limit equilibrium method lem to calculate the safety factor casagli et al 2006 muntohar and liao 2010 zhang et al 2017 however on the one hand the accuracy of these models has been rarely validated by the testing data from physical rainfall model tests on slopes on the other hand some literatures pachepsky et al 2003 sun et al 2013 have proven that these models with integer order may lead to the overestimation of water infiltration rate in soils cho 2017 directly applied the original green ampt model to slope infiltration analysis although simple enough it completely ignored the effect of gradient difference due to topography on water flow in addition few studies have focused on the application of the green ampt model to 3d slope stability analysis due to the complexity of calculation while actual slopes are usually 3d and there are economic as well as technical advantages in developing a good understanding of 3d effects on slope stability given the above the objective of this paper is to develop a green ampt model considering the two stage infiltration in slopes based on fractional derivatives the proposed model was integrated with the 3d lem to calculate the slope safety factor during rainfall the rest of this paper was organized as follows section 2 is the introduction to the proposed model section 3 is the test validation and application i e combining the proposed model with 3d lem to calculate the safety factor of the slope during rainfall of the proposed model section 4 is the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model section 5 is the discussions the conclusions are drawn in the end 2 methods 2 1 existing green ampt models as shown in fig 1 a the soil profile is divided into a saturated region and an unsaturated region during infiltration the interface between the two regions is called the wetting front the original green ampt infiltration model can be described by an energy diagram illustrated in fig 1 a elevation energy increases linearly with elevation the matric energy is a constant suction value based on soil properties and the matric energy total energy is the sum of matric energy and elevation energy the water infiltration process is mainly driven by gradient difference of total energy δh in the coordinate system shown in fig 1 a based on darcy s law one also has 1 q k s h z where q k s h and z are the water flux saturated permeability coefficient total water head and depth respectively in fig 1 a h z t ψ z where ψ is the suction head at the wetting front soils in the saturated region satisfy the following equations 2 q z k s 2 h z 2 0 h 0 t h 0 h s t ψ s where h 0 and s are the ponding depth in fig 1 a the value of h 0 is negative and the wetting front depth respectively solving equation 2 the following equation can be obtained 3 h z t ψ s h 0 s z h 0 the total amount of infiltration i can be given by 4 i δ θ s where δ θ is the moisture content difference and δ θ θ sat θ i where θ i and θ sat are the natural water content and the saturated water content respectively derivate t at both ends of equation 4 and the infiltration rate f is obtained as follows 5 f di dt δ θ ds dt note that f q substituting equation 5 into equation 1 one has 6 ds dt k s δ θ ψ s h 0 s s 0 0 equation 6 is the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 equation 6 was proposed for horizontal soils and has been most applicable to agricultural irrigation considering a coordinate system shown in fig 1 b substitute h z t ψ z cos γ γ is the slope angle and h s t ψ s cos γ into equations 1 and 2 leads to h z t ψ s cos γ h 0 s z h 0 hence according to the derivation method consistent with equation 6 one has 7 ds dt k s δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s s 0 0 different from equation 6 equation 7 can be used to describe the infiltration in slopes during rainfall the infiltration amount is first determined by rainfall intensity as the rainfall continues the infiltration amount depends on darcy s law this infiltration process was called two stage infiltration mein and larson 1973 the time and depth at which infiltration begins to be controlled by darcy s law are referred to as the critical time and critical depth respectively the infiltration rate f 1 controlled by rainwater is 8 f 1 q rain cos γ where q rain is the rainfall intensity let f 1 q the critical time t p controlled by rainfall and seepage is obtained 9 t p δ θ ψ h 0 cos γ 2 q rain q rain k s 1 therefore an infiltration model can be written as 10 s q rain cos γ t t t p ds dt k s δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s t t p s t p q rain cos γ t p equation 10 is the chen and young 2006 s model equation 10 has an explicit solution 11a t s q rain cos γ s q rain cos γ t p t t p a 1 a 2 t t p where 11b a 1 δ θ s q rain cos γ t p k s cos γ a 2 δ θ h 0 ψ ln ψ h 0 z cos γ ψ h 0 q rain cos γ 2 t p k s cos γ 2 2 2 proposed model hansbo 1960 first referred to the phenomenon of seepage inconsistent with darcy s law in soils as non darcian flow and proposed a theoretical model dubin and moulin 1986 proved the existence of non darcian seepage in soils through experiments due to the multifractal nature of soils allaire et al 2009 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 moisture transport in soils exhibits anomalous diffusion behaviors which can be achieved through the use of fractional derivatives voller 2011 hence according to equation 1 a similar mathematical expression can be written as 12 q k α d z α h where k α is a parameter similar to the saturated permeability coefficient note that unlike k s the dimension of k α should be lengh t α time d z α is the caputo derivative symbol agarwal et al 2017 equation 12 shows that in the saturated region the relationship between the water flux unit area q and the head is not linear in the saturated region we have 13 q z k s z d z α h 0 h 0 t h 0 h s t ψ s equation 13 can be solved as 14 h z t ψ s h 0 s α z α h 0 according to the same process as the derivation of equation 6 an infiltration model can be expressed as 15 ds dt γ α 1 k α δ θ ψ s h 0 s α s 0 0 where γ is the gamma function agarwal et al 2017 equation 15 is a fractional form of the green ampt model voller 2011 however this model was limited to horizontal soils and did not consider the two stage infiltration in unsaturated soils according to the same process as the derivation of equation 7 a fractional form of the green ampt model for slopes can be expressed as 16 ds dt γ α 1 k α δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s α s 0 0 considering the two stage infiltration based on the same process as the derivation of equation 9 the expression of the critical time t p can be obtained as 17 k α γ α 1 ψ s h 0 s α q rain cos γ t p s q rain cos γ equation 17 is not an explicit solution and it needs to be solved numerically according to the same process as the derivation of equation 10 one has 18 s q rain cos γ t t t p ds dt γ α 1 k α δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s α t t p s t p q rain cos γ t p equation 18 is the green ampt model based on fractional derivatives proposed in this paper which considers the two stage infiltration in slopes in the derivations of equations 15 16 and 18 the following calculation rule is used diethelm 2010 19 d z α z j 0 j 0 γ j 1 γ j 1 α z j α o t h e r note that water cannot pond at the slope surface due to the inclined topography when applying the proposed model equations 7 10 16 and 18 h 0 0 should be set 3 test validations and applications 3 1 test validations in order to validate the proposed model two cases were adopted one was the 1d loess soil column test in qin et al 2017 the other was the laboratory test for loess slopes 3 1 1 1d loess soil column test in qin et al 2017 the 1d loess soil column test taken by qin et al 2017 was used to validate the proposed model in comparison with the chen and young s model the reason that we chose the chen and young s model is because it is one of the most commonly used models for describing water infiltration in slopes under uniform rainfall conditions subbaiah 2013 fig 2 is the schematic diagram of test device an organic glass tube with an outer diameter of 120 mm an inner diameter of 100 mm and a length of 1000 mm was used to make the vertical soil column according to the designed dry density the loess was weighed and compacted layer by layer the thickness of each layer is 50 mm the data acquisition system consisted of mp406 soil moisture sensors and dt80 data acquisition instrument artificially controlled water weight and time interval were used to simulate the designed rainfall intensity and then the water was added evenly and slowly to the upper surface of the soil column the time of water arrival was determined by the hydrological response of sensors when the moisture content of different buried depth tends to saturation which can reduce the uncertainty of manual measurement soil column tests with rainfall intensity of 0 02 m h and 0 03 m h were carried out before applying the proposed model the parameters k α and α need to be calibrated therefore one set 0 02 m h was used to determine parameters k α and α and the other set 0 03 m h was used to validate the proposed model the mean absolute percentage error mape was selected to measure the accuracy of models 20 mape t test t cal t test 100 where the subscript test and the subscript cal represent the test value and the calculated value respectively the smaller the mape the higher the accuracy of the model equation 20 was also used to measure the accuracy of models by comparing the test time and the calculated time at the wetting front the reason why accuracy was not measured by the wetting front depth is that according to equations 9 and 10 explicit solutions of time dependent variable and wetting front independent variable can be obtained equation 11 which can simplify the calculation based on the wetting front travel curve at rainfall intensity 0 02 m h k α 0 0054 m α h and α 0 86 fig 3 were obtained and equation 17 was solved by the function ode45 in matlab mathworks 2018 the results of chen and young s model differed from the test values fig 3 this is because in the loess infiltration the actual infiltration coefficient is often smaller than the saturated infiltration coefficient k s is 0 005 m h table 1 which is called the unsaturated infiltration effect wu et al 2018 fig 4 is the comparison of the results between the proposed model and the chen and young s model at the rainfall intensity of 0 03 m h calculation parameters can be found in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the mape of the proposed model is 4 89 while the mape of the chen and young s model is 9 06 hence the proposed model is considered to be superior to the chen and young s model for describing the 1d infiltration although the proposed model does not explicitly consider the unsaturated infiltration effect from the mechanical mechanism the new calculation rule of fractional derivative can obtain results similar to the test values and still has a certain application value 3 1 2 a laboratory test for loess slopes laboratory physical model test is an important approach to study the mechanism of rainfall induced landslides a laboratory test was carried out in the debris flow laboratory of chengdu university of technology to further validate the proposed green ampt model an organic glass box with a length of 240 cm a width of 100 cm a height of 150 cm was made for this test according to the designed dry density the loess was weighed and compacted layer by layer the soil was cut to form a slope with 100 cm height the data acquisition system consisted of ec 5 soil moisture sensors and em50 data acquisition instrument ry2 artificial rainfall simulation system composed of a pressurization unit a spray unit a control unit was used to simulate the designed rainfall intensity this system has a satisfactory performance the coefficient of rainfall uniformity is greater than 0 9 and the measurement error is less than 2 the rainfall intensity of this test was 0 04 m h and the slope angle was 60 a large slope angle was designed to facilitate slope failure due to calculation time saving leica scanstaion2 3d laser scanner was used to observe the deformation of slope surface moisture sensors were arranged parallel to the slope surface more information about soil model and test devices can be seen in fig 5 fig 6 shows the deformation of slope surface observed by 3d laser scanner different from water infiltration in horizontal soil surface erosion caused by water infiltration in slopes is obvious after 95 min of rainfall sporadic cracks gradually appeared in the middle of the slope which were perpendicular to the slope strike and gradually extended to the foot of the slope and slight swelling appeared at the foot of the slope as rainfall continued 234 min the sporadic cracks developed into several vertical cracks widening and lengthening continuously and tensile cracks parallel to the slope strike appeared in the upper part of the slope while obvious uplift appeared at the foot of the slope after 304 min of rainfall the overall sliding failure of the loess slope occurred fig 7 fig 8 shows the comparison for describing the infiltration in the loess slope between the proposed model and the chen and young s model it can be seen that the mape of the proposed model is 5 95 while the mape of the chen and young s model is 11 71 which reflects the superiority of the proposed model note that the contour lines of infiltration depth in the actual slope are not exactly parallel to the slope surface thus the time of water arrival at different depths in this case was determined by the average response time of sensors b c and d profiles parallel to the slope surface 3 2 model applications slope stability analysis is a major issue faced by geological practitioners in this field the factor of safety f s a dimensionless coefficient defined as the ratio of the soil shear strength to the shear stress of a possible sliding surface in the slope is usually used to estimate slope stability when the safety factor is greater than 1 it indicates that the slope is stable otherwise the slope is unstable rainfall infiltration leads to an increase of slope weight triggering landslides here the laboratory rainfall test of the loess slope mentioned above was used as a case for the comparison of failure time between the calculated value by the proposed model and the actual value monitored in the test slope safety factor during rainfall was obtained by combining the green ampt model and the 3d lem see appendix for details substituting the calculation parameters table 2 into equations 18 21 24 the real time of slope safety factor can be obtained fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that with the increase of rainfall time the slope safety factor decreases rapidly when the rainfall duration is about 5 3 h the slope safety factor decreases to 1 the slope is at a limit state the critical failure time calculated is consistent with the actual failure time 304 min monitored in the test it has been stated in introduction that most studies combine the green ampt model with 1 d lem to analyze slope stability these methods have two disadvantages 1 no 1d slope exists in practice 2 even for long slopes the slip surface is usually not flat silvestri 2006 the advantage of these hybrid methods is that an explicit expression of the safety factor can be derived wu et al 2018 the safety factor of the 1d lem the slope in fig 5 was reduced to an infinite slope with 60 slope angle is also reported in fig 9 the results obtained using 1d lem and 3d lem differ greatly 1d lem method underestimated the slope stability although simple enough 1d lem cannot provide an accurate solution the calculated failure time was about 2 2 h which was much shorter than the actual failure time which illustrates that it is necessary to consider 3d effect when evaluating slope stability besides the chen and young s model also underestimated the safety factor of the slope because the unsaturated infiltration effect was not taken into account the calculated failure time was about 3 3 h which was also shorter than the actual failure time 4 sensitivity analysis the single variable method was adopted to study the sensitivity of variables of the proposed green ampt model to wetting front depth the fluctuation range of the variable was limited to plus or minus 20 a rainfall intensity fig 10 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves at the rainfall intensity of 0 016 0 02 and 0 024 m h respectively with the increase of rainfall intensity the wetting front depth increases at the same time which means a faster infiltration process rainfall intensity is positively correlated with the wetting front depth b slope angle fig 11 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the slope angle of 16 20 and 24 respectively at the same time with the increase of the slope the shallower the wetting front the slower the water infiltration the slope is negatively related to the wetting front depth this is because the larger the slope angle is the less water infiltrates into the slope fig 1 b c fractional derivative order fig 12 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the fractional derivative order of 0 688 0 86 and 1 032 at the same time the larger the fractional derivative order the faster the infiltration the fractional derivative is positively correlated with the wetting front d moisture content difference fig 13 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the moisture content difference of 0 184 0 23 and 0 276 at the same time the larger the moisture content difference the smaller the wetting front depth which means a slower infiltration process the moisture content difference is negatively correlated with the wetting front depth this is because the larger the moisture content difference the greater the amount of water required to saturate the slope e suction head fig 14 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the suction head of 0 32 0 4 and 0 48 m at the same time the larger the suction head the larger the wetting front depth which means the faster the water infiltration the suction head is positively correlated with the wetting front f permeability coefficient fig 15 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the permeability coefficient of 0 00432 0 0054 and 0 00648 m α h at the same time with the increase of k α the wetting front depth increases which means a faster infiltration process the permeability coefficient is positively correlated with the wetting front according to zhao et al 2020 the sensitivity s of a variable can be defined as 21 s v δ p p δ v v where v is the variable and δv is the variation of the variable p is the response value of the variable and δp is the variation of the response value the greater the s the more sensitive the parameter according to equation 21 the fractional derivative order has the greatest influence on wetting front depth followed by the permeability coefficient moisture content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle with sensitivity of 0 66 0 64 0 60 0 42 0 18 and 0 15 respectively note that the sensitivity calculated here is the average of the corresponding sensitivity for each discrete point on the curves in figs 10 15 5 discussions a mathematical relations between the proposed green ampt model and the existing models although a set of modified green ampt models have been proposed pointed out in introduction we can compare these models mathematically table 3 lists the expressions of the proposed model and some other existing models for example the original green ampt model was a special case of the proposed model with t p α γ t 0 1 0 t the chen and young model was a special case of the proposed model with α 1 for details see table 3 the remark column in table 3 shows the relationship between the proposed model and the existing models mathematically speaking several existing models including green ampt model and chen and young model are regarded as special cases of the proposed model which is a general model in addition it should be noted that equation 9 indicates the prerequisity for applying the chen and young s model i e q rain k s otherwise a critical time t p will be negative at this time equation 7 should be used for calculation the application condition of the proposed model the solution to equation 17 must be a real number greater than 0 if the condition is not met equation 16 should be used b advantages of the proposed model water flow in slopes is of great significance for landslide prevention and control although the law of water flow in slopes can be obtained by solving richards equation with numerical methods it is still necessary to develop some green ampt models of slopes suitable for simple application by engineers chen and young s model has been widely used but it overestimates the rate of water infiltration in slopes in this paper we compared the performance of the chen and young model and the proposed model with the soil column test by qin et al 2017 and the laboratory rainfall test of loess slope by authors compared with the monitored data the mean absolute percentage error of the proposed model was about twice smaller than that of chen and young s model combining the proposed green ampt model with the 3d limit equilibrium method the real time safety factor of slope during rainfall was obtained the calculated failure time was close to the actual failure time monitored which shows the prospect of the proposed model in the prediction of rainfall induced landslides c future work the disadvantage of the proposed model is that the permeability coefficient and fractional derivative order can only be obtained by the inversion of the wetting front depth vs time curve the determination of model parameters is more complicated than the green ampt model and chen and young s model besides the concept of fractional derivative order may not be easily accepted by engineers however it should be noted that the law of water flow in soils does not completely satisfy darcy s law dubin and moulin 1986 allaire et al 2009 the use of fractional derivative form is one of the effective methods to describe non darcy flow although the proposed model has been combined with 3d lem to calculate the slope safety factor during rainfall the uncertainty of soil mechanical parameters kang et al 2015 kang et al 2017 has not been considered the future study trends to extend the proposed model to a layered slope and combine uncertain methods to calculate the slope failure probability jiang and huang 2018 during rainfall 6 conclusions the following conclusions can be summarized by this paper 1 a new green ampt model for describing the two stage infiltration in slopes based on fractional derivatives was proposed which is a general model when the parameters of the proposed model are taken specific values it can be degraded into several existing models including the green and ampt s model and chen and young s model 2 the permeability coefficient and fractional derivative order in the proposed model was calibrated by the 1d loess soil column test in qin et al 2017 a laboratory rainfall test of loess slope was also carried out to validate the proposed model the test value shows that the accuracy of the proposed model was better than chen and young s model the use of fractional derivatives is one of the effective methods to describe non darcy flow approximately 3 the proposed green ampt model was combined with a rigorous 3d limit equilibrium method to calculate the slope safety factor during rainfall the slope failure time calculated by the proposed method was very close to the test value compared with the chen and young s model which underestimated the slope stability the proposed model improved the calculation accuracy of slope stability 4 there are six parameters in the proposed model fractional derivative order had the most influence on the wetting front depth followed by permeability coefficient moisture content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle 7 data availability all data generated or analyzed during this study are included within the article credit authorship contribution statement

paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 41672282 appendix here the calculation method of slope safety factors during rainfall the combination of the proposed green ampt model and the lem was introduced an idealized slope fig 16 was taken as an example the slip surface was modeled by an elliptic sphere and oxyz represents a spatial coordinate system take a slide block in the slide body the area bounded by the slide surface and the original slope surface the forces exerted on the slide block include block self weight w depending on the unit weight of soilγ g sliding resistance force τ normal force σ from slip surface the wetting front depth in the slide block was determined by the proposed green ampt model it should be noted that in the 3d slope stability analysis the infiltration angle in the sliding body is equal to the slope angle while the infiltration angle at the slope bottom is 0 according to the definition the slope safety factor can be expressed as shen et al 2012 22 τ σ γ w s tan φ c f s where the sliding resistance force of the molecular term is calculated by the two parameters of cohesion c and internal friction angle φ γ w is the weight of water generally 10kn m3 s is the wetting front depth at different times obtained by the proposed green ampt model according to statics bell 1968 a system of equations consisting of three equations should be solved to obtain f s including the force balance equations along the y and z directions and the torque balance equation around the o point for the balance analysis in fig 16 the equations can be written as 23a σ z x τ ω ω 1 d x d y 0 23b σ z x τ ω ω 1 d x d y wdxdy 23c σ z x τ ω ω 1 x d x d y wxdxdy σ z x τ ω ω 1 z d x d y where 24a ω 1 z x 2 z y 2 24b ω 1 1 z x 2 in line with zhu and lee 2002 parameters λ 1 and λ 2 were introduced to transform equation 22 into a solvable statically determinate system f s was finally solved the real time safety factor during rainfall can be obtained by substituting the wetting front depth of equations 18 into equations 22 24 
3960,the infiltration process in slopes is an essential issue in geotechnical engineering a new green ampt model for describing the two stage infiltration in slopes based on fractional derivatives was proposed in this paper the green and ampt 1911 s model and chen and young 2006 s model are two special cases of the proposed model a 1d loess soil column test in the literature as well as a laboratory rainfall test of loess slope were used to validate the proposed model the travel curve of wetting front obtained by the proposed model was obviously closer to the actual test value than that obtained by the chen and young s model indicating that the performance of the proposed model is superior to the chen and young s model due to the use of fractional derivatives the proposed green ampt model was combined with a rigorous 3d limit equilibrium method to obtain the real time safety factor of the slope during rainfall the calculated failure time of the loess slope by the proposed method is close to the actual failure time of the laboratory test while the corresponding of chen and young s model is obviously shorter than the actual status six parameters are included in the proposed model and sensitivity analysis shows that the fractional derivative has the most significant impact on the wetting front depth followed by the permeability coefficient moisture content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle keywords green ampt model two stage infiltration slopes fractional derivatives limit equilibrium method 1 introduction the green ampt model proposed by green and ampt 1911 is a conceptually robust physically based mathematical model applied to describe the infiltration process in soils due to its simple principle and computational expediency it has been widely used in a variety of hydrological applications such as infiltration computation in rainfall runoff modelling groundwater transportation modelling and irrigation management studies etc julien et al 1995 golian et al 2010 baiamonte and singh 2015 another important model that reflects the relationship between rainfall intensity and infiltration capacity based on the green ampt model was proposed by mein and larsen 1973 since the original green ampt method is applicable only for a single ponding period ogden and saghafian 1997 also developed an explicit green and ampt redistribution gar technique to estimate soil water redistribution and allow multiple ponding simulations using the ga method some approximate solutions useful for engineering applications born out of green ampt model were given by barry et al 2005 utilizing the numerical solution to richards equation an improved green ampt model that can consider the effect of the groundwater level was developed by liu et al 2011

original green ampt model simplified the soil moisture distribution thus a new method to modify the green ampt model by the soil infiltration amount was developed by mao et al 2016 the above i e mein and larsen s model liu s model almedeij and esen s model deng and zhu s model zhang s model and mao s model are modified green ampt models based on physical concepts different from the previous studies a fractional form of the green ampt model which introduced a new operation rule was written by voller 2011 and this approach was cited by fernández pato et al 2018 however most of these studies focus on the infiltration in horizontal soils but increasing attention has been poured into the infiltration in slopes which affects the stability of slopes and then leads to geological disasters li et al 2020 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 infiltration processes driven by overlying water in the horizontal soil and slope are shown in fig 1 water flows downward under the action of the gradient difference δh of total energy the sum of elevation energy and matrix potential energy in slopes water cannot pond at the surface due to the inclined topography wu et al 2020 rainfall infiltration can be divided into runoff component and infiltration component perpendicular to the slope surface although water flow in slopes can be obtained by solving richards equation with numerical methods lai and ogden 2015 it is necessary to develop some green ampt models of slopes for simple applications by engineers a modified green ampt model for

safety factor casagli et al 2006 muntohar and liao 2010 zhang et al 2017 however on the one hand the accuracy of these models has been rarely validated by the testing data from physical rainfall model tests on slopes on the other hand some literatures pachepsky et al 2003 sun et al 2013 have proven that these models with integer order may lead to the overestimation of water infiltration rate in soils cho 2017 directly applied the original green ampt model to slope infiltration analysis although simple enough it completely ignored the effect of gradient difference due to topography on water flow in addition few studies have focused on the application of the green ampt model to 3d slope stability analysis due to the complexity of calculation while actual slopes are usually 3d and there are economic as well as technical advantages in developing a good understanding of 3d effects on slope stability given the above the objective of this paper is to develop a green ampt model considering the two stage infiltration in slopes based on fractional derivatives the proposed model was integrated with the 3d lem to calculate the slope safety factor during rainfall the rest of this paper was organized as follows section 2 is the introduction to the proposed model section 3 is the test validation and application i e combining the proposed model with 3d lem to calculate the safety factor of the slope during rainfall of the proposed model section 4 is the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model section 5 is the discussions the conclusions are drawn in the end 2 methods 2 1 existing green ampt models as shown in fig 1 a the soil profile is divided into a saturated region and an unsaturated region during infiltration the interface between the two regions is called the wetting front the original green ampt infiltration model can be described by an energy diagram illustrated in fig 1 a elevation energy increases linearly with elevation the matric energy is a constant suction value based on soil properties and the matric energy total energy is the sum of matric energy and elevation energy the water infiltration process is mainly driven by gradient difference of total energy δh in the coordinate system shown in fig 1 a based on darcy s law one also has 1 q k s h z where q k s h and z are the water flux saturated permeability coefficient total water head and depth respectively in fig 1 a h z t ψ z where ψ is the suction head at the wetting front soils in the saturated region satisfy the following equations 2 q z k s 2 h z 2 0 h 0 t h 0 h s t ψ s where h 0 and s are the ponding depth in fig 1 a the value of h 0 is negative and the wetting front depth respectively solving equation 2 the following equation can be obtained 3 h z t ψ s h 0 s z h 0 the total amount of infiltration i can be given by 4 i δ θ s where δ θ is the moisture content difference and δ θ θ sat θ i where θ i and θ sat are the natural water content and the saturated water content respectively derivate t at both ends of equation 4 and the infiltration rate f is obtained as follows 5 f di dt δ θ ds dt note that f q substituting equation 5 into equation 1 one has 6 ds dt k s δ θ ψ s h 0 s s 0 0 equation 6 is the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 equation 6 was proposed for horizontal soils and has been most applicable to agricultural irrigation considering a coordinate system shown in fig 1 b substitute h z t ψ z cos γ γ is the slope angle and h s t ψ s cos γ into equations 1 and 2 leads to h z t ψ s cos γ h 0 s z h 0 hence according to the derivation method consistent with equation 6 one has 7 ds dt k s δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s s 0 0 different from equation 6 equation 7 can be used to describe the infiltration in slopes during rainfall the infiltration amount is first determined by rainfall intensity as the rainfall continues the infiltration amount depends on darcy s law this infiltration process was called two stage infiltration mein and larson 1973 the time and depth at which infiltration begins to be controlled by darcy s law are referred to as the critical time and critical depth respectively the infiltration rate f 1 controlled by rainwater is 8 f 1 q rain cos γ where q rain is the rainfall intensity let f 1 q the critical time t p controlled by rainfall and seepage is obtained 9 t p δ θ ψ h 0 cos γ 2 q rain q rain k s 1 therefore an infiltration model can be written as 10 s q rain cos γ t t t p ds dt k s δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s t t p s t p q rain cos γ t p equation 10 is the chen and young 2006 s model equation 10 has an explicit solution 11a t s q rain cos γ s q rain cos γ t p t t p a 1 a 2 t t p where 11b a 1 δ θ s q rain cos γ t p k s cos γ a 2 δ θ h 0 ψ ln ψ h 0 z cos γ ψ h 0 q rain cos γ 2 t p k s cos γ 2 2 2 proposed model hansbo 1960 first referred to the phenomenon of seepage inconsistent with darcy s law in soils as non darcian flow and proposed a theoretical model dubin and moulin 1986 proved the existence of non darcian seepage in soils through experiments due to the multifractal nature of soils allaire et al 2009 neuman and tartakovsky 2009 moisture transport in soils exhibits anomalous diffusion behaviors which can be achieved through the use of fractional derivatives voller 2011 hence according to equation 1 a similar mathematical expression can be written as 12 q k α d z α h where k α is a parameter similar to the saturated permeability coefficient note that unlike k s the dimension of k α should be lengh t α time d z α is the caputo derivative symbol agarwal et al 2017 equation 12 shows that in the saturated region the relationship between the water flux unit area q and the head is not linear in the saturated region we have 13 q z k s z d z α h 0 h 0 t h 0 h s t ψ s equation 13 can be solved as 14 h z t ψ s h 0 s α z α h 0 according to the same process as the derivation of equation 6 an infiltration model can be expressed as 15 ds dt γ α 1 k α δ θ ψ s h 0 s α s 0 0 where γ is the gamma function agarwal et al 2017 equation 15 is a fractional form of the green ampt model voller 2011 however this model was limited to horizontal soils and did not consider the two stage infiltration in unsaturated soils according to the same process as the derivation of equation 7 a fractional form of the green ampt model for slopes can be expressed as 16 ds dt γ α 1 k α δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s α s 0 0 considering the two stage infiltration based on the same process as the derivation of equation 9 the expression of the critical time t p can be obtained as 17 k α γ α 1 ψ s h 0 s α q rain cos γ t p s q rain cos γ equation 17 is not an explicit solution and it needs to be solved numerically according to the same process as the derivation of equation 10 one has 18 s q rain cos γ t t t p ds dt γ α 1 k α δ θ ψ s cos γ h 0 s α t t p s t p q rain cos γ t p equation 18 is the green ampt model based on fractional derivatives proposed in this paper which considers the two stage infiltration in slopes in the derivations of equations 15 16 and 18 the following calculation rule is used diethelm 2010 19 d z α z j 0 j 0 γ j 1 γ j 1 α z j α o t h e r note that water cannot pond at the slope surface due to the inclined topography when applying the proposed model equations 7 10 16 and 18 h 0 0 should be set 3 test validations and applications 3 1 test validations in order to validate the proposed model two cases were adopted one was the 1d loess soil column test in qin et al 2017 the other was the laboratory test for loess slopes 3 1 1 1d loess soil column test in qin et al 2017 the 1d loess soil column test taken by qin et al 2017 was used to validate the proposed model in comparison with the chen and young s model the reason that we chose the chen and young s model is because it is one of the most commonly used models for describing water infiltration in slopes under uniform rainfall conditions subbaiah 2013 fig 2 is the schematic diagram of test device an organic glass tube with an outer diameter of 120 mm an inner diameter of 100 mm and a length of 1000 mm was used to make the vertical soil column according to the designed dry density the loess was weighed and compacted layer by layer the thickness of each layer is 50 mm the data acquisition system consisted of mp406 soil moisture sensors and dt80 data acquisition instrument artificially controlled water weight and time interval were used to simulate the designed rainfall intensity and then the water was added evenly and slowly to the upper surface of the soil column the time of water arrival was determined by the hydrological response of sensors when the moisture content of different buried depth tends to saturation which can reduce the uncertainty of manual measurement soil column tests with rainfall intensity of 0 02 m h and 0 03 m h were carried out before applying the proposed model the parameters k α and α need to be calibrated therefore one set 0 02 m h was used to determine parameters k α and α and the other set 0 03 m h was used to validate the proposed model the mean absolute percentage error mape was selected to measure the accuracy of models 20 mape t test t cal t test 100 where the subscript test and the subscript cal represent the test value and the calculated value respectively the smaller the mape the higher the accuracy of the model equation 20 was also used to measure the accuracy of models by comparing the test time and the calculated time at the wetting front the reason why accuracy was not measured by the wetting front depth is that according to equations 9 and 10 explicit solutions of time dependent variable and wetting front independent variable can be obtained equation 11 which can simplify the calculation based on the wetting front travel curve at rainfall intensity 0 02 m h k α 0 0054 m α h and α 0 86 fig 3 were obtained and equation 17 was solved by the function ode45 in matlab mathworks 2018 the results of chen and young s model differed from the test values fig 3 this is because in the loess infiltration the actual infiltration coefficient is often smaller than the saturated infiltration coefficient k s is 0 005 m h table 1 which is called the unsaturated infiltration effect wu et al 2018 fig 4 is the comparison of the results between the proposed model and the chen and young s model at the rainfall intensity of 0 03 m h calculation parameters can be found in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the mape of the proposed model is 4 89 while the mape of the chen and young s model is 9 06 hence the proposed model is considered to be superior to the chen and young s model for describing the 1d infiltration although the proposed model does not explicitly consider the unsaturated infiltration effect from the mechanical mechanism the new calculation rule of fractional derivative can obtain results similar to the test values and still has a certain application value 3 1 2 a laboratory test for loess slopes laboratory physical model test is an important approach to study the mechanism of rainfall induced landslides a laboratory test was carried out in the debris flow laboratory of chengdu university of technology to further validate the proposed green ampt model an organic glass box with a length of 240 cm a width of 100 cm a height of 150 cm was made for this test according to the designed dry density the loess was weighed and compacted layer by layer the soil was cut to form a slope with 100 cm height the data acquisition system consisted of ec 5 soil moisture sensors and em50 data acquisition instrument ry2 artificial rainfall simulation system composed of a pressurization unit a spray unit a control unit was used to simulate the designed rainfall intensity this system has a satisfactory performance the coefficient of rainfall uniformity is greater than 0 9 and the measurement error is less than 2 the rainfall intensity of this test was 0 04 m h and the slope angle was 60 a large slope angle was designed to facilitate slope failure due to calculation time saving leica scanstaion2 3d laser scanner was used to observe the deformation of slope surface moisture sensors were arranged parallel to the slope surface more information about soil model and test devices can be seen in fig 5 fig 6 shows the deformation of slope surface observed by 3d laser scanner different from water infiltration in horizontal soil surface erosion caused by water infiltration in slopes is obvious after 95 min of rainfall sporadic cracks gradually appeared in the middle of the slope which were perpendicular to the slope strike and gradually extended to the foot of the slope and slight swelling appeared at the foot of the slope as rainfall continued 234 min the sporadic cracks developed into several vertical cracks widening and lengthening continuously and tensile cracks parallel to the slope strike appeared in the upper part of the slope while obvious uplift appeared at the foot of the slope after 304 min of rainfall the overall sliding failure of the loess slope occurred fig 7 fig 8 shows the comparison for describing the infiltration in the loess slope between the proposed model and the chen and young s model it can be seen that the mape of the proposed model is 5 95 while the mape of the chen and young s model is 11 71 which reflects the superiority of the proposed model note that the contour lines of infiltration depth in the actual slope are not exactly parallel to the slope surface thus the time of water arrival at different depths in this case was determined by the average response time of sensors b c and d profiles parallel to the slope surface 3 2 model applications slope stability analysis is a major issue faced by geological practitioners in this field the factor of safety f s a dimensionless coefficient defined as the ratio of the soil shear strength to the shear stress of a possible sliding surface in the slope is usually used to estimate slope stability when the safety factor is greater than 1 it indicates that the slope is stable otherwise the slope is unstable rainfall infiltration leads to an increase of slope weight triggering landslides here the laboratory rainfall test of the loess slope mentioned above was used as a case for the comparison of failure time between the calculated value by the proposed model and the actual value monitored in the test slope safety factor during rainfall was obtained by combining the green ampt model and the 3d lem see appendix for details substituting the calculation parameters table 2 into equations 18 21 24 the real time of slope safety factor can be obtained fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that with the increase of rainfall time the slope safety factor decreases rapidly when the rainfall duration is about 5 3 h the slope safety factor decreases to 1 the slope is at a limit state the critical failure time calculated is consistent with the actual failure time 304 min monitored in the test it has been stated in introduction that most studies combine the green ampt model with 1 d lem to analyze slope stability these methods have two disadvantages 1 no 1d slope exists in practice 2 even for long slopes the slip surface is usually not flat silvestri 2006 the advantage of these hybrid methods is that an explicit expression of the safety factor can be derived wu et al 2018 the safety factor of the 1d lem the slope in fig 5 was reduced to an infinite slope with 60 slope angle is also reported in fig 9 the results obtained using 1d lem and 3d lem differ greatly 1d lem method underestimated the slope stability although simple enough 1d lem cannot provide an accurate solution the calculated failure time was about 2 2 h which was much shorter than the actual failure time which illustrates that it is necessary to consider 3d effect when evaluating slope stability besides the chen and young s model also underestimated the safety factor of the slope because the unsaturated infiltration effect was not taken into account the calculated failure time was about 3 3 h which was also shorter than the actual failure time 4 sensitivity analysis the single variable method was adopted to study the sensitivity of variables of the proposed green ampt model to wetting front depth the fluctuation range of the variable was limited to plus or minus 20 a rainfall intensity fig 10 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves at the rainfall intensity of 0 016 0 02 and 0 024 m h respectively with the increase of rainfall intensity the wetting front depth increases at the same time which means a faster infiltration process rainfall intensity is positively correlated with the wetting front depth b slope angle fig 11 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the slope angle of 16 20 and 24 respectively at the same time with the increase of the slope the shallower the wetting front the slower the water infiltration the slope is negatively related to the wetting front depth this is because the larger the slope angle is the less water infiltrates into the slope fig 1 b c fractional derivative order fig 12 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the fractional derivative order of 0 688 0 86 and 1 032 at the same time the larger the fractional derivative order the faster the infiltration the fractional derivative is positively correlated with the wetting front d moisture content difference fig 13 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the moisture content difference of 0 184 0 23 and 0 276 at the same time the larger the moisture content difference the smaller the wetting front depth which means a slower infiltration process the moisture content difference is negatively correlated with the wetting front depth this is because the larger the moisture content difference the greater the amount of water required to saturate the slope e suction head fig 14 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the suction head of 0 32 0 4 and 0 48 m at the same time the larger the suction head the larger the wetting front depth which means the faster the water infiltration the suction head is positively correlated with the wetting front f permeability coefficient fig 15 shows the wetting front depth vs time curves with the permeability coefficient of 0 00432 0 0054 and 0 00648 m α h at the same time with the increase of k α the wetting front depth increases which means a faster infiltration process the permeability coefficient is positively correlated with the wetting front according to zhao et al 2020 the sensitivity s of a variable can be defined as 21 s v δ p p δ v v where v is the variable and δv is the variation of the variable p is the response value of the variable and δp is the variation of the response value the greater the s the more sensitive the parameter according to equation 21 the fractional derivative order has the greatest influence on wetting front depth followed by the permeability coefficient moisture content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle with sensitivity of 0 66 0 64 0 60 0 42 0 18 and 0 15 respectively note that the sensitivity calculated here is the average of the corresponding sensitivity for each discrete point on the curves in figs 10 15 5 discussions a mathematical relations between the proposed green ampt model and the existing models although a set of modified green ampt models have been proposed pointed out in introduction we can compare these models mathematically table 3 lists the expressions of the proposed model and some other existing models for example the original green ampt model was a special case of the proposed model with t p α γ t 0 1 0 t the chen and young model was a special case of the proposed model with α 1 for details see table 3 the remark column in table 3 shows the relationship between the proposed model and the existing models mathematically speaking several existing models including green ampt model and chen and young model are regarded as special cases of the proposed model which is a general model in addition it should be noted that equation 9 indicates the prerequisity for applying the chen and young s model i e q rain k s otherwise a critical time t p will be negative at this time equation 7 should be used for calculation the application condition of the proposed model the solution to equation 17 must be a real number greater than 0 if the condition is not met equation 16 should be used b advantages of the proposed model water flow in slopes is of great significance for landslide prevention and control although the law of water flow in slopes can be obtained by solving richards equation with numerical methods it is still necessary to develop some green ampt models of slopes suitable for simple application by engineers chen and young s model has been widely used but it overestimates the rate of water infiltration in slopes in this paper we compared the performance of the chen and young model and the proposed model with the soil column test by qin et al 2017 and the laboratory rainfall test of loess slope by authors compared with the monitored data the mean absolute percentage error of the proposed model was about twice smaller than that of chen and young s model combining the proposed green ampt model with the 3d limit equilibrium method the real time safety factor of slope during rainfall was obtained the calculated failure time was close to the actual failure time monitored which shows the prospect of the proposed model in the prediction of rainfall induced landslides c future work the disadvantage of the proposed model is that the permeability coefficient and fractional derivative order can only be obtained by the inversion of the wetting front depth vs time curve the determination of model parameters is more complicated than the green ampt model and chen and young s model besides the concept of fractional derivative order may not be easily accepted by engineers however it should be noted that the law of water flow in soils does not completely satisfy darcy s law dubin and moulin 1986 allaire et al 2009 the use of fractional derivative form is one of the effective methods to describe non darcy flow although the proposed model has been combined with 3d lem to calculate the slope safety factor during rainfall the uncertainty of soil mechanical parameters kang et al 2015 kang et al 2017 has not been considered the future study trends to extend the proposed model to a layered slope and combine uncertain methods to calculate the slope failure probability jiang and huang 2018 during rainfall 6 conclusions the following conclusions can be summarized by this paper 1 a new green ampt model for describing the two stage infiltration in slopes based on fractional derivatives was proposed which is a general model when the parameters of the proposed model are taken specific values it can be degraded into several existing models including the green and ampt s model and chen and young s model 2 the permeability coefficient and fractional derivative order in the proposed model was calibrated by the 1d loess soil column test in qin et al 2017 a laboratory rainfall test of loess slope was also carried out to validate the proposed model the test value shows that the accuracy of the proposed model was better than chen and young s model the use of fractional derivatives is one of the effective methods to describe non darcy flow approximately 3 the proposed green ampt model was combined with a rigorous 3d limit equilibrium method to calculate the slope safety factor during rainfall the slope failure time calculated by the proposed method was very close to the test value compared with the chen and young s model which underestimated the slope stability the proposed model improved the calculation accuracy of slope stability 4 there are six parameters in the proposed model fractional derivative order had the most influence on the wetting front depth followed by permeability coefficient moisture content difference suction head rainfall intensity and slope angle 7 data availability all data generated or analyzed during this study are included within the article credit authorship contribution statement

paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 41672282 appendix here the calculation method of slope safety factors during rainfall the combination of the proposed green ampt model and the lem was introduced an idealized slope fig 16 was taken as an example the slip surface was modeled by an elliptic sphere and oxyz represents a spatial coordinate system take a slide block in the slide body the area bounded by the slide surface and the original slope surface the forces exerted on the slide block include block self weight w depending on the unit weight of soilγ g sliding resistance force τ normal force σ from slip surface the wetting front depth in the slide block was determined by the proposed green ampt model it should be noted that in the 3d slope stability analysis the infiltration angle in the sliding body is equal to the slope angle while the infiltration angle at the slope bottom is 0 according to the definition the slope safety factor can be expressed as shen et al 2012 22 τ σ γ w s tan φ c f s where the sliding resistance force of the molecular term is calculated by the two parameters of cohesion c and internal friction angle φ γ w is the weight of water generally 10kn m3 s is the wetting front depth at different times obtained by the proposed green ampt model according to statics bell 1968 a system of equations consisting of three equations should be solved to obtain f s including the force balance equations along the y and z directions and the torque balance equation around the o point for the balance analysis in fig 16 the equations can be written as 23a σ z x τ ω ω 1 d x d y 0 23b σ z x τ ω ω 1 d x d y wdxdy 23c σ z x τ ω ω 1 x d x d y wxdxdy σ z x τ ω ω 1 z d x d y where 24a ω 1 z x 2 z y 2 24b ω 1 1 z x 2 in line with zhu and lee 2002 parameters λ 1 and λ 2 were introduced to transform equation 22 into a solvable statically determinate system f s was finally solved the real time safety factor during rainfall can be obtained by substituting the wetting front depth of equations 18 into equations 22 24 
3961,natural conditions of surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers in the north china plain ncp have been altered to meet the ever growing human water demands several water resources management measures have been implemented in recent decades to alleviate groundwater depletion maintain ecological resilience and sustain agricultural production this study aims to investigate their impacts on land water storage and thus obtain a picture of the spatio temporal variation of water resources over the ncp based on multi mission earth observation datasets i e altimetry sentinel 3 synthetic aperture radar sar and spectral imagery sentinel 1 2 gravimetry grace fo and microwave sensors imerg as well as reanalysis datasets we investigate surface water storage sws soil moisture water storage sms and total water storage tws changes groundwater storage gws change is subsequently estimated as the residual of the total storage equation results show that tws declined significantly over the past decades 1 04 0 05 cm yr in 2004 to 2020 while sms rebounded after a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014 the spatial pattern of tws variations depicts a particularly severe depletion along provincial boundaries the sws dynamics reveal that the volumes of three major ncp reservoirs guanting miyun and danjiangkou increased significantly since around 2014 when the operation of the south to north water diversion middle route project snwdp mr started moreover gws maintained a depletion rate of 1 05 0 08 cm yr during 2004 2014 over the whole ncp while the depletion rate accelerated during 2015 2020 1 88 0 38 cm yr we also found that the gws depletion in beijing 1 20 0 10 cm yr during 2004 2014 and 0 79 0 44 cm yr during 2015 2020 and its surrounding areas has been lowered possibly because of the snwdp mr this study shows how multi mission satellite earth observation products can be combined to monitor water resources at a regional scale and provide spatio temporally resolved estimates of the impacts of human induced changes in the inland water cycle keywords water resources sentinel 3 altimetry grace grace fo north china plain south to north water diversion project 1 introduction northern china and specifically the north china plain ncp is one of the world s most water scarce regions because domestic industrial and agricultural water consumption exceeds natural renewable water resources availability vörösmarty et al 2010 many water resources management measures have been promoted and implemented and they are essential to alleviate the problems of insufficient water availability in the ncp jiang 2009 structural and non structural measures have been initiated including reservoir construction improved irrigation technology adjustment of water pricing and inter basin water transfer projects most notably the south to north water diversion project snwdp zhang and li 2014 snwdp is noticeable among these water management strategies because it is the largest physical water transfer project in china it diverts water from the yangtze river basin to the water deficient north aiming at curbing the water shortage there liu et al 2019 since snwdp middle route snwdp mr opening in december 2014 over 30 km3 of water have been transported to the north guo et al 2020 several studies have analyzed the influence of this project on the surface and subsurface water levels in many target areas long et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 long et al 2020 used in situ data to detect groundwater recovery in beijing they found that snwdp mr helped stabilize groundwater levels and reduced cumulative groundwater depletion by 3 6 km3 accounting for 40 of total groundwater storage recovery during 2006 2018 zhang et al 2020a analyzed groundwater levels from 559 monitoring wells and found that the gws increased by 0 21 cm yr 0 3 km3 yr on average during 2015 2018 although the rates are diverse across regions snwdp has already shown impacts on water resources in some water receiving areas and is expected to further alleviate water shortages in the future osnpcc 2016 however the influence of snwdp on the surface and sub surface water storages over the whole ncp has not been comprehensively investigated due to data availability constraints and the large spatial extent current earth observation eo satellites offer new opportunities to monitor different water cycle components in near real time or with short delays thus eo data provide an alternative approach to monitor and assess water storage variations in this region the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission measured the earth s gravity field anomalies from its launch in march 2002 until the end of the mission in october 2017 and was continued by its follow on grace fo mission launched in may 2018 landerer et al 2020 grace derived terrestrial water storage tws including surface water storage sws soil moisture water storage sms groundwater storage gws snow water storage ice and water in biomass has been widely used to analyze the dynamics of continental water storage ferreira et al 2020 ramillien et al 2008 rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 singh et al 2012 rodell et al 2018 quantified 34 trends of tws observed by grace and categorized their drivers they found that the tws change rate was around 2 cm yr in ncp and could be attributed to direct human activities literature review indicates that the impacts of human intervention on freshwater storage were already visible in ncp decades ago liu et al 2001 foster et al 2004 tang et al 2013 investigated gws based on grace in 2003 2011 and found a decreasing rate of 1 4 to 0 8 cm yr feng et al 2013 estimated a gws depletion rate of 2 2 0 3 cm yr from 2003 to 2010 in ncp huang et al 2015 detected the spatial differences of gws depletion in the ncp and found that the shallow gws in the piedmont plain 4 65 0 68 cm yr declined faster than the deep gws in the east central plain 1 69 0 19 cm yr during 2003 2013 zhao et al 2019 found that the groundwater depletion rate rose to 3 8 0 1 cm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 in the ncp this study makes contributions to further refine the understanding of water storage change in the ncp considering the following drawbacks of previous studies 1 sws assessment was often highly simplified or ignored 2 gws dynamics especially the spatially distributed responses to snwdp have not been exhaustively analyzed this study exploits the new satellite datasets sentinel 1 2 3 and grace fo to address these knowledge gaps sws estimation is very challenging due to the low density monitoring network and access restrictions to in situ data nowadays sws can be estimated using satellite derived surface water extent swe and water surface elevation wse crétaux et al 2011 jiang et al 2017a khandelwal et al 2017 nielsen et al 2015 tulbure et al 2016 these two hydraulic variables are essential for the estimation of volumetric variations for example busker et al 2019 used the joint research centre jrc global surface water dataset and the satellite altimetry database from database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti to calculate the volume variations of 134 lakes and reservoirs globally the validation results gave an average correlation coefficient of 0 97 with a standard deviation of 0 041 km3 compared to in situ measurements optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar sar show good performance in monitoring swe dynamics globally khandelwal et al 2017 tulbure et al 2016 however wse is only available for certain targets depending on the ground tracks of satellite altimetry missions for example the jason series missions have a large equatorial inter track distance ca 315 km while the envisat and cryosat 2 have a relatively smaller inter track distance ca 90 km and 7 5 km at the equator respectively jiang et al 2017b among the previous and current satellite altimetry missions sentinel 3 a b is unique due to its sar altimeter and open loop tracking system jiang et al 2020 it has a relatively small inter track distance 104 km with a short repeat period 27 days which can provide quasi monthly wse time series for a higher number of ground targets therefore the sentinel 3 constellation has good potential to estimate volume change by combination with swe datasets subsurface water storage including sms and gws is the main component of tws usually sms is provided by land surface models and gws is calculated by deducting the contribution of sws sms from grace based tws güntner et al 2007 in this study we showcase the application of recent eo satellites for assessing water resources over the ncp specifically altimetry spectral sar imagery gravimetry microwave sensors and outputs of land surface models i e soil moisture are used to assess surface and sub surface freshwater dynamics especially the response to water resource management interventions the objectives of this study are 1 to assess the spatio temporal variations of grace grace fo derived tws in the ncp 2 to estimate sws variation using sentinel 1 2 imagery and sentinel 3 a b altimetry and 3 to analyze groundwater storage dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp located between 110 35 122 70 e and 31 38 43 62 n fig 1 a is one of the three major plains of china generally the ncp refers to the plains of seven provinces and municipalities including beijing tianjin hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu here the study region is chosen to coincide with the former five administrative regions located in the north fig 1 ncp covers an area of 5 42 105 km2 accounting for 5 6 of china s total land area and hosts a total population of 3 39 108 people accounting for 24 2 of china s total population the average annual precipitation of ncp is 678 0 mm derived from gpm imerg products from jan 2004 to dec 2019 summer jun aug precipitation is abundant accounting for 58 97 of the mean annual precipitation 399 8 mm across the region total precipitation in spring mar may autumn sep nov and winter dec feb is 118 1 mm 129 0 mm 31 1 mm accounting for 17 42 19 03 4 58 of mean annual precipitation respectively ncp is one of china s grain producing areas and agricultural land is the major land use type covering 56 33 of the total land area excessive groundwater withdrawal is used for irrigation due to the low amount of precipitation and its uneven distribution within and between years the snwdp mr has been put into use since december 2014 fig 1b the route starts from danjiangkou reservoir located in the southwest of the henan province runs along the western edge of ncp and ends in beijing and tianjin snwdp mr provides water mainly for domestic industry and agriculture for 14 cities along the distribution canals the main objective is to solve the water shortage problems in beijing tianjin hebei and henan before the construction of snwdp reservoirs of diverse sizes were built to contribute to flood protection supporting irrigation and drinking water in ncp the number of large reservoirs with a total storage capacity greater than 108 m3 is around 90 lehner et al 2011 here 26 reservoirs and lakes are monitored by sentinel 3 altimeters fig 1b fig 1c and 1d are partially enlarged views illustrating the maximum swe and sentinel 3 a b tracks crossing guanting and miyun reservoirs 2 2 methods overview multi mission eo data and model outputs are used to estimate monthly surface and sub surface water storage according to the total storage equation 1 tws s w s s m s g w s tws refers to the terrestrial water storage and the three main components i e surface water storage sws soil moisture water storage sms and groundwater storage gws are calculated through the following steps 1 monthly tws is derived from grace grace fo 2 sws can be estimated by summing the volume changes of all lakes and reservoirs in ncp volumetric variation calculation is based on the hypsometry relationship i e the relation between wse and swe wse and swe are retrieved from sentinel 3 a b and spectral and sar imageries respectively 3 sms is retrieved from three land surface model outputs 4 gws can be estimated by subtracting sws and sms from grace grace fo derived tws according to eq 1 the data sets used in this study and the processing methods of tws sms and sws are described in the following sections 2 3 grace grace fo derived tws grace measured gravity changes by linking it to the dynamic distance between the twin satellites which were separated by 220 km these measurements are combined with other data and models to provide estimates of tws changes at global and regional scales tapley et al 2004 original grace and grace fo data are mainly processed by the center for space research at the university of texas austin csr geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl five different grace tws anomaly twsa products are utilized in this study 1 jpl mass concentration mascon solutions watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2018 2 csr mascon solutions save et al 2016 3 three spherical harmonic coefficients shc from csr gfz and jpl landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 as recommended by sakumura et al 2014 five grace products were averaged by simple arithmetic mean all products cover the period of grace from april 2002 to june 2017 and grace fo from june 2018 to december 2020 detailed information on grace data processing can be found in grace tellus https grace jpl nasa gov twsa for seventeen months was missing between january 2004 to june 2017 during the grace period and for two months during the grace fo period thus a lagrange barycentric lb interpolator was introduced to interpolate the missing values deng et al 2020 the lb interpolator is based on the following equations 2 l t j 0 k y j l j t 3 l j t i 0 i j k t t i t j t i where l t is the interpolated value at time t and k is number of original data k equals 3 in this study indicating that the three nearest twsa were used yj are the datasets of the original series l j t are the lagrange fundamental polynomials 2 4 surface water storage sws estimation 2 4 1 swe retrieved from spectral and sar imagery the jrc global surface water dataset henceforth referred to as jrc maps temporal and spatial distributions of global surface water from 1984 to 2020 and is updated yearly pekel et al 2016 the dataset is derived from all landsat 5 7 and 8 optical imagery and the spatial resolution is 30 m monthly records of swe water occurrence and maximum water extent from jrc are used the monthly jrc swe history records were processed in the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 after obtaining the long term swe from 2004 to 2019 we further used the maximum swe and minimum swe as filtering windows to remove outliers in the time series outliers occur for two reasons 1 the algorithm treats ice as a non valid observation thus the swe in the frozen season is 0 2 the jrc dataset is derived from optical landsat images which are affected by cloud cover pekel et al 2016 therefore we consider water occurrence higher than 90 percent as the minimum swe and flag lower values as outliers considering that the spatial resolution of the swe is critical to developing the hypsometry relationship we also used a novel algorithm for fusing optical and sar data to map swe dynamics at monthly time intervals and high spatial resolution druce et al 2021 this dataset henceforth referred to as gras was chosen to overcome limitations in previous optical only datasets pekel et al 2016 pickens et al 2020 such as cloud cover and winter ice issue analysis of the jrc swe showed no valid data across the ncp reservoirs in january and december and 60 of valid data in february and november this is problematic for use in time series analysis and is overcome in the gras approach where more than 90 of valid pixels are consistently achieved throughout the year appendix a the gras approach can be described as an optical and sar based fusion algorithm which integrates all available sentinel 2 landsat and sentinel 1 images acquired over the years 2017 2020 to map surface water dynamics over the ncp at monthly time steps prior to water classification all acquired data are subject to essential pre processing including standard processing routines for orthorectification radiometric and atmospheric correction cloud masking as well as terrain and radar shadow masking monthly composites are generated using best available pixel by cloudiness for optical data and as median composites for the sar data the vv sar backscatter and the optical derived normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference water index ndwi are used as inputs to a logistic regression model that has been trained using labels from pickens et al 2020 swe product the logistic model returns a water probability score which is subsequently thresholded to convert the probability into a binary water not water classification 2 5 sentinel 3 a b observed wse the sentinel 3 mission concept was developed by the european space agency esa and currently consists of two satellites sentinel 3a s3a launched in february 2016 and sentinel 3b s3b launched in april 2018 unlike other satellite altimetry missions sentinel 3 is equipped with a sar altimeter and has an advanced open loop tracking mode to monitor water surface elevation wse of inland water targets jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b several studies have illustrated its potential for monitoring inland water bodies huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 2019 kittel et al 2020 we downloaded the sentinel 3 a b data from the esa grid processing on demand server gpod https gpod eo esa int the data processing configuration for inland water in gpod follows jiang et al 2020 and kittel et al 2020 on gpod the range r unc is retracked using the samosa method dinardo et al 2015 but no range corrections are applied we applied propagation and geophysical corrections i e dry troposphere r dry wet troposphere r wet ionosphere r ion solid earth tide r earth and pole tide r pole and the corrected range r cor was calculated by 4 r cor r unc r dry r wet r ion r earth r pole subsequently the wse can be calculated using the following equation 5 wse h r cor g e o i d where h is the ellipsoidal altitude of the satellite and geoid is the geoid height we used the egm2008 geoid as the reference we used the maximum swe derived from jrc to pre select observations of the corresponding reservoirs and then discarded the obvious outliers by comparing with dem from shuttle radar topography mission rodriguez et al 2005 i e 20 m away from dem 2 5 1 volume change calculation reservoir and lake volume change estimation is based on the hypsometry relationship dh d a dh represents the change of wse monitored by sentinel 3a b altimetry and da represents the change of swe observed by jrc and gras considering that the exact dates of swe are not provided but the dates of altimetry derived wse are known we first interpolated wse data on a monthly basis during the coincidence period of sentinel 3 a b and gras wse swe pairs were used to calculate the volume change δ v t between month t and the reference time i e the first month as 6 δ v t 1 2 swe t swe 0 wse t wse 0 considering sentinel 3 altimetry data are only available since 2016 a linear regression between the volume change δ v and the swe is fitted for each lake or reservoir during the period of 2016 to 2020 7 δ v t a swe t b ε t where a and b are the slope and intercept parameters and ε t is the error term or the residual for month t then the monthly records of swe from jrc for each reservoir and lake were inserted into the regression equation to estimate the volume change before 2016 2 6 soil moisture water storage sms estimation the reliability of sms is critical when estimating the groundwater storage considering that the sws contributes a small portion to total tws over the entire ncp here soil moisture from three reanalysis datasets are used 1 the second version of global land data assimilation system gldas 2 1 developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard earth science data information and services center 2 the updated version of the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 from nasa global modeling and assimilation office gelaro et al 2017 reichle et al 2017 3 the climate prediction center cpc soil moisture data provided by the physical sciences laboratory of national oceanic and atmospheric administration van den dool et al 2003 gldas 2 1 is forced with a combination of models princeton meteorological forcing dataset and ground observational data the dataset covers the period from 2000 to the near present with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 gldas noah model outputs are used merra2 covers 1980 to the near present and has a spatial resolution of 0 65 0 5 cpc is based on the water budget and covers 1948 to the near present and the spatial resolution is 0 5 0 5 the final sms was estimated using the arithmetic mean of the three products in ncp and the sub regions 2 7 imerg precipitation imerg was developed by combining information of the gpm satellite constellation to monitor the earth s surface rainfall and snowfall huffman et al 2015 the latest version of imerg version 06 contains both the early precipitation estimates collected during the operation of the trmm satellite 2000 2015 and precipitation estimates compiled during the operation of the gpm satellite 2014 near present we use the final run product which is bias corrected with precipitation gauge data the spatial resolution is 0 1 10 km and the dataset covers the period from june 2000 to the near present with a minimum latency of 3 5 months 2 8 trend and uncertainty estimation the linear least squares regression method is used to calculate the trend of variables in the present study and the non parametric mann kendall trend test was employed to study the significance of the trend mk test has been widely adopted to detect changes in hydro climate time series without assumptions of the frequency distribution of data hussain and mahmud 2019 evaluation of the reliability of different products is necessary but difficult in practice because no ground truth exists for sms and tws to estimate the uncertainty of tws we used five grace products specifically the three shc products were merged with two mascon products and the error was calculated as one standard deviation σ merged of these products we then considered the calibrated error σ calibrated of grace twsa provided by jpl mascon products watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 the final error of grace twsa is presented as 8 σ twsa σ merged 2 σ calibrated 2 the error of sws anomaly swsa estimations is a result of uncertainties in the image based swe and the wse from altimetry as well as the representation of the linear relationship between wse and swe we used the average relative standard error between in situ and eo based volume measurements of three large reservoirs to represent the uncertainty of swsa σ swsa the error of sms anomaly smsa was calculated as the average standard deviation σ smsa of the three modeling products the uncertainty of the gws anomaly gwsa is determined by propagating twsa swsa and smsa errors assuming that they are independent and normally distributed around the actual values the uncertainty of gwsa σ gwsa is presented as 9 σ gwsa σ twsa 2 σ swsa 2 σ smsa 2 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal patterns of twsa fig 2 shows the spatial patterns of linear trends of grace derived twsa trends of precipitation annual average precipitation and the cropping systems of ncp overall twsa was decreasing in 2004 2020 in most regions of ncp all twsa products show similar variations with the jpl mascon showing larger trends 6 1 cm yr of twsa change in some areas and the shc products showing smaller trends 2 0 cm yr many regions with the highest depletion rates are along the provincial boundaries i e the transboundary areas between hebei henan and shandong provinces fig 2a 2b and 2c decreasing trends in these areas reached 4 cm yr and even over 5 cm yr at some sites as shown by jpl mascon fig 2a grace can detect mass changes in small areas when the mass change is highly concentrated and of considerable magnitude longuevergne et al 2013 different grace solutions have detected twsa depletion in the boundary area indicating that local water storage losses have been severe twsa declines fig 2a are notable in the plain area compared to the surrounding mountains see the topography in fig 1b e g the north of hebei yanshan mountains southeast henan qinling mountains and south shandong taishan mountains areas of intense twsa decline correspond well with areas of intensive agriculture fig 2f fig 2d shows that precipitation is slightly increasing in the north and northwest ncp with a trend of around 0 1 cm yr however annual precipitation in these areas is relatively low fig 2e moreover there is a decreasing trend of precipitation in the southeastern ncp around 0 1 cm yr which contributes to decreasing tws in shandong and southern henan the uneven distribution of precipitation and intensive cropping systems may be the main drivers for groundwater abstraction resulting in spatial heterogeneities of tws for example the annual average precipitation decreased from 800 mm in the south side of the provincial boundary areas compared to 600 mm in the north fig 2e while the cropping system is the same i e double cropping system the irrigation heavily relies on groundwater pumping in these areas and resulting in significant tws decreases fig 3 shows the temporal fluctuations of monthly twsa in the ncp and its five sub regions from 2004 to 2020 tws has decreased continuously in the whole ncp with a rate of 1 04 0 05 cm yr in the past 17 years the regional twsa depletion rates in beijing tian and hebei have a trend of 0 98 0 07 cm yr 1 51 0 11 cm yr and 1 43 0 08 cm yr respectively the time series show that beijing tianjin and hebei experienced a significant decrease in 2004 2010 followed by a steady state in 2011 2014 afterward a significant drop was observed in 2014 2015 which can be explained by severe drought chen et al 2019 the drought had the most significant impact in tianjin resulting in a twsa decrease of ca 15 cm from 5 to 15 cm fig 3c the effects of the drought were less severe in hebei and beijing from 5 to 10 cm twsa in henan and shandong was continuously declining with rates of 1 25 0 09 cm yr and 1 63 0 07 cm yr respectively 3 2 surface water storage variations fig 4 shows the wse monitored by sentinel 3 a b and swe derived from the gras dataset of three large reservoirs in ncp the performance of sentinel 3 a b at these reservoirs is highly satisfactory in terms of the root mean square error rmse rmse between in situ and sentinel 3 a b observations of wse is 0 21 m for guanting 0 17 m for miyun and 0 52 m for danjiangkou however the accuracy of the swe datasets is lower specifically the swe of the guanting reservoir before 2019 has inconsistent changes compared with wse as shown in fig 4a one of the reasons is that the gras algorithm favors optical data and the algorithm relies on sar imagery sentinel 1 only when the optical data sentinel 2 is missing due to clouds therefore in some months the swe might be affected by haze for instance the swe of july 2018 was underestimated as shown in fig 4 wse and swe of guanting reservoir gradually increased during 2016 2020 miyun reservoir continuously expanded in 2017 and 2018 and remained stable in 2019 according to the swe records the danjiangkou reservoir started filling up around june 2017 and the highest wse reached 166 m to guarantee the water supply requirements of the snwdp mr the wse fluctuation range of danjiangkou reservoir is between 153 and 167 m with a difference of approximately 14 m as shown in fig 4c satellite altimetry has captured this process and altimetry derived wse is well in line with in situ data fig 5 demonstrates the satellite based volume change estimates for three large reservoirs located in ncp as mentioned above the swe of guanting before 2019 is highly uncertain we therefore used the swe and wse after 2019 for guanting reservoir to construct the hypsometry relationship the linear relationship between volume change and swe for guanting miyun and danjiangkou is strong with an associated r2 value of 0 79 0 89 and 0 95 respectively the temporal variations of volume changes in guanting miyun and danjiangkou show a clear increasing trend since around 2014 the increasing trends derived from satellite estimations for guanting miyun and danjiangkou are 0 02 0 11 and 0 31 km3 yr during 2004 2020 the marked increase starts around 2014 which is related to snwtp and local water transfer projects we found that the satellite based volume change estimates are close to in situ observations although discrepancies exist fig 5b 5d and 5f the discrepancies may be caused by the limitations of the estimated linear regressions based on data after 2016 since wse and swe are relatively larger after 2016 the linear assumption may not hold for smaller wse and swe the trends of volume change estimates based on satellite datasets are displayed in fig 6 for the other 23 ncp lakes and reservoirs the time series of wse and swe monitored by sentinel 3 altimetry and the gras dataset of each reservoir are given in appendix b we found that the monthly variations of wse and swe for most reservoirs and lakes are consistent the linear regression between volume change and swe are relatively robust for ten reservoirs with r2 higher than 0 8 and the r2 of the other eleven reservoirs were between 0 6 and 0 8 fig 6 and appendix c two reservoirs in beijing have a significant increasing trend the reservoirs located in hebei also show a slightly increasing trend however a majority of the reservoirs in henan and shandong show a decreasing trend as shown in fig 6b the overall swsa has an increasing trend with a 0 10 cm yr rate miyun gunting and danjingkou reservoir are the three largest reservoirs among the 26 observed reservoirs and their volumes dominate the overall trend 3 3 soil moisture water storage variation fig 7 shows the inter comparison of multi source derived soil moisture water storage anomaly smsa precipitation anomaly from imerg and their trends in ncp and the sub regions comparison of the smsa from three datasets gldas 2 1 merra 2 and cpc indicates a high consistency of interannual and seasonal changes with a mean correlation coefficient cc of 0 70 and a rmse of 12 19 cm between two different products monthly variations of smsa and precipitation are synchronized fig 7a and 7b and sms responds quickly to substantially increased precipitation in ncp the interannual variations of precipitation and smsa show no significant trend for the whole ncp fig 7c but show a constantly increasing trend in the sub regions e g beijing 0 06 cm yr for precipitation 0 25 cm yr for smsa and hebei 0 23 cm yr for smsa the general trends of smsa in henan and shandong is decreasing but insignificant as shown in fig 2 the spatial trends of precipitation in henan and shandong are unevenly distributed e g the south of henan and shandong show decreasing trends but the precipitation was increasing in the north 3 4 groundwater storage variation fig 8 shows the temporal variations of monthly groundwater storage anomaly gwsa the gwsa of the whole ncp shows an overall downward trend and shows different depletion rates during the two periods i e 2004 2014 1 05 0 08 cm yr and 2015 2020 1 88 0 38 cm yr gwsa shows different variations in the five sub regions in beijing and tianjin gws depletion is slowing down from 2015 to 2020 compared with the period 2004 2014 especially in beijing gws depletion rate is 1 20 0 10 cm yr in 2004 2014 but the rate is 0 79 0 44 cm yr during 2015 2020 similarly the depletion rate has been halved in tianjin specifically the decreasing gws trend is 1 90 0 19 cm yr in 2004 2014 but reduced to 1 58 0 70 cm yr in 2015 2020 comparatively the gws depletion in shandong is very high at a rate of 1 80 0 15 cm yr in 2004 2014 and a rate of 3 31 0 75 cm yr in 2015 2020 the accelerated decline in 2015 2020 is also observed in henan with a rate of 1 80 0 35 cm yr in general there is a change around 2015 which is very likely a direct consequence of the snwdp mr 3 5 uncertainties the uncertainties of twsa smsa and gwsa are shown in fig 9 which are presented as monthly and zonal mean of ncp and the sub regions the uncertainty of twsa is 2 97 cm in ncp beijing has a relatively lower error 2 46 cm while tianjin and shandong have higher errors 4 48 cm and 4 77 cm tianjin is a small area along the ocean where mass change signals might be challenging to detect by grace we also found some noisy grid cells in the jpl processed data fig 2a shandong has a large coastal area and the representativeness of grace data across land ocean boundaries is poor because of significant leakage johnson and chambers 2013 although the scale factors were used for calibrating twsa prior to uncertainty estimation the errors of grace derived twsa could be considerable when the applied scale factors cannot eliminate the leakage errors the error of swsa is 0 18 cm which is negligible compared with tws and sms additionally the number of monitored reservoirs is limited in this study because the inter track distance of sentinel 3 a b is 104 km which means not all the surface water bodies can be observed besides an acceptable regression between volume change and swe could not be established for some sentinel 3 a b monitored water bodies which were therefore discarded during data processing nevertheless the total storage capacity of the 26 monitored reservoirs is over 80 km3 accounting for 77 6 of the entire large reservoir volume in ncp the uncertainties of smsa are homogeneous in the ncp the uncertainty of the estimated gwsa in ncp is 3 24 cm while tianjin and shandong have a higher error and the value is 4 80 cm and 5 01 cm respectively 4 discussion a plethora of literature has reported groundwater depletion in north china over the past three decades ebead et al 2017 feng et al 2013 gong et al 2018 shen et al 2015 zhan et al 2019 although groundwater table records have been monitored via monitoring wells for a long time kendy et al 2007 obtaining a comprehensive picture of groundwater was difficult if not impossible for the first time the grace mission provided a bigger picture of large scale land water fluctuations over the ncp and other regions tapley et al 2019 combined with grace fo tws over the past 15 years reveals the dramatic decline of water resources in north china this is in line with previous studies li et al 2016 su et al 2020 land surface water especially the groundwater has been unsustainably over exploited decades ago and the depletion rates are unevenly distributed in ncp because of climate change intensive agriculture domestic and industrial uses one interesting finding is that tws depletion is accelerating in the areas along the provincial boundaries far from the main cities fig 2a this is probably related to the double cropping system fig 2d combined with relatively low precipitation in these areas fig 2f yang et al 2015 showed that the double cropping system is more water consuming due to high evapotranspiration unsustainable agricultural water use could be one of the reasons for the acceleration of groundwater over exploration the interannual and seasonal variations of land water storage can be attributed to climate change and human activity attribution of the land water storage variations in ncp is very important to understand the drivers of local water availability and can provide insights for water sectors given that precipitation is the primary driver of the water cycle we use precipitation as a first order indicator of climate variability while major water resources management interventions indicate human impact spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation have direct impacts on sws that is represented by reservoir storage gridded precipitation showed an increasing trend in central and northern ncp where the reservoir volumes also showed a slightly increasing trend and the precipitation showed a decreasing trend in the south of henan and shandong corresponding to reservoir depletion the main purposes of reservoirs in ncp are for irrigation water supply therefore water consumption increased in regions with drying trends e g shandong and the water storage in reservoirs decreased sws is thus synchronized with precipitation however a discrepancy between gwsa and precipitation variations at the interannual scale is noticeable as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 it is thus inferred that unsustainable water resource management e g over pumping is the principal cause of groundwater depletion groundwater over exploration resulted in a significant decrease in the water table in many regions of ncp the depth of groundwater tables has reached 40 m below terrain in the unconfined aquifer and 80 m below terrain in the confined aquifer in ncp zhang et al 2021 the thickening unsaturated zone increased unsaturated storage and the lag time between percolation and groundwater recharge cao et al 2016 the recharge efficiency of precipitation on groundwater decreased with the increase of the water table previous studies used models tracers water table and deep vadose zone data to quantify groundwater recharge and identified the critical factors controlling groundwater recharge as applied irrigation evapotranspiration and soil texture cao et al 2016 min et al 2015 tan et al 2014 this could explain the seasonal asynchrony between precipitation and gws the gains and losses of gws during a year are controlled by irrigation and evapotranspiration one of the significant water resources management projects is snwdp mr according to an official report from the construction and administration bureau of the south to north water division middle route project https nsbd cn c 2021 03 02 638770 shtml over 30 km3 of water was transferred to ncp from danjiangkou reservoir the transferred water was used to replenish reservoirs recharge aquifers satisfy domestic industrial and ecological demands the snwd mr is probably the main driver for increasing surface water storage in the monitored large reservoirs specifically guanting and miyun are two major surface water reservoirs in water receiving regions meanwhile the increasing storage of danjiangkou aims to guarantee the planned amount of transfer water the expanding volumes of guanting and miyun show that these reservoirs benefit from the snwd mr both directly and indirectly the amount of transferred water 30 km3 is roughly equivalent to ca 0 92 cm yr over the ncp during 2015 2020 using the total volume divided by the operation period of snwdp mr and area of ncp this explains why no evident change in the long term trend of gws is found however the allocation of transferred water is unevenly distributed as beijing and surrounding areas have a higher priority to receive water this explains the heterogeneity of gws trends beijing shows slowing gws depletion trends while shandong maintains severe depletion due to the drought and groundwater abstraction we attribute the gws depletion slowdown in beijing and its surrounding areas to the snwd mr and this finding was also supported by the in situ monitoring wells long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 found a recovering gws trend of 1 8 0 7 mm yr during 2015 2018 by analyzing groundwater level data of 617 wells we also noticed that gws continued to significantly decrease in some areas e g shandong it should be noted that satellite observations play a very important role in understanding the bigger picture of gws dynamics at a large scale additionally gws depletion rates are slightly different from those reported in former studies since the boundary of ncp and the period are different for example su et al 2020 reported that gws decreasing trend is 1 14 0 89 cm y in the huang huai hai plain from 2003 to 2015 zhao et al 2019 estimated gws depletion in ncp mainly the sedimentary basin depleted at a rate of 1 7 0 1 cm yr from 2004 to mid 2016 although the area of interest is ncp in this study the hydrological implications of water transfers for the water sources of snwdp mr are important danjiangkou water level surface area and volume were raised before the operation of snwdp mr to satisfy the water delivery targets fig 4 and fig 5 some studies have demonstrated that danjiangkou has significantly changed the flow and thermal regimes of downstream hanjiang river wang et al 2015 j zhao et al 2020 land use land cover wang et al 2020 and ecosystem services h liu et al 2019 further studies of the impacts of snwdp on regional hydrology ecology climate in both diversion region and benefited region are necessary exploiting the monitoring datasets provided by multiple satellite missions 5 conclusions in this study multi satellite products and modeled variables were used to investigate the total water storage tws and the dynamics of its components in the north china plain ncp the main conclusions of this study are 1 the spatial pattern of twsa indicates that the water storage continuously decreased in most parts of ncp twsa depletion rate in ncp is 1 04 0 05 cm yr from 2004 to 2020 and shandong has the highest depletion rate 1 63 0 07 cm yr compared with other regions special attention should be paid to the provincial boundary areas because of severe groundwater depletion 2 the sws shows an overall increasing trend at a rate of 0 10 cm yr three large reservoirs i e danjiangkou miyun and guanting reservoirs show a significant increase since 2014 coinciding with the opening of snwdp mr even though the amount of investigated reservoirs is limited to 26 sentinel 3 a b altimetry and optical sar derived surface water extent swe data showed great potential in estimating surface water storage sws in this area 3 groundwater storage gws depletion was estimated as 1 05 0 08 cm yr during 2004 2014 in ncp it has accelerated in 2015 2020 1 88 0 38 cm yr mainly due to the drawdown in henan and shandong conversely gws depletion has slowed down in beijing 0 79 0 44 cm yr and tianjin 1 58 0 70 cm yr thanks to snwdp mr the large water transfer project has contributed to gws recovery and alleviates water stress in parts of ncp this study showcases the value of earth observation datasets in monitoring terrestrial freshwater resources which is of great concern in many regions and river basins including the ncp to meet the sustainable development goals the groundwater table

3961,natural conditions of surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers in the north china plain ncp have been altered to meet the ever growing human water demands several water resources management measures have been implemented in recent decades to alleviate groundwater depletion maintain ecological resilience and sustain agricultural production this study aims to investigate their impacts on land water storage and thus obtain a picture of the spatio temporal variation of water resources over the ncp based on multi mission earth observation datasets i e altimetry sentinel 3 synthetic aperture radar sar and spectral imagery sentinel 1 2 gravimetry grace fo and microwave sensors imerg as well as reanalysis datasets we investigate surface water storage sws soil moisture water storage sms and total water storage tws changes groundwater storage gws change is subsequently estimated as the residual of the total storage equation results show that tws declined significantly over the past decades 1 04 0 05 cm yr in 2004 to 2020 while sms rebounded after a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2014 the spatial pattern of tws variations depicts a particularly severe depletion along provincial boundaries the sws dynamics reveal that the volumes of three major ncp reservoirs guanting miyun and danjiangkou increased significantly since around 2014 when the operation of the south to north water diversion middle route project snwdp mr started moreover gws maintained a depletion rate of 1 05 0 08 cm yr during 2004 2014 over the whole ncp while the depletion rate accelerated during 2015 2020 1 88 0 38 cm yr we also found that the gws depletion in beijing 1 20 0 10 cm yr during 2004 2014 and 0 79 0 44 cm yr during 2015 2020 and its surrounding areas has been lowered possibly because of the snwdp mr this study shows how multi mission satellite earth observation products can be combined to monitor water resources at a regional scale and provide spatio temporally resolved estimates of the impacts of human induced changes in the inland water cycle keywords water resources sentinel 3 altimetry grace grace fo north china plain south to north water diversion project 1 introduction northern china and specifically the north china plain ncp is one of the world s most water scarce regions because domestic industrial and agricultural water consumption exceeds natural renewable water resources availability vörösmarty et al 2010 many water resources management measures have been promoted and implemented and they are essential to alleviate the problems of insufficient water availability in the ncp jiang 2009 structural and non structural measures have been initiated including reservoir construction improved irrigation technology adjustment of water pricing and inter basin water transfer projects most notably the south to north water diversion project snwdp zhang and li 2014 snwdp is noticeable among these water management strategies because it is the largest physical water transfer project in china it diverts water from the yangtze river basin to the water deficient north aiming at curbing the water shortage there liu et al 2019 since snwdp middle route snwdp mr opening in december 2014 over 30 km3 of water have been transported to the north guo et al 2020 several studies have analyzed the influence of this project on the surface and subsurface water levels in many target areas long et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 long et al 2020 used in situ data to detect groundwater recovery in beijing they found that snwdp mr helped stabilize groundwater levels and reduced cumulative groundwater depletion by 3 6 km3 accounting for 40 of total groundwater storage recovery during 2006 2018 zhang et al 2020a analyzed groundwater levels from 559 monitoring wells and found that the gws increased by 0 21 cm yr 0 3 km3 yr on average during 2015 2018 although the rates are diverse across regions snwdp has already shown impacts on water resources in some water receiving areas and is expected to further alleviate water shortages in the future osnpcc 2016 however the influence of snwdp on the surface and sub surface water storages over the whole ncp has not been comprehensively investigated due to data availability constraints and the large spatial extent current earth observation eo satellites offer new opportunities to monitor different water cycle components in near real time or with short delays thus eo data provide an alternative approach to monitor and assess water storage variations in this region the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission measured the earth s gravity field anomalies from its launch in march 2002 until the end of the mission in october 2017 and was continued by its follow on grace fo mission launched in may 2018 landerer et al 2020 grace derived terrestrial water storage tws including surface water storage sws soil moisture water storage sms groundwater storage gws snow water storage ice and water in biomass has been widely used to analyze the dynamics of continental water storage ferreira et al 2020 ramillien et al 2008 rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 singh et al 2012 rodell et al 2018 quantified 34 trends of tws observed by grace and categorized their drivers they found that the tws change rate was around 2 cm yr in ncp and could be attributed to direct human activities literature review indicates that the impacts of human intervention on freshwater storage were already visible in ncp decades ago liu et al 2001 foster et al 2004 tang et al 2013 investigated gws based on grace in 2003 2011 and found a decreasing rate of 1 4 to 0 8 cm yr feng et al 2013 estimated a gws depletion rate of 2 2 0 3 cm yr from 2003 to 2010 in ncp huang et al 2015 detected the spatial differences of gws depletion in the ncp and found that the shallow gws in the piedmont plain 4 65 0 68 cm yr declined faster than the deep gws in the east central plain 1 69 0 19 cm yr during 2003 2013 zhao et al 2019 found that the groundwater depletion rate rose to 3 8 0 1 cm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 in the ncp this study makes contributions to further refine the understanding of water storage change in the ncp considering the following drawbacks of previous studies 1 sws assessment was often highly simplified or ignored 2 gws dynamics especially the spatially distributed responses to snwdp have not been exhaustively analyzed this study exploits the new satellite datasets sentinel 1 2 3 and grace fo to address these knowledge gaps sws estimation is very challenging due to the low density monitoring network and access restrictions to in situ data nowadays sws can be estimated using satellite derived surface water extent swe and water surface elevation wse crétaux et al 2011 jiang et al 2017a khandelwal et al 2017 nielsen et al 2015 tulbure et al 2016 these two hydraulic variables are essential for the estimation of volumetric variations for example busker et al 2019 used the joint research centre jrc global surface water dataset and the satellite altimetry database from database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti to calculate the volume variations of 134 lakes and reservoirs globally the validation results gave an average correlation coefficient of 0 97 with a standard deviation of 0 041 km3 compared to in situ measurements optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar sar show good performance in monitoring swe dynamics globally khandelwal et al 2017 tulbure et al 2016 however wse is only available for certain targets depending on the ground tracks of satellite altimetry missions for example the jason series missions have a large equatorial inter track distance ca 315 km while the envisat and cryosat 2 have a relatively smaller inter track distance ca 90 km and 7 5 km at the equator respectively jiang et al 2017b among the previous and current satellite altimetry missions sentinel 3 a b is unique due to its sar altimeter and open loop tracking system jiang et al 2020 it has a relatively small inter track distance 104 km with a short repeat period 27 days which can provide quasi monthly wse time series for a higher number of ground targets therefore the sentinel 3 constellation has good potential to estimate volume change by combination with swe datasets subsurface water storage including sms and gws is the main component of tws usually sms is provided by land surface models and gws is calculated by deducting the contribution of sws sms from grace based tws güntner et al 2007 in this study we showcase the application of recent eo satellites for assessing water resources over the ncp specifically altimetry spectral sar imagery gravimetry microwave sensors and outputs of land surface models i e soil moisture are used to assess surface and sub surface freshwater dynamics especially the response to water resource management interventions the objectives of this study are 1 to assess the spatio temporal variations of grace grace fo derived tws in the ncp 2 to estimate sws variation using sentinel 1 2 imagery and sentinel 3 a b altimetry and 3 to analyze groundwater storage dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp located between 110 35 122 70 e and 31 38 43 62 n fig 1 a is one of the three major plains of china generally the ncp refers to the plains of seven provinces and municipalities including beijing tianjin hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu here the study region is chosen to coincide with the former five administrative regions located in the north fig 1 ncp covers an area of 5 42 105 km2 accounting for 5 6 of china s total land area and hosts a total population of 3 39 108 people accounting for 24 2 of china s total population the average annual precipitation of ncp is 678 0 mm derived from gpm imerg products from jan 2004 to dec 2019 summer jun aug precipitation is abundant accounting for 58 97 of the mean annual precipitation 399 8 mm across the region total precipitation in spring mar may autumn sep nov and winter dec feb is 118 1 mm 129 0 mm 31 1 mm accounting for 17 42 19 03 4 58 of mean annual precipitation respectively ncp is one of china s grain producing areas and agricultural land is the major land use type covering 56 33 of the total land area excessive groundwater withdrawal is used for irrigation due to the low amount of precipitation and its uneven distribution within and between years the snwdp mr has been put into use since december 2014 fig 1b the route starts from danjiangkou reservoir located in the southwest of the henan province runs along the western edge of ncp and ends in beijing and tianjin snwdp mr provides water mainly for domestic industry and agriculture for 14 cities along the distribution canals the main objective is to solve the water shortage problems in beijing tianjin hebei and henan before the construction of snwdp reservoirs of diverse sizes were built to contribute to flood protection supporting irrigation and drinking water in ncp the number of large reservoirs with a total storage capacity greater than 108 m3 is around 90 lehner et al 2011 here 26 reservoirs and lakes are monitored by sentinel 3 altimeters fig 1b fig 1c and 1d are partially enlarged views illustrating the maximum swe and sentinel 3 a b tracks crossing guanting and miyun reservoirs 2 2 methods overview multi mission eo data and model outputs are used to estimate monthly surface and sub surface water storage according to the total storage equation 1 tws s w s s m s g w s tws refers to the terrestrial water storage and the three main components i e surface water storage sws soil moisture water storage sms and groundwater storage gws are calculated through the following steps 1 monthly tws is derived from grace grace fo 2 sws can be estimated by summing the volume changes of all lakes and reservoirs in ncp volumetric variation calculation is based on the hypsometry relationship i e the relation between wse and swe wse and swe are retrieved from sentinel 3 a b and spectral and sar imageries respectively 3 sms is retrieved from three land surface model outputs 4 gws can be estimated by subtracting sws and sms from grace grace fo derived tws according to eq 1 the data sets used in this study and the processing methods of tws sms and sws are described in the following sections 2 3 grace grace fo derived tws grace measured gravity changes by linking it to the dynamic distance between the twin satellites which were separated by 220 km these measurements are combined with other data and models to provide estimates of tws changes at global and regional scales tapley et al 2004 original grace and grace fo data are mainly processed by the center for space research at the university of texas austin csr geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl five different grace tws anomaly twsa products are utilized in this study 1 jpl mass concentration mascon solutions watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2018 2 csr mascon solutions save et al 2016 3 three spherical harmonic coefficients shc from csr gfz and jpl landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 as recommended by sakumura et al 2014 five grace products were averaged by simple arithmetic mean all products cover the period of grace from april 2002 to june 2017 and grace fo from june 2018 to december 2020 detailed information on grace data processing can be found in grace tellus https grace jpl nasa gov twsa for seventeen months was missing between january 2004 to june 2017 during the grace period and for two months during the grace fo period thus a lagrange barycentric lb interpolator was introduced to interpolate the missing values deng et al 2020 the lb interpolator is based on the following equations 2 l t j 0 k y j l j t 3 l j t i 0 i j k t t i t j t i where l t is the interpolated value at time t and k is number of original data k equals 3 in this study indicating that the three nearest twsa were used yj are the datasets of the original series l j t are the lagrange fundamental polynomials 2 4 surface water storage sws estimation 2 4 1 swe retrieved from spectral and sar imagery the jrc global surface water dataset henceforth referred to as jrc maps temporal and spatial distributions of global surface water from 1984 to 2020 and is updated yearly pekel et al 2016 the dataset is derived from all landsat 5 7 and 8 optical imagery and the spatial resolution is 30 m monthly records of swe water occurrence and maximum water extent from jrc are used the monthly jrc swe history records were processed in the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 after obtaining the long term swe from 2004 to 2019 we further used the maximum swe and minimum swe as filtering windows to remove outliers in the time series outliers occur for two reasons 1 the algorithm treats ice as a non valid observation thus the swe in the frozen season is 0 2 the jrc dataset is derived from optical landsat images which are affected by cloud cover pekel et al 2016 therefore we consider water occurrence higher than 90 percent as the minimum swe and flag lower values as outliers considering that the spatial resolution of the swe is critical to developing the hypsometry relationship we also used a novel algorithm for fusing optical and sar data to map swe dynamics at monthly time intervals and high spatial resolution druce et al 2021 this dataset henceforth referred to as gras was chosen to overcome limitations in previous optical only datasets pekel et al 2016 pickens et al 2020 such as cloud cover and winter ice issue analysis of the jrc swe showed no valid data across the ncp reservoirs in january and december and 60 of valid data in february and november this is problematic for use in time series analysis and is overcome in the gras approach where more than 90 of valid pixels are consistently achieved throughout the year appendix a the gras approach can be described as an optical and sar based fusion algorithm which integrates all available sentinel 2 landsat and sentinel 1 images acquired over the years 2017 2020 to map surface water dynamics over the ncp at monthly time steps prior to water classification all acquired data are subject to essential pre processing including standard processing routines for orthorectification radiometric and atmospheric correction cloud masking as well as terrain and radar shadow masking monthly composites are generated using best available pixel by cloudiness for optical data and as median composites for the sar data the vv sar backscatter and the optical derived normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference water index ndwi are used as inputs to a logistic regression model that has been trained using labels from pickens et al 2020 swe product the logistic model returns a water probability score which is subsequently thresholded to convert the probability into a binary water not water classification 2 5 sentinel 3 a b observed wse the sentinel 3 mission concept was developed by the european space agency esa and currently consists of two satellites sentinel 3a s3a launched in february 2016 and sentinel 3b s3b launched in april 2018 unlike other satellite altimetry missions sentinel 3 is equipped with a sar altimeter and has an advanced open loop tracking mode to monitor water surface elevation wse of inland water targets jiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b several studies have illustrated its potential for monitoring inland water bodies huang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 2019 kittel et al 2020 we downloaded the sentinel 3 a b data from the esa grid processing on demand server gpod https gpod eo esa int the data processing configuration for inland water in gpod follows jiang et al 2020 and kittel et al 2020 on gpod the range r unc is retracked using the samosa method dinardo et al 2015 but no range corrections are applied we applied propagation and geophysical corrections i e dry troposphere r dry wet troposphere r wet ionosphere r ion solid earth tide r earth and pole tide r pole and the corrected range r cor was calculated by 4 r cor r unc r dry r wet r ion r earth r pole subsequently the wse can be calculated using the following equation 5 wse h r cor g e o i d where h is the ellipsoidal altitude of the satellite and geoid is the geoid height we used the egm2008 geoid as the reference we used the maximum swe derived from jrc to pre select observations of the corresponding reservoirs and then discarded the obvious outliers by comparing with dem from shuttle radar topography mission rodriguez et al 2005 i e 20 m away from dem 2 5 1 volume change calculation reservoir and lake volume change estimation is based on the hypsometry relationship dh d a dh represents the change of wse monitored by sentinel 3a b altimetry and da represents the change of swe observed by jrc and gras considering that the exact dates of swe are not provided but the dates of altimetry derived wse are known we first interpolated wse data on a monthly basis during the coincidence period of sentinel 3 a b and gras wse swe pairs were used to calculate the volume change δ v t between month t and the reference time i e the first month as 6 δ v t 1 2 swe t swe 0 wse t wse 0 considering sentinel 3 altimetry data are only available since 2016 a linear regression between the volume change δ v and the swe is fitted for each lake or reservoir during the period of 2016 to 2020 7 δ v t a swe t b ε t where a and b are the slope and intercept parameters and ε t is the error term or the residual for month t then the monthly records of swe from jrc for each reservoir and lake were inserted into the regression equation to estimate the volume change before 2016 2 6 soil moisture water storage sms estimation the reliability of sms is critical when estimating the groundwater storage considering that the sws contributes a small portion to total tws over the entire ncp here soil moisture from three reanalysis datasets are used 1 the second version of global land data assimilation system gldas 2 1 developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard earth science data information and services center 2 the updated version of the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 from nasa global modeling and assimilation office gelaro et al 2017 reichle et al 2017 3 the climate prediction center cpc soil moisture data provided by the physical sciences laboratory of national oceanic and atmospheric administration van den dool et al 2003 gldas 2 1 is forced with a combination of models princeton meteorological forcing dataset and ground observational data the dataset covers the period from 2000 to the near present with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 gldas noah model outputs are used merra2 covers 1980 to the near present and has a spatial resolution of 0 65 0 5 cpc is based on the water budget and covers 1948 to the near present and the spatial resolution is 0 5 0 5 the final sms was estimated using the arithmetic mean of the three products in ncp and the sub regions 2 7 imerg precipitation imerg was developed by combining information of the gpm satellite constellation to monitor the earth s surface rainfall and snowfall huffman et al 2015 the latest version of imerg version 06 contains both the early precipitation estimates collected during the operation of the trmm satellite 2000 2015 and precipitation estimates compiled during the operation of the gpm satellite 2014 near present we use the final run product which is bias corrected with precipitation gauge data the spatial resolution is 0 1 10 km and the dataset covers the period from june 2000 to the near present with a minimum latency of 3 5 months 2 8 trend and uncertainty estimation the linear least squares regression method is used to calculate the trend of variables in the present study and the non parametric mann kendall trend test was employed to study the significance of the trend mk test has been widely adopted to detect changes in hydro climate time series without assumptions of the frequency distribution of data hussain and mahmud 2019 evaluation of the reliability of different products is necessary but difficult in practice because no ground truth exists for sms and tws to estimate the uncertainty of tws we used five grace products specifically the three shc products were merged with two mascon products and the error was calculated as one standard deviation σ merged of these products we then considered the calibrated error σ calibrated of grace twsa provided by jpl mascon products watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 the final error of grace twsa is presented as 8 σ twsa σ merged 2 σ calibrated 2 the error of sws anomaly swsa estimations is a result of uncertainties in the image based swe and the wse from altimetry as well as the representation of the linear relationship between wse and swe we used the average relative standard error between in situ and eo based volume measurements of three large reservoirs to represent the uncertainty of swsa σ swsa the error of sms anomaly smsa was calculated as the average standard deviation σ smsa of the three modeling products the uncertainty of the gws anomaly gwsa is determined by propagating twsa swsa and smsa errors assuming that they are independent and normally distributed around the actual values the uncertainty of gwsa σ gwsa is presented as 9 σ gwsa σ twsa 2 σ swsa 2 σ smsa 2 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal patterns of twsa fig 2 shows the spatial patterns of linear trends of grace derived twsa trends of precipitation annual average precipitation and the cropping systems of ncp overall twsa was decreasing in 2004 2020 in most regions of ncp all twsa products show similar variations with the jpl mascon showing larger trends 6 1 cm yr of twsa change in some areas and the shc products showing smaller trends 2 0 cm yr many regions with the highest depletion rates are along the provincial boundaries i e the transboundary areas between hebei henan and shandong provinces fig 2a 2b and 2c decreasing trends in these areas reached 4 cm yr and even over 5 cm yr at some sites as shown by jpl mascon fig 2a grace can detect mass changes in small areas when the mass change is highly concentrated and of considerable magnitude longuevergne et al 2013 different grace solutions have detected twsa depletion in the boundary area indicating that local water storage losses have been severe twsa declines fig 2a are notable in the plain area compared to the surrounding mountains see the topography in fig 1b e g the north of hebei yanshan mountains southeast henan qinling mountains and south shandong taishan mountains areas of intense twsa decline correspond well with areas of intensive agriculture fig 2f fig 2d shows that precipitation is slightly increasing in the north and northwest ncp with a trend of around 0 1 cm yr however annual precipitation in these areas is relatively low fig 2e moreover there is a decreasing trend of precipitation in the southeastern ncp around 0 1 cm yr which contributes to decreasing tws in shandong and southern henan the uneven distribution of precipitation and intensive cropping systems may be the main drivers for groundwater abstraction resulting in spatial heterogeneities of tws for example the annual average precipitation decreased from 800 mm in the south side of the provincial boundary areas compared to 600 mm in the north fig 2e while the cropping system is the same i e double cropping system the irrigation heavily relies on groundwater pumping in these areas and resulting in significant tws decreases fig 3 shows the temporal fluctuations of monthly twsa in the ncp and its five sub regions from 2004 to 2020 tws has decreased continuously in the whole ncp with a rate of 1 04 0 05 cm yr in the past 17 years the regional twsa depletion rates in beijing tian and hebei have a trend of 0 98 0 07 cm yr 1 51 0 11 cm yr and 1 43 0 08 cm yr respectively the time series show that beijing tianjin and hebei experienced a significant decrease in 2004 2010 followed by a steady state in 2011 2014 afterward a significant drop was observed in 2014 2015 which can be explained by severe drought chen et al 2019 the drought had the most significant impact in tianjin resulting in a twsa decrease of ca 15 cm from 5 to 15 cm fig 3c the effects of the drought were less severe in hebei and beijing from 5 to 10 cm twsa in henan and shandong was continuously declining with rates of 1 25 0 09 cm yr and 1 63 0 07 cm yr respectively 3 2 surface water storage variations fig 4 shows the wse monitored by sentinel 3 a b and swe derived from the gras dataset of three large reservoirs in ncp the performance of sentinel 3 a b at these reservoirs is highly satisfactory in terms of the root mean square error rmse rmse between in situ and sentinel 3 a b observations of wse is 0 21 m for guanting 0 17 m for miyun and 0 52 m for danjiangkou however the accuracy of the swe datasets is lower specifically the swe of the guanting reservoir before 2019 has inconsistent changes compared with wse as shown in fig 4a one of the reasons is that the gras algorithm favors optical data and the algorithm relies on sar imagery sentinel 1 only when the optical data sentinel 2 is missing due to clouds therefore in some months the swe might be affected by haze for instance the swe of july 2018 was underestimated as shown in fig 4 wse and swe of guanting reservoir gradually increased during 2016 2020 miyun reservoir continuously expanded in 2017 and 2018 and remained stable in 2019 according to the swe records the danjiangkou reservoir started filling up around june 2017 and the highest wse reached 166 m to guarantee the water supply requirements of the snwdp mr the wse fluctuation range of danjiangkou reservoir is between 153 and 167 m with a difference of approximately 14 m as shown in fig 4c satellite altimetry has captured this process and altimetry derived wse is well in line with in situ data fig 5 demonstrates the satellite based volume change estimates for three large reservoirs located in ncp as mentioned above the swe of guanting before 2019 is highly uncertain we therefore used the swe and wse after 2019 for guanting reservoir to construct the hypsometry relationship the linear relationship between volume change and swe for guanting miyun and danjiangkou is strong with an associated r2 value of 0 79 0 89 and 0 95 respectively the temporal variations of volume changes in guanting miyun and danjiangkou show a clear increasing trend since around 2014 the increasing trends derived from satellite estimations for guanting miyun and danjiangkou are 0 02 0 11 and 0 31 km3 yr during 2004 2020 the marked increase starts around 2014 which is related to snwtp and local water transfer projects we found that the satellite based volume change estimates are close to in situ observations although discrepancies exist fig 5b 5d and 5f the discrepancies may be caused by the limitations of the estimated linear regressions based on data after 2016 since wse and swe are relatively larger after 2016 the linear assumption may not hold for smaller wse and swe the trends of volume change estimates based on satellite datasets are displayed in fig 6 for the other 23 ncp lakes and reservoirs the time series of wse and swe monitored by sentinel 3 altimetry and the gras dataset of each reservoir are given in appendix b we found that the monthly variations of wse and swe for most reservoirs and lakes are consistent the linear regression between volume change and swe are relatively robust for ten reservoirs with r2 higher than 0 8 and the r2 of the other eleven reservoirs were between 0 6 and 0 8 fig 6 and appendix c two reservoirs in beijing have a significant increasing trend the reservoirs located in hebei also show a slightly increasing trend however a majority of the reservoirs in henan and shandong show a decreasing trend as shown in fig 6b the overall swsa has an increasing trend with a 0 10 cm yr rate miyun gunting and danjingkou reservoir are the three largest reservoirs among the 26 observed reservoirs and their volumes dominate the overall trend 3 3 soil moisture water storage variation fig 7 shows the inter comparison of multi source derived soil moisture water storage anomaly smsa precipitation anomaly from imerg and their trends in ncp and the sub regions comparison of the smsa from three datasets gldas 2 1 merra 2 and cpc indicates a high consistency of interannual and seasonal changes with a mean correlation coefficient cc of 0 70 and a rmse of 12 19 cm between two different products monthly variations of smsa and precipitation are synchronized fig 7a and 7b and sms responds quickly to substantially increased precipitation in ncp the interannual variations of precipitation and smsa show no significant trend for the whole ncp fig 7c but show a constantly increasing trend in the sub regions e g beijing 0 06 cm yr for precipitation 0 25 cm yr for smsa and hebei 0 23 cm yr for smsa the general trends of smsa in henan and shandong is decreasing but insignificant as shown in fig 2 the spatial trends of precipitation in henan and shandong are unevenly distributed e g the south of henan and shandong show decreasing trends but the precipitation was increasing in the north 3 4 groundwater storage variation fig 8 shows the temporal variations of monthly groundwater storage anomaly gwsa the gwsa of the whole ncp shows an overall downward trend and shows different depletion rates during the two periods i e 2004 2014 1 05 0 08 cm yr and 2015 2020 1 88 0 38 cm yr gwsa shows different variations in the five sub regions in beijing and tianjin gws depletion is slowing down from 2015 to 2020 compared with the period 2004 2014 especially in beijing gws depletion rate is 1 20 0 10 cm yr in 2004 2014 but the rate is 0 79 0 44 cm yr during 2015 2020 similarly the depletion rate has been halved in tianjin specifically the decreasing gws trend is 1 90 0 19 cm yr in 2004 2014 but reduced to 1 58 0 70 cm yr in 2015 2020 comparatively the gws depletion in shandong is very high at a rate of 1 80 0 15 cm yr in 2004 2014 and a rate of 3 31 0 75 cm yr in 2015 2020 the accelerated decline in 2015 2020 is also observed in henan with a rate of 1 80 0 35 cm yr in general there is a change around 2015 which is very likely a direct consequence of the snwdp mr 3 5 uncertainties the uncertainties of twsa smsa and gwsa are shown in fig 9 which are presented as monthly and zonal mean of ncp and the sub regions the uncertainty of twsa is 2 97 cm in ncp beijing has a relatively lower error 2 46 cm while tianjin and shandong have higher errors 4 48 cm and 4 77 cm tianjin is a small area along the ocean where mass change signals might be challenging to detect by grace we also found some noisy grid cells in the jpl processed data fig 2a shandong has a large coastal area and the representativeness of grace data across land ocean boundaries is poor because of significant leakage johnson and chambers 2013 although the scale factors were used for calibrating twsa prior to uncertainty estimation the errors of grace derived twsa could be considerable when the applied scale factors cannot eliminate the leakage errors the error of swsa is 0 18 cm which is negligible compared with tws and sms additionally the number of monitored reservoirs is limited in this study because the inter track distance of sentinel 3 a b is 104 km which means not all the surface water bodies can be observed besides an acceptable regression between volume change and swe could not be established for some sentinel 3 a b monitored water bodies which were therefore discarded during data processing nevertheless the total storage capacity of the 26 monitored reservoirs is over 80 km3 accounting for 77 6 of the entire large reservoir volume in ncp the uncertainties of smsa are homogeneous in the ncp the uncertainty of the estimated gwsa in ncp is 3 24 cm while tianjin and shandong have a higher error and the value is 4 80 cm and 5 01 cm respectively 4 discussion a plethora of literature has reported groundwater depletion in north china over the past three decades ebead et al 2017 feng et al 2013 gong et al 2018 shen et al 2015 zhan et al 2019 although groundwater table records have been monitored via monitoring wells for a long time kendy et al 2007 obtaining a comprehensive picture of groundwater was difficult if not impossible for the first time the grace mission provided a bigger picture of large scale land water fluctuations over the ncp and other regions tapley et al 2019 combined with grace fo tws over the past 15 years reveals the dramatic decline of water resources in north china this is in line with previous studies li et al 2016 su et al 2020 land surface water especially the groundwater has been unsustainably over exploited decades ago and the depletion rates are unevenly distributed in ncp because of climate change intensive agriculture domestic and industrial uses one interesting finding is that tws depletion is accelerating in the areas along the provincial boundaries far from the main cities fig 2a this is probably related to the double cropping system fig 2d combined with relatively low precipitation in these areas fig 2f yang et al 2015 showed that the double cropping system is more water consuming due to high evapotranspiration unsustainable agricultural water use could be one of the reasons for the acceleration of groundwater over exploration the interannual and seasonal variations of land water storage can be attributed to climate change and human activity attribution of the land water storage variations in ncp is very important to understand the drivers of local water availability and can provide insights for water sectors given that precipitation is the primary driver of the water cycle we use precipitation as a first order indicator of climate variability while major water resources management interventions indicate human impact spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation have direct impacts on sws that is represented by reservoir storage gridded precipitation showed an increasing trend in central and northern ncp where the reservoir volumes also showed a slightly increasing trend and the precipitation showed a decreasing trend in the south of henan and shandong corresponding to reservoir depletion the main purposes of reservoirs in ncp are for irrigation water supply therefore water consumption increased in regions with drying trends e g shandong and the water storage in reservoirs decreased sws is thus synchronized with precipitation however a discrepancy between gwsa and precipitation variations at the interannual scale is noticeable as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 it is thus inferred that unsustainable water resource management e g over pumping is the principal cause of groundwater depletion groundwater over exploration resulted in a significant decrease in the water table in many regions of ncp the depth of groundwater tables has reached 40 m below terrain in the unconfined aquifer and 80 m below terrain in the confined aquifer in ncp zhang et al 2021 the thickening unsaturated zone increased unsaturated storage and the lag time between percolation and groundwater recharge cao et al 2016 the recharge efficiency of precipitation on groundwater decreased with the increase of the water table previous studies used models tracers water table and deep vadose zone data to quantify groundwater recharge and identified the critical factors controlling groundwater recharge as applied irrigation evapotranspiration and soil texture cao et al 2016 min et al 2015 tan et al 2014 this could explain the seasonal asynchrony between precipitation and gws the gains and losses of gws during a year are controlled by irrigation and evapotranspiration one of the significant water resources management projects is snwdp mr according to an official report from the construction and administration bureau of the south to north water division middle route project https nsbd cn c 2021 03 02 638770 shtml over 30 km3 of water was transferred to ncp from danjiangkou reservoir the transferred water was used to replenish reservoirs recharge aquifers satisfy domestic industrial and ecological demands the snwd mr is probably the main driver for increasing surface water storage in the monitored large reservoirs specifically guanting and miyun are two major surface water reservoirs in water receiving regions meanwhile the increasing storage of danjiangkou aims to guarantee the planned amount of transfer water the expanding volumes of guanting and miyun show that these reservoirs benefit from the snwd mr both directly and indirectly the amount of transferred water 30 km3 is roughly equivalent to ca 0 92 cm yr over the ncp during 2015 2020 using the total volume divided by the operation period of snwdp mr and area of ncp this explains why no evident change in the long term trend of gws is found however the allocation of transferred water is unevenly distributed as beijing and surrounding areas have a higher priority to receive water this explains the heterogeneity of gws trends beijing shows slowing gws depletion trends while shandong maintains severe depletion due to the drought and groundwater abstraction we attribute the gws depletion slowdown in beijing and its surrounding areas to the snwd mr and this finding was also supported by the in situ monitoring wells long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 found a recovering gws trend of 1 8 0 7 mm yr during 2015 2018 by analyzing groundwater level data of 617 wells we also noticed that gws continued to significantly decrease in some areas e g shandong it should be noted that satellite observations play a very important role in understanding the bigger picture of gws dynamics at a large scale additionally gws depletion rates are slightly different from those reported in former studies since the boundary of ncp and the period are different for example su et al 2020 reported that gws decreasing trend is 1 14 0 89 cm y in the huang huai hai plain from 2003 to 2015 zhao et al 2019 estimated gws depletion in ncp mainly the sedimentary basin depleted at a rate of 1 7 0 1 cm yr from 2004 to mid 2016 although the area of interest is ncp in this study the hydrological implications of water transfers for the water sources of snwdp mr are important danjiangkou water level surface area and volume were raised before the operation of snwdp mr to satisfy the water delivery targets fig 4 and fig 5 some studies have demonstrated that danjiangkou has significantly changed the flow and thermal regimes of downstream hanjiang river wang et al 2015 j zhao et al 2020 land use land cover wang et al 2020 and ecosystem services h liu et al 2019 further studies of the impacts of snwdp on regional hydrology ecology climate in both diversion region and benefited region are necessary exploiting the monitoring datasets provided by multiple satellite missions 5 conclusions in this study multi satellite products and modeled variables were used to investigate the total water storage tws and the dynamics of its components in the north china plain ncp the main conclusions of this study are 1 the spatial pattern of twsa indicates that the water storage continuously decreased in most parts of ncp twsa depletion rate in ncp is 1 04 0 05 cm yr from 2004 to 2020 and shandong has the highest depletion rate 1 63 0 07 cm yr compared with other regions special attention should be paid to the provincial boundary areas because of severe groundwater depletion 2 the sws shows an overall increasing trend at a rate of 0 10 cm yr three large reservoirs i e danjiangkou miyun and guanting reservoirs show a significant increase since 2014 coinciding with the opening of snwdp mr even though the amount of investigated reservoirs is limited to 26 sentinel 3 a b altimetry and optical sar derived surface water extent swe data showed great potential in estimating surface water storage sws in this area 3 groundwater storage gws depletion was estimated as 1 05 0 08 cm yr during 2004 2014 in ncp it has accelerated in 2015 2020 1 88 0 38 cm yr mainly due to the drawdown in henan and shandong conversely gws depletion has slowed down in beijing 0 79 0 44 cm yr and tianjin 1 58 0 70 cm yr thanks to snwdp mr the large water transfer project has contributed to gws recovery and alleviates water stress in parts of ncp this study showcases the value of earth observation datasets in monitoring terrestrial freshwater resources which is of great concern in many regions and river basins including the ncp to meet the sustainable development goals the groundwater table must be stabilized therefore timely and continuous monitoring of water dynamics is essential to effectively assess the effects of water resources management interventions big earth observation datasets have proven valuable to facilitate large scale monitoring and are especially useful in the context of climate change and intensive human interventions such as large physical water diversion

3962,due to the huge potential of radar raingauge merged rainfall products for improving quantitative rainfall estimates the expectation of their applications in hydrological simulations has always been high this study investigates the main strengths and limitations of radar raingauge merged rainfall products over traditional radar only and raingauge only rainfall products for discharge simulations in both deterministic and stochastic ways the probability distributed moisture pdm model was used to generate hourly discharge simulations over near natural catchments in england the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method was applied to quantify the uncertainty in river discharge simulated by using different rainfall estimates the results suggest that the use of radar raingauge merged rainfall estimates for hydrological simulations is beneficial even if the quality of radar rainfall is poor and there is a limited number of raingauges furthermore the glue uncertainty analysis show that the posterior parameter distributions not only depend upon the choice of acceptability threshold values but also on the quality of rainfall estimates when increasing the glue threshold value the parameter values are more constrained to a certain range to generate the behavioral runs rainfall estimators with good quality are more tolerant to the range of parameter sets and leading to more equifinality and uncertainty in the parameters particularly for a rainfall dependent parameter this suggests that any factors affecting the quality of the rainfall estimates will have an impact on the parameter uncertainty and hence discharge simulations keywords precipitation radar raingauge merging discharge simulations uncertainty pdm glue 1 introduction hydrological forecasting is considered as one of the most important applications of radar rainfall observations krajewski and smith 2002 smith et al 2007 delrieu et al 2009 nanding et al 2014 rico ramirez et al 2015b ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 park et al 2019 hwang et al 2020 knöll et al 2020 paz et al 2020 wijayarathne et al 2020a nanding and rico ramirez 2021 shehu and haberlandt 2021 wen et al 2021 wijayarathne et al 2021 this is due to the radar s high spatial e g 1 km or lower and temporal resolutions e g 5 min or lower and large areal coverage e g range of 75 km or further that provide unique information on the dynamics of precipitation events in space and time which are difficult to obtain through a network of raingauges however practical applications of radar in hydrological studies have been limited by a number of error sources and uncertainties in the radar rainfall estimates cluckie and collier 1991 borga 2002 rico ramirez et al 2005 villarini and krajewski 2010 bringi et al 2011 islam et al 2012 villarini et al 2014 dai et al 2015 hall et al 2015 rico ramirez et al 2015a qi et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017b huang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 chang et al 2021 kim et al 2021 pickering et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 a variety of techniques have been developed to improve the quantitative rainfall estimation by merging radar and raingauges rainfall measurements these merging techniques range from non statistical methods such as the brandes spatial adjustment brandes 1975 and range dependent adjustment to more complex statistical techniques such as co kriging krajewski 1987 conditional merging sinclair and pegram 2005 bayesian merging wang et al 2015 kriging with radar based error correction kre ehret et al 2008 and kriging with external drift ked haberlandt 2007 velasco forero et al 2009 delrieu et al 2014 typically the geostatistical merging methods produced better rainfall estimates compared to radar only and raingauge only methods goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 nanding et al 2015 adhikary et al 2017 foehn et al 2018 barton et al 2020 and the benefits of radar gauge merged rainfall products increase with increasing the number of raingauges used in the merging goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 jewell and gaussiat 2015 nanding et al 2015 furthermore other studies have also examined the impacts of different factors on the quality of radar raingauge merged rainfall products such as data quality berndt et al 2014 rabiei and haberlandt 2015 wang et al 2015 accumulation timescales jewell and gaussiat 2015 storm types schiemann et al 2011 nanding et al 2015 data distribution cecinati et al 2017c ro and yoo 2020 yan et al 2021 and variogram model schiemann et al 2011 verworn and haberlandt 2011 dumitrescu et al 2020 applied in the merging scheme however most of these studies demonstrated the strengths and limitations of the merged rainfall products in terms of rain rates or accumulations and only few studies assessed their performances for hydrological applications wang et al 2015 cecinati et al 2017a mckee et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 wijayarathne et al 2020b for example mckee et al 2018 assessed the performance of radar gauge merging methods on the accuracy of flow simulations based on an event based hydrological model over a canadian river basin they also highlighted that the rainfall merging methods improve the accuracy of both rainfall estimates and predicted streamflows but the hydrological gains of rainfall merging depend highly on gauge density precipitation intensity and timestep of adjustment qiu et al 2020 also confirmed that a higher quality of merging products show a better agreement between the observed and simulated runoff for a river basin in northern china based on the case studies in a uk catchment wang et al 2015 suggested that a singularity sensitive bayesian merging method taking into account the non gaussian rainfall structures can better predict urban drainage system s dynamics particularly for peak flows however these studies on hydrological evaluation of radar raingauge merging methods in the literature were based on deterministic analysis or using raingauge data alone for their model calibration the calibration of the model using a single rainfall event may cause bias in simulation outputs and the differences of rainfall estimations from different merging methods may be obscured in the hydrological simulations due to the variability in both meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the catchments and their resulting effects on hydrological prediction much attention has been paid to uncertainty in hydrological predictions these uncertainties mainly result from imperfect knowledge of initial conditions errors associated with input data e g rainfall xu et al 2006 abro et al 2020 nanding et al 2021 and observation data e g river discharge extrapolated from water levels using the rating curve coxon et al 2015 inherent structural errors in models engeland et al 2005 marshall et al 2007 and uncertainty in model parameters jin et al 2010 shen et al 2012 hydrological models are often applied in the framework of a decision making process such as definition of flood risk zones for planning thus it is important to understand the uncertainties in model representation and modellers should take account of such uncertainties into any decision making process

been proposed for quantifying those sources of uncertainty including the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 bayesian techniques duan et al 2007 feyen et al 2007 methods based on cumulative distribution functions pianosi and wagener 2015 and among others generally ua methods can be broadly classified as bayesian and glue methods the former method refers as formal bayesian approach while the later refers as informal bayesian approach the discussions with respect to philosophies of both methods can be found in the literature gupta et al 2003 beven 2006 beven et al 2008 todini 2008 yang et al 2008a vrugt et al 2009 jin et al 2010 li et al 2010 the nature of different sources of uncertainty and the meaning of the uncertainty bounds derived from the glue simulations are revisited in beven and binley 2014 and the controversy mantovan and todini 2006 stedinger et al 2008 clark et al 2011 generated by the glue concept in the past 20 years has also been discussed this study aims to assess the performance of different radar raingauge merged rainfall products for discharge simulations in both deterministic and stochastic ways river discharges were simulated by using the pdm probability distributed moisture model for operational flood predictions in uk catchments and the uncertainties in discharge simulations associated with model parameter uncertainty were quantified by using the glue method the organization of this paper is presented as follows a description of the study catchments and datasets is presented in section 2 this is followed by a description of the hydrological model setup including rainfall inputs definition of objective function and calibration strategies as presented in section 2 3 a brief description of the glue method to produce ensemble streamflow simulations is also included in section 2 4 then the hydrological performance of different rainfall merged products are compared and discussed in section 3 and the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 study catchments three catchments located in the north of england are selected to investigate the performance of the radar raingauge merged rainfall as the inputs for discharge simulations maps of study catchments with surrounding raingauges are shown in fig 1 these near natural catchments with free of direct and significant anthropogenic impacts i e ground water abstraction industrial and agricultural abstractions hydro electric power and storage and reservoir are deemed to have good quality of streamflow observations another important criterion for selecting these catchments was to avoid having catchments with significant snow accumulation and orographic influences hourly discharge observations are provided by the centre for ecology and hydrology ceh through the national river flow archive nrfa and the environment agency these hydrometric datasets have undergone careful validation as described in dixon et al 2013 a set of physical catchment descriptors obtained from the flood estimation handbook feh 2009 are listed in table 1 2 2 rainfall estimates the study catchments are under the umbrella of three c band weather radars hameldon hill high moorsley and ingham and a dense raingauge network maintained by the met office and the environment agency respectively rainguage observation data was provided by the environment agency at the temporal resolution of 15 min the quality of the raingauge data is routinely assessed by using near neighbour comparison daily weather summaries raingauge station history log and radar scans a detailed description of the raingauge quality control procedures is presented in howard et al 2012 the radar rainfall field is a composite product at 5 minute intervals with a spatial resolution of 1 km provided by the uk met office through the british atmospheric data centre badc the automatic pre processing of the weather radar data as part of the uk met office nimrod system addresses a number of sources of errors such as the removal of spurious non meteorological echoes and corrections to account for radar sensitivity errors variations in the vertical profile of reflectivity and radar signal attenuation also the quality of the estimated radar rainfall rates is routinely assessed by comparison with ground truth raingauge measurements more detailed information of the pre processing of the uk radar rainfall composite product was described in harrison et al 2009 the rainfall inputs to the hydrological models are obtained by using different radar raingauge merging techniques such as kriging with radar based error kre correction and kriging with external drift ked for comparison the raingauge only rainfall interpolated by using the ordinary kriging ork radar only rainfall rad and the radar rainfall adjusted by a simple bias correction method mfb are also included in this study the mfb correction is a simple and effective method for adjusting radar based quantitative precipitation estimates wilson 1970 smith and krajewski 1991 harrison et al 2000 chumchean et al 2006 the assumption is that the radar estimates are affected by a uniform systematic error this systematic bias between radar and raingauge rainfall can be adjusted based on an estimation of a single multiplicative factor as the ratio of the accumulated raingauge rainfall and the radar rainfall the mfb correction method applied in this study is an additional correction that is applied to the radar data using the raingauge measurements from the specific region of interest the ordinary kriging ork as the most widely used geostatistical method deals with the spatial interpolation of a random field from observations at several locations it is worth noting that the ork method is not a merging method but it is used as a benchmark to compare against the radar raingauge merging methods in ork the spatial variability of the precipitation field is characterized by a predefined semivariogram model obtained from raingauge observations in this study the estimated parametric semivariogram for the kriging based methods i e ork kre and ked was fitted to a spherical model and assuming that the rainfall field is isotropic the kre method uses radar rainfall fields to estimate the errors associated with the kriging interpolation process first raingauge data and radar measurements at the corresponding raingauge locations are interpolated separately using ork this radar based kriged field is subtracted from the original radar field to compute the errors associated with kriging interpolation then the error field is added to the gauge based kriged field in this way the radar field is incorporated into the gauge interpolated rainfall field a general description of the kre method was originally presented in sinclair and pegram 2005 and later refined in ehret et al 2008 the advantage of the kre technique is that the final merged rainfall field not only follows the spatial structure of the original radar field but also preserves the mean field of the raingauge data however the kre method is more sensitive to the changes in the radar field the ked method is an extension of universal kriging interpolation that allows the incorporation of one or more additional variables that are used as auxiliary information to interpolate the primary variable haberlandt 2007 in this study only radar data is included as an additional variable the basic assumption of ked is that the expected value of the estimated variable has a linear relationship with an additional variable in ked the linear weights employed in the interpolation of raingauge values are further constrained by the spatial association between radar values and raingauge locations therefore in the ked technique the radar data provides the external drift term and it is important that the radar rainfall measurements are highly linearly correlated to the raingauge measurements the kriging methods i e ork kre and ked are more sophisticated methods than the simple radar rainfall adjustment method i e mfb radar raingauge merging techniques kre and ked both rely on the concepts of ork interpolation procedure the main difference between these two merging techniques is that the kre performs the merging process after the ork weights are obtained whereas the ked merging takes place before the ork weights are obtained technical descriptions of these rainfall estimation methods are provided in nanding et al 2015 furthermore for assessing the impacts of the number of raingauges on discharge simulations two raingauge networks with different configurations are used to estimate the mean areal rainfall namely the full raingauge network and the reduced raingauge network the full raingauge network includes all 194 raingauges available in the study region whereas the reduced raingauge network removes the raingauges inside the catchments representing ungauged basins as shown in fig 1 for demonstration purposes the ork rainfall product using the full raingauge network is used as the reference for comparison of different rainfall estimates scatter plots of different rainfall estimates against the reference data are presented in fig 2 specifically the ked estimator shows the best fit to the reference data whereas the rad rainfall estimate shows the lowest skill however the quality of kriging interpolated rainfall estimates depends on the number of available raingauges as expected by reducing the density of the raingauge network the performance of the kriging interpolation methods decreases the kriging interpolated rainfall estimates which have previously shown excellent performance show a significant reduction of the skill for reduced network on the other hand the mfb rainfall estimate appears less affected to variation of raingauge number compared to the kriging rainfall estimators for instance the r 2 of mfb rainfall is 0 67 when using the full network whereas the r 2 is 0 63 when using the reduced network for the river lune similar results are obtained for the performance of the different rainfall estimators in terms of rmse scores note that the statistical scores of rad does not change with the raingauge network density for each catchment 2 3 discharge simulations the probability distributed moisture pdm model moore 1985 was used to simulate river discharges which has been used operationally in the national flood forecasting system nffs by the uk s environmental agency the pdm model has also been tested in various catchments throughout the uk cole and moore 2008 kay et al 2009 arnell 2011 weerts et al 2011 arnell et al 2014 and abroad arnell 1999 cabus 2008 ferket et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 formulations of the pdm model are derived based on mass balance principles with the addition of rainfall losses to evaporation drainage to groundwater recharge and the production of direct runoff the direct runoff and recharge are routed via surface and subsurface storages representing fast and slow pathways to the basin outlet respectively the list of the pdm model parameters is summarized in table 2 discharge simulations are conducted at hourly time step during 2006 2010 in this study so the meteorological and hydrological data as inputs for rainfall runoff model are computed to the required time scale i e hourly the pdm model not only require rainfall inputs but also air temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet pet is computed by using the fao penman monteith algorithm allen et al 1998 and the required meteorological data for pet estimation e g wind speed solar radiations air temperature air pressure and dew point temperature are obtained from the uk met office integrated data archive system midas land and marine surface stations data the timeseries of data between 1st january 2006 and 30th june 2008 are used for calibrating the hydrological model while the remaining period from 1st july 2008 to 31st december 2010 is used for validation purposes the first six months of each calibration and validation period are used as warm up period and therefore these data periods are disregarded when evaluating the hydrological model performance observed discharges are compared with model simulations by using different rainfall estimates this allows us to evaluate any improvements in river discharge simulations associated with the use of radar raingauge merged rainfall fields 2 4 uncertainty analysis in order to quantify prediction uncertainty of streamflow simulations due to the uncertainty in rainfall inputs the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 is used in this study glue is an effective and general approach for calibration and uncertainty analysis based on monte carlo mc simulation in the past 20 years it has been extensively applied in hydrological and environmental modelling to estimate the uncertainty associated with model outputs and parameter estimates lamb et al 1998 freer et al 2004 muleta and nicklow 2005 mcmichael et al 2006a choi and beven 2007 liu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 di marco et al 2021 liang et al 2021 due to its conceptual simplicity and relative ease of implementation it is worth noting that the glue method uses only parameter uncertainty to represent all sources of errors in the simulations in this study the glue simulations during the calibration period are performed with the sensitivity analysis for everybody safe toolbox pianosi et al 2015 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is chosen as the likelihood function for the glue as in many other studies freer et al 1996 beven and freer 2001 arabi et al 2007 the nse values of 0 6 and 0 7 are set as the threshold values of acceptable run and if the acceptability of each run is below the threshold the run is considered to be non behavioural and that parameter combination is removed from further analysis it is worth noting that the threshold for determining the behavioural solutions is subjectively defined here in this study a large number of sampling sets 10 000 runs are conducted to ensure the sampling of parameter space is dense enough to provide sufficient precision of the statistics inferred from the glue simulations due to the lack of a prior distribution of parameter values a uniform distribution is chosen for its simplicity the range of each parameter is divided into overlapping intervals based on equal probability and parameters are identically chosen from spanning the feasible parameter range the values of each parameter are randomly selected from each interval the summary of parameters for the pdm model and their ranges of values for model calibration are listed in tables 2 these ranges of parameter values are selected based on previous research seibert 1997 moore 2007 liu and han 2013 given a large number of behavioural runs a meaningful cumulative weighted distribution of predictions may then be evaluated to obtain prediction quantiles at any time step during the validation period the 90 confidence interval 90 c i by using predefined quantiles i e 5th and 95th percentiles from the glue output cumulative distribution function cdf was applied to analyse the model prediction uncertainty the agreement between the observed and the 90 c i of simulated discharge is evaluated by other performance indicators such as the maximum nse mnse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the percent of observations bracketed by the 90 c i p 90 c i li et al 2009 the average relative interval length aril jin et al 2010 and the acceptable sample rate asr these indices are defined as follows 1 asr n bs n ts 100 where n bs is the number of behavioural samples obtained by the glue method for the hydrological model and n ts is total 10 000 samples here 2 p 90 c i n n 100 where n is the number of time steps when observations are captured in 90 c i and n is the total number of time steps 3 aril 1 n ub 90 c i lb 90 c i obs where ub 90 c i and lb 90 c i are the upper and lower boundary values of 90 c i and obs represents the observed discharge at each time step 4 mnse max i 1 n bs nse i where i is the acceptable sample index and the nse indicates the nash sutcliffe coefficient the aril measures the mean width of the 90 c i uncertainty boundaries with relative to observed discharge for the timeseries whereas the p 90 c i is simply defined to represent the percent of observations enveloped by the 90 c i uncertainty bands for the entire timeseries the goodness of fit of the model simulation to the observed discharge is determined on the basis of the scores of aril to 0 the p 90 c i to 100 and the mnse should be as close to 1 as possible 3 results and discussions 3 1 hydrological modeling performances figs 3 and 4 show the split violin plots of positive nse values obtained with model configurations of different rainfall products raingauge networks for both calibration and validation periods when using the glue acceptability thresholds of 0 6 and 0 7 respectively the violin shape plot represents the density estimate of the nse scores within a split violin plot the left side represents the distributions of nse scores for the calibration period while the right side is for the validation period the horizontal lines from the top represent the 75th percentile median and 25th percentile respectively the median nse scores of ked and ork products are relatively higher than the other products for all raingauge networks except for river ribble the radar based rainfall products show the worst in terms of median nse scores for both calibration and validation periods interestingly the hydrological performance of kre rainfall input is inconsistent between the calibration and validation period specifically for most of the cases the median nse values of kre are comparable to those of ork and ked during the calibration period but it is obviously worse than the other two rainfall estimates during the validation period this could be due to the differences in kre and ked merging processes although both methods rely on the concepts of kriging interpolation ork method specifically the ked uses radar rainfall fields as additional constraints and merging procedure takes place before the ork weights are obtained whereas the kre performs the merging process after the ork weights are obtained and uses the radar to gauge ratio to produce merged output therefore the kre method is more sensitive to the changes in the radar rainfall field and its hydrological performance somehow follows the hydrological performances of radar only product and worse than the ork and ked products in most of the cases the consistency of hydrological performances in both calibration and validation period would help us to further evaluate the quality of rainfall estimates and provide an additional perspective on identifying the best available rainfall estimates at catchment scale the maximum nse mnse scores of different rainfall products for acceptability thresholds of 0 6 and 0 7 are also presented in table 3 and 4 respectively the results show that the ked consistently show higher mnse values than other rainfall inputs regardless of raingauge network configurations the hydrological performances of raingauge only rainfall estimates i e ork are comparable to the performances of ked rainfall estimates the radar only rainfall i e rad or simple radar adjusted rainfall estimates i e mfb are the worst in terms of mnse values particularly for the river lune this is because the catchment river lune see fig 1 is distant from any of the radars and it is well known that radar errors e g attenuation of the radar signal increase of the sampling volume due to beam broadening beam overshooting the shallow precipitation increase with range harrison et al 2000 rico ramirez 2012 whereas the quality of radar rainfall estimates in the rivers ribble and swale is less affected by the range effects due to proximity of catchment to the radar sites fig 2 as expected by reducing the number of raingauges for radar raingauge merging scheme the hydrological performances of kriging interpolated rainfall estimates i e ork kre and ked decrease compared to their performances when using the full raingauge network for instance for river ribble the mnse values of the ork kre and ked rainfall estimates decrease from 0 89 0 83 and 0 87 for the full raingauge network to the mnse values of 0 73 0 73 and 0 76 respectively for the reduced raingauge network during validation period their hydrological performances are even worse than the radar only rad or the simple radar adjusted rainfall estimates mfb for ungauged catchments this is because the quality of kriging interpolated rainfall estimates decreases with the decrease of raingauge density goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 nanding et al 2015 resulting in poor hydrological performances in contrast for the river lune the ked product outperforms the other rainfall products for streamflow simulations although its quality in rainfall estimates suffers from the reduction of raingauges in the merging process for this ungauged catchment the accuracy of radar only rainfall estimates seems to be worse than its quality in the other catchments due to the range effects while the quality of raingauge only rainfall estimates also degrades because of the reduced number of raingauges this implies that even if the quality of both radar and raingauge rainfall data are poor merging them can help to improve the streamflow simulations with better rainfall estimates 3 2 errors in discharge simulations fig 5 shows the cumulative errors in simulated discharges for the pdm models with the maximum nse values the vertical lines split the calibration on the left side and validation on the right side periods it can be seen that errors in simulated discharges vary between rainfall estimators catchments and network densities the models using different rainfall estimates clearly underestimate the observed discharge except for the model using the mfb rainfall estimates for the river swale when using the full raingauge network specifically different rainfall estimators show larger errors in their simulated discharges for the river lune regardless of network configurations in comparison they generate lower errors for the river ribble particularly when using full raingauge network which is also reflected in their higher nse values fig 4 radar only rainfall generally shows the larger errors in simulated discharges compared to the other rainfall estimators for the rivers lune and swale however for the ungauged version of the catchment for the river ribble the radar only rainfallgenerates the lowest errors in simulated discharges this is because the catchment of the river ribble is close to the radar site and therefore the radar rainfall quality is less affected by the range effects fig 1 meanwhile the remaining rainfall estimates particularly the kriging interpolated rainfall estimators e g ork kre ked generate much larger errors when reducing the number of gauges for the interpolation procedures it seems that kriging based rainfall estimators are more sensitive to the number of raingauges for the river ribble compared to the other catchments showing clear differences in cumulative errors between the full and reduced raingauge networks comparing the other kriging interpolated rainfall products the ked product is more sensitive to the number of raingauges used in the interpolation showing much larger deterioration of discharge errors due to the removal of raingauges inside the catchments fig 5b e however for the river swale the ork and kre rainfall products perform better when using the reduced network compared to their performances when using the full network fig 5a d this could be due to the fact that the model parameters are calibrated using the nse scores as the likelihood function instead of errors in simulated discharges so the best model does not necessarily produce discharge simulations with the lowest errors as shown in table 3 both methods perform better when using the full network compared to the reduced network with the higher mnse asr and p 90 c i moreover it is worth noting that the figure is showing the cumulative errors so the random under over estimations in simulate discharges are cancelled out through the accumulation of errors during the timeseries and finally showing less cumulative errors moreover it can be seen that the rad simulated discharges severally underestimate the observations for the river lune fig 5c f which is in line with its lower mnse scores fig 4c f this also confirms that the quality of rad rainfall estimates is affected by the range effects leading to the larger errors in simulated discharges similarly the errors in mfb simulated discharges are much larger for the river lune compared to those errors for the other two catchments although the mfb rainfall product also incorporate raingauge observations its hydrological performance is less dependent on the number of raingauges which is consistent with its performance in terms of rainfall accumulations as reported in nanding et al 2015 3 3 uncertainty in discharge simulations all performance indicators i e asr mnse aril and p 90 c i of the glue uncertainty analysis with an acceptability threshold of 0 6 and 0 7 are summarised in table 3 and 4 respectively the higher the value for aril the wider the 90 c i uncertainty bounds derived from the glue simulations which increase the chance of observations being captured by ensemble simulations the best glue simulation is a trade off between narrow uncertainty bound low aril score and high coverage of observations high p 90 c i score as shown in fig 6 the rainfall product with the best hydrological performance should be located at the upper left corner as much as possible in general the ked shows better hydrological performances in terms of glue uncertainty analysis i e higher p 90 c i and lower aril regardless of the choice of threshold values and raingauges networks it is expected that the scores of both aril and p 90 c i increase with the decrease of the acceptability threshold this is because more parameter sets have been retained as behavioural runs with lower threshold value of likelihood measure and the resulting uncertainty in the glue simulations due to parameter uncertainty is larger specifically when using the full raingauge network to estimate the mean areal rainfall the ork kre and ked rainfall estimators generally show larger uncertainty in the glue simulations compared to the rad and mfb rainfall products which is reflected in the higher values of aril this could be explained by the fact that more parameter sets can interact with higher quality of rainfall estimates e g kre and ekd and then produce better simulations with the values of the likelihood measure above the threshold however for ungauged catchments the kriging interpolated rainfall estimators show less uncertainty in glue discharge simulations which is reflected by lower scores of aril in contrast the mfb rainfall estimates show less dependency on the configuration of raingauge network in terms of uncertainty in glue ensemble simulations however this does not mean that rainfall estimates with poor quality leads to a narrower uncertainty bands of simulated discharge unlike the method used in this study the glue behavioral runs can be determined by using a prefixed percentage of acceptable runs from all samples mcmichael et al 2006b yang et al 2008b so from another aspect to reach a given asr rainfall estimates with poor quality should have a lower threshold of nse scores for retaining adequate number of acceptable parameter sets compared to the higher quality of rainfall estimates tables s1 and s2 supplementary materials show the minimum nse scores obtained by different rainfall products to retain a prefixed asr value of 5 for both calibration and validation periods furthermore the glue simulations with the same asr could generate 90 c i uncertainty bands with different widths and locations li et al 2010 note that the statistical scores of the glue simulations using rad rainfall do not change with regards to the change of raingauge network configuration and thus these plots are the same for different raingauge networks in fig 6 the decrease of asr is remarkable with the increase of threshold value from 0 6 to 0 7 for each model table 3 and 4 it is obvious that the asr highly depends on the choice of threshold value the glue simulations of the model using ork kre and ked also show dependency on the number of raingauges used for interpolation procedure similar to p 90 c i and aril the asr scores of the models that use ork kre and ked rainfall decrease with the decrease of raingauge network density the mfb rainfall estimates are less sensitive to the change in the number of raingauges in comparison to the other rainfall estimators a visual inspection of the flow hydrographs constrained by 90 c i of glue ensemble simulations for the river swale when using the full and reduced raingauge network is presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively these figures show that the glue uncertainty bounds with the threshold value of 0 6 red shadings is visibly wider than those glue simulations with the threshold value of 0 7 blue shadings and the resulting coverages of observations are higher this is because more parameter sets have been retained as behavioural runs with lower threshold value of acceptability which is reflected in the higher value of asr and resulting in larger uncertainty boundaries the 90 c i uncertainty bounds of the models except for the rad and mfb generally capture the observed discharges when using the full raingauge network particularly for the models using the kriging interpolated rainfall estimators i e ork kre and ked the radar rainfall estimates perform better than the radar raingauge merged rainfall i e kre and ked when using the reduced raingauge network in terms of peak discharges however for the river lune the hydrological performance of radar only rainfall has been clearly improved by merging radar and raingauge measurements in terms of peak discharge even for the ungauged version of the river lune figures omitted the 90 c i uncertainty bounds obtained from the models using the kriging interpolated products capture the observed discharges when using the full raingauge network fig 7 however for the reduced network they show underestimations of peak discharges for some of the periods the radar based rainfall products rad and mfb poorly replicate the observed discharges showing the underestimations of observed peak discharges and overestimations of baseflows for both full and reduced networks the hydrographs with the 90 c i uncertainty bounds for the rivers ribble and lune are also included in figs s1 s4 supplementary materials models using different rainfall products generally perform better for the river ribble than those simulations for the river lune although they underestimate the observed discharges for both catchments 3 4 uncertainty in model parameters this section shows the effect of rainfall products and threshold values of acceptability on model parameter uncertainty this is achieved by calculating the cumulative distributions of behavioral parameter sets with thresholds of 0 6 and 0 7 for the glue ensemble simulations using different rainfall inputs the cdfs of each model for the river ribble when using the full and reduced raingauge networks are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the flatter shape of cdf curve indicates that the parameters values are more uniformly distributed across the feasible range of values it can be seen that the parameter distributions vary between different rainfall estimators and threshold values of acceptability the cdfs of each rainfall estimator are flatter for a low threshold value of 0 6 than for a high threshold value of 0 7 regardless of rainfall product this implies that when increasing the glue threshold value parameter values are more constrained to a certain range to generate the behavioral runs in other words the lower the threshold value the more parameter sets are retained as behavioral runs and hence the more uniformly distributed parameter values indicating the higher degree of equifinality in model parameters this is in line with the findings of li et al 2010 that the larger the asr the flatter the shape of the parameter posterior distribution the parameter posterior distribution also shows dependency on model parameter the cdfs of time delay τ d and exponent of recharge function b g are distributed more uniformly across the feasible range of values than the rainfall factor f c which indicates higher degree of equifinality or uncertainty and more difficulty in constraining the parameter range for time delay τ d moreover the differences in cdf curves between rainfall estimators are larger for rainfall factor f c compared to those differences for the other parameters regardless of acceptability thresholds whereas for parameters of time delay τ d and exponent of recharge b g cdfs curves between rainfall estimators are similar for each acceptability threshold when using the full raingauge network fig 9 however for the reduced raingauge network these two parameters show larger differences in cdf curves between rainfall estimators particularly for a high acceptability threshold of 0 7 fig 10 it is worth noting that the cdfs for the radar only rainfall product remains the same for different raingauge networks moreover different rainfall estimators also show various parameters uncertainty in glue simulations generally the cdfs of kriging interpolated rainfall tend to be distributed more uniformly across the feasible range of values figs 9 and 10 this indicates that those rainfall estimators with good performance are more tolerant to the range of behavioral parameter sets and leading to more equifinality and uncertainty in parameter particularly for a rainfall dependent parameter e g rainfall factor f c this implies the dominant effects of rainfall quality on parameter uncertainty the cdfs of parameter uncertainty for the river lune when using the full and reduced raingaugenetworks are also plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively it can be seen that when the threshold changes from 0 7 to 0 6 more samples are retained as behavioral parameter sets and the resulting cumulative distributions for those parameter sets are much flatter particularly for the model using rad rainfall and mfb rainfall in contrast the cumulative distributions of behavioral parameter sets for kriging interpolated rainfall estimates i e ork kre and ked are less affected by the change of threshold values this can be explained by the fact that the ork kre and ked is better than the rad and mfb in terms of rainfall estimation and this enables them to retain more parameter sets with the likelihood measure above the threshold values however the case is different for the models that use the reduced number of raingauges for rainfall estimations as shown in fig 12 the cdf curves of the model using different rainfall estimates are discrete particularly for the threshold value of 0 7 this is because the quality of rainfall estimates decreases with decreasing number of raingauges used for estimating the mean areal rainfall and the resulting behavioral parameter sets are less with a high threshold i e 0 7 of likelihood measure in addition the cdfs of parameter sets for the rad rainfall is much flatter and smoother for the river ribble than for the river lune this could be another indication that due to the proximity of the catchment to the nearest radar site i e hameldon hill the quality of the rad rainfall is better to produce more behavioral parameter sets with the likelihood function above the predefined threshold value in overall these results demonstrate that the cdfs of the glue simulations using different rainfall estimators not only depend upon the choice of threshold values but also the quality of rainfall estimates and parameter itself this suggests that any factors affecting the quality of the rainfall estimates will have impacts on the estimation of glue parameter uncertainty 4 conclusions this study investigates the main strengths and limitations of radar raingauge merged rainfall products over traditional radar only and raingauge only rainfall products for discharge simulations in both deterministic and stochastic ways hourly discharges are simulated by using the pdm model in uk catchments and the uncertainty assessment is conducted using the glue method with an acceptability threshold of 0 6 and 0 7 for behaviour runs the results show that the pdm model using the ked rainfall input consistently shows higher mnse values than other rainfall estimators regardless of raingauge network configurations the hydrological performances of raingauge only rainfall estimates i e ork are comparable to the performances of ked rainfall estimates the radar only rainfall i e rad or simple radar adjusted rainfall estimates i e mfb are the worst in terms of mnse values particularly for the river lune this is because the quality of radar rainfall estimates in the river lune is largely affected by the radar range effects however by incorporating raingauge measurements hydrological performances of radar only rainfall have been improved dramatically however for the river ribble where hydrological performances of radar rainfall are good enough and the improvements in discharge simulations by merging radar and raingauge is limited in contrast the merging procedure improve the hydrological performance of raingauge only rainfall estimators e g ork for the ungauged version of the river ribble similar findings can also be observed based on the results of cumulative errors in simulated discharges these results suggest that when the quality of both radar and raingauge rainfall data are poor merging them can help to improve the streamflow simulations with better rainfall estimates moreover the consistency in hydrological performances between calibration and validation period would help us to further evaluate the quality of rainfall estimates and provide an additional perspective on defining the best available rainfall estimates at catchment scale the glue uncertainty analysis shows that the posterior parameter distributions of the glue simulations not only depend upon the choice of threshold values but also the quality of rainfall estimates and parameter itself when increasing the glue threshold value parameter values are more constrained to a certain range to generate the behavioral runs in other words the lower the threshold value the more parameter sets are retained as behavioral runs and hence the more uniformly distributed parameter values indicating the higher degree of equifinality in model parameters moreover rainfall estimators with good quality e g ked are more tolerant to the range of behavioral parameter sets and leading to more equifinality and uncertainty in parameter particularly for a rainfall dependent parameter e g rainfall factor f c this suggests that any factors affecting the quality of the rainfall estimates will have impacts on the parameter uncertainty and hence discharge simulations since the spatial rainfall variability across the catchments is not taken into account with the lumped version of the pdm model this could potentially diminish the performance of the merged rainfall products e g kre and ked for getting the amount and timing of peaks especially when there are large rainfall gradients across the catchment e g during convective precipitation besides the use of distributed hydrological models is strongly recommended for future work for spatially detailed hydrological prediction and flood forecasting data availability streamflow and rain gauge data

3962,due to the huge potential of radar raingauge merged rainfall products for improving quantitative rainfall estimates the expectation of their applications in hydrological simulations has always been high this study investigates the main strengths and limitations of radar raingauge merged rainfall products over traditional radar only and raingauge only rainfall products for discharge simulations in both deterministic and stochastic ways the probability distributed moisture pdm model was used to generate hourly discharge simulations over near natural catchments in england the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method was applied to quantify the uncertainty in river discharge simulated by using different rainfall estimates the results suggest that the use of radar raingauge merged rainfall estimates for hydrological simulations is beneficial even if the quality of radar rainfall is poor and there is a limited number of raingauges furthermore the glue uncertainty analysis show that the posterior parameter distributions not only depend upon the choice of acceptability threshold values but also on the quality of rainfall estimates when increasing the glue threshold value the parameter values are more constrained to a certain range to generate the behavioral runs rainfall estimators with good quality are more tolerant to the range of parameter sets and leading to more equifinality and uncertainty in the parameters particularly for a rainfall dependent parameter this suggests that any factors affecting the quality of the rainfall estimates will have an impact on the parameter uncertainty and hence discharge simulations keywords precipitation radar raingauge merging discharge simulations uncertainty pdm glue 1 introduction hydrological forecasting is considered as one of the most important applications of radar rainfall observations krajewski and smith 2002 smith et al 2007 delrieu et al 2009 nanding et al 2014 rico ramirez et al 2015b ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 park et al 2019 hwang et al 2020 knöll et al 2020 paz et al 2020 wijayarathne et al 2020a nanding and rico ramirez 2021 shehu and haberlandt 2021 wen et al 2021 wijayarathne et al 2021 this is due to the radar s high spatial e g 1 km or lower and temporal resolutions e g 5 min or lower and large areal coverage e g range of 75 km or further that provide unique information on the dynamics of precipitation events in space and time which are difficult to obtain through a network of raingauges however practical applications of radar in hydrological studies have been limited by a number of error sources and uncertainties in the radar rainfall estimates cluckie and collier 1991 borga 2002 rico ramirez et al 2005 villarini and krajewski 2010 bringi et al 2011 islam et al 2012 villarini et al 2014 dai et al 2015 hall et al 2015 rico ramirez et al 2015a qi et al 2016 cecinati et al 2017b huang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 chang et al 2021 kim et al 2021 pickering et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 a variety of techniques have been developed to improve the quantitative rainfall estimation by merging radar and raingauges rainfall measurements these merging techniques range from non statistical methods such as the brandes spatial adjustment brandes 1975 and range dependent adjustment to more complex statistical techniques such as co kriging krajewski 1987 conditional merging sinclair and pegram 2005 bayesian merging wang et al 2015 kriging with radar based error correction kre ehret et al 2008 and kriging with external drift ked haberlandt 2007 velasco forero et al 2009 delrieu et al 2014 typically the geostatistical merging methods produced better rainfall estimates compared to radar only and raingauge only methods goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 nanding et al 2015 adhikary et al 2017 foehn et al 2018 barton et al 2020 and the benefits of radar gauge merged rainfall products increase with increasing the number of raingauges used in the merging goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 jewell and gaussiat 2015 nanding et al 2015 furthermore other studies have also examined the impacts of different factors on the quality of radar raingauge merged rainfall products such as data quality berndt et al 2014 rabiei and haberlandt 2015 wang et al 2015 accumulation timescales jewell and gaussiat 2015 storm types schiemann et al 2011 nanding et al 2015 data distribution cecinati et al 2017c ro and yoo 2020 yan et al 2021 and variogram model schiemann et al 2011 verworn and haberlandt 2011 dumitrescu et al 2020 applied in the merging scheme however most of these studies demonstrated the strengths and limitations of the merged rainfall products in terms of rain rates or accumulations and only few studies assessed their performances for hydrological applications wang et al 2015 cecinati et al 2017a mckee et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 wijayarathne et al 2020b for example mckee et al 2018 assessed the performance of radar gauge merging methods on the accuracy of flow simulations based on an event based hydrological model over a canadian river basin they also highlighted that the rainfall merging methods improve the accuracy of both rainfall estimates and predicted streamflows but the hydrological gains of rainfall merging depend highly on gauge density precipitation intensity and timestep of adjustment qiu et al 2020 also confirmed that a higher quality of merging products show a better agreement between the observed and simulated runoff for a river basin in northern china based on the case studies in a uk catchment wang et al 2015 suggested that a singularity sensitive bayesian merging method taking into account the non gaussian rainfall structures can better predict urban drainage system s dynamics particularly for peak flows however these studies on hydrological evaluation of radar raingauge merging methods in the literature were based on deterministic analysis or using raingauge data alone for their model calibration the calibration of the model using a single rainfall event may cause bias in simulation outputs and the differences of rainfall estimations from different merging methods may be obscured in the hydrological simulations due to the variability in both meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the catchments and their resulting effects on hydrological prediction much attention has been paid to uncertainty in hydrological predictions these uncertainties mainly result from imperfect knowledge of initial conditions errors associated with input data e g rainfall xu et al 2006 abro et al 2020 nanding et al 2021 and observation data e g river discharge extrapolated from water levels using the rating curve coxon et al 2015 inherent structural errors in models engeland et al 2005 marshall et al 2007 and uncertainty in model parameters jin et al 2010 shen et al 2012 hydrological models are often applied in the framework of a decision making process such as definition of flood risk zones for planning thus it is important to understand the uncertainties in model representation and modellers should take account of such uncertainties into any decision making process pianosi et al 2016 pianosi and wagener 2016 uncertainty analysis ua provides distributions of simulations outputs resulting from a set of inputs data and parameter values a number of ua methods have been proposed for quantifying those sources of uncertainty including the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 bayesian techniques duan et al 2007 feyen et al 2007 methods based on cumulative distribution functions pianosi and wagener 2015 and among others generally ua methods can be broadly classified as bayesian and glue methods the former method refers as formal bayesian approach while the later refers as informal bayesian approach the discussions with respect to philosophies of both methods can be found in the literature gupta et al 2003 beven 2006 beven et al 2008 todini 2008 yang et al 2008a vrugt et al 2009 jin et al 2010 li et al 2010 the nature of different sources of uncertainty and the meaning of the uncertainty bounds derived from the glue simulations are revisited in beven and binley 2014 and the controversy mantovan and todini 2006 stedinger et al 2008 clark et al 2011 generated by the glue concept in the past 20 years has also been discussed this study aims to assess the performance of different radar raingauge merged rainfall products for discharge simulations in both deterministic and stochastic ways river discharges were simulated by using the pdm probability distributed moisture model for operational flood predictions in uk catchments and the uncertainties in discharge simulations associated with model parameter uncertainty were quantified by using the glue method the organization of this paper is presented as follows a description of the study catchments and datasets is presented in section 2 this is followed by a description of the hydrological model setup including rainfall inputs definition of objective function and calibration strategies as presented in section 2 3 a brief description of the glue method to produce ensemble streamflow simulations is also included in section 2 4 then the hydrological performance of different rainfall merged products are compared and discussed in section 3 and the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 data and methods 2 1 study catchments three catchments located in the north of england are selected to investigate the performance of the radar raingauge merged rainfall as the inputs for discharge simulations maps of study catchments with surrounding raingauges are shown in fig 1 these near natural catchments with free of direct and significant anthropogenic impacts i e ground water abstraction industrial and agricultural abstractions hydro electric power and storage and reservoir are deemed to have good quality of streamflow observations another important criterion for selecting these catchments was to avoid having catchments with significant snow accumulation and orographic influences hourly discharge observations are provided by the centre for ecology and hydrology ceh through the national river flow archive nrfa and the environment agency these hydrometric datasets have undergone careful validation as described in dixon et al 2013 a set of physical catchment descriptors obtained from the flood estimation handbook feh 2009 are listed in table 1 2 2 rainfall estimates the study catchments are under the umbrella of three c band weather radars hameldon hill high moorsley and ingham and a dense raingauge network maintained by the met office and the environment agency respectively rainguage observation data was provided by the environment agency at the temporal resolution of 15 min the quality of the raingauge data is routinely assessed by using near neighbour comparison daily weather summaries raingauge station history log and radar scans a detailed description of the raingauge quality control procedures is presented in howard et al 2012 the radar rainfall field is a composite product at 5 minute intervals with a spatial resolution of 1 km provided by the uk met office through the british atmospheric data centre badc the automatic pre processing of the weather radar data as part of the uk met office nimrod system addresses a number of sources of errors such as the removal of spurious non meteorological echoes and corrections to account for radar sensitivity errors variations in the vertical profile of reflectivity and radar signal attenuation also the quality of the estimated radar rainfall rates is routinely assessed by comparison with ground truth raingauge measurements more detailed information of the pre processing of the uk radar rainfall composite product was described in harrison et al 2009 the rainfall inputs to the hydrological models are obtained by using different radar raingauge merging techniques such as kriging with radar based error kre correction and kriging with external drift ked for comparison the raingauge only rainfall interpolated by using the ordinary kriging ork radar only rainfall rad and the radar rainfall adjusted by a simple bias correction method mfb are also included in this study the mfb correction is a simple and effective method for adjusting radar based quantitative precipitation estimates wilson 1970 smith and krajewski 1991 harrison et al 2000 chumchean et al 2006 the assumption is that the radar estimates are affected by a uniform systematic error this systematic bias between radar and raingauge rainfall can be adjusted based on an estimation of a single multiplicative factor as the ratio of the accumulated raingauge rainfall and the radar rainfall the mfb correction method applied in this study is an additional correction that is applied to the radar data using the raingauge measurements from the specific region of interest the ordinary kriging ork as the most widely used geostatistical method deals with the spatial interpolation of a random field from observations at several locations it is worth noting that the ork method is not a merging method but it is used as a benchmark to compare against the radar raingauge merging methods in ork the spatial variability of the precipitation field is characterized by a predefined semivariogram model obtained from raingauge observations in this study the estimated parametric semivariogram for the kriging based methods i e ork kre and ked was fitted to a spherical model and assuming that the rainfall field is isotropic the kre method uses radar rainfall fields to estimate the errors associated with the kriging interpolation process first raingauge data and radar measurements at the corresponding raingauge locations are interpolated separately using ork this radar based kriged field is subtracted from the original radar field to compute the errors associated with kriging interpolation then the error field is added to the gauge based kriged field in this way the radar field is incorporated into the gauge interpolated rainfall field a general description of the kre method was originally presented in sinclair and pegram 2005 and later refined in ehret et al 2008 the advantage of the kre technique is that the final merged rainfall field not only follows the spatial structure of the original radar field but also preserves the mean field of the raingauge data however the kre method is more sensitive to the changes in the radar field the ked method is an extension of universal kriging interpolation that allows the incorporation of one or more additional variables that are used as auxiliary information to interpolate the primary variable haberlandt 2007 in this study only radar data is included as an additional variable the basic assumption of ked is that the expected value of the estimated variable has a linear relationship with an additional variable in ked the linear weights employed in the interpolation of raingauge values are further constrained by the spatial association between radar values and raingauge locations therefore in the ked technique the radar data provides the external drift term and it is important that the radar rainfall measurements are highly linearly correlated to the raingauge measurements the kriging methods i e ork kre and ked are more sophisticated methods than the simple radar rainfall adjustment method i e mfb radar raingauge merging techniques kre and ked both rely on the concepts of ork interpolation procedure the main difference between these two merging techniques is that the kre performs the merging process after the ork weights are obtained whereas the ked merging takes place before the ork weights are obtained technical descriptions of these rainfall estimation methods are provided in nanding et al 2015 furthermore for assessing the impacts of the number of raingauges on discharge simulations two raingauge networks with different configurations are used to estimate the mean areal rainfall namely the full raingauge network and the reduced raingauge network the full raingauge network includes all 194 raingauges available in the study region whereas the reduced raingauge network removes the raingauges inside the catchments representing ungauged basins as shown in fig 1 for demonstration purposes the ork rainfall product using the full raingauge network is used as the reference for comparison of different rainfall estimates scatter plots of different rainfall estimates against the reference data are presented in fig 2 specifically the ked estimator shows the best fit to the reference data whereas the rad rainfall estimate shows the lowest skill however the quality of kriging interpolated rainfall estimates depends on the number of available raingauges as expected by reducing the density of the raingauge network the performance of the kriging interpolation methods decreases the kriging interpolated rainfall estimates which have previously shown excellent performance show a significant reduction of the skill for reduced network on the other hand the mfb rainfall estimate appears less affected to variation of raingauge number compared to the kriging rainfall estimators for instance the r 2 of mfb rainfall is 0 67 when using the full network whereas the r 2 is 0 63 when using the reduced network for the river lune similar results are obtained for the performance of the different rainfall estimators in terms of rmse scores note that the statistical scores of rad does not change with the raingauge network density for each catchment 2 3 discharge simulations the probability distributed moisture pdm model moore 1985 was used to simulate river discharges which has been used operationally in the national flood forecasting system nffs by the uk s environmental agency the pdm model has also been tested in various catchments throughout the uk cole and moore 2008 kay et al 2009 arnell 2011 weerts et al 2011 arnell et al 2014 and abroad arnell 1999 cabus 2008 ferket et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 formulations of the pdm model are derived based on mass balance principles with the addition of rainfall losses to evaporation drainage to groundwater recharge and the production of direct runoff the direct runoff and recharge are routed via surface and subsurface storages representing fast and slow pathways to the basin outlet respectively the list of the pdm model parameters is summarized in table 2 discharge simulations are conducted at hourly time step during 2006 2010 in this study so the meteorological and hydrological data as inputs for rainfall runoff model are computed to the required time scale i e hourly the pdm model not only require rainfall inputs but also air temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet pet is computed by using the fao penman monteith algorithm allen et al 1998 and the required meteorological data for pet estimation e g wind speed solar radiations air temperature air pressure and dew point temperature are obtained from the uk met office integrated data archive system midas land and marine surface stations data the timeseries of data between 1st january 2006 and 30th june 2008 are used for calibrating the hydrological model while the remaining period from 1st july 2008 to 31st december 2010 is used for validation purposes the first six months of each calibration and validation period are used as warm up period and therefore these data periods are disregarded when evaluating the hydrological model performance observed discharges are compared with model simulations by using different rainfall estimates this allows us to evaluate any improvements in river discharge simulations associated with the use of radar raingauge merged rainfall fields 2 4 uncertainty analysis in order to quantify prediction uncertainty of streamflow simulations due to the uncertainty in rainfall inputs the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 is used in this study glue is an effective and general approach for calibration and uncertainty analysis based on monte carlo mc simulation in the past 20 years it has been extensively applied in hydrological and environmental modelling to estimate the uncertainty associated with model outputs and parameter estimates lamb et al 1998 freer et al 2004 muleta and nicklow 2005 mcmichael et al 2006a choi and beven 2007 liu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 di marco et al 2021 liang et al 2021 due to its conceptual simplicity and relative ease of implementation it is worth noting that the glue method uses only parameter uncertainty to represent all sources of errors in the simulations in this study the glue simulations during the calibration period are performed with the sensitivity analysis for everybody safe toolbox pianosi et al 2015 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is chosen as the likelihood function for the glue as in many other studies freer et al 1996 beven and freer 2001 arabi et al 2007 the nse values of 0 6 and 0 7 are set as the threshold values of acceptable run and if the acceptability of each run is below the threshold the run is considered to be non behavioural and that parameter combination is removed from further analysis it is worth noting that the threshold for determining the behavioural solutions is subjectively defined here in this study a large number of sampling sets 10 000 runs are conducted to ensure the sampling of parameter space is dense enough to provide sufficient precision of the statistics inferred from the glue simulations due to the lack of a prior distribution of parameter values a uniform distribution is chosen for its simplicity the range of each parameter is divided into overlapping intervals based on equal probability and parameters are identically chosen from spanning the feasible parameter range the values of each parameter are randomly selected from each interval the summary of parameters for the pdm model and their ranges of values for model calibration are listed in tables 2 these ranges of parameter values are selected based on previous research seibert 1997 moore 2007 liu and han 2013 given a large number of behavioural runs a meaningful cumulative weighted distribution of predictions may then be evaluated to obtain prediction quantiles at any time step during the validation period the 90 confidence interval 90 c i by using predefined quantiles i e 5th and 95th percentiles from the glue output cumulative distribution function cdf was applied to analyse the model prediction uncertainty the agreement between the observed and the 90 c i of simulated discharge is evaluated by other performance indicators such as the maximum nse mnse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the percent of observations bracketed by the 90 c i p 90 c i li et al 2009 the average relative interval length aril jin et al 2010 and the acceptable sample rate asr these indices are defined as follows 1 asr n bs n ts 100 where n bs is the number of behavioural samples obtained by the glue method for the hydrological model and n ts is total 10 000 samples here 2 p 90 c i n n 100 where n is the number of time steps when observations are captured in 90 c i and n is the total number of time steps 3 aril 1 n ub 90 c i lb 90 c i obs where ub 90 c i and lb 90 c i are the upper and lower boundary values of 90 c i and obs represents the observed discharge at each time step 4 mnse max i 1 n bs nse i where i is the acceptable sample index and the nse indicates the nash sutcliffe coefficient the aril measures the mean width of the 90 c i uncertainty boundaries with relative to observed discharge for the timeseries whereas the p 90 c i is simply defined to represent the percent of observations enveloped by the 90 c i uncertainty bands for the entire timeseries the goodness of fit of the model simulation to the observed discharge is determined on the basis of the scores of aril to 0 the p 90 c i to 100 and the mnse should be as close to 1 as possible 3 results and discussions 3 1 hydrological modeling performances figs 3 and 4 show the split violin plots of positive nse values obtained with model configurations of different rainfall products raingauge networks for both calibration and validation periods when using the glue acceptability thresholds of 0 6 and 0 7 respectively the violin shape plot represents the density estimate of the nse scores within a split violin plot the left side represents the distributions of nse scores for the calibration period while the right side is for the validation period the horizontal lines from the top represent the 75th percentile median and 25th percentile respectively the median nse scores of ked and ork products are relatively higher than the other products for all raingauge networks except for river ribble the radar based rainfall products show the worst in terms of median nse scores for both calibration and validation periods interestingly the hydrological performance of kre rainfall input is inconsistent between the calibration and validation period specifically for most of the cases the median nse values of kre are comparable to those of ork and ked during the calibration period but it is obviously worse than the other two rainfall estimates during the validation period this could be due to the differences in kre and ked merging processes although both methods rely on the concepts of kriging interpolation ork method specifically the ked uses radar rainfall fields as additional constraints and merging procedure takes place before the ork weights are obtained whereas the kre performs the merging process after the ork weights are obtained and uses the radar to gauge ratio to produce merged output therefore the kre method is more sensitive to the changes in the radar rainfall field and its hydrological performance somehow follows the hydrological performances of radar only product and worse than the ork and ked products in most of the cases the consistency of hydrological performances in both calibration and validation period would help us to further evaluate the quality of rainfall estimates and provide an additional perspective on identifying the best available rainfall estimates at catchment scale the maximum nse mnse scores of different rainfall products for acceptability thresholds of 0 6 and 0 7 are also presented in table 3 and 4 respectively the results show that the ked consistently show higher mnse values than other rainfall inputs regardless of raingauge network configurations the hydrological performances of raingauge only rainfall estimates i e ork are comparable to the performances of ked rainfall estimates the radar only rainfall i e rad or simple radar adjusted rainfall estimates i e mfb are the worst in terms of mnse values particularly for the river lune this is because the catchment river lune see fig 1 is distant from any of the radars and it is well known that radar errors e g attenuation of the radar signal increase of the sampling volume due to beam broadening beam overshooting the shallow precipitation increase with range harrison et al 2000 rico ramirez 2012 whereas the quality of radar rainfall estimates in the rivers ribble and swale is less affected by the range effects due to proximity of catchment to the radar sites fig 2 as expected by reducing the number of raingauges for radar raingauge merging scheme the hydrological performances of kriging interpolated rainfall estimates i e ork kre and ked decrease compared to their performances when using the full raingauge network for instance for river ribble the mnse values of the ork kre and ked rainfall estimates decrease from 0 89 0 83 and 0 87 for the full raingauge network to the mnse values of 0 73 0 73 and 0 76 respectively for the reduced raingauge network during validation period their hydrological performances are even worse than the radar only rad or the simple radar adjusted rainfall estimates mfb for ungauged catchments this is because the quality of kriging interpolated rainfall estimates decreases with the decrease of raingauge density goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 nanding et al 2015 resulting in poor hydrological performances in contrast for the river lune the ked product outperforms the other rainfall products for streamflow simulations although its quality in rainfall estimates suffers from the reduction of raingauges in the merging process for this ungauged catchment the accuracy of radar only rainfall estimates seems to be worse than its quality in the other catchments due to the range effects while the quality of raingauge only rainfall estimates also degrades because of the reduced number of raingauges this implies that even if the quality of both radar and raingauge rainfall data are poor merging them can help to improve the streamflow simulations with better rainfall estimates 3 2 errors in discharge simulations fig 5 shows the cumulative errors in simulated discharges for the pdm models with the maximum nse values the vertical lines split the calibration on the left side and validation on the right side periods it can be seen that errors in simulated discharges vary between rainfall estimators catchments and network densities the models using different rainfall estimates clearly underestimate the observed discharge except for the model using the mfb rainfall estimates for the river swale when using the full raingauge network specifically different rainfall estimators show larger errors in their simulated discharges for the river lune regardless of network configurations in comparison they generate lower errors for the river ribble particularly when using full raingauge network which is also reflected in their higher nse values fig 4 radar only rainfall generally shows the larger errors in simulated discharges compared to the other rainfall estimators for the rivers lune and swale however for the ungauged version of the catchment for the river ribble the radar only rainfallgenerates the lowest errors in simulated discharges this is because the catchment of the river ribble is close to the radar site and therefore the radar rainfall quality is less affected by the range effects fig 1 meanwhile the remaining rainfall estimates particularly the kriging interpolated rainfall estimators e g ork kre ked generate much larger errors when reducing the number of gauges for the interpolation procedures it seems that kriging based rainfall estimators are more sensitive to the number of raingauges for the river ribble compared to the other catchments showing clear differences in cumulative errors between the full and reduced raingauge networks comparing the other kriging interpolated rainfall products the ked product is more sensitive to the number of raingauges used in the interpolation showing much larger deterioration of discharge errors due to the removal of raingauges inside the catchments fig 5b e however for the river swale the ork and kre rainfall products perform better when using the reduced network compared to their performances when using the full network fig 5a d this could be due to the fact that the model parameters are calibrated using the nse scores as the likelihood function instead of errors in simulated discharges so the best model does not necessarily produce discharge simulations with the lowest errors as shown in table 3 both methods perform better when using the full network compared to the reduced network with the higher mnse asr and p 90 c i moreover it is worth noting that the figure is showing the cumulative errors so the random under over estimations in simulate discharges are cancelled out through the accumulation of errors during the timeseries and finally showing less cumulative errors moreover it can be seen that the rad simulated discharges severally underestimate the observations for the river lune fig 5c f which is in line with its lower mnse scores fig 4c f this also confirms that the quality of rad rainfall estimates is affected by the range effects leading to the larger errors in simulated discharges similarly the errors in mfb simulated discharges are much larger for the river lune compared to those errors for the other two catchments although the mfb rainfall product also incorporate raingauge observations its hydrological performance is less dependent on the number of raingauges which is consistent with its performance in terms of rainfall accumulations as reported in nanding et al 2015 3 3 uncertainty in discharge simulations all performance indicators i e asr mnse aril and p 90 c i of the glue uncertainty analysis with an acceptability threshold of 0 6 and 0 7 are summarised in table 3 and 4 respectively the higher the value for aril the wider the 90 c i uncertainty bounds derived from the glue simulations which increase the chance of observations being captured by ensemble simulations the best glue simulation is a trade off between narrow uncertainty bound low aril score and high coverage of observations high p 90 c i score as shown in fig 6 the rainfall product with the best hydrological performance should be located at the upper left corner as much as possible in general the ked shows better hydrological performances in terms of glue uncertainty analysis i e higher p 90 c i and lower aril regardless of the choice of threshold values and raingauges networks it is expected that the scores of both aril and p 90 c i increase with the decrease of the acceptability threshold this is because more parameter sets have been retained as behavioural runs with lower threshold value of likelihood measure and the resulting uncertainty in the glue simulations due to parameter uncertainty is larger specifically when using the full raingauge network to estimate the mean areal rainfall the ork kre and ked rainfall estimators generally show larger uncertainty in the glue simulations compared to the rad and mfb rainfall products which is reflected in the higher values of aril this could be explained by the fact that more parameter sets can interact with higher quality of rainfall estimates e g kre and ekd and then produce better simulations with the values of the likelihood measure above the threshold however for ungauged catchments the kriging interpolated rainfall estimators show less uncertainty in glue discharge simulations which is reflected by lower scores of aril in contrast the mfb rainfall estimates show less dependency on the configuration of raingauge network in terms of uncertainty in glue ensemble simulations however this does not mean that rainfall estimates with poor quality leads to a narrower uncertainty bands of simulated discharge unlike the method used in this study the glue behavioral runs can be determined by using a prefixed percentage of acceptable runs from all samples mcmichael et al 2006b yang et al 2008b so from another aspect to reach a given asr rainfall estimates with poor quality should have a lower threshold of nse scores for retaining adequate number of acceptable parameter sets compared to the higher quality of rainfall estimates tables s1 and s2 supplementary materials show the minimum nse scores obtained by different rainfall products to retain a prefixed asr value of 5 for both calibration and validation periods furthermore the glue simulations with the same asr could generate 90 c i uncertainty bands with different widths and locations li et al 2010 note that the statistical scores of the glue simulations using rad rainfall do not change with regards to the change of raingauge network configuration and thus these plots are the same for different raingauge networks in fig 6 the decrease of asr is remarkable with the increase of threshold value from 0 6 to 0 7 for each model table 3 and 4 it is obvious that the asr highly depends on the choice of threshold value the glue simulations of the model using ork kre and ked also show dependency on the number of raingauges used for interpolation procedure similar to p 90 c i and aril the asr scores of the models that use ork kre and ked rainfall decrease with the decrease of raingauge network density the mfb rainfall estimates are less sensitive to the change in the number of raingauges in comparison to the other rainfall estimators a visual inspection of the flow hydrographs constrained by 90 c i of glue ensemble simulations for the river swale when using the full and reduced raingauge network is presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively these figures show that the glue uncertainty bounds with the threshold value of 0 6 red shadings is visibly wider than those glue simulations with the threshold value of 0 7 blue shadings and the resulting coverages of observations are higher this is because more parameter sets have been retained as behavioural runs with lower threshold value of acceptability which is reflected in the higher value of asr and resulting in larger uncertainty boundaries the 90 c i uncertainty bounds of the models except for the rad and mfb generally capture the observed discharges when using the full raingauge network particularly for the models using the kriging interpolated rainfall estimators i e ork kre and ked the radar rainfall estimates perform better than the radar raingauge merged rainfall i e kre and ked when using the reduced raingauge network in terms of peak discharges however for the river lune the hydrological performance of radar only rainfall has been clearly improved by merging radar and raingauge measurements in terms of peak discharge even for the ungauged version of the river lune figures omitted the 90 c i uncertainty bounds obtained from the models using the kriging interpolated products capture the observed discharges when using the full raingauge network fig 7 however for the reduced network they show underestimations of peak discharges for some of the periods the radar based rainfall products rad and mfb poorly replicate the observed discharges showing the underestimations of observed peak discharges and overestimations of baseflows for both full and reduced networks the hydrographs with the 90 c i uncertainty bounds for the rivers ribble and lune are also included in figs s1 s4 supplementary materials models using different rainfall products generally perform better for the river ribble than those simulations for the river lune although they underestimate the observed discharges for both catchments 3 4 uncertainty in model parameters this section shows the effect of rainfall products and threshold values of acceptability on model parameter uncertainty this is achieved by calculating the cumulative distributions of behavioral parameter sets with thresholds of 0 6 and 0 7 for the glue ensemble simulations using different rainfall inputs the cdfs of each model for the river ribble when using the full and reduced raingauge networks are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the flatter shape of cdf curve indicates that the parameters values are more uniformly distributed across the feasible range of values it can be seen that the parameter distributions vary between different rainfall estimators and threshold values of acceptability the cdfs of each rainfall estimator are flatter for a low threshold value of 0 6 than for a high threshold value of 0 7 regardless of rainfall product this implies that when increasing the glue threshold value parameter values are more constrained to a certain range to generate the behavioral runs in other words the lower the threshold value the more parameter sets are retained as behavioral runs and hence the more uniformly distributed parameter values indicating the higher degree of equifinality in model parameters this is in line with the findings of li et al 2010 that the larger the asr the flatter the shape of the parameter posterior distribution the parameter posterior distribution also shows dependency on model parameter the cdfs of time delay τ d and exponent of recharge function b g are distributed more uniformly across the feasible range of values than the rainfall factor f c which indicates higher degree of equifinality or uncertainty and more difficulty in constraining the parameter range for time delay τ d moreover the differences in cdf curves between rainfall estimators are larger for rainfall factor f c compared to those differences for the other parameters regardless of acceptability thresholds whereas for parameters of time delay τ d and exponent of recharge b g cdfs curves between rainfall estimators are similar for each acceptability threshold when using the full raingauge network fig 9 however for the reduced raingauge network these two parameters show larger differences in cdf curves between rainfall estimators particularly for a high acceptability threshold of 0 7 fig 10 it is worth noting that the cdfs for the radar only rainfall product remains the same for different raingauge networks moreover different rainfall estimators also show various parameters uncertainty in glue simulations generally the cdfs of kriging interpolated rainfall tend to be distributed more uniformly across the feasible range of values figs 9 and 10 this indicates that those rainfall estimators with good performance are more tolerant to the range of behavioral parameter sets and leading to more equifinality and uncertainty in parameter particularly for a rainfall dependent parameter e g rainfall factor f c this implies the dominant effects of rainfall quality on parameter uncertainty the cdfs of parameter uncertainty for the river lune when using the full and reduced raingaugenetworks are also plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively it can be seen that when the threshold changes from 0 7 to 0 6 more samples are retained as behavioral parameter sets and the resulting cumulative distributions for those parameter sets are much flatter particularly for the model using rad rainfall and mfb rainfall in contrast the cumulative distributions of behavioral parameter sets for kriging interpolated rainfall estimates i e ork kre and ked are less affected by the change of threshold values this can be explained by the fact that the ork kre and ked is better than the rad and mfb in terms of rainfall estimation and this enables them to retain more parameter sets with the likelihood measure above the threshold values however the case is different for the models that use the reduced number of raingauges for rainfall estimations as shown in fig 12 the cdf curves of the model using different rainfall estimates are discrete particularly for the threshold value of 0 7 this is because the quality of rainfall estimates decreases with decreasing number of raingauges used for estimating the mean areal rainfall and the resulting behavioral parameter sets are less with a high threshold i e 0 7 of likelihood measure in addition the cdfs of parameter sets for the rad rainfall is much flatter and smoother for the river ribble than for the river lune this could be another indication that due to the proximity of the catchment to the nearest radar site i e hameldon hill the quality of the rad rainfall is better to produce more behavioral parameter sets with the likelihood function above the predefined threshold value in overall these results demonstrate that the cdfs of the glue simulations using different rainfall estimators not only depend upon the choice of threshold values but also the quality of rainfall estimates and parameter itself this suggests that any factors affecting the quality of the rainfall estimates will have impacts on the estimation of glue parameter uncertainty 4 conclusions this study investigates the main strengths and limitations of radar raingauge merged rainfall products over traditional radar only and raingauge only rainfall products for discharge simulations in both deterministic and stochastic ways hourly discharges are simulated by using the pdm model in uk catchments and the uncertainty assessment is conducted using the glue method with an acceptability threshold of 0 6 and 0 7 for behaviour runs the results show that the pdm model using the ked rainfall input consistently shows higher mnse values than other rainfall estimators regardless of raingauge network configurations the hydrological performances of raingauge only rainfall estimates i e ork are comparable to the performances of ked rainfall estimates the radar only rainfall i e rad or simple radar adjusted rainfall estimates i e mfb are the worst in terms of mnse values particularly for the river lune this is because the quality of radar rainfall estimates in the river lune is largely affected by the radar range effects however by incorporating raingauge measurements hydrological performances of radar only rainfall have been improved dramatically however for the river ribble where hydrological performances of radar rainfall are good enough and the improvements in discharge simulations by merging radar and raingauge is limited in contrast the merging procedure improve the hydrological performance of raingauge only rainfall estimators e g ork for the ungauged version of the river ribble similar findings can also be observed based on the results of cumulative errors in simulated discharges these results suggest that when the quality of both radar and raingauge rainfall data are poor merging them can help to improve the streamflow simulations with better rainfall estimates moreover the consistency in hydrological performances between calibration and validation period would help us to further evaluate the quality of rainfall estimates and provide an additional perspective on defining the best available rainfall estimates at catchment scale the glue uncertainty analysis shows that the posterior parameter distributions of the glue simulations not only depend upon the choice of threshold values but also the quality of rainfall estimates and parameter itself when increasing the glue threshold value parameter values are more constrained to a certain range to generate the behavioral runs in other words the lower the threshold value the more parameter sets are retained as behavioral runs and hence the more uniformly distributed parameter values indicating the higher degree of equifinality in model parameters moreover rainfall estimators with good quality e g ked are more tolerant to the range of behavioral parameter sets and leading to more equifinality and uncertainty in parameter particularly for a rainfall dependent parameter e g rainfall factor f c this suggests that any factors affecting the quality of the rainfall estimates will have impacts on the parameter uncertainty and hence discharge simulations since the spatial rainfall variability across the catchments is not taken into account with the lumped version of the pdm model this could potentially diminish the performance of the merged rainfall products e g kre and ked for getting the amount and timing of peaks especially when there are large rainfall gradients across the catchment e g during convective precipitation besides the use of distributed hydrological models is strongly recommended for future work for spatially detailed hydrological prediction and flood forecasting data availability streamflow and rain gauge data

3963,the limited area of influence in highly permeable aquifers hampers hydraulic tomography ht surveys with traditional pumping tests few have suggested that flow data under natural stimuli could complement ht verifying this conjecture in controlled laboratory sandbox experiments does not exist similarly many have employed independent pumping events to validate inverse modeling results but few have explored the validation uncertainty this study first conducted sandbox experiments to investigate the effectiveness of head data from ht natural gradient ng and precipitation infiltration pi events for estimating hydraulic conductivity k field conditional monte carlo simulation of independent pumping tests then addresses the uncertainty of validating these estimated k fields the effectiveness of the estimates from ng and pi as prior information for ht was investigated next cross correlation analysis exploring the relationship between the observed heads and k heterogeneity under different stimuli then assesses the usefulness of flow data under different stimuli and their possibility for complementing ht as prior information estimates from ng and pi events as the mean of the prior probability distribution for ht then corroborate the cross correlation analysis conditional monte carlo simulation of twelve independent pumping tests further confirms that a decent ng s k estimate as the mean for the prior probability distribution for ht inversion yields the highest resolution of k estimates keywords hydraulic tomography natural gradient flow precipitation infiltration events prior information conditional effective hydraulic conductivity conditional realizations 1 introduction proper management and protection of groundwater resources demand high resolution spatial distributions of hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss of aquifers hydraulic tomography ht has recently been proposed for high resolution aquifer characterization gottlieb dietrich 1995 yeh et al 1996 vasco et al 1997 butler et al 1999 and many others yeh liu 2000 and zhu yeh 2005 developed the first three dimensional steady and transient ht and demonstrated their effectiveness see cardiff et al 2011 table 1 the ht s essential concept is to conduct sequential single hole pumping tests at different locations and collect heads at other locations in a well network since each pumping test creates a different flow field the monitoring network captures new information about aquifer heterogeneity synthesizing all the information in an inverse modeling analysis yields a more detailed heterogeneity than traditional hydraulic tests or inverse modeling exercises over the last two decades the robust performance of ht in revealing k heterogeneity has been demonstrated through numerous numerical experiments e g bohling et al 2010 cardiff et al 2009 sun et al 2013 xiang et al 2009 laboratory sandboxes e g illman et al 2010 zhao illman 2021 and field tests e g berg illman 2011 bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2013 cardiff et al 2012 huang et al 2011 liu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 mao et al 2018 wang et al 2021b zha et al 2017 the use of auxiliary information e g tracer data flux data and geologic information has been proposed as an additional constraint for improving ht s ability for instance through the numerical experiments cirpka kitanidis 2001 reported that joint inversing of the measured hydraulic heads and tracer data under constant gradient conditions along with an injection test improved the lnk estimates based on head data alone zha et al 2014 numerically demonstrated that flux measurements in addition to head data can improve fracture patterns and their k estimates tso et al 2016 discovered that while additional flux information for ht is helpful in porous media it is not as effective as in fracture rocks compared with zha et al 2014 zhao illman 2017 demonstrated the significant improvement in ht estimates by the use of geological models with measured k values obtained from permeameter tests further zha et al 2017 developed a general statistical theory to incorporate the site specific spatial patterns of geologic information into ht surveys cardiff et al 2013 2020 promoted oscillatory ht of different frequencies as an alternative to ht surveys with constant pumping rates but emphasized its limited coverage they suggested that natural oscillations tides periodic river stage fluctuations evapotranspiration signals and others may be alternative to characterize large regions using monte carlo simulation wang et al 2021a demonstrated that both oht and ht with constant pumping rates do not overcome the underdetermined nature of the inverse problem compared with traditional aquifer tests natural stimuli can affect groundwater flow fields over kilometers for example precipitation jan et al 2013 earthquakes lin et al 2004 earth tide e g hsieh et al 1988 rojstaczer riley 1990 ocean tides e g davis et al 2000 li et al 2007 hydrogeologists have long recognized the possibility of taking advantage of naturally occurring fluctuations to determine formation properties van der kamp gale 1983 suggested that the earth tide and barometric measurements could yield valuable information on in situ formation properties if combined with other appropriate aquifer tests such measurements could potentially make an important contribution to the characterization of the hydraulic and elastic properties of a particular formation unlike other previous studies yeh et al 2008 proposed exploiting natural stimuli e g spatiotemporal variations in precipitation river stage barometric lightning and other natural events as sources of basin scale ht surveys subsequently wang et al 2017 through the large scale groundwater field study demonstrated river stage tomography s ability to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity of heterogeneous aquifers of zhuoshui river alluvial fan taiwan later wang et al 2019 found that the single moving excitation was more effective than the periodic excitations for river stage tomography because of the migration of excitation source location ht is a promising technology but still faces many issues in practical field applications for example pumping tests of ht surveys in highly permeable or unconfined aquifers could not yield detectable drawdowns over large distances e g 10 m unless the pumping rate is substantial over a long period large discharges and long durations often lead to problems disposing of the pumped water particularly contaminated groundwater under this situation flow due to large scale natural events could be a viable alternative utilizing natural events to estimate hydraulic parameters is not new however the effectiveness of different natural stimuli has rarely been investigated besides their usefulness as prior information for ht surveys remains unanswered more recently gao et al 2021 developed a conditional monte carlo simulation algorithm to yield ht s conditional realizations they can quantify the uncertainty in the independent pumping tests that aim to validate ht s or other inverse method s estimates applying the new approach to a sandbox experiment could further advance ht technology and geostatistical inverse modeling methodology the motivation of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of natural gradient flow and precipitation infiltration events further it exploits these events non fully redundant heterogeneity information to enhance ht analysis in physical sandbox experiments lastly the study investigates the uncertainty in the independent pumping tests that validate the estimates from ht and the combination of ht and the natural events 2 sandbox construction and experiments 2 1 sandbox construction a sandbox 200 cm in length 100 cm in height and 10 cm in width fig 1 a was constructed xu et al 2019 perforated pvc polyvinyl chloride filter plates were installed on the sandbox s left and right sides 10 cm from the sandbox s left and right outer faces the area between the perforated pvc plates and the sandbox s left and right outer faces was used as water reservoirs serving as the sandbox s constant head boundary the water reservoirs on both sides were connected to small overflow tanks which could be raised or lowered for adjusting the boundary heads we then filled the sandbox l h w 180 cm 90 cm 10 cm with 19 layers of five types of sands with different grain size and permeability fig 1b we used the wet sands to fill the laboratory sandbox manually to reduce the effect of mixing sands at the interface after packing the sandbox with sands we repeatedly filled and drained the water in the box to ensure the settlement of the sands such that any subsidence was minimized during sandbox experiments afterward the spatial distribution of the layers was photographed and mapped the saturated hydraulic parameters of the sands of each material were measured before packing the sandbox utilizing a constant head permeameter table 1 the grain size saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity for the five materials are listed in table 1 after packing the sandbox we installed 40 ports on one side of the sandbox 5 vertical columns with a 30 cm horizontal spacing and 8 horizontal rows at 10 cm vertical spacing see fig 1c each port was 1 cm in diameter and 8 cm in length partially penetrating the sandbox s thickness the port could be connected to either a pressure transducer model cy201 instrument error 2 mm as an observation port or a peristaltic pump as a pumping or injection port via a silicone tube two perforated horizontal pvc pipes were installed over the sandbox s top to create artificial precipitation fig 1a these pipes were connected to a peristaltic pump that controlled the precipitation intensity 2 2 sandbox experiments we conducted three hydraulic experiments using the laboratory sandbox 1 a ht survey 2 natural gradient flow between the two constant head boundaries and 3 precipitation infiltration events 2 2 1 ht surveys experiment for ht surveys the bottom boundary was impermeable and a constant total head of 95 cm was kept for the remaining three boundaries the ht surveys involved pumping water at one of the 40 ports and monitoring the head changes at the remaining 39 ports we repeated the pumping test by moving the pump to another port until all 40 ports were used as a pumping port as a result the ht surveys had 40 pumping tests and each test collected drawdown data from 39 monitoring ports in the ht surveys a constant pumping rate of q 9 168 ml s was used at ports 11 19 23 31 and q 18 336 ml s for the other 36 ports due to different hydraulic properties each pumping test was carried out by using a peristaltic pump at the selected constant rates we monitored the initial head distribution over the 39 ports during each pumping test before the peristaltic pump started once the pumping started we monitored heads at the other 39 observation ports every 0 1 s until they stabilized indicating that the flow had reached a steady state each test lasted about 3 5 s to reach a steady state afterward we turned off the pump and allowed the head to rebound to the initial head reaching a uniform boundary value of 95 cm subsequently another pumping test was initiated at a different port 2 2 2 natural gradient experiment regional natural gradient flow in a groundwater basin could also provide some useful information about aquifer heterogeneity therefore we adjusted the sandbox s left and right hydraulic boundary conditions to create regional groundwater flows the initial total head of this test was 90 cm afterward we kept the left side boundary as a constant total head value of 90 cm and then slowly lowered the right side boundary to a total head of 86 cm the bottom boundary was impermeable and the top boundary was a no flux boundary the hydraulic heads of 40 observation ports were monitored at 0 1 second intervals until the heads of all observation ports had reached a steady state 2 2 3 precipitation infiltration experiment precipitation among all meteorological factors is the most common environmental factor influencing groundwater dynamics it is a major source for groundwater recharge causing large scale and regional groundwater level responses the water level fluctuation may vary with different locations at the same depths because of the heterogeneity of geologic media hence the hydraulic heads collected under the conditions of precipitation infiltration might help estimate k distributions of the aquifer during the precipitation infiltration experiment horizontal pvc pipes at the top of the sandbox were perforated every three centimeters to create a precipitation intensity of 0 0116 cm s the intensity is the total discharge rate from the pipes per unit area of the top of the sandbox albeit the actual precipitation intensity was likely uneven for the upper surface the upper boundary was set as a constant flux boundary of 0 0116 cm s for the numerical simulation the bottom boundary was impermeable the left and right boundaries had constant heads of 75 cm so parts of the top aquifers were under unsaturated conditions the hydraulic heads were collected every 0 1 s at 35 ports except for the top 5 ports 1 9 17 25 and 33 in fig 1a where an unsaturated zone exists no tensiometers were installed at these ports to measure the soil matrix potential 3 inverse methodology 3 1 governing flow equation the following steady state forward and inverse modeling exercises assume that the following partial differential equations govern the flow 1 q x q x p 0 q x k x h x which are subjected to the following boundary conditions 2 h γ 1 h 0 q n γ 2 q 0 in eq 1 x is the spatial coordinate x x y l q is the specific discharge q qx qy l t q x p is the flow rate l2 t at a source sink at the location x p k x is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t and h is the total head l in eq 2 h 0 is the prescribed total head at dirichlet boundary γ1 q 0 is the specified flux at the neumann boundary γ2 and n is a unit vector normal to the boundary γ2 3 2 inversion algorithm the above governing flow equations were solved by a 2 d finite element model vsaft2 variably saturated flow and transport in 2d yeh et al 1993 available at http tian hwr arizona edu downloads the steady state inverse modeling of these experiments was conducted using the sle successive linear estimator yeh et al 1996 or the simsle algorithm simultaneous sle xiang et al 2009 embedded in vsaft2 the simsle algorithm evolves from sle to simultaneously consider the observed head data from multiple pumping injection events both sle and simsle aim to derive the effective parameter field conditioned on available head data they are a geostatistical inverse approach which considers the parameter field as a spatially random field characterized by a joint probability distribution jpd specified by the mean and covariance of the parameter sle and simsle are mathematically equivalent to the maximum a posterior inverse approach or the extended kalman filter of time series analysis see mclaughlin townley 1996 they use the unconditional mean and the exponential covariance function as the bayesian theory s prior jpd sle and simsle adopt a highly parameterized heterogeneous conceptual model the model discretizes the simulation domain into n elements where different parameter values are assigned to avoid obtaining negative values of the estimated parameters sle and simsle conceptualize the parameter s natural logarithm values i e lnk x f x as a stochastic field characterized by the prior jpd implicitly normal with an unconditional mean f x and covariance r ff similarly head h is a spatial stochastic field the parameter f and the state h are expressed as the sum of the unconditional mean and perturbation i e h x h x h x and f x f x f x where the overbar denotes the expected value solving the groundwater flow equation eq 1 with a given unconditional mean f x derives the unconditional mean head h x the most likely head field with the given information note that unconditional parameters or states mean that they do not honor their measured values at measurement locations suppose we collected m observed head measurements expressed as a vector h m 1 from an ht survey consisting of multiple pumping tests simsle then employs a successive linear estimator to derive the conditional effective lnk perturbation field f c x where subscript c denotes conditional the conditional effective parameter is different from the statistical mean parameter because it produces the most likely head field honoring the observed heads and conforming to the governing equation given the observed data conditional mean heads gao et al 2021 the successive linear estimator sle is 3 f c r 1 f c r ω r t h h r eq 3 states that the estimate of the perturbation f c x at iteration r 1 f c r 1 is the sum of the estimate f c r at iteration r and the spatially weighted sum of the difference between h r i e the heads simulated by eq 1 with f c r and the observed heads h at the observation locations the spatial weights are denoted by ω and the superscript t is the transpose at r 0 simle starts from the unconditional mean head h x derived from solving eq 1 with the unconditional f x when r 0 the estimated f c r is added to f x to simulate h r the coefficient matrix ω is determined by solving the following equation 4 r hh r q h θ diag r hh r ω r r hf r in eq 4 r hh r is the unconditional head covariance matrix when r 0 and is the conditional covariance when r 0 similarly the cross covariance r hf r is the unconditional cross covariance matrix between parameter and head measurement at r 0 and is the conditional one at r 0 θ is a stability multiplier and diag r hh r is the diagonal elements of the r hh r matrix which are the head variance at the measurement location q h denotes the variance matrix m 1 of the head measurement error if specified the covariance matrix r hh r and cross covariance r hf r matrix at iteration r are derived from first order approximation based on the taylor series 5 r hh r j hf r r ff r j hf r t r hf r j hf r r ff r the sensitivity of the head at the observation location to the parameter everywhere in the domain at iteration r is j hf r evaluated using f c r at r 0 r ff 0 is the unconditional covariance r ff of the prior jpd when r 1 r ff r is a residual or conditional covariance of the posterior jpd after the observed heads constrain the estimate at iteration r because f is nonlinearly related to h and the estimator eq 3 is linear simsle uses the mean and covariance of the posterior jpd at the current iteration r as those of the prior jpd for the next iteration r 1 this procedure updates the prior jpd for iteration r 1 to reflect the inclusion of the head measurements at the current iteration r while the mean is updated by eq 3 the covariance is modified by 6 r ff r 1 r ff r ω r t r hf r after such updating procedures i e eqs 3 and 6 at iteration r the covariance of the posterior jpd residual covariance is denoted as r ff r 1 this residual covariance is then served as the covariance of the prior jpd for the linear estimation at the next iteration continuous updating of the mean and covariance of the posterior jpd is necessary because both the mean and covariance are nonlinear functions of h other geostatistical inverse models iteratively update the mean however they linearly approximate the posterior covariance at the final iteration the above steps are repeated until the two convergence criteria are satisfied 1 the change in variances of the estimated lnk field between the current iteration and the previous iteration change is less than a user specified value 2 the change in simulated heads between successive iterations is smaller than a specified value once one of the two criteria is met we consider the estimates optimal and terminate the iteration 3 3 inverse modeling of the sandbox experiment after the laboratory experiments we selected the steady state head data from the first third and fifth vertical columns of the 24 ports fig 1a and 1c to estimate the conditional effective k distributions in the following three cases the choice of the steady state data for the inverse modeling analysis is to avoid the effects of interaction between the k and the specific storage on the estimates note the term conditional effective will be dropped for convenience unless necessary hereafter 1 case ht is the case where head data from 23 ports excluding the pumping port induced by a constant rate pumping at each of six ports 3 6 19 22 35 and 38 as such 138 steady state head measurements were utilized in the inverse model to estimate k field 2 case ng considers the natural gradient experiment where 24 steady state head measurements are available 3 case pi is the case where the inverse model analyzed the data from the precipitation infiltration experiment the number of head data points used for this case was different from those in case ht and case ng data from the top ports 1 17 and 33 were discarded due to the unsaturated zone s presence as we explained in section 2 2 3 and the model accounts for the unsaturated zone forming above the groundwater table therefore there were in total of 21 steady state head measurements in case pi the boundary conditions of case ht case ng and case pi have been described in sections 2 2 1 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 3 4 parameters of the unconditional prior jpd for the inverse analysis the sandbox domain was discretized into 4 050 elements and 4 186 nodes with element dimensions of 2 cm 2 cm the pumping and observation ports were set at the nodes afterward we specified the prior parameters for the inverse model including the mean variance and correlation scales of the prior jpd an exponential function was the covariance function the unconditional mean value of k is 0 22 cm s and the variance of lnk is 1 5 yeh et al 2015 articulated that correlation scales represent the average more precisely ½ length thickness and width of the dominant heterogeneities in a formation accordingly the correlation scales were assigned as 90 cm and 10 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively after visual examination of the geometry of the19 layers cases ng and pi involve some unsaturated zones near the top boundary in the inverse modeling we simulated the unsaturated process using vsaft2 and gardner s exponential unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function gardner 1958 with the pore size distribution parameter α 0 001 cm 1 which is assumed spatially constant and known in the inverse modeling analysis the saturated hydraulic conductivity is the same as in the saturated zone 3 5 independent pumping test validation because the actual k values in the sandbox are unknown one way to validate the k estimates is to use them to predict drawdown distributions of independent pumping tests using pumping and observation ports not used in the model s calibration e g illman et al 2007 following this logic we used the head data from the second and fourth columns of 16 ports not used in the inverse models of three cases for validation 180 steady state drawdown data sets from twelve pumping tests at ports 10 11 12 13 14 15 26 27 28 29 30 and 31 the green ports in fig 1a were used for the validation purpose afterward we used the k estimates from different tests to simulate the steady state drawdown fields and compared them with the 180 data the agreement between predicted and measured drawdowns for the twelve validation pumping tests was evaluated using scatterplots of the measured and predicted drawdowns popular performance metrics i e linear regression coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error l1 and the mean square error l2 provide the quantitative assessment 3 6 uncertainty analysis of independent pumping tests illman et al 2007 and liu et al 2007 proposed the independent pumping test concept for validating ht estimates and many have followed afterward however the highly parameterized inverse problem including ht is underdetermined or ill defined with the given data set simsle s estimate is the statistically most likely solution nevertheless it neither thoroughly identifies the actual k field nor predicts an independent pumping test free of uncertainty although the residual variance eq 6 addresses the parameter estimation uncertainty its impact on predicting the head field under different flow scenarios remains unresolved reliability of the validation this study adopts a conditional monte carlo simulation approach to address this issue specifically we generate 100 realizations of possible heterogeneous k fields having the same unconditional spatial statistics additionally they reproduce the observed heads at the observation wells in ht ng and pi experiments i e conditional realizations subsequently these realizations are used to simulate the twelve independent pumping tests to consider the effects of unresolved heterogeneity in the effective k field this conditional monte carlo simulation was accomplished using the approach by gao et al 2021 based on sle and the karhunen loeve expansion method sleklm the procedure of sleklm followed 1 it first employs sle to derive the conditional effective lnk field and the conditional covariance matrix of lnk 2 using the conditional covariance of lnk resulting from sle sleklm then generates the zero mean conditional realizations 3 afterward these zero mean realizations are added to the conditional effective lnk field to form the conditional realizations of lnk fields which are then converted to the conditional realizations of k fields 4 finally we used them to predict the drawdowns of independent pumping tests at validation wells 4 results first the effects of the unconditional mean as prior for inversion of ht ng and pi data on their estimated k fields are discussed in terms of independent pumping test results and uncertainty cross correlation analysis explaining the differences follows afterward the effects of conditional effective k estimates from ng and pi as the prior mean for ht are presented and discussed 4 1 effective k estimates with unconditional prior fig 2 a shows a sketch of the layers in the sandbox based on a visual examination we assigned a color to each layer according to the five types of sands and their k values see table 1 this figure shows that layers 9 and 12 are the highest k layers while layers 4 and 14 are the lowest the effective k field from case ht is illustrated in fig 2b comparing it with fig 2a we notice that this k field closely resembles fig 2a in layers 1 7 8 9 12 16 17 and 19 suggesting that the k tomogram captures the general shapes and locations of the layers we also find that the k values of layers 2 11 13 and 18 in fig 2b case ht are slightly higher than those in fig 2a fig 2c is the effective k field from case ng revealing that it captures the layers 1 6 8 10 12 16 and 18 in fig 2a however the high k layers 2 9 12 and 19 the k values are higher than those in fig 2a the effective k field from case pi fig 2d resembles that in layers 8 13 16 17 and 18 in fig 2a overall case pi reproduces only a very vague pattern of the sandbox aquifer s layer structure detecting only the low k layers general location we also conducted variogram analysis of the conditional effective k estimates of the three cases table 2 lists the resulting spatial statistics including the geometric mean kg variance of lnk σ in k 2 and the horizontal correlation scale λ x and the vertical λ z of an exponential variogram among case ht ng and pi table 2 shows that case pi has the largest kg the smallest σ2 ln k and the largest λ x in contrast the effective k in case ng has the smallest kg the largest σ2 ln k and the moderate λ x the contour plots in fig 2 echo these differences in these spatial statistics 4 2 independent pumping tests validation and uncertainty validations of the effective k estimates their uncertainty and performance metrics are presented in fig 3 a b and c for case ht case ng and case pi the red circles in these figures are the measured versus the predicted drawdowns based on the effective k field the green circles are the measured versus the predicted resulting from the 100 k realizations specifically each green circle is the observed drawdown at an observation well induced by one of the twelve pumping tests in a conditional realization of the k field the black lines are the 1 1 line while the red lines are the regression lines of the red circles and the green lines are for the green circles the performance metrics of the red circles demonstrate that the effective k estimates from case ht fig 3a yields the best prediction which has the highest r2 and smallest l1 l2 the case ng follows and case pi is the last however the deviation of the red line from the 1 1 line is the least in case ng case ht the second and case pi the last as reflected in their slopes and intercepts the large kg in case pi table 2 in addition to the uncertain boundary flux may expound the systematically lower predicted drawdowns than the observed at large values notice that the difference in the slopes of the regression lines for case ng 0 865 and case ht 0 812 is small but the intercept of case ng 0 468 is larger than case ht 0 325 the significant scattering of the red circles around heads less than 4 cm in case ng due to its large σ2 ln k explain the difference on the other hand the larger scattering of the red circles in case pi than case ht may be due to its uncertain flux boundary since its σ2 ln k is the smallest nevertheless the spatial statistics represent the entire domain and the different patterns of cross correlations between the pumping and observation wells in independent pumping test may complicate the interpretation the more significant dispersal of the green circles than the red circles in fig 3a b and c is no surprise reflecting the effects of unaccounted heterogeneity in the effective k field scatterings are the uncertainty in the validation using the effective k field representing possible deviations of actual heads from the predicted from the effective k among the three figures the green circles from k realizations in fig 3a have the highest r2 0 837 and smallest l1 l2 0 353 and 0 302 respectively fig 3b and 3c show larger scatterings of the data than fig 3a confirming the robustness of the ht survey for capturing most of the heterogeneity in the sandbox these uncertainties are approximate likely not absolute ones based on rigorous stochastic theories the above examples highlight the usefulness of the relative uncertainties among different cases as emphasized in yeh et al 2015 the spatial statistics in table 2 also provide some explanation of above behaviors we also notice that the scattering increases with the drawdown values this finding is consistent with the stochastic theories gelhar 1993 that uncertainty of drawdown is proportional to the variance of the uncharacterized k heterogeneity and the average gradient which is large near the pumping well where drawdown is large case ht s superior performance is anticipated because six pumping tests at different locations were conducted and 23 heads were collected during each test case ht thus had six sets of partially non redundant data sets wen et al 2019 on the other hand case ng had only one excitation flow from left to right with the 24 head data measured at 24 ports meanwhile case pi had only 21 head data induced by vertical recharge from the precipitation infiltration events flow from top to left and right sides of the sandbox unequivocally the number of non redundant data in the inverse modeling plays a critical role since these results are from the same inverse algorithm in particular ht uses a similar number of wells but creates more non fully redundant data sets however the head data from case ng consisted of only three more than that in case pi under one unidirectional flow stress the cross correlation analysis next may explain the better performance of case ng than case pi 4 3 cross correlation analysis in inverse modeling the cross correlation represents the contribution of the parameter at a location in the heterogeneous aquifer to the head observed at a well kitanidis vomvoris 1983 kitanidis 1995 we followed this school of thought and analyzed the cross correlation for the ht ng and pi experiments 4 3 1 case ht the cross correlation maps of the head at an observation well and k anywhere in the aquifer during two steady state cross hole pumping tests are presented in fig 4 a and 4b where the flow fields also are illustrated in fig 4a the monitoring port the black circle is on the left and the pumping port the white circle is on the right the locations of the pumping and the monitoring well were switched in fig 4b these figures reveal that the positive cross correlation coefficients with values 0 4 form a red crescent shaped region near the top boundary a negative correlation with values less than 0 1 forms a similar crescent shaped region near the lower boundary as such the correlation results indicate that the head s perturbation at the observation port could reveal the k perturbations within the crescent shaped regions if the pumping port and the observation port locations are exchanged in fig 4b the crescent shaped region covers the same area as fig 4a thus the observed heads in these two figures carry the same information about k s variation in the aquifer a well known reciprocity principle in diffusion equations the contour plots in fig 4c and 4d are the cases where a pair of the pumping and observation ports are along a vertical line when the pair is near the right side of the sandbox boundary the distribution is illustrated in fig 4c on the other hand fig 4d shows the distribution when the pair is close to the sandbox left side boundary the high correlation areas reside above the observation port as well as below the pumping port the smaller area below the pumping port is due to the impermeable boundary at the bottom of the sandbox fig 4a 4b 4c and 4d reveal that the regions of high cross correlation values vary with the locations of the pair ports since there are 23 observed ports in one pumping test selecting different pumping locations alters the flow field to allow high correlation areas to cover the different parts of the aquifer ht s principle 4 3 2 case ng natural gradient the natural gradient experiments cross correlation distribution and flow fields are depicted in fig 4e to 4 h for different observation port locations the black circles notice that these figures head contour levels are different from fig 4a b c and d in case ng the mean flow was unidirectional flow from the left to the right the k on the upstream of the observation well is positively correlated with the head at the well the k on the downstream of the observation well near the right boundary is negatively correlated with the head at the well this result manifests the effect of the flow predominantly in the horizontal direction of the long correlation length of k the regions of high cross correlation areas also varied with the location of the observation port again high cross correlation areas from the selected 24 steady state heads covered most sandbox aquifer areas nevertheless because the sandbox is a 2 d vertical plane changing flow direction from left to right to right to left only results in redundant information due to the reciprocity nature of groundwater flow 4 3 3 case pi precipitation infiltration as illustrated in fig 4i to 4 l at the regions of high cross correlation 0 6 resulting from the observation port at different locations cover a small area downstream of the observation port the correlation contour and flow patterns are different from the previous two cases these figures reveal a similar monotonous correlation pattern over a sizeable horizontal domain indicating heterogeneity at many parts of the sandbox equally impacts the head at a port that is to say deciphering the contribution from heterogeneity at different locations could be difficult the flux boundary condition at the top is likely the culprit for such a correlation pattern specifically a constant head boundary and the observed head at a well reveal the hydraulic gradient under a steady flow condition reveals the k between them relative to other locations even though the flux is unknown in contrast the head perturbation around the mean head at the well in a flow field with a known flux boundary could result from either or both the perturbations from k and hydraulic gradient for this reason the cross correlation patterns are monotonous in case pi the head measurement is less informative about the k than in ht and ng cases besides the inverse modeling of the sandbox experiment assumed uniform recharge flux from precipitation infiltration experiment at the top boundary and assumed unsaturated flow parameters for these reasons inversion of data from case pi of the sandbox yielded less heterogeneity information than from case ng the results of the cross correlation analysis are consistent with the inverse modeling results and expound on the relative performance of ht ng and pi approaches 4 4 effects of conditional prior common sense tells us that a good guess parameter value could lead to fast convergence in a nonlinear problem and a better solution in an underdetermined problem this intuition suggests that the k fields from case ng or case pi should be helpful as the mean of the prior jpd for case ht s to improve the estimate further we could evaluate the benefits of different prior information in addition it may show that the mean of prior jpd for simsle matters even using the same unconditional covariance for all cases the covariance may affect the final estimates absolute uncertainty or the posterior jpd however critical to our interest are the actual estimates and the relative uncertainty between different cases 4 4 1 k estimates case ng ht denotes the scenario where the effective k estimates from case ng were used as the prior mean for ht the effective k field from case ng ht is displayed in fig 5 a comparing fig 5a with fig 2b case ht and the reference k field fig 2a we find that in case ng ht the k locations and values of layers 4 5 13 14 16 and 18 are closer to the outline of the reference layers fig 2a than those in case ht this result indicates that the prior conditional effective k from case ng indeed improves the estimate by ht alone case pi ht represents the scenario where the k estimates from case pi were used as the prior mean for ht the estimated effective k field for case pi ht is illustrated in fig 5b the result is similar to fig 2b case ht indicative of little new information gain by incorporating the estimates from pi as the prior mean for ht 4 4 2 validation and uncertainty the red circles in scatterplots of the predicted based on conditional effective k fields versus the measured drawdowns of the twelve independent pumping tests including regression line r2 l1 and l2 norms are displayed in fig 6 a for case ng ht and fig 6b for case pi ht comparing the red circles in fig 6a case ng ht and fig 3a case ht manifests that in case ng ht r2 increases from 0 849 to 0 925 likewise l1 decreases from 0 306 to 0 193 and l2 decreases from 0 263 to 0 130 similarly the comparison of the green circles predictions based on conditional k realizations in fig 3a case ht and fig 6a reaches the same conclusion as the comparison based on the red circles the behaviors of the red and green circles confirm that prior information from case ng for ht analysis can improve the accuracy of ht estimates and reduce the uncertainty of their validation examining fig 6b case pi ht and fig 3a case ht we find that the performance metrics of both the red and green circles become slightly worse specifically using the conditional effective k estimates from case pi as the prior mean for ht inversion slightly degrades the ht performance such degradation seems to indicate impacts of factors other than the low cross correlation expounded previously scrutinizing results of the twelve independent pumping tests in fig 3c and fig 6b we find that the estimated k from case pi and case pi ht persistently predicted lower drawdowns than the observed at large drawdowns this finding suggests that besides the low cross correlation due to the flux boundary condition the uniform flux boundary 0 0116 cm s at the top of the simulation domain likely deviates from the actual flux and its distribution the presence of the unsaturated zone near the boundary may exacerbate the discrepancy neither did we measure the unsaturated zone parameters such as pore size parameter α saturated water content θs and others of sands near the top of the sandbox nor did we collect soil water pressures in the unsaturated zone vsaft2 with our guessed unsaturated parameters may incorrectly simulate the fluxes recharging the saturated zone and discharging from the side boundaries near the top these issues deserve further investigation however σ2 ln k λ x and λ z from case pi are noticeably different from other cases in table 2 indicating that the conditional effective k from case pi inaccurately described the sandbox aquifer s heterogeneous distribution as evident in fig 2d further the flawed mean k for the prior jpd of case pi ht should explain the degradation of case pi ht s performance summarizing these results the correct mean for the prior jpd for ht could improve the estimates of ht and otherwise we show that collecting the head data sets under natural gradient conditions to estimate the k field and then using it as the mean parameter field as prior jpd for ht analysis can enhance the k estimates 5 summary and conclusions intuitively additional information from natural events i e natural gradient ng precipitation infiltration pi could benefit ht s analysis we conducted ht ng pi and twelve independent pumping test experiments in a laboratory sandbox to substantiate our intuition then we employed simsle to derive conditional effective k estimates and sleklm to form 100 conditional k realizations using the head measurements from the ht ng and pi experiments afterward twelve independent pumping tests were simulated with the conditional effective k field and conditional realizations to evaluate the predictive capability of the conditional effective k field and address uncertainty in their predictions this study also investigated the effects of prior information on ht analysis notably the conditional effective k estimates from ng or pi were incorporated into ht analysis as the mean for ht s prior joint probability distribution the results of these estimates were then assessed by predicting twelve independent single hole pumping tests the results lead to the following conclusions 1 among ht ng and pi events using the same unconditional mean for the prior jpd in the inversion ht surveys yield the highest resolution of the estimated conditional effective k field and the least uncertainty of drawdown predictions the estimated k field from the ng experiment follows and the head measurements from the pi experiment are least effective 2 cross correlation analysis explains that ht creates many non fully redundant heterogeneity information sets by changing the flow fields using the same monitoring network as ng and pi more interestingly the flux boundary condition in pi case explains the lowest cross correlation between head and heterogeneity 3 a decent conditional effective k field as the mean of the prior jpd for ht inverse modeling is amicable to a better solution of an inverse problem incorrect boundary flux and inadequate flow modeling in the unsaturated zone tainted the conditional effective k field from precipitation infiltration events consequently using this flawed conditional effective k field as the mean of the prior jpd for ht deteriorates the ht s performance meanwhile using the pristine conditional effective k field from the natural gradient events as the mean leads to noticeable improvements of the k estimates than using the unconditional mean in ht analysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

3963,the limited area of influence in highly permeable aquifers hampers hydraulic tomography ht surveys with traditional pumping tests few have suggested that flow data under natural stimuli could complement ht verifying this conjecture in controlled laboratory sandbox experiments does not exist similarly many have employed independent pumping events to validate inverse modeling results but few have explored the validation uncertainty this study first conducted sandbox experiments to investigate the effectiveness of head data from ht natural gradient ng and precipitation infiltration pi

effectiveness of the estimates from ng and pi as prior information for ht was investigated next cross correlation analysis exploring the relationship between the observed heads and k heterogeneity under different stimuli then assesses the usefulness of flow data under different stimuli and their possibility for complementing ht as prior information estimates from ng and pi events as the mean of the prior probability distribution for ht then corroborate the cross correlation analysis conditional monte carlo simulation of twelve independent pumping tests further confirms that a decent ng s k estimate as the mean for the prior probability distribution for ht inversion yields the highest resolution of k estimates keywords hydraulic tomography natural gradient flow precipitation infiltration events prior information conditional effective hydraulic conductivity conditional realizations 1 introduction proper management and protection of groundwater resources demand high resolution spatial distributions of hydraulic parameters e g hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss of aquifers hydraulic tomography ht has recently been proposed for high resolution aquifer characterization gottlieb dietrich 1995 yeh et al 1996 vasco et al 1997 butler et al 1999 and many others yeh liu 2000 and zhu yeh 2005 developed the first three dimensional steady and transient ht and demonstrated their effectiveness see cardiff et al 2011 table 1 the ht s essential concept is to conduct sequential single hole pumping tests at different locations and collect heads at other locations in a well network since each pumping test creates a different flow field the monitoring network captures new information about aquifer heterogeneity synthesizing all the information in an inverse modeling analysis yields a more detailed heterogeneity than traditional hydraulic tests or inverse modeling exercises over the last two decades the robust performance of ht in revealing k heterogeneity has been demonstrated through numerous numerical experiments e g bohling et al 2010 cardiff et al 2009 sun et al 2013 xiang et al 2009 laboratory sandboxes e g illman et al 2010 zhao illman 2021 and field tests e g berg illman 2011 bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2013 cardiff et al 2012 huang et al 2011 liu et al 2020 luo et al 2020 mao et al 2018 wang et al 2021b zha et al 2017 the use of auxiliary information e g tracer data flux data and geologic information has been proposed as an additional constraint for improving ht s ability for instance through the numerical experiments cirpka kitanidis 2001 reported that joint inversing of the measured hydraulic heads and tracer data under constant gradient conditions along with an injection test improved the lnk estimates based on head data alone zha et al 2014 numerically demonstrated that flux measurements in addition to head data can improve fracture patterns and their k estimates tso et al 2016 discovered that while additional flux information for ht is helpful in porous media it is not as effective as in fracture rocks compared with zha et al 2014 zhao illman 2017 demonstrated the significant improvement in ht estimates by the use of geological models with measured k values obtained from permeameter tests further zha et al 2017 developed a general statistical theory to incorporate the site specific spatial patterns of geologic information into ht surveys cardiff et al 2013 2020 promoted oscillatory ht of different frequencies as an alternative to ht surveys with constant pumping rates but emphasized its limited coverage they suggested that natural oscillations tides periodic river stage fluctuations evapotranspiration signals and others may be alternative to characterize large regions using monte carlo simulation wang et al 2021a demonstrated that both oht and ht with constant pumping rates do not overcome the underdetermined nature of the inverse problem compared with traditional aquifer tests natural stimuli can affect groundwater flow fields over kilometers for example precipitation jan et al 2013 earthquakes lin et al 2004 earth tide e g hsieh et al 1988 rojstaczer riley 1990 ocean tides e g davis et al 2000 li et al 2007 hydrogeologists have long recognized the possibility of taking advantage of naturally occurring fluctuations to determine formation properties van der kamp gale 1983 suggested that the earth tide and barometric measurements could yield valuable information on in situ formation properties if combined with other appropriate aquifer tests such measurements could potentially make an important contribution to the characterization of the hydraulic and elastic properties of a particular formation unlike other previous studies yeh et al 2008 proposed exploiting natural stimuli e g spatiotemporal variations in precipitation river stage barometric lightning and other natural events as sources of basin scale ht surveys subsequently wang et al 2017 through the large scale groundwater field study demonstrated river stage tomography s ability to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity of heterogeneous aquifers of zhuoshui river alluvial fan taiwan later wang et al 2019 found that the single moving excitation was more effective than the periodic excitations for river stage tomography because of the migration of excitation source location ht is a promising technology but still faces many issues in practical field applications for example pumping tests of ht surveys in highly permeable or unconfined aquifers could not yield detectable drawdowns over large distances e g 10 m unless the pumping rate is substantial over a long period large discharges and long durations often lead to problems disposing of the pumped water particularly contaminated groundwater under this situation flow due to large scale natural events could be a viable alternative utilizing natural events to estimate hydraulic parameters is not new however the effectiveness of different natural stimuli has rarely been investigated besides their usefulness as prior information for ht surveys remains unanswered more recently gao et al 2021 developed a conditional monte carlo simulation algorithm to yield ht s conditional realizations they can quantify the uncertainty in the independent pumping tests that aim to validate ht s or other inverse method s estimates applying the new approach to a sandbox experiment could further advance ht technology and geostatistical inverse modeling methodology the motivation of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of natural gradient flow and precipitation infiltration events further it exploits these events non fully redundant heterogeneity information to enhance ht analysis in physical sandbox experiments lastly the study investigates the uncertainty in the independent pumping tests that validate the estimates from ht and the combination of ht and the natural events 2 sandbox construction and experiments 2 1 sandbox construction a sandbox 200 cm in length 100 cm in height and 10 cm in width fig 1 a was constructed xu et al 2019 perforated pvc polyvinyl chloride filter plates were installed on the sandbox s left and right sides 10 cm from the sandbox s left and right outer faces the area between the perforated pvc plates and the sandbox s left and right outer faces was used as water reservoirs serving as the sandbox s constant head boundary the water reservoirs on both sides were connected to small overflow tanks which could be raised or lowered for adjusting the boundary heads we then filled the sandbox l h w 180 cm 90 cm 10 cm with 19 layers of five types of sands with different grain size and permeability fig 1b we used the wet sands to fill the laboratory sandbox manually to reduce the effect of mixing sands at the interface after packing the sandbox with sands we repeatedly filled and drained the water in the box to ensure the settlement of the sands such that any subsidence was minimized during sandbox experiments afterward the spatial distribution of the layers was photographed and mapped the saturated hydraulic parameters of the sands of each material were measured before packing the sandbox utilizing a constant head permeameter table 1 the grain size saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity for the five materials are listed in table 1 after packing the sandbox we installed 40 ports on one side of the sandbox 5 vertical columns with a 30 cm horizontal spacing and 8 horizontal rows at 10 cm vertical spacing see fig 1c each port was 1 cm in diameter and 8 cm in length partially penetrating the sandbox s thickness the port could be connected to either a pressure transducer model cy201 instrument error 2 mm as an observation port or a peristaltic pump as a pumping or injection port via a silicone tube two perforated horizontal pvc pipes were installed over the sandbox s top to create artificial precipitation fig 1a these pipes were connected to a peristaltic pump that controlled the precipitation intensity 2 2 sandbox experiments we conducted three hydraulic experiments using the laboratory sandbox 1 a ht survey 2 natural gradient flow between the two constant head boundaries and 3 precipitation infiltration events 2 2 1 ht surveys experiment for ht surveys the bottom boundary was impermeable and a constant total head of 95 cm was kept for the remaining three boundaries the ht surveys involved pumping water at one of the 40 ports and monitoring the head changes at the remaining 39 ports we repeated the pumping test by moving the pump to another port until all 40 ports were used as a pumping port as a result the ht surveys had 40 pumping tests and each test collected drawdown data from 39 monitoring ports in the ht surveys a constant pumping rate of q 9 168 ml s was used at ports 11 19 23 31 and q 18 336 ml s for the other 36 ports due to different hydraulic properties each pumping test was carried out by using a peristaltic pump at the selected constant rates we monitored the initial head distribution over the 39 ports during each pumping test before the peristaltic pump started once the pumping started we monitored heads at the other 39 observation ports every 0 1 s until they stabilized indicating that the flow had reached a steady state each test lasted about 3 5 s to reach a steady state afterward we turned off the pump and allowed the head to rebound to the initial head reaching a uniform boundary value of 95 cm subsequently another pumping test was initiated at a different port 2 2 2 natural gradient experiment regional natural gradient flow in a groundwater basin could also provide some useful information about aquifer heterogeneity therefore we adjusted the sandbox s left and right hydraulic boundary conditions to create regional groundwater flows the initial total head of this test was 90 cm afterward we kept the left side boundary as a constant total head value of 90 cm and then slowly lowered the right side boundary to a total head of 86 cm the bottom boundary was impermeable and the top boundary was a no flux boundary the hydraulic heads of 40 observation ports were monitored at 0 1 second intervals until the heads of all observation ports had reached a steady state 2 2 3 precipitation infiltration experiment precipitation among all meteorological factors is the most common environmental factor influencing groundwater dynamics it is a major source for groundwater recharge causing large scale and regional groundwater level responses the water level fluctuation may vary with different locations at the same depths because of the heterogeneity of geologic media hence the hydraulic heads collected under the conditions of precipitation infiltration might help estimate k distributions of the aquifer during the precipitation infiltration experiment horizontal pvc pipes at the top of the sandbox were perforated every three centimeters to create a precipitation intensity of 0 0116 cm s the intensity is the total discharge rate from the pipes per unit area of the top of the sandbox albeit the actual precipitation intensity was likely uneven for the upper surface the upper boundary was set as a constant flux boundary of 0 0116 cm s for the numerical simulation the bottom boundary was impermeable the left and right boundaries had constant heads of 75 cm so parts of the top aquifers were under unsaturated conditions the hydraulic heads were collected every 0 1 s at 35 ports except for the top 5 ports 1 9 17 25 and 33 in fig 1a where an unsaturated zone exists no tensiometers were installed at these ports to measure the soil matrix potential 3 inverse methodology 3 1 governing flow equation the following steady state forward and inverse modeling exercises assume that the following partial differential equations govern the flow 1 q x q x p 0 q x k x h x which are subjected to the following boundary conditions 2 h γ 1 h 0 q n γ 2 q 0 in eq 1 x is the spatial coordinate x x y l q is the specific discharge q qx qy l t q x p is the flow rate l2 t at a source sink at the location x p k x is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t and h is the total head l in eq 2 h 0 is the prescribed total head at dirichlet boundary γ1 q 0 is the specified flux at the neumann boundary γ2 and n is a unit vector normal to the boundary γ2 3 2 inversion algorithm the above governing flow equations were solved by a 2 d finite element model vsaft2 variably saturated flow and transport in 2d yeh et al 1993 available at http tian hwr arizona edu downloads the steady state inverse modeling of these experiments was conducted using the sle successive linear estimator yeh et al 1996 or the simsle algorithm simultaneous sle xiang et al 2009 embedded in vsaft2 the simsle algorithm evolves from sle to simultaneously consider the observed head data from multiple pumping injection events both sle and simsle aim to derive the effective parameter field conditioned on available head data they are a geostatistical inverse approach which considers the parameter field as a spatially random field characterized by a joint probability distribution jpd specified by the mean and covariance of the parameter sle and simsle are mathematically equivalent to the maximum a posterior inverse approach or the extended kalman filter of time series analysis see mclaughlin townley 1996 they use the unconditional mean and the exponential covariance function as the bayesian theory s prior jpd sle and simsle adopt a highly parameterized heterogeneous conceptual model the model discretizes the simulation domain into n elements where different parameter values are assigned to avoid obtaining negative values of the estimated parameters sle and simsle conceptualize the parameter s natural logarithm values i e lnk x f x as a stochastic field characterized by the prior jpd implicitly normal with an unconditional mean f x and covariance r ff similarly head h is a spatial stochastic field the parameter f and the state h are expressed as the sum of the unconditional mean and perturbation i e h x h x h x and f x f x f x where the overbar denotes the expected value solving the groundwater flow equation eq 1 with a given unconditional mean f x derives the unconditional mean head h x the most likely head field with the given information note that unconditional parameters or states mean that they do not honor their measured values at measurement locations suppose we collected m observed head measurements expressed as a vector h m 1 from an ht survey consisting of multiple pumping tests simsle then employs a successive linear estimator to derive the conditional effective lnk perturbation field f c x where subscript c denotes conditional the conditional effective parameter is different from the statistical mean parameter because it produces the most likely head field honoring the observed heads and conforming to the governing equation given the observed data conditional mean heads gao et al 2021 the successive linear estimator sle is 3 f c r 1 f c r ω r t h h r eq 3 states that the estimate of the perturbation f c x at iteration r 1 f c r 1 is the sum of the estimate f c r at iteration r and the spatially weighted sum of the difference between h r i e the heads simulated by eq 1 with f c r and the observed heads h at the observation locations the spatial weights are denoted by ω and the superscript t is the transpose at r 0 simle starts from the unconditional mean head h x derived from solving eq 1 with the unconditional f x when r 0 the estimated f c r is added to f x to simulate h r the coefficient matrix ω is determined by solving the following equation 4 r hh r q h θ diag r hh r ω r r hf r in eq 4 r hh r is the unconditional head covariance matrix when r 0 and is the conditional covariance when r 0 similarly the cross covariance r hf r is the unconditional cross covariance matrix between parameter and head measurement at r 0 and is the conditional one at r 0 θ is a stability multiplier and diag r hh r is the diagonal elements of the r hh r matrix which are the head variance at the measurement location q h denotes the variance matrix m 1 of the head measurement error if specified the covariance matrix r hh r and cross covariance r hf r matrix at iteration r are derived from first order approximation based on the taylor series 5 r hh r j hf r r ff r j hf r t r hf r j hf r r ff r the sensitivity of the head at the observation location to the parameter everywhere in the domain at iteration r is j hf r evaluated using f c r at r 0 r ff 0 is the unconditional covariance r ff of the prior jpd when r 1 r ff r is a residual or conditional covariance of the posterior jpd after the observed heads constrain the estimate at iteration r because f is nonlinearly related to h and the estimator eq 3 is linear simsle uses the mean and covariance of the posterior jpd at the current iteration r as those of the prior jpd for the next iteration r 1 this procedure updates the prior jpd for iteration r 1 to reflect the inclusion of the head measurements at the current iteration r while the mean is updated by eq 3 the covariance is modified by 6 r ff r 1 r ff r ω r t r hf r after such updating procedures i e eqs 3 and 6 at iteration r the covariance of the posterior jpd residual covariance is denoted as r ff r 1 this residual covariance is then served as the covariance of the prior jpd for the linear estimation at the next iteration continuous updating of the mean and covariance of the posterior jpd is necessary because both the mean and covariance are nonlinear functions of h other geostatistical inverse models iteratively update the mean however they linearly approximate the posterior covariance at the final iteration the above steps are repeated until the two convergence criteria are satisfied 1 the change in variances of the estimated lnk field between the current iteration and the previous iteration change is less than a user specified value 2 the change in simulated heads between successive iterations is smaller than a specified value once one of the two criteria is met we consider the estimates optimal and terminate the iteration 3 3 inverse modeling of the sandbox experiment after the laboratory experiments we selected the steady state head data from the first third and fifth vertical columns of the 24 ports fig 1a and 1c to estimate the conditional effective k distributions in the following three cases the choice of the steady state data for the inverse modeling analysis is to avoid the effects of interaction between the k and the specific storage on the estimates note the term conditional effective will be dropped for convenience unless necessary hereafter 1 case ht is the case where head data from 23 ports excluding the pumping port induced by a constant rate pumping at each of six ports 3 6 19 22 35 and 38 as such 138 steady state head measurements were utilized in the inverse model to estimate k field 2 case ng considers the natural gradient experiment where 24 steady state head measurements are available 3 case pi is the case where the inverse model analyzed the data from the precipitation infiltration experiment the number of head data points used for this case was different from those in case ht and case ng data from the top ports 1 17 and 33 were discarded due to the unsaturated zone s presence as we explained in section 2 2 3 and the model accounts for the unsaturated zone forming above the groundwater table therefore there were in total of 21 steady state head measurements in case pi the boundary conditions of case ht case ng and case pi have been described in sections 2 2 1 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 3 4 parameters of the unconditional prior jpd for the inverse analysis the sandbox domain was discretized into 4 050 elements and 4 186 nodes with element dimensions of 2 cm 2 cm the pumping and observation ports were set at the nodes afterward we specified the prior parameters for the inverse model including the mean variance and correlation scales of the prior jpd an exponential function was the covariance function the unconditional mean value of k is 0 22 cm s and the variance of lnk is 1 5 yeh et al 2015 articulated that correlation scales represent the average more precisely ½ length thickness and width of the dominant heterogeneities in a formation accordingly the correlation scales were assigned as 90 cm and 10 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively after visual examination of the geometry of the19 layers cases ng and pi involve some unsaturated zones near the top boundary in the inverse modeling we simulated the unsaturated process using vsaft2 and gardner s exponential unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function gardner 1958 with the pore size distribution parameter α 0 001 cm 1 which is assumed spatially constant and known in the inverse modeling analysis the saturated hydraulic conductivity is the same as in the saturated zone 3 5 independent pumping test validation because the actual k values in the sandbox are unknown one way to validate the k estimates is to use them to predict drawdown distributions of independent pumping tests using pumping and observation ports not used in the model s calibration e g illman et al 2007 following this logic we used the head data from the second and fourth columns of 16 ports not used in the inverse models of three cases for validation 180 steady state drawdown data sets from twelve pumping tests at ports 10 11 12 13 14 15 26 27 28 29 30 and 31 the green ports in fig 1a were used for the validation purpose afterward we used the k estimates from different tests to simulate the steady state drawdown fields and compared them with the 180 data the agreement between predicted and measured drawdowns for the twelve validation pumping tests was evaluated using scatterplots of the measured and predicted drawdowns popular performance metrics i e linear regression coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error l1 and the mean square error l2 provide the quantitative assessment 3 6 uncertainty analysis of independent pumping tests illman et al 2007 and liu et al 2007 proposed the independent pumping test concept for validating ht estimates and many have followed afterward however the highly parameterized inverse problem including ht is underdetermined or ill defined with the given data set simsle s estimate is the statistically most likely solution nevertheless it neither thoroughly identifies the actual k field nor predicts an independent pumping test free of uncertainty although the residual variance eq 6 addresses the parameter estimation uncertainty its impact on predicting the head field under different flow scenarios remains unresolved reliability of the validation this study adopts a conditional monte carlo simulation approach to address this issue specifically we generate 100 realizations of possible heterogeneous k fields having the same unconditional spatial statistics additionally they reproduce the observed heads at the observation wells in ht ng and pi experiments i e conditional realizations subsequently these realizations are used to simulate the twelve independent pumping tests to consider the effects of unresolved heterogeneity in the effective k field this conditional monte carlo simulation was accomplished using the approach by gao et al 2021 based on sle and the karhunen loeve expansion method sleklm the procedure of sleklm followed 1 it first employs sle to derive the conditional effective lnk field and the conditional covariance matrix of lnk 2 using the conditional covariance of lnk resulting from sle sleklm then generates the zero mean conditional realizations 3 afterward these zero mean realizations are added to the conditional effective lnk field to form the conditional realizations of lnk fields which are then converted to the conditional realizations of k fields 4 finally we used them to predict the drawdowns of independent pumping tests at validation wells 4 results first the effects of the unconditional mean as prior for inversion of ht ng and pi data on their estimated k fields are discussed in terms of independent pumping test results and uncertainty cross correlation analysis explaining the differences follows afterward the effects of conditional effective k estimates from ng and pi as the prior mean for ht are presented and discussed 4 1 effective k estimates with unconditional prior fig 2 a shows a sketch of the layers in the sandbox based on a visual examination we assigned a color to each layer according to the five types of sands and their k values see table 1 this figure shows that layers 9 and 12 are the highest k layers while layers 4 and 14 are the lowest the effective k field from case ht is illustrated in fig 2b comparing it with fig 2a we notice that this k field closely resembles fig 2a in layers 1 7 8 9 12 16 17 and 19 suggesting that the k tomogram captures the general shapes and locations of the layers we also find that the k values of layers 2 11 13 and 18 in fig 2b case ht are slightly higher than those in fig 2a fig 2c is the effective k field from case ng revealing that it captures the layers 1 6 8 10 12 16 and 18 in fig 2a however the high k layers 2 9 12 and 19 the k values are higher than those in fig 2a the effective k field from case pi fig 2d resembles that in layers 8 13 16 17 and 18 in fig 2a overall case pi reproduces only a very vague pattern of the sandbox aquifer s layer structure detecting only the low k layers general location we also conducted variogram analysis of the conditional effective k estimates of the three cases table 2 lists the resulting spatial statistics including the geometric mean kg variance of lnk σ in k 2 and the horizontal correlation scale λ x and the vertical λ z of an exponential variogram among case ht ng and pi table 2 shows that case pi has the largest kg the smallest σ2 ln k and the largest λ x in contrast the effective k in case ng has the smallest kg the largest σ2 ln k and the moderate λ x the contour plots in fig 2 echo these differences in these spatial statistics 4 2 independent pumping tests validation and uncertainty validations of the effective k estimates their uncertainty and performance metrics are presented in fig 3 a b and c for case ht case ng and case pi the red circles in these figures are the measured versus the predicted drawdowns based on the effective k field the green circles are the measured versus the predicted resulting from the 100 k realizations specifically each green circle is the observed drawdown at an observation well induced by one of the twelve pumping tests in a conditional realization of the k field the black lines are the 1 1 line while the red lines are the regression lines of the red circles and the green lines are for the green circles the performance metrics of the red circles demonstrate that the effective k estimates from case ht fig 3a yields the best prediction which has the highest r2 and smallest l1 l2 the case ng follows and case pi is the last however the deviation of the red line from the 1 1 line is the least in case ng case ht the second and case pi the last as reflected in their slopes and intercepts the large kg in case pi table 2 in addition to the uncertain boundary flux may expound the systematically lower predicted drawdowns than the observed at large values notice that the difference in the slopes of the regression lines for case ng 0 865 and case ht 0 812 is small but the intercept of case ng 0 468 is larger than case ht 0 325 the significant scattering of the red circles around heads less than 4 cm in case ng due to its large σ2 ln k explain the difference on the other hand the larger scattering of the red circles in case pi than case ht may be due to its uncertain flux boundary since its σ2 ln k is the smallest nevertheless the spatial statistics represent the entire domain and the different patterns of cross correlations between the pumping and observation wells in independent pumping test may complicate the interpretation the more significant dispersal of the green circles than the red circles in fig 3a b and c is no surprise reflecting the effects of unaccounted heterogeneity in the effective k field scatterings are the uncertainty in the validation using the effective k field representing possible deviations of actual heads from the predicted from the effective k among the three figures the green circles from k realizations in fig 3a have the highest r2 0 837 and smallest l1 l2 0 353 and 0 302 respectively fig 3b and 3c show larger scatterings of the data than fig 3a confirming the robustness of the ht survey for capturing most of the heterogeneity in the sandbox these uncertainties are approximate likely not absolute ones based on rigorous stochastic theories the above examples highlight the usefulness of the relative uncertainties among different cases as emphasized in yeh et al 2015 the spatial statistics in table 2 also provide some explanation of above behaviors we also notice that the scattering increases with the drawdown values this finding is consistent with the stochastic theories gelhar 1993 that uncertainty of drawdown is proportional to the variance of the uncharacterized k heterogeneity and the average gradient which is large near the pumping well where drawdown is large case ht s superior performance is anticipated because six pumping tests at different locations were conducted and 23 heads were collected during each test case ht thus had six sets of partially non redundant data sets wen et al 2019 on the other hand case ng had only one excitation flow from left to right with the 24 head data measured at 24 ports meanwhile case pi had only 21 head data induced by vertical recharge from the precipitation infiltration events flow from top to left and right sides of the sandbox unequivocally the number of non redundant data in the inverse modeling plays a critical role since these results are from the same inverse algorithm in particular ht uses a similar number of wells but creates more non fully redundant data sets however the head data from case ng consisted of only three more than that in case pi under one unidirectional flow stress the cross correlation analysis next may explain the better performance of case ng than case pi 4 3 cross correlation analysis in inverse modeling the cross correlation represents the contribution of the parameter at a location in the heterogeneous aquifer to the head observed at a well kitanidis vomvoris 1983 kitanidis 1995 we followed this school of thought and analyzed the cross correlation for the ht ng and pi experiments 4 3 1 case ht the cross correlation maps of the head at an observation well and k anywhere in the aquifer during two steady state cross hole pumping tests are presented in fig 4 a and 4b where the flow fields also are illustrated in fig 4a the monitoring port the black circle is on the left and the pumping port the white circle is on the right the locations of the pumping and the monitoring well were switched in fig 4b these figures reveal that the positive cross correlation coefficients with values 0 4 form a red crescent shaped region near the top boundary a negative correlation with values less than 0 1 forms a similar crescent shaped region near the lower boundary as such the correlation results indicate that the head s perturbation at the observation port could reveal the k perturbations within the crescent shaped regions if the pumping port and the observation port locations are exchanged in fig 4b the crescent shaped region covers the same area as fig 4a thus the observed heads in these two figures carry the same information about k s variation in the aquifer a well known reciprocity principle in diffusion equations the contour plots in fig 4c and 4d are the cases where a pair of the pumping and observation ports are along a vertical line when the pair is near the right side of the sandbox boundary the distribution is illustrated in fig 4c on the other hand fig 4d shows the distribution when the pair is close to the sandbox left side boundary the high correlation areas reside above the observation port as well as below the pumping port the smaller area below the pumping port is due to the impermeable boundary at the bottom of the sandbox fig 4a 4b 4c and 4d reveal that the regions of high cross correlation values vary with the locations of the pair ports since there are 23 observed ports in one pumping test selecting different pumping locations alters the flow field to allow high correlation areas to cover the different parts of the aquifer ht s principle 4 3 2 case ng natural gradient the natural gradient experiments cross correlation distribution and flow fields are depicted in fig 4e to 4 h for different observation port locations the black circles notice that these figures head contour levels are different from fig 4a b c and d in case ng the mean flow was unidirectional flow from the left to the right the k on the upstream of the observation well is positively correlated with the head at the well the k on the downstream of the observation well near the right boundary is negatively correlated with the head at the well this result manifests the effect of the flow predominantly in the horizontal direction of the long correlation length of k the regions of high cross correlation areas also varied with the location of the observation port again high cross correlation areas from the selected 24 steady state heads covered most sandbox aquifer areas nevertheless because the sandbox is a 2 d vertical plane changing flow direction from left to right to right to left only results in redundant information due to the reciprocity nature of groundwater flow 4 3 3 case pi precipitation infiltration as illustrated in fig 4i to 4 l at the regions of high cross correlation 0 6 resulting from the observation port at different locations cover a small area downstream of the observation port the correlation contour and flow patterns are different from the previous two cases these figures reveal a similar monotonous correlation pattern over a sizeable horizontal domain indicating heterogeneity at many parts of the sandbox equally impacts the head at a port that is to say deciphering the contribution from heterogeneity at different locations could be difficult the flux boundary condition at the top is likely the culprit for such a correlation pattern specifically a constant head boundary and the observed head at a well reveal the hydraulic gradient under a steady flow condition reveals the k between them relative to other locations even though the flux is unknown in contrast the head perturbation around the mean head at the well in a flow field with a known flux boundary could result from either or both the perturbations from k and hydraulic gradient for this reason the cross correlation patterns are monotonous in case pi the head measurement is less informative about the k than in ht and ng cases besides the inverse modeling of the sandbox experiment assumed uniform recharge flux from precipitation infiltration experiment at the top boundary and assumed unsaturated flow parameters for these reasons inversion of data from case pi of the sandbox yielded less heterogeneity information than from case ng the results of the cross correlation analysis are consistent with the inverse modeling results and expound on the relative performance of ht ng and pi approaches 4 4 effects of conditional prior common sense tells us that a good guess parameter value could lead to fast convergence in a nonlinear problem and a better solution in an underdetermined problem this intuition suggests that the k fields from case ng or case pi should be helpful as the mean of the prior jpd for case ht s to improve the estimate further we could evaluate the benefits of different prior information in addition it may show that the mean of prior jpd for simsle matters even using the same unconditional covariance for all cases the covariance may affect the final estimates absolute uncertainty or the posterior jpd however critical to our interest are the actual estimates and the relative uncertainty between different cases 4 4 1 k estimates case ng ht denotes the scenario where the effective k estimates from case ng were used as the prior mean for ht the effective k field from case ng ht is displayed in fig 5 a comparing fig 5a with fig 2b case ht and the reference k field fig 2a we find that in case ng ht the k locations and values of layers 4 5 13 14 16 and 18 are closer to the outline of the reference layers fig 2a than those in case ht this result indicates that the prior conditional effective k from case ng indeed improves the estimate by ht alone case pi ht represents the scenario where the k estimates from case pi were used as the prior mean for ht the estimated effective k field for case pi ht is illustrated in fig 5b the result is similar to fig 2b case ht indicative of little new information gain by incorporating the estimates from pi as the prior mean for ht 4 4 2 validation and uncertainty the red circles in scatterplots of the predicted based on conditional effective k fields versus the measured drawdowns of the twelve independent pumping tests including regression line r2 l1 and l2 norms are displayed in fig 6 a for case ng ht and fig 6b for case pi ht comparing the red circles in fig 6a case ng ht and fig 3a case ht manifests that in case ng ht r2 increases from 0 849 to 0 925 likewise l1 decreases from 0 306 to 0 193 and l2 decreases from 0 263 to 0 130 similarly the comparison of the green circles predictions based on conditional k realizations in fig 3a case ht and fig 6a reaches the same conclusion as the comparison based on the red circles the behaviors of the red and green circles confirm that prior information from case ng for ht analysis can improve the accuracy of ht estimates and reduce the uncertainty of their validation examining fig 6b case pi ht and fig 3a case ht we find that the performance metrics of both the red and green circles become slightly worse specifically using the conditional effective k estimates from case pi as the prior mean for ht inversion slightly degrades the ht performance such degradation seems to indicate impacts of factors other than the low cross correlation expounded previously scrutinizing results of the twelve independent pumping tests in fig 3c and fig 6b we find that the estimated k from case pi and case pi ht persistently predicted lower drawdowns than the observed at large drawdowns this finding suggests that besides the low cross correlation due to the flux boundary condition the uniform flux boundary 0 0116 cm s at the top of the simulation domain likely deviates from the actual flux and its distribution the presence of the unsaturated zone near the boundary may exacerbate the discrepancy neither did we measure the unsaturated zone parameters such as pore size parameter α saturated water content θs and others of sands near the top of the sandbox nor did we collect soil water pressures in the unsaturated zone vsaft2 with our guessed unsaturated parameters may incorrectly simulate the fluxes recharging the saturated zone and discharging from the side boundaries near the top these issues deserve further investigation however σ2 ln k λ x and λ z from case pi are noticeably different from other cases in table 2 indicating that the conditional effective k from case pi inaccurately described the sandbox aquifer s heterogeneous distribution as evident in fig 2d further the flawed mean k for the prior jpd of case pi ht should explain the degradation of case pi ht s performance summarizing these results the correct mean for the prior jpd for ht could improve the estimates of ht and otherwise we show that collecting the head data sets under natural gradient conditions to estimate the k field and then using it as the mean parameter field as prior jpd for ht analysis can enhance the k estimates 5 summary and conclusions intuitively additional information from natural events i e natural gradient ng precipitation infiltration pi could benefit ht s analysis we conducted ht ng pi and twelve independent pumping test experiments in a laboratory sandbox to substantiate our intuition then we employed simsle to derive conditional effective k estimates and sleklm to form 100 conditional k realizations using the head measurements from the ht ng and pi experiments afterward twelve independent pumping tests were simulated with the conditional effective k field and conditional realizations to evaluate the predictive capability of the conditional effective k field and address uncertainty in their predictions this study also investigated the effects of prior information on ht analysis notably the conditional effective k estimates from ng or pi were incorporated into ht analysis as the mean for ht s prior joint probability distribution the results of these estimates were then assessed by predicting twelve independent single hole pumping tests the results lead to the following conclusions 1 among ht ng and pi events using the same unconditional mean for the prior jpd in the inversion ht surveys yield the highest resolution of the estimated conditional effective k field and the least uncertainty of drawdown predictions the estimated k field from the ng experiment follows and the head measurements from the pi experiment are least effective 2 cross correlation analysis explains that ht creates many non fully redundant heterogeneity information sets by changing the flow fields using the same monitoring network as ng and pi more interestingly the flux boundary condition in pi case explains the lowest cross correlation between head and heterogeneity 3 a decent conditional effective k field as the mean of the prior jpd for ht inverse modeling is amicable to a better solution of an inverse problem incorrect boundary flux and inadequate flow modeling in the unsaturated zone tainted the conditional effective k field from precipitation infiltration events consequently using this flawed conditional effective k field as the mean of the prior jpd for ht deteriorates the ht s performance meanwhile using the pristine conditional effective k field from the natural gradient events as the mean leads to noticeable improvements of the k estimates than using the unconditional mean in ht analysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

3964,submerged flexible vegetation such as reeds and sedge are quite common in rivers during flood seasons different from rigid aquatic vegetation like shurbs flexible vegetation bends under the effect of streamwise flow making the velocity profile even more complicated this study aims to build an analytical model for predicting the vertical velocity profile in an open channel flow fully covered by submerged flexible vegetation whose projection area varies in vertical direction a classical two layer approach is applied which divides the flow into a vegetation layer and a free surface layer using the top of the vegetation patch as the boundary for the vegetation layer the vegetation induced drag force is assumed to be proportion to the local streamwise velocity and projection area considering the influence of vegetation bending in order to obtain the vertical velocity profile width averaged navier stokes equation is solved with a first order closure scheme for the reynolds stress for the free surface layer similar approach as the vegetation layer is applied while a wake function is added into the solution and the vegetation induced drag force is considered to be zero in this layer the average relative error between the results of current analytical model and experimental measurements is 4 11 indicating the applicability and accuracy of the model to predict the vertical velocity profile keywords analytical model velocity profile flexible canopies drag force linear superposition 1 introduction in recent years flexible canopies flows have attracted extensive attention fonseca and fisher 1986 wilson et al 2003 järvelä 2005 sukhodolov 2005 boller and carrington 2006 righetti 2008 li and xie 2011 huai et al 2013 wang et al 2019 this is because flexible canopies occupy a large proportion of both natural rivers and coastal zones see fig 1 compared with rigid vegetation flexible vegetation can bend to different degrees under the influence of flowing water wilson 2007 stone et al 2013 and the degree of bending will also change with different flow velocities abdelrhman 2007 kubrak et al 2012 in the meantime the different degrees of bending lead to changes of vegetation drag force on flow which in turn will affect the flow velocity the flexible vegetation flow interaction results in complex flow turbulent characteristics carollo et al 2005 järvelä 2005 hence the flow velocity characteristics are also more complex than those when rigid vegetation exists velocity distribution in vegetated channels is a fundamental and significant scientific problem to date which is highly related to the prediction of flow rate and flow turbulent structure for example pollutant and sediment transport has a strong relationship with flow velocity with implications for ecological issues as well as erosion and riverbed stability various calculation methods of velocity profiles identify two main methods numerical solution models and analytical solution models uittenbogaard 2003 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 liu et al 2012 a numerical solution model such as the method of large eddy simulation can accurately predict and analyze the characteristics of vegetation flow su et al 2003 fitzmaurice et al 2004 stoesser et al 2006 stoesser et al 2009 this method requires heavy computation which may take a long time however the explicit expression obtained by the analytical solution model can help predict the velocity conveniently and quickly huai et al 2014 huthoff et al 2007 stone and shen 2002 wang et al 2015 according to the spatial physical structure vegetated flow is divided into vegetation layers the area from the bottom of the riverbed to the top of the vegetation and a free water layer above the vegetation according to turbulence theory mccomb 1990 the vegetation flow can be divided into three sections i near the bottom of the vegetation where the turbulent structure is mainly dominated by the karmen vortex nezu and sanjou 2008 okamoto and nezu 2009 ii near the top of vegetation that is near the interface between vegetation layer and the free water layer due to the discontinuity of flow resistance along the vertical direction a great difference in the flow velocity occurs leading to the formation of the mixing layer ghisalberti and nepf 2006 katul et al 2002 iii far from the top of vegetation where the flow is described by the boundary layer theory based on the displacement of the zero plane katul et al 2011 poggi et al 2004 klopstra et al 1997 believed that the analytical solution of the velocity distribution deduced from the rigid vegetation was also applicable to flexible vegetation when the degree of flexible vegetation bending was small however the resistance mechanism of flexible vegetation is completely different from that of rigid vegetation hence the formula of klopstra et al 1997 may not be applicable when the vegetation has a large degree of bending to obtain the velocity profile in a flexible vegetated channel we need to investigate the drag force of the vegetation on the flow based on the principle of flow past cylinders the drag force of erect rigid vegetation is proportional to the square of the flow velocity hoerner 1965 however owing to the streamlined state of flexible vegetation greatly reducing its blocking effect on flow vogel 1981 kouwen and fathi moghadam 2000 schoneboom et al 2010 the drag force velocity relationship may be different experimental results shows that the streamlined shape of vegetation causes the drag force of vegetation decrease from the direct proportion to the square of the flow velocity to the approximate direct proportion to the flow velocity in other words in the case of large deflection bending the drag force of vegetation and the flow velocity show an approximate linear relation armanini et al 2005 studied the relationship between the drag force of flexible wicker and velocity using a force sensor and found that when the flexible wicker shows a large deflection under the action of water flow i e streamline state the resistance of wicker to flow is approximately linear with velocity wilson et al 2010 used trees with a height between 1 4 m and 4 m to conduct resistance research and found that the resistance of trees to water flow is related to the velocity when the flow velocity is greater than 5 m s the resistance decreases to be proportional to the first square of the flow velocity wang et al 2015 observed an approximately linear relationship between the drag force of bending vegetation and the streamwise mean flow velocity which differs significantly from the case of rigid upright vegetation previous researches mainly focus rigid vegetation stem with uniform frontal width ghisalberti and nepf 2002 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 liu et al 2013 huai et al 2014 some consider the velocity profile in the flexible vegetation flow with variable frontal width in vertical direction and constructs a shape function to obtain the velocity profile wang et al 2019 which can be used to the vegetation with gradually increasing frontal width from the bottom up however the shape function they proposed has limitations and needs to be developed to be suitable for other vegetation form in addition the empirical parameters in the theoretical model needs further investigations in this paper we establish new analytical solutions for the velocity profile for submerged flexible canopies such as reeds and sedge which is verified by the flow velocity measurement experiments the flow structure is divided into two distinct layers namely the lower vegetation layer and the upper free water layer based on the previous assumption of the linear vegetation drag force velocity relationship and momentum balance concepts we propose a new drag force velocity expression in the vegetation layer then combining the momentum balance concept and wake function concept the analytical solution of the velocity profile in non vegetation layer is obtained finally the predicted velocity in each layer is compared with the experimental data from present study and other researchers 2 methods and materials 2 1 model vegetation the model vegetation studied here is different from the previous vegetation cases ghisalberti and nepf 2002 katul et al 2002 poggi et al 2009 which have vertically uniform and regular shapes huai et al 2019 the flexible vegetation can bend significantly under the forces exerted by the flowing water the bending picture is shown in fig 2 θ is defined as the averaged bending angle which is the angle between the vertical direction and the line through the initial and final points of bending for a single vegetation element in this study the projection area a f is calculated at 0 01 m δ h v intervals through a matlab code the principle of the code is based on the photograph of the vegetation the gray level of which is transformed and then adopts the method of stratified calculation then the frontal area per water volume a is expressed as a m a f δ h v where m is the number of the vegetation per unit bed area the calculated vertical distribution of the vegetation density a is far from uniform as shown in fig 3 where z in the vertical coordinate represents the vertical distance with z 0 at the channel bed h v is the vegetation height after bending under the influence of flow hence we can conclude that the vegetation has an irregular vertical distribution in the frontal projection area which is more representative of natural aquatic vegetation the average height of the plastic flexible plants was 21 cm and each vegetation had 11 leaves with a long diameter of 1 5 cm see fig 4 a the transverse spreading width of the leaves in a natural state was approximately 17 cm and the longitudinal spreading width was approximately 4 5 cm this kind of vegetation could sway and bend in the flow and was used to simulate the sedge which is common in natural rivers the bottom section of each vegetation instance 1 cm thick was made of ceramic and gathered the separate 11 leaves each vegetation was fixed at the flume bed with wire and glass glue fig 4 a the vegetation was arranged in a staggered manner see fig 4 b and the longitudinal and transverse spacings are 0 15 m in wide channel with b 1 m and 0 10 m in the other channel with b 0 6 m 2 2 velocity measurement the experiments were conducted in two recirculated glass flumes see huai et al 2019 and wang et al 2019 one of which is 20 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 4 m deep and the other of which is 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 4 m deep these two flumes had a rectangular cross section and the tailgate at the end of the flumes was used to adjust the water level the schematic diagram of the experimental setup and picture of experimental vegetation are shown in fig 5 in which the flexible vegetation was submerged and covered the whole flume width the coordinate system is x 0 at the leading edge of the vegetation zone with the positive direction along the main flow direction y 0 at the sidewall of the flume and z 0 at the flume bed for the channel covered by submerged flexible canopies the flow can be divided into two horizontal layers a vegetation layer and a free water layer h is the water depth h v is the projective height of the model vegetation after bending and h h h v presents the height of the free water layer we are interested in the flow region where the flow has been fully developed and steady i e x 0 and t 0 hence the length of the vegetation zone is 8 m which is long enough to allow the flow to reach stability in the vegetated channel when the flow enters the vegetated flume the flow velocity gradually decreases along the longitudinal direction due to the vegetation drag force and eventually reaches an equilibrium a length scale x d is proposed to demonstrate the distance from the leading edge of the vegetation to the cross section where the flow is fully developed we have mentioned above that we focused on the velocity profile in the fully developed region hence the determination of the adjustment length x d is necessary to select an appropriately measured cross section x d m i n 3 5 d 7 h v in a vegetated flume with high flow blockage where d is the width of the vegetation patch belcher et al 2003 rominger and nepf 2011 liu and nepf 2016 according to the parameters in this study the maximum adjustment length is x d 3 5 m therefore the measured cross section was chosen as x 4 5 m where the flow was fully developed the experimental variables that interest us are vegetation density m and water depth h hence we measured the flow velocity using acoustic doppler velocity adv under various vegetation densities and water depths the adv probe was placed at the middle of the channel and at the midline of every two rows of the vegetation in addition 25 35 measured points in the measured line were made the sampling frequency of adv is 50 hz and the measurement time of each measured point is set as 120 s that is 6000 instantaneous velocity can be obtained at each measured point the corresponding and supplementary parameters are detailed in table 1 3 framework for predicting the velocity the flow structure can be divided into two layers the vegetation layer and free surface layer we here construct a conceptual framework that can predict the velocity profile in these two layers the velocity in the vegetation layer is deduced from the improved momentum equation and the velocity in the free surface layer is considered to be the sum of the momentum equation and wake effect 3 1 velocity in vegetation layer considering the streamwise force balance among the gravity component the reynolds shear stress and the vegetation drag force the vertical momentum equation can be obtained as 1 τ z f v ρ g i 0 where τ is the reynolds stress f v is the drag force of the vegetation ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and i is the free water slope a first order closure scheme is proposed to calculate the reynolds stress wang 2014 namely 2 τ ρ k v u z u v z where k v is the karman coefficient in the vegetation layer u g i h v 0 5 is the shear velocity at the top of the vegetation and u v is the time averaged velocity inside the vegetation layer based on the classical drag formula the drag force f v is expressed as hoerner 1965 3 f v 0 5 ρ c d a u v 2 where c d is the form drag coefficient of the vegetation a m d denotes the frontal area per flow volume and m is the vegetation density specifically m is defined as the number of the stems per unit bed area d is the frontal projected width of the stem eq 3 is often applied to natural vegetation which behaves similar to rigid circular cylinders however the model vegetation is flexible and can bend under the forces exerted by the flowing water oplatka 1998 pointed that the trunk and branches of flexible vegetation may reconfigure and streamline with increasing flow velocity hence previous studies oplatka 1998 armanini et al 2005 james et al 2008 wilson et al 2008 mentioned that classical drag formula eq 3 could not be directly applied to the natural flexible vegetation because it did not consider the vegetation s flexibility under the action of flow wang et al 2015 used a flexible cylinder stem to conduct mechanical analysis and found that the streamwise drag force from bending vegetation is almost linearly related to the flow velocity when the vegetation experiences large bending i e the average bending angle is greater than 30 the flexible vegetation studied in this paper also shows large bending due to the action of the flow hence following the study of wang et al 2015 we adopted a linear assumption and constructed a drag force expression of the flexible vegetation f v shown as 4 f v ρ c v m d u u v which is similar to the form of rigid case it should be noted that the shear velocity u is introduced to balance the dimensions c v is the dimensionless drag coefficient similar to 0 5 c d in eq 3 by substituting eqs 3 and 4 into eq 1 the momentum equation can be rewritten as 5 k v u z u

are the modified bessel functions of the first and second order of α 0 and 1 respectively c 1 and c 2 are the constant coefficients and their expression can be obtained from the following boundary

layer nikora et al 2013 suggested that the use of a single physical concept to predict velocity profile is not sufficient to cover all possible experimental cases of flow vegetation interactions hence they proposed a method in which a vertical velocity profile in submerged vegetated channels is modeled as a linear superposition of various physics concepts see fig 2 in nikora et al 2013 following their analyses the velocity profile in the non vegetation layer may be presented as a superposition of individual profiles formed by a particular momentum transport mechanism i e u n u n 1 u n 2 where u n 1 is from the momentum balance and u n 2 is from the region effect 3 2 1 velocity profile u n 1 derived from the momentum balance in the non vegetation layer the momentum equations can be expressed as 15 τ z ρ g i 0 where the reynolds stress τ is calculated in the same way as in the vegetation layer 16 τ ρ k n u z u n 1 z where k n is the karman coefficient in the non vegetation layer and u n 1 is the longitudinal velocity in the free water layer substituting eq 16 into eq 15 gives 17 k n u z u n 1 z z g i 0 by solving the eq 17 the expression of velocity u n 1 is 18 u n 1 z gi k n

with the coefficients the component of velocity profile u v 1 can be obtained 3 2 2 velocity profile u n 2 derived from the wake effect the wake effect on the velocity can be demonstrated using one of the analytical approximations such as a trigonometric function monin and yaglom 1971 23 u n 2 u 2 π k sin 2 π z 2 h where u is the interfacial shear velocity representing a scale of turbulent momentum transport nepf 2012 π 0 2 is the coles s wake strength parameter nezu and rodi 1986 combining eqs 18 and 23 the velocity profile in the free water layer can be given as 24 u n u n 1 u n 2 gi k n u z c 3 l n z c 4 u 2 π k sin 2 π z 2 h 4 results experimental and predicted velocity profiles along the vertical direction in a submerged vegetated channel are compared as shown in fig 6 the measured velocity in all cases present an s shape with an inflection point below the top of the vegetation layer the s shape is due to the vertical change of the vegetation density a in general the theoretical data basically agrees with the measured data in the vegetation layer and free water layer the difference between the measured and predicted data can be determined through error analysis an absolute error is defined as the difference between the predicted and experimental values of the time averaged velocities hence the average absolute error is calculated as 25 δ a 1 n 1 n a b s u v n predicted u v n measured where n denotes the number of measured points in a vertical line for each case u v n u v o r u n indicating the time averaged longitudinal velocity in vegetation layer and free water layer respectively the average relative error is defined as 26 δ r 1 n 1 n a b s u v n predicted u v n measured u v n measured 100 the results of average absolute errors and average relative error tests are detailed in table 2 as shown in table 2 the theoretical method used in the models has a time averaged velocity within 0 012 m s accuracy in terms of the average absolute error the average relative errors varied within 11 for all experimental cases wang et al 2019 also adopted the similar vegetation to analyze the velocity profile the submerged vegetation has two main features first they have a variable frontal width in the vertical direction second they can bend in the flow in the vegetation layer wang et al 2019 focuses on the shape of the submerged vegetation with variable frontal width in vertical direction and constructs a shape function to obtain the velocity profile they do not consider the bending of the vegetation the present work focuses on the influence of the vegetation bending and adopts the linear relationship between the vegetation drag force and longitudinal velocity in the free water layer wang et al 2019 used the single momentum equation to obtain the velocity profile the present work adopts combined effect of fluid mechanics in deriving velocity profile including the momentum balance and wake function the average relative errors of the analytical model from wang et al 2019 are within 20 which are larger than those from this study in addition the analytical model from wang et al 2019 is suitable for the vegetation such as sedge and shrub the frontal width of which gradually increases from the bottom to the top and can be rigid last the empirical expressions adopted in wang et al 2019 are still needed to be given full consideration for various flow conditions and vegetation shape by contrast the present model is more reliable for the velocity prediction in the flexible vegetated channels 5 discussion 5 1 extension of the analytical model we used the experimental data from nepf and vivoni 2000 and hui et al 2009 to figure out the applicability of the analytical model the model flexible vegetation of nepf and vivoni 2000 also has variable frontal widths along the water depth see fig 3 in nepf and vivoni 2000 the height h v of the flexible vegetation is 16 cm and was constructed based on the similarity in geometry and flexural rigidity to prototype aquatic vegetation as reported by kouwen and li 1980 each vegetation instance consisted of six blades of width w 0 3 cm bundled to a short 2 cm basal stem diameter 0 64 cm the blades were made from a 0 025 cm thick vinyl plastic we extracted the frontal area per volume a from fig 3 in nepf and vivoni 2000 and used its average value in the present analytical model the model vegetation in hui et al 2009 is also not uniform along the water depth to describe the vertical change of the model vegetation shape from hui et al 2009 the vegetation diameter is expressed as d d 0 q z where d 0 20 c m is the diameter of the vegetation top and q z denotes the shape function the expression of q z is liu et al 2012 27 q z 2 n z l a z l a 2 b 2 where n 7 is the integer parameter for adjusting the function curve and a and b are two parameters that can be determined by the vegetation characteristic diameters assuming the diameter ratio of the model vegetation bottom to top as r 0 1 the parameter a and b take the values of a h v h v 2 n n n r h v and b h v a 2 n a h v where h v is the vegetation height l 2 0 015 h h v c d m d 0 is a parameter van velzen et al 2003 liu et al 2012 with the vegetation drag coefficient c d 1 5 and the vegetation density m 7 85 m2 and 15 71 m2 after the vertical change of the vegetation shape is obtained the characteristic depth averaged diameter can also be obtained which is used in the present model the predicted velocity from the present analytical model is compared with the experimental data of nepf and vivoni 2000 and hui et al 2009 see fig 7 the average absolute error is 0 004 m s and the average relative error is 5 69 for nepf and vivoni 2000 and 0 017 m s and 7 88 for hui et al 2009 the error statistics for hui et al 2009 are slightly higher which is because the model vegetation used by hui et al 2009 is shrub like vegetation and cannot present large bending overall the prediction from the present model for the velocity in nepf and vivoni 2000 and hui et al 2009 is acceptable confirming that the reliability and authenticity of the proposed theoretical model for the open channels covered by submerged flexible vegetation with a variable frontal area 5 2 superposition of the velocity profile in this study the velocity profile in the free water layer was regarded as a superposition of the momentum balance region and the wake region when the analytical model only considers the momentum balance effect in the free water layer the predicted velocity profile is expressed as 28 u n gi k n u z c 3 l n z c 4 the analytical model neglecting the wake effect is performed in the present experimental case and the results are detailed in fig 8 from fig 8 the predicted velocity form model ignoring the superposition method occurs some deviations from the measured data to be specific it produces a slightly smaller velocity than that from the superposition model it is worth noting that the velocity profile near the water surface tends to be a vertical line this is because when solving a different equation in section 2 2 we utilized the boundary condition of velocity gradient with zero at the water surface 6 conclusion this paper presents an improved model for interpreting and predicting the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity in open channel flows with submerged flexible vegetation such predictions are necessary to fully understand the complex mechanics of flow vegetation interactions and determine the detailed velocity distribution and total flow rate in the proposed model the flow is classified into two layers vegetation layer and free surface layer in the vegetation layer different from rigid vegetation the shape of flexible vegetation has a variable frontal area instead of being uniform in the vertical direction moreover the flexible vegetation can bend significantly considering its flexibility and bending a linear relationship between the drag force of flexible vegetation and the flow velocity is adopted which gives a predict for the vertical velocity distribution in the vegetation layer in the free surface layer a linear superposition approach is utilized which modifies the classical log law considering the wake effect outputs of this two layer model agree well with the measured velocity data with a maximum mean relative error of

3964,submerged flexible vegetation such as reeds and sedge are quite common in rivers during flood seasons different from rigid aquatic vegetation like shurbs flexible vegetation bends under the effect of streamwise flow making the velocity profile even more complicated this study aims to build an analytical model for predicting the vertical velocity profile in an open channel flow fully covered by submerged flexible vegetation whose projection area varies in vertical direction a classical two layer approach is applied which divides the flow into a vegetation layer and a free surface layer using the top of the vegetation patch as the boundary for the vegetation layer the vegetation induced drag force is assumed to be proportion to the local streamwise velocity and projection area considering the influence of vegetation bending in order to obtain the vertical velocity profile width averaged navier stokes equation is solved with a first order closure scheme for the reynolds stress for the free surface layer similar approach as the vegetation layer is applied while a wake function is added into the solution and the vegetation induced drag force is considered to be zero in this layer the average relative error between the results of current analytical model and experimental measurements is 4 11 indicating the applicability and accuracy of the model to predict the vertical velocity profile keywords analytical model velocity profile flexible canopies drag force linear superposition 1 introduction in recent years flexible canopies flows have attracted extensive attention fonseca and fisher 1986 wilson et al 2003 järvelä 2005 sukhodolov 2005 boller and carrington 2006 righetti 2008 li and xie 2011 huai et al 2013 wang et al 2019 this is because flexible canopies occupy a large proportion of both natural rivers and coastal zones see fig 1 compared with rigid vegetation flexible vegetation can bend to different degrees under the influence of flowing water wilson 2007 stone et al 2013 and the degree of bending will also change with different flow velocities abdelrhman 2007 kubrak et al 2012 in the meantime the different degrees of bending lead to changes of vegetation drag force on flow which in turn will affect the flow velocity the flexible vegetation flow interaction results in complex flow turbulent characteristics carollo et al 2005 järvelä 2005 hence the flow velocity characteristics are also more complex than those when rigid vegetation exists velocity distribution in vegetated channels is a fundamental and significant scientific problem to date which is highly related to the prediction of flow rate and flow turbulent structure for example pollutant and sediment transport has a strong relationship with flow velocity with implications for ecological issues as well as erosion and riverbed stability various calculation methods of velocity profiles identify two main methods numerical solution models and analytical solution models uittenbogaard 2003 baptist et al 2007 huthoff et al 2007 liu et al 2012 a numerical solution model such as the method of large eddy simulation can accurately predict and analyze the characteristics of vegetation flow su et al 2003 fitzmaurice et al 2004 stoesser et al 2006 stoesser et al 2009 this method requires heavy computation which may take a long time however the explicit expression obtained by the analytical solution model can help predict the velocity conveniently and quickly huai et al 2014 huthoff et al 2007 stone and shen 2002 wang et al 2015 according to the spatial physical structure vegetated flow is divided into vegetation layers the area from the bottom of the riverbed to the top of the vegetation and a free water layer above the vegetation according to turbulence theory mccomb 1990 the vegetation flow can be divided into three sections i near the bottom of the vegetation where the turbulent structure is mainly dominated by the karmen vortex nezu and sanjou 2008 okamoto and nezu 2009 ii near the top of vegetation that is near the interface between vegetation layer and the free water layer due to the discontinuity of flow resistance along the vertical direction a great difference in the flow velocity occurs leading to the formation of the mixing layer ghisalberti and nepf 2006 katul et al 2002 iii far from the top of vegetation where the flow is described by the boundary layer theory based on the displacement of the zero plane katul et al 2011 poggi et al 2004 klopstra et al 1997 believed that the analytical solution of the velocity distribution deduced from the rigid vegetation was also applicable to flexible vegetation when the degree of flexible vegetation bending was small however the resistance mechanism of flexible vegetation is completely different from that of rigid vegetation hence the formula of klopstra et al 1997 may not be applicable when the vegetation has a large degree of bending to obtain the velocity profile in a flexible vegetated channel we need to investigate the drag force of the vegetation on the flow based on the principle of flow past cylinders the drag force of erect rigid vegetation is proportional to the square of the flow velocity hoerner 1965 however owing to the streamlined state of flexible vegetation greatly reducing its blocking effect on flow vogel 1981 kouwen and fathi moghadam 2000 schoneboom et al 2010 the drag force velocity relationship may be different experimental results shows that the streamlined shape of vegetation causes the drag force of vegetation decrease from the direct proportion to the square of the flow velocity to the approximate direct proportion to the flow velocity in other words in the case of large deflection bending the drag force of vegetation and the flow velocity show an approximate linear relation armanini et al 2005 studied the relationship between the drag force of flexible wicker and velocity using a force sensor and found that when the flexible wicker shows a large deflection under the action of water flow i e streamline state the resistance of wicker to flow is approximately linear with velocity wilson et al 2010 used trees with a height between 1 4 m and 4 m to conduct resistance research and found that the resistance of trees to water flow is related to the velocity when the flow velocity is greater than 5 m s the resistance decreases to be proportional to the first square of the flow velocity wang et al 2015 observed an approximately linear relationship between the drag force of bending vegetation and the streamwise mean flow velocity which differs significantly from the case of rigid upright vegetation previous researches mainly focus rigid vegetation stem with uniform frontal width ghisalberti and nepf 2002 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 liu et al 2013 huai et al 2014 some consider the velocity profile in the flexible vegetation flow with variable frontal width in vertical direction and constructs a shape function to obtain the velocity profile wang et al 2019 which can be used to the vegetation with gradually increasing frontal width from the bottom up however the shape function they proposed has limitations and needs to be developed to be suitable for other vegetation form in addition the empirical parameters in the theoretical model needs further investigations in this paper we establish new analytical solutions for the velocity profile for submerged flexible canopies such as reeds and sedge which is verified by the flow velocity measurement experiments the flow structure is divided into two distinct layers namely the lower vegetation layer and the upper free water layer based on the previous assumption of the linear vegetation drag force velocity relationship and momentum balance concepts we propose a new drag force velocity expression in the vegetation layer then combining the momentum balance concept and wake function concept the analytical solution of the velocity profile in non vegetation layer is obtained finally the predicted velocity in each layer is compared with the experimental data from present study and other researchers 2 methods and materials 2 1 model vegetation the model vegetation studied here is different from the previous vegetation cases ghisalberti and nepf 2002 katul et al 2002 poggi et al 2009 which have vertically uniform and regular shapes huai et al 2019 the flexible vegetation can bend significantly under the forces exerted by the flowing water the bending picture is shown in fig 2 θ is defined as the averaged bending angle which is the angle between the vertical direction and the line through the initial and final points of bending for a single vegetation element in this study the projection area a f is calculated at 0 01 m δ h v intervals through a matlab code the principle of the code is based on the photograph of the vegetation the gray level of which is transformed and then adopts the method of stratified calculation then the frontal area per water volume a is expressed as a m a f δ h v where m is the number of the vegetation per unit bed area the calculated vertical distribution of the vegetation density a is far from uniform as shown in fig 3 where z in the vertical coordinate represents the vertical distance with z 0 at the channel bed h v is the vegetation height after bending under the influence of flow hence we can conclude that the vegetation has an irregular vertical distribution in the frontal projection area which is more representative of natural aquatic vegetation the average height of the plastic flexible plants was 21 cm and each vegetation had 11 leaves with a long diameter of 1 5 cm see fig 4 a the transverse spreading width of the leaves in a natural state was approximately 17 cm and the longitudinal spreading width was approximately 4 5 cm this kind of vegetation could sway and bend in the flow and was used to simulate the sedge which is common in natural rivers the bottom section of each vegetation instance 1 cm thick was made of ceramic and gathered the separate 11 leaves each vegetation was fixed at the flume bed with wire and glass glue fig 4 a the vegetation was arranged in a staggered manner see fig 4 b and the longitudinal and transverse spacings are 0 15 m in wide channel with b 1 m and 0 10 m in the other channel with b 0 6 m 2 2 velocity measurement the experiments were conducted in two recirculated glass flumes see huai et al 2019 and wang et al 2019 one of which is 20 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 4 m deep and the other of which is 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 4 m deep these two flumes had a rectangular cross section and the tailgate at the end of the flumes was used to adjust the water level the schematic diagram of the experimental setup and picture of experimental vegetation are shown in fig 5 in which the flexible vegetation was submerged and covered the whole flume width the coordinate system is x 0 at the leading edge of the vegetation zone with the positive direction along the main flow direction y 0 at the sidewall of the flume and z 0 at the flume bed for the channel covered by submerged flexible canopies the flow can be divided into two horizontal layers a vegetation layer and a free water layer h is the water depth h v is the projective height of the model vegetation after bending and h h h v presents the height of the free water layer we are interested in the flow region where the flow has been fully developed and steady i e x 0 and t 0 hence the length of the vegetation zone is 8 m which is long enough to allow the flow to reach stability in the vegetated channel when the flow enters the vegetated flume the flow velocity gradually decreases along the longitudinal direction due to the vegetation drag force and eventually reaches an equilibrium a length scale x d is proposed to demonstrate the distance from the leading edge of the vegetation to the cross section where the flow is fully developed we have mentioned above that we focused on the velocity profile in the fully developed region hence the determination of the adjustment length x d is necessary to select an appropriately measured cross section x d m i n 3 5 d 7 h v in a vegetated flume with high flow blockage where d is the width of the vegetation patch belcher et al 2003 rominger and nepf 2011 liu and nepf 2016 according to the parameters in this study the maximum adjustment length is x d 3 5 m therefore the measured cross section was chosen as x 4 5 m where the flow was fully developed the experimental variables that interest us are vegetation density m and water depth h hence we measured the flow velocity using acoustic doppler velocity adv under various vegetation densities and water depths the adv probe was placed at the middle of the channel and at the midline of every two rows of the vegetation in addition 25 35 measured points in the measured line were made the sampling frequency of adv is 50 hz and the measurement time of each measured point is set as 120 s that is 6000 instantaneous velocity can be obtained at each measured point the corresponding and supplementary parameters are detailed in table 1 3 framework for predicting the velocity the flow structure can be divided into two layers the vegetation layer and free surface layer we here construct a conceptual framework that can predict the velocity profile in these two layers the velocity in the vegetation layer is deduced from the improved momentum equation and the velocity in the free surface layer is considered to be the sum of the momentum equation and wake effect 3 1 velocity in vegetation layer considering the streamwise force balance among the gravity component the reynolds shear stress and the vegetation drag force the vertical momentum equation can be obtained as 1 τ z f v ρ g i 0 where τ is the reynolds stress f v is the drag force of the vegetation ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration and i is the free water slope a first order closure scheme is proposed to calculate the reynolds stress wang 2014 namely 2 τ ρ k v u z u v z where k v is the karman coefficient in the vegetation layer u g i h v 0 5 is the shear velocity at the top of the vegetation and u v is the time averaged velocity inside the vegetation layer based on the classical drag formula the drag force f v is expressed as hoerner 1965 3 f v 0 5 ρ c d a u v 2 where c d is the form drag coefficient of the vegetation a m d denotes the frontal area per flow volume and m is the vegetation density specifically m is defined as the number of the stems per unit bed area d is the frontal projected width of the stem eq 3 is often applied to natural vegetation which behaves similar to rigid circular cylinders however the model vegetation is flexible and can bend under the forces exerted by the flowing water oplatka 1998 pointed that the trunk and branches of flexible vegetation may reconfigure and streamline with increasing flow velocity hence previous studies oplatka 1998 armanini et al 2005 james et al 2008 wilson et al 2008 mentioned that classical drag formula eq 3 could not be directly applied to the natural flexible vegetation because it did not consider the vegetation s flexibility under the action of flow wang et al 2015 used a flexible cylinder stem to conduct mechanical analysis and found that the streamwise drag force from bending vegetation is almost linearly related to the flow velocity when the vegetation experiences large bending i e the average bending angle is greater than 30 the flexible vegetation studied in this paper also shows large bending due to the action of the flow hence following the study of wang et al 2015 we adopted a linear assumption and constructed a drag force expression of the flexible vegetation f v shown as 4 f v ρ c v m d u u v which is similar to the form of rigid case it should be noted that the shear velocity u is introduced to balance the dimensions c v is the dimensionless drag coefficient similar to 0 5 c d in eq 3 by substituting eqs 3 and 4 into eq 1 the momentum equation can be rewritten as 5 k v u z u v z z c v m d u u v g i 0 the longitudinal time averaged velocity u v can be obtained by solving eq 5 6 u v z c 1 i α f z c 2 k α f z gi c v m d u where f z 2 a z h v and a c v k v m d h v i α and k α are the modified bessel functions of the first and second order of α 0 and 1 respectively c 1 and c 2 are the constant coefficients and their expression can be obtained from the following boundary conditions i the first boundary condition is defined as a no slip condition which indicates that the velocity is zero at the flume bed i e 7 u v z 0 0 namely 8 c 1 i α f 0 c 2 k α f 0 gi c v m d u 0 ii the second boundary condition can be determined from the interfacial shear stress which is 9 τ h v ρ k v u h v u v z z h v ρ u 2 then the velocity gradient at the interface between the vegetation layer and free water layer is 10 u v z z h v u k v h v the vertical gradient of the velocity calculated from eq 6 is 11 u v z z f z 2 z c 1 i 1 f z c 2 k 1 f z combining eqs 10 and 11 at the interface gives 12 f h v 2 h v c 1 i 1 f h v c 2 k 1 f h v u k v h v according to the boundary conditions eqs 8 and 12 the expressions of the two constant coefficients are 13 c 1 2 u k v f h v k 0 f 0 gi c v m d u k 1 f h v i 0 f 0 k 1 f h v i 1 f h v k 0 f 0 14 c 2 c 1 i 1 f h v 2 u k v f h v k 1 f h v then the velocity profile in the vegetation layer can be obtained from eq 6 3 2 velocity in free surface layer nikora et al 2013 suggested that the use of a single physical concept to predict velocity profile is not sufficient to cover all possible experimental cases of flow vegetation interactions hence they proposed a method in which a vertical velocity profile in submerged vegetated channels is modeled as a linear superposition of various physics concepts see fig 2 in nikora et al 2013 following their analyses the velocity profile in the non vegetation layer may be presented as a superposition of individual profiles formed by a particular momentum transport mechanism i e u n u n 1 u n 2 where u n 1 is from the momentum balance and u n 2 is from the region effect 3 2 1 velocity profile u n 1 derived from the momentum balance in the non vegetation layer the momentum equations can be expressed as 15 τ z ρ g i 0 where the reynolds stress τ is calculated in the same way as in the vegetation layer 16 τ ρ k n u z u n 1 z where k n is the karman coefficient in the non vegetation layer and u n 1 is the longitudinal velocity in the free water layer substituting eq 16 into eq 15 gives 17 k n u z u n 1 z z g i 0 by solving the eq 17 the expression of velocity u n 1 is 18 u n 1 z gi k n

velocity in all cases present an s shape with an inflection point below the top of the vegetation layer the s shape is due to the vertical change of the vegetation density a in general the theoretical data basically agrees with the measured data in the vegetation layer and free water layer the difference between the measured and predicted data can be determined through error analysis an absolute error is defined as the difference between the predicted and experimental values of the time averaged velocities hence the average absolute error is calculated as 25 δ a 1 n 1 n a b s u v n predicted u v n measured where n denotes the number of measured points in a vertical line for each case u v n u v o r u n indicating the time averaged longitudinal velocity in vegetation layer and free water layer respectively the average relative error is defined as 26 δ r 1 n 1 n a b s u v n predicted u v n measured u v n measured 100 the results of average absolute errors and average relative error tests are detailed in table 2 as shown in table 2 the theoretical method used in the models has a time averaged velocity within 0 012 m s accuracy in terms of the average absolute error the average relative errors varied within 11 for all experimental cases wang et al 2019 also adopted the similar vegetation to analyze the velocity profile the submerged vegetation has two main features first they have a variable frontal width in the vertical direction second they can bend in the flow in the vegetation layer wang et al 2019 focuses on the shape of the submerged vegetation with variable frontal width in vertical direction and constructs a shape function to obtain the velocity profile they do not consider the bending of the vegetation the present work focuses on the influence of the vegetation bending and adopts the linear relationship between the vegetation drag force and longitudinal velocity in the free water layer wang et al 2019 used the single momentum equation to obtain the velocity profile the present work adopts combined effect of fluid mechanics in deriving velocity profile including the momentum balance and wake function the average relative errors of the analytical model from wang et al 2019 are within 20 which are larger than those from this study in addition the analytical model from wang et al 2019 is suitable for the vegetation such as sedge and shrub the frontal width of which gradually increases from the bottom to the top and can be rigid last the empirical expressions adopted in wang et al 2019 are still needed to be given full consideration for various flow conditions and vegetation shape by contrast the present model is more reliable for the velocity prediction in the flexible vegetated channels 5 discussion 5 1 extension of the analytical model we used the experimental data from nepf and vivoni 2000 and hui et al 2009 to figure out the applicability of the analytical model the model flexible vegetation of nepf and vivoni 2000 also has variable frontal widths along the water depth see fig 3 in nepf and vivoni 2000 the height h v of the flexible vegetation is 16 cm and was constructed based on the similarity in geometry and flexural rigidity to prototype aquatic vegetation as reported by kouwen and li 1980 each vegetation instance consisted of six blades of width w 0 3 cm bundled to a short 2 cm basal stem diameter 0 64 cm the blades were made from a 0 025 cm thick vinyl plastic we extracted the frontal area per volume a from fig 3 in nepf and vivoni 2000 and used its average value in the present analytical model the model vegetation in hui et al 2009 is also not uniform along the water depth to describe the vertical change of the model vegetation shape from hui et al 2009 the vegetation diameter is expressed as d d 0 q z where d 0 20 c m is the diameter of the vegetation top and q z denotes the shape function the expression of q z is liu et al 2012 27 q z 2 n z l a z l a 2 b 2 where n 7 is the integer parameter for adjusting the function curve and a and b are two parameters that can be determined by the vegetation characteristic diameters assuming the diameter ratio of the model vegetation bottom to top as r 0 1 the parameter a and b take the values of a h v h v 2 n n n r h v and b h v a 2 n a h v where h v is the vegetation height l 2 0 015 h h v c d m d 0 is a parameter van velzen et al 2003 liu et al 2012 with the vegetation drag coefficient c d 1 5 and the vegetation density m 7 85 m2 and 15 71 m2 after the vertical change of the vegetation shape is obtained the characteristic depth averaged diameter can also be obtained which is used in the present model the predicted velocity from the present analytical model is compared with the experimental data of nepf and vivoni 2000 and hui et al 2009 see fig 7 the average absolute error is 0 004 m s and the average relative error is 5 69 for nepf and vivoni 2000 and 0 017 m s and 7 88 for hui et al 2009 the error statistics for hui et al 2009 are slightly higher which is because the model vegetation used by hui et al 2009 is shrub like vegetation and cannot present large bending overall the prediction from the present model for the velocity in nepf and vivoni 2000 and hui et al 2009 is acceptable confirming that the reliability and authenticity of the proposed theoretical model for the open channels covered by submerged flexible vegetation with a variable frontal area 5 2 superposition of the velocity profile in this study the velocity profile in the free water layer was regarded as a superposition of the momentum balance region and the wake region when the analytical model only considers the momentum balance effect in the free water layer the predicted velocity profile is expressed as 28 u n gi k n u z c 3 l n z c 4 the analytical model neglecting the wake effect is performed in the present experimental case and the results are detailed in fig 8 from fig 8 the predicted velocity form model ignoring the superposition method occurs some deviations from the measured data to be specific it produces a slightly smaller velocity than that from the superposition model it is worth noting that the velocity profile near the water surface tends to be a vertical line this is because when solving a different equation in section 2 2 we utilized the boundary condition of velocity gradient with zero at the water surface 6 conclusion this paper presents an improved model for interpreting and predicting the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity in open channel flows with submerged flexible vegetation such predictions are necessary to fully understand the complex mechanics of flow vegetation interactions and determine the detailed velocity distribution and total flow rate in the proposed model the flow is classified into two layers vegetation layer and free surface layer in the vegetation layer different from rigid vegetation the shape of flexible vegetation has a variable frontal area instead of being uniform in the vertical direction moreover the flexible vegetation can bend significantly considering its flexibility and bending a linear relationship between the drag force of flexible vegetation and the flow velocity is adopted which gives a predict for the vertical velocity distribution in the vegetation layer in the free surface layer a linear superposition approach is utilized which modifies the classical log law considering the wake effect outputs of this two layer model agree well with the measured velocity data with a maximum mean relative error of 10 9 this model is useful for further study on flooding risk estimation contaminant conveyance and sediment transport in vegetated channels credit authorship contribution statement jiao zhang data
