9780,with the extensive use of plastic film a large number of residual film accumulated in the farmland bringing a huge negative impact on agricultural production studying the effect of residual film on roots is helpful to understand the damage mechanism of residual film on crop growth thus a two year field experiment was conducted with 0 m0 90 m90 180 m180 360 m360 and 720 m720 kg ha 1 residual film and sine and logistic functions were used to simulate root growth and vertical distribution of maize results showed that root length decreased with residual film increasing and was more sensitive to residual film at tasseling filling and maturity stages than at seedling and jointing stages the results of the sine function fitting the total root length showed that the potential maximum root length was decreased and the rooting time was delayed and the root growth time was shortened with the amount of residual film increasing m90 had no significant effect on root length but residual film equal to or greater than 180 kg ha 1 had significant negative effects on root length m180 m360 and m720 significantly reduced the actual total root length by 13 7 23 8 and 33 3 and reduced the potential root length by 9 4 17 1 and 21 8 m360 and m720 significantly shortened the growth time by 3 8 and 6 6 the logistic function fit the vertical root distribution well residual film decreased the root length in deep soil and gathered roots in the soil layer near the depth of d 50 at which 50 of the root length was accumulated residual film decreased the soil depth where 50 and 95 root length were accumulated and increased the proportion of root length in 0 30 cm soil layer this adverse effect increased with residual film amount increasing the dry matter of stems leaves and ears decreased with residual film increasing m90 reduced the above ground dry matter insignificantly and the other treatments with residual film had significant effects at the maturity stage the above ground dry matter in m90 m180 m360 and m720 was reduced by 2 4 14 2 22 2 and 29 4 compared with m0 residual film decreased evapotranspiration et grain yield and water use efficiency wue significantly except m90 et yield and wue were reduced by 1 7 3 0 and 1 1 in m90 and 2 5 17 1 and 16 1 in m180 and 6 2 27 1 and 23 4 in m360 and 8 5 34 7 and 30 8 in m720 respectively in summary the residual film beyond 180 kg ha 1 had a significant negative effect on summer maize this information will be useful to better understand and respond to residual film pollution and ensure safe agricultural production keywords residual film maize root length vertical root distribution yield 1 introduction agricultural mulch has been widely used because it increases soil temperature retains moisture controls weeds and increases yields fan et al 2021 gu et al 2019 yin et al 2016 zheng et al 2021 however due to the difficulties in its decomposition he et al 2009 the limitations of recycling technology yan et al 2014 and the lack of environmental awareness among users liu he and yan 2014 mulching film fragments have accumulated in large quantities in farmland soil which has seriously harmed soil quality and crop production du et al 2018 gao et al 2019 zumilaiti et al 2017 to address this problem degradable mulch an alternative to low density polyethylene mulch has been developed and has been shown to achieve similar effects in farmland gu et al 2020 yin et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 however the higher cost has limited its widespread application more importantly its impacts on the soil environment and biological health still have to be evaluated sintim and flury 2017 thus residual film pollution is likely to remain a serious problem for a long time steinmetz et al 2016 at present residual film is mainly present in arid and cold agricultural areas and the amount of residual film is closely related to mulching methods crop types and the amount of mulch applied he et al 2018 yan et al 2008 it has also been found that residual film reduces yields of cotton dong et al 2013 maize du et al 2018 xin et al 2014 and tomatoes gao et al 2011 zou et al 2016 all of these studies are about the status of residual film and its final impact on agriculture but there are few studies on the damage mechanism of residual film on crops residual film accumulates in the farmland changing soil structure and nutrients distribution in root zones cao et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2020 wan et al 2019 which directly affects roots growth hu et al 2020 li et al 2008 as the main organ of water and nutrient absorption of crops the change of root system is bound to significantly affect above ground dry matter accumulation and yield therefore studying the effect of residual film on crop roots will lead to a better understanding of residual film hazards and enable residual film pollution to be controlled some researchers have found that residual film reduced root length root volume root activity but these results are limited to qualitative analysis in certain soil layers 0 30 cm depth gao et al 2011 li et al 2017 and certain growth stages xin et al 2014 zou et al 2016 the quantitative analysis of residual film on root growth during the whole growing season and in the whole soil profile is unknown as the growth process advances the sensitivity of crops to residual film is different analyzing the sensitivity of crops to residual film at different growth stages helps us to take appropriate measures to reduce the negative impact of residual film on crops moreover roots at different soil depths together form a complete system the growth of roots in the upper soil has a significant effect on the deep roots and vice versa thus it is insufficient to study only the influence of residual film on root system in topsoil and at certain growth stages moreover these studies mostly focused on tomato gao et al 2011 zou et al 2017 and cotton zumilaiti et al 2017 with less research on maize therefore we carried out a two year maize field experiment with different amounts of residual film to 1 determine the growth status of root and root sensitivity to residual film at different growth stages 2 analyze the influence of residual film on the vertical distribution of roots in the entire soil profile 3 and determine the amount of residual film that has a significant negative impact on the dry matter and yield of summer maize so as to provide a theoretical basis for residual film control in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials a two year field experiment was conducted between june 2017 and october 2018 in the irrigation station 34 18 n 108 24 e of northwest a f university yangling which is located in northwest china this region has a typical temperate monsoon climate with a mean annual air temperature of 12 9 mean annual sunshine hours of 2163 8 h mean annual precipitation of 632 mm mean annual pan evaporation of 1500 mm mean sunshine duration of 2163 8 h and a frost free period of more than 210 d the field capacity and permanent wilting points are 24 0 and 8 5 respectively gravimetric moisture content the loam soil has a average dry bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 in 100 cm depth and has organic matter content of 13 36 g kg 1 total nitrogen n content of 0 96 g kg 1 nitrate n content of 73 01 mg kg 1 available phosphorus content of 24 07 mg kg 1 available potassium content of 135 73 mg kg 1 and a ph of 8 13 in the topsoil 0 0 2 m 2 2 experimental design according to literature data ma et al 2008 yan et al 2014 plastic fragments mainly exist in topsoil at the depth of 0 30 cm and the mass ratio of two sizes of fragments 0 5 and 5 25 cm2 is about 1 7 the amount of residual plastic film m kg ha 1 increases linearly with the number of years that plastic film is used t yr m 5 546 t 47 840 r2 0 871 yan et al 2014 therefore five treatments with residual film 0 kg ha 1 m0 90 kg ha 1 m90 180 kg ha 1 m180 360 kg ha 1 m360 and 720 kg ha 1 m720 were set to simulate the mulching time of 0 years 8 years 24 years 56 years and 121 years respectively biodegradable film with 0 008 mm thick produced by shaanxi ruifeng technology co ltd was cut into two sizes of 0 5 cm2 and 5 25 cm2 and mixed evenly according to the mass ratio of 1 7 each treatment had three replicated plots and each plot was 4 m 4 5 m and separated by 1 m wide pathway film fragments and fertilizer were ploughed into the topsoil of the pre divided plots by a rotary tiller the amount of fertilizer applied were 160 kg of n 120 kg of p2o5 and 60 kg of k2o per hectare summer maize zhengdan 958 was sown at the planting density of 66 667 plants ha 1 with 0 5 m in row spacing and about 0 3 m in plant spacing on june 23 2017 and june 20 2018 and harvested on october 8 2017 and october 4 2018 due to drought at the early growth stage in 2017 50 mm and 66 mm of water were irrigated to each plot at the seedling stage june 29 and jointing july 20 stage through the water hydrant near the test field to ensure the normal growth during the two growing seasons weed control and pesticides were applied to keep a relatively healthy growing environment 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 above ground dry matter and root length density three representative plants for each treatment were selected at different stages seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturity to measure above ground dry matter and root length the above ground parts were separated into stems leaves and ears cut into small pieces dried in an oven for 30 min at 105 to deactivate enzymes then dried at 75 to a constant weight and weighed root was also sampled after the above ground parts were sampled taking the plant position as the center the root sampling range was 30 cm along rows and 60 cm perpendicular to rows the soil was excavated with a 9 cm inner diameter drill layer by layer at 10 cm intervals the sampling depth was 50 cm at the seedling stage and 100 cm at the other stages roots were manually picked out cleaned with piped water and scanned with a flatbed scanner v900 epson nagano japan into pictures pictures of the roots were analyzed by a winrhizo root analysis system regent instruments quebec canada to determine root length density rld 10 4 cm cm 3 in different soil layers after picking out roots the remaining soil was filled back to the original soil layer with the original bulk density 2 3 2 soil moisture grain yield and water use efficiency soil moisture contents within 200 cm were determined before sowing and after harvest to calculate the changes of soil water storage during the whole growing seasons soil samples were taken with a 6 cm inner diameter drill between two adjacent plants within a row at 10 cm intervals and each treatment had three replicates soil samples were dried at 105 in an oven to a constant weight to calculate the gravimetric water content soil water storage sws mm was calculated as 1 sws ω i γ h 10 where h is soil layer thickness cm γ is soil dry bulk density g cm 3 and ω i is gravimetric water content at different soil layer since the groundwater level was below 5 m the groundwater recharge was considered to be negligible runoff was assumed to be negligible because the ground slope was small and each plot was bordered deep percolation was assumed to be negligible due to no heavy rains appearing for the 200 cm deep soil layer during the growing seasons evapotranspiration et was calculated with the following equation 2 et p i w 0 w 1 where et is evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is the amount of irrigation mm w0 and w1 are the soil water storage mm of 0 200 cm before sowing and after harvesting respectively at the natural maturity stage maize of three randomly chosen rows in middle of each plot were harvested manually to determine grain yield at water content of 14 wue was defined as 3 wue y et where wue is the water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y kg ha 1 is the yield of summer maize 2 3 3 air temperature and precipitation meteorological data i e daily maximum air temperature tmax daily minimum air temperature tmin daily mean air temperature tave and rainfall were recorded fig 1 at a nearby weather station 2 4 estimating of root growth and vertical distribution 2 4 1 estimating of the sum of rld at different growth stages the first derivative of a sine function eq 5 was used to simulate the dynamic change of the sum of rld in different growth stages since air temperature and its range of change affect significantly crop growth

and are 34 0 10 0 and 24 0 hou et al 2014 respectively t max t min and t ave are the maximum minimum and average air temperature a x c and w are model parameters 2 4 2 estimating of vertical root distribution a logistic curve fan et al 2016 schenk and jackson 2002 was used to describe the vertical distribution of the cumulative rld based on the following equation 8 p r d r s 1 1 d d 50 c where r d is the cumulative rld to d cm soil depth r s is the sum of rld of soil profile d 50 is the depth at which 50 of the total rld was accumulated c is a dimensionless shape parameter 2 5 statistical analysis the coefficient of determination r 2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse fang et al 2020 between the simulated and observed values were the evaluation indicators the model simulation

test at p 0 05 was used to determine the significance of differences between treatments figures were created by origin 8 0 and auto cad 2007 3 results 3 1 the changes of the sum of rld the residual film had significant negative effect on the total root length of summer maize table 1 with the increase of residual film amount the total rld decreased compared with m0 the total rld of m90 was reduced by 6 4 4 2 3 0 3 3 and 5 0 at seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturation stages across two years but the difference was not significant when the residual film amount reached and exceeded 180 kg ha 1 the total rld was significantly reduced m180 reduced total rld by an average of 20 5 15 0 9 9 10 8 and 12 4 at the five growth stages mentioned above in two years similarly m360 reduced total rld by 36 7 24 0 18 4 19 1 and 20 5 and m720 decreased by 53 7 31 8 24 3 25 5 and 31 1 in two years linear regression was made between total rld and residual film amount at different growth stages and the results showed that there was a good negative linear relationship p 0 05 between root length and residual film amount table 2 the absolute value of slope could be used to indicate the sensitivity of root length to residual film at different growth stages the absolute value of slope increased first and then decreased with the growth process and reached the maximum value at filling stage indicating that the sensitivity of root length to residual film was greater at late growth stage than at early growth stage and was the greatest at the filling stage the r2 value was above 0 99 and the nrmse was below 10 for each treatment which showed that the sine function well fitted the changes of total rld during the whole growing season in 2017 and 2018 table 3 with an increase in the amount of residual film the parameters a and w decreased while x c increased table 3 according to the meanings of the three parameters it indicated that the potential maximum root length a and the root growth time w decreased while the time x c when roots began to grow was delayed as the amount of residual film increased compared with m0 a of m90 decreased by 3 0 with no significant difference the parameter a was significantly decreased when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 which was consistent with the observed differences in table 1 compared with m0 a in m180 m360 and m720 decreased by 9 4 17 1 and 21 8 the residual film less than 360 kg ha 1 reduced w insignificantly the parameter w was reduced by an average of 1 3 and 2 8 in m90 and m180 than m0 in two years m360 and m720 significantly reduced w by 3 8 and 6 6 respectively residual film significantly increased x c in 2017 but had no significant effect on it in 2018 which may have something to do with climate 3 2 root vertical distribution the logistic curve well fitted the ratio of cumulative rld to the total rld with soil depth under different amounts of residual plastic film at the different growth stages in 2017 and 2018 fig 2 anova showed that years growth stages and the amount of residual film had significant effect on root vertical distribution table 4 the shape parameter c decreased with the increase of residual film and the differences of parameter c among treatments became larger at the later growth stages fig 3 based on the meaning of parameter c in the logistic function the decrease of c indicated that the cumulative proportion of rld increased more rapidly in the soil layer near d 50 while it increased less in the deeper soils with soil depth increasing in other words as the amount of residual film increased more roots gathered in the soil layer near d 50 and fewer roots existed in deeper soil layer the soil depth with 50 cumulative root length d 50 and the deeper soil depth with 95 cumulative root length d 95 both increased first and then decreased with growth process and reached the peak value at the filling stage both of d 50 and d 95 decreased as residual film increased at each growing stage and were significantly reduced when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 indicating residual film confined most of roots in the shallower soil layer fig 3 the proportion of rld in 0 30 cm to the total rld in the whole soil profile p 30 decreased first and then increased and achieved the maximum value at the seedling stage and the minimum value at the filling stage fig 3 the values of p 30 increased with the increasing of residual film and were significantly larger in the treatments with residual film than that in m0 which showed that residual film forced more roots in the topsoil 3 3 above ground dry biomass and grain yield the dry matter of stems leaves ears and above ground parts at each growth stage decreased with the increase of residual film fig 4 there was no significant difference between m90 and m0 however when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg hm 2 the dry matter was significantly reduced during most of growth stages compared with m0 from seedling to maturity in two years m90 decreased the dry matter of stems by 6 0 1 6 4 8 6 2 and 4 5 and decreased leaves by 1 3 1 7 2 8 5 2 and 1 1 and decreased ears by 4 0 0 1 and 1 8 similarly m180 from seedling to maturity averagely decreased stems by 35 7 16 3 22 4 21 9 and 10 8 and decreased leaves by 28 3 13 3 16 7 16 0 and 10 3 and decreased ears by 19 9 17 0 and 15 9 across two years evapotranspiration et grain yield and water use efficiency wue all decreased linearly p 0 05 with the amount of residual film increasing except for wue in 2017 fig 5 the three indexes in m90 were reduced than m0 but there was no significant difference compared with m0 et grain yield and wue of m90 decreased by 1 7 3 0 and 1 1 when the amount of residual film exceeded 180 kg hm 2 these three indexes were significantly lower than m0 treatment except et and wue in 2017 compared with m0 et in m180 m360 and m720 were decreased by 2 5 6 2 and 8 5 on average in two years similarly grain yield in m180 m360 and m720 were reduced by 17 1 27 1 and 34 7 on average in two years wue in m180 m360 and m720 were reduced by 16 1 23 4 and 30 8 on average in two years 4 discussion this study established a sine function to simulate the dynamic changes of total root length in the whole growing seasons and analyzed root vertical distribution with a logistic function under different amounts of residual film these findings could help us understand systematically the influence of residual film on root growth and vertical distribution enabling the formulation of appropriate strategies to deal with the residual film problems 4 1 effects of residual film on root growth in whole growing seasons some crop growth models such as the richard and logistic models have been used to simulate plant height grain filling and above ground dry matter du et al 2018 fang et al 2020 but it is difficult for them to describe roots and leaves with negative growth processes sun et al 2019 xing et al 1998 especially with residual film this study innovatively used a sine function to describe the changes of root length and quantify the effect of residual film on roots in the whole growth period considering the increase of x c and the decrease of a and w we could get the conclusion that residual film delayed crops rooting reduced the maximum root length and shortens the root growth period the increase of x c could be explained by mulch fragments wrapping around nearby seeds blocking moisture and air and causing delayed germination or even death jie et al 2007 as roots grew more soil space was needed to accommodate them but the physical barrier formed by residual film prevented roots from expanding reducing the maximum biomass a that the roots could reach qi et al 2018 steinmetz et al 2016 due to the restricted root development the water and nutrients needed for crop growth were insufficient resulting in premature aging and a shortened root growth time w in addition the linear negative correlation between root length and residual film in table 2 also indicated that residual film inhibited root length the absolute value of the slope reflected the sensitivity of root length to residual film a slope with a larger absolute value represented that the root length decreased more with the same increase in the amount of residual film the results in table 2 showed that the root length was more sensitive to residual film at the late stage than the early stage and was most sensitive to residual film at the filling stage this may be because maize at seedling stage had the smallest root biomass and the limiting effect of residual film was therefore relatively weaker as the growth period advanced the contradiction between the need of more space for root growth and the restriction of residual film became more serious however the opposite conclusions that the effects of residual film on roots were larger in the early stage than in the later stage were drawn xin et al 2014 zou et al 2016 the reason may be that the small volume of the containers used in the experiment became the major limiting factor for root growth in the late growth stage covering the role of residual film 4 2 effects of residual film on vertical distribution of roots the soil structure between different soil layers usually has great difference for its spatial difference and residual film further aggravates the complexity of soil structure qi et al 2020 wan et al 2019 due to the randomness of its distribution and shape in soil yan et al 2014 therefore evaluating the effect of residual film on root growth in a soil layer may lead to inconsistency and confusion for example dong et al 2013 found that the effect of residual film on roots was not always negative as the soil depth increased li et al 2017 pointed out that residual film 90 kg ha 1 increased maize root length while du et al 2018 reached the opposite conclusion in this study we used the logistic function to describe the vertical distribution of roots in the entire soil profile to avoid the deficiencies mentioned above the shape parameter c decreasing with the increase of residual film fig 3 suggested that more of roots were concentrated in the soil layer near d 50 with fewer roots in the deeper soil in the presence of residual film fig 2 the reduction of d 50 and d 95 and the increase of p 30 with the increase in the amount of residual film in fig 3 also showed that the presence of residual film resulted in most of the roots gathering in the shallower soil as for the reasons on the one hand the residual film directly impeded root growth downward and on the other hand residual film indirectly reduced deep roots by restricting water and nutrients remaining near the residual film zone this change may reduce the access to water and nutrients in the deep soil li et al 2020 increase the risk of drought and high temperature impacts on the root system and weaken the ability of the crop to resist bad weather yang et al 2016 4 3 effects of residual film on above ground dry matter grain yield and wue residual film inhibiting dry matter accumulation and reducing yield has been widely studied du et al 2018 gao et al 2019 qi et al 2020 xin et al 2014 and the similar conclusions have been obtained in this study residual film inhibited root growth reduced the available water and nutrient decreased the dry matter accumulation of stems and leaves and decreased the organic matter that would be transported to grains during the filling stage resulting in a reduction in et yield and wue moreover we found that residual film significantly decreased the above ground matter and grain yield when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 which is essential to the local maize production qi et al 2020 found that 300 kg hm 2 residual film significantly decreased the yield of maize in inner mongolia province and gao et al 2019 drew a conclusion that crops yield decreased significantly with residual film 240 kg hm 2 this difference may be related to crop varieties climate soil texture and the size of residual film 5 conclusions root length decreased with residual film increasing at all growth stages and root length was more sensitive to residual film at late growth stage and the most sensitive at filling stages root length was reduced significantly as the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 the sine function fitted well the dynamic changes of total root length as growth progressed under different amounts of residual film with the increase in the amount of residual film the maximum total root length decreased the time when roots began to grow was delayed and the root growth time was shortened the logistic function described the vertical distribution of roots well residual film decreased the root length in deep soil and gathered roots in the soil layer near the depth of d 50 the presence of residual film decreased d 50 and d 95 and increased p 30 keeping roots in shallower soil this adverse effect increased with residual film amount increasing the above ground dry matter grain yield and water use efficiency decreased significantly with residual film beyond 180 kg ha 1 credit authorship contribution statement pengpeng chen formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization

9780,with the extensive use of plastic film a large number of residual film accumulated in the farmland bringing a huge negative impact on agricultural production studying the effect of residual film on roots is helpful to understand the damage mechanism of residual film on crop growth thus a two year field experiment was conducted with 0 m0 90 m90 180 m180 360 m360 and 720 m720 kg ha 1 residual film and sine and logistic functions were used to simulate root growth and vertical distribution of maize results showed that root length decreased with residual film increasing and was more sensitive to residual film at tasseling filling and maturity stages than at seedling and jointing stages the results of the sine function fitting the total root length showed that the potential maximum root length was decreased and the rooting time was delayed and the root growth time was shortened with the amount of residual film increasing m90 had no significant effect on root length but residual film equal to or greater than 180 kg ha 1 had significant negative effects on root length m180 m360 and m720 significantly reduced the actual total root length by 13 7 23 8 and 33 3 and reduced the potential root length by 9 4 17 1 and 21 8 m360 and m720 significantly shortened the growth time by 3 8 and 6 6 the logistic function fit the vertical root distribution well residual film decreased the root length in deep soil and gathered roots in the soil layer near the depth of d 50 at which 50 of the root length was accumulated residual film decreased the soil depth where 50 and 95 root length were accumulated and increased the proportion of root length in 0 30 cm soil layer this adverse effect increased with residual film amount increasing the dry matter of stems leaves and ears decreased with residual film increasing m90 reduced the above ground dry matter insignificantly and the other treatments with residual film had significant effects at the maturity stage the above ground dry matter in m90 m180 m360 and m720 was reduced by 2 4 14 2 22 2 and 29 4 compared with m0 residual film decreased evapotranspiration et grain yield and water use efficiency wue significantly except m90 et yield and wue were reduced by 1 7 3 0 and 1 1 in m90 and 2 5 17 1 and 16 1 in m180 and 6 2 27 1 and 23 4 in m360 and 8 5 34 7 and 30 8 in m720 respectively in summary the residual film beyond 180 kg ha 1 had a significant negative effect on summer maize this information will be useful to better understand and respond to residual film pollution and ensure safe agricultural production

but these results are limited to qualitative analysis in certain soil layers 0 30 cm depth gao et al 2011 li et al 2017 and certain growth stages xin et al 2014 zou et al 2016 the quantitative analysis of residual film on root growth during the whole growing season and in the whole soil profile is unknown as the growth process advances the sensitivity of crops to residual film is different analyzing the sensitivity of crops to residual film at different growth stages helps us to take appropriate measures to reduce the negative impact of residual film on crops moreover roots at different soil depths together form a complete system the growth of roots in the upper soil has a significant effect on the deep roots and vice versa thus it is insufficient to study only the influence of residual film on root system in topsoil and at certain growth stages moreover these studies mostly focused on tomato gao et al 2011 zou et al 2017 and cotton zumilaiti et al 2017 with less research on maize therefore we carried out a two year maize field experiment with different amounts of residual film to 1 determine the growth status of root and root sensitivity to residual film at different growth stages 2 analyze the influence of residual film on the vertical distribution of roots in the entire soil profile 3 and determine the amount of residual film that has a significant negative impact on the dry matter and yield of summer maize so as to provide a theoretical basis for residual film control in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and materials a two year field experiment was conducted between june 2017 and october 2018 in the irrigation station 34 18 n 108 24 e of northwest a f university yangling which is located in northwest china this region

has a average dry bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 in 100 cm depth and has organic matter content of 13 36 g kg 1 total nitrogen n content of 0 96 g kg 1 nitrate n content of 73 01 mg kg 1 available phosphorus content of 24 07 mg kg 1 available potassium content of 135 73 mg kg 1 and a ph of 8 13 in the topsoil 0 0 2 m 2 2 experimental design according to literature data ma et al 2008 yan et al 2014 plastic fragments mainly exist in topsoil at the depth of 0 30 cm and the mass ratio of two sizes of fragments 0 5 and 5 25 cm2 is about 1 7 the amount of residual plastic film m kg ha 1 increases linearly with the number of years that plastic film is used t yr m 5 546 t 47 840 r2 0 871 yan et al 2014 therefore five treatments with residual film 0 kg ha 1 m0 90 kg ha 1 m90 180 kg ha 1 m180 360 kg ha 1 m360 and 720 kg ha 1 m720 were set to simulate the mulching time of 0 years 8 years 24 years 56 years and 121 years respectively biodegradable film with 0 008 mm thick produced by shaanxi ruifeng technology co ltd was cut into two sizes of 0 5 cm2 and 5 25 cm2 and mixed evenly according to the mass ratio of 1 7 each treatment had three replicated plots and each plot was 4 m 4 5 m and separated by 1 m wide pathway film fragments and fertilizer were ploughed into the topsoil of the pre divided plots by a rotary tiller the amount of fertilizer applied were 160 kg of n 120 kg of p2o5 and 60 kg of k2o per hectare summer maize zhengdan 958 was sown at the planting density of 66 667 plants ha 1 with 0 5 m in row spacing and about 0 3 m in plant spacing on june 23 2017 and june 20 2018 and harvested on october 8 2017 and october 4 2018 due to drought at the early growth stage in 2017 50 mm and 66 mm of water were irrigated to each plot at the seedling stage june 29 and jointing july 20 stage through the water hydrant near the test field to ensure the normal growth during the two growing seasons weed control and pesticides were applied to keep a relatively healthy growing environment 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 above ground dry matter and root length density three representative plants for each treatment were selected at different stages seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturity to measure above ground dry matter and root length the above ground parts were separated into stems leaves and ears cut into small pieces dried in an oven for 30 min at 105 to deactivate enzymes then dried at 75 to a constant weight and weighed root was also sampled after the above ground parts were sampled taking the plant position as the center the root sampling range was 30 cm along rows and 60 cm perpendicular to rows the soil was excavated with a 9 cm inner diameter drill layer by layer at 10 cm intervals the sampling depth was 50 cm at the seedling stage and 100 cm at the other stages roots were manually picked out cleaned with piped water and scanned with a flatbed scanner v900 epson nagano japan into pictures pictures of the roots were analyzed by a winrhizo root analysis system regent instruments quebec canada to determine root length density rld 10 4 cm cm 3 in different soil layers after picking out roots the remaining soil was filled back to the original soil layer with the original bulk density 2 3 2 soil moisture grain yield and water use efficiency soil moisture contents within 200 cm were determined before sowing and after harvest to calculate the changes of soil water storage during the whole growing seasons soil samples were taken with a 6 cm inner diameter drill between two adjacent plants within a row at 10 cm intervals and each treatment had three replicates soil samples were dried at 105 in an oven to a constant weight to calculate the gravimetric water content soil water storage sws mm was calculated as 1 sws ω i γ h 10 where h is soil layer thickness cm γ is soil dry bulk density g cm 3 and ω i is gravimetric water content at different soil layer since the groundwater level was below 5 m the groundwater recharge was considered to be negligible runoff was assumed to be negligible because the ground slope was small and each plot was bordered deep percolation was assumed to be negligible due to no heavy rains appearing for the 200 cm deep soil layer during the growing seasons evapotranspiration et was calculated with the following equation 2 et p i w 0 w 1 where et is evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is the amount of irrigation mm w0 and w1 are the soil water storage mm of 0 200 cm before sowing and after harvesting respectively at the natural maturity stage maize of three randomly chosen rows in middle of each plot were harvested manually to determine grain yield at water content of 14 wue was defined as 3 wue y et where wue is the water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y kg ha 1 is the yield of summer maize 2 3 3 air temperature and precipitation meteorological data i e daily maximum air temperature tmax daily minimum air temperature tmin daily mean air temperature tave and rainfall were recorded fig 1 at a nearby weather station 2 4 estimating of root growth and vertical distribution 2 4 1 estimating of the sum of rld at different growth stages the first derivative of a sine function eq 5 was used to simulate the dynamic change of the sum of rld in different growth stages since air temperature and its range of change affect significantly crop growth

distribution a logistic curve fan et al 2016 schenk and jackson 2002 was used to describe the vertical distribution of the cumulative rld based on the following equation 8 p r d r s 1 1 d d 50 c where r d is the cumulative rld to d cm soil depth r s is the sum of rld of soil profile d 50 is the depth at which 50 of the total rld was accumulated c is a dimensionless shape parameter 2 5 statistical analysis the coefficient of determination r 2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse fang et al 2020 between the simulated and observed values were the evaluation indicators the model simulation

test at p 0 05 was used to determine the significance of differences between treatments figures were created by origin 8 0 and auto cad 2007 3 results 3 1 the changes of the sum of rld the residual film had significant negative effect on the total root length of summer maize table 1 with the increase of residual film amount the total rld decreased compared with m0 the total rld of m90 was reduced by 6 4 4 2 3 0 3 3 and 5 0 at seedling jointing tasseling filling and maturation stages across two years but the difference was not significant when the residual film amount reached and exceeded 180 kg ha 1 the total rld was significantly reduced m180 reduced total rld by an average of 20 5 15 0 9 9 10 8 and 12 4 at the five growth stages mentioned above in two years similarly m360 reduced total rld by 36 7 24 0 18 4 19 1 and 20 5 and m720 decreased by 53 7 31 8 24 3 25 5 and 31 1 in two years linear regression was made between total rld and residual film amount at different growth stages and the results showed that there was a good negative linear relationship p 0 05 between root length and residual film amount table 2 the absolute value of slope could be used to indicate the sensitivity of root length to residual film at different growth stages the absolute value of slope increased first and then decreased with the growth process and reached the maximum value at filling stage indicating that the sensitivity of root length to residual film was greater at late growth stage than at early growth stage and was the greatest at the filling stage the r2 value was above 0 99 and the nrmse was below 10 for each treatment which showed that the sine function well fitted the changes of total rld during the whole growing season in 2017 and 2018 table 3 with an increase in the amount of residual film the parameters a and w decreased while x c increased table 3 according to the meanings of the three parameters it indicated that the potential maximum root length a and the root growth time w decreased while the time x c when roots began to grow was delayed as the amount of residual film increased compared with m0 a of m90 decreased by 3 0 with no significant difference the parameter a was significantly decreased when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 which was consistent with the observed differences in table 1 compared with m0 a in m180 m360 and m720 decreased by 9 4 17 1 and 21 8 the residual film less than 360 kg ha 1 reduced w insignificantly the parameter w was reduced by an average of 1 3 and 2 8 in m90 and m180 than m0 in two years m360 and m720 significantly reduced w by 3 8 and 6 6 respectively residual film significantly increased x c in 2017 but had no significant effect on it in 2018 which may have something to do with climate 3 2 root vertical distribution the logistic curve well fitted the ratio of cumulative rld to the total rld with soil depth under different amounts of residual plastic film at the different growth stages in 2017 and 2018 fig 2 anova showed that years growth stages and the amount of residual film had significant effect on root vertical distribution table 4 the shape parameter c decreased with the increase of residual film and the differences of parameter c among treatments became larger at the later growth stages fig 3 based on the meaning of parameter c in the logistic function the decrease of c indicated that the cumulative proportion of rld increased more rapidly in the soil layer near d 50 while it increased less in the deeper soils with soil depth increasing in other words as the amount of residual film increased more roots gathered in the soil layer near d 50 and fewer roots existed in deeper soil layer the soil depth with 50 cumulative root length d 50 and the deeper soil depth with 95 cumulative root length d 95 both increased first and then decreased with growth process and reached the peak value at the filling stage both of d 50 and d 95 decreased as residual film increased at each growing stage and were significantly reduced when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 indicating residual film confined most of roots in the shallower soil layer fig 3 the proportion of rld in 0 30 cm to the total rld in the whole soil profile p 30 decreased first and then increased and achieved the maximum value at the seedling stage and the minimum value at the filling stage fig 3 the values of p 30 increased with the increasing of residual film and were significantly larger in the treatments with residual film than that in m0 which showed that residual film forced more roots in the topsoil 3 3 above ground dry biomass and grain yield the dry matter of stems leaves ears and above ground parts at each growth stage decreased with the increase of residual film fig 4 there was no significant difference between m90 and m0 however when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg hm 2 the dry matter was significantly reduced during most of growth stages compared with m0 from seedling to maturity in two years m90 decreased the dry matter of stems by 6 0 1 6 4 8 6 2 and 4 5 and decreased leaves by 1 3 1 7 2 8 5 2 and 1 1 and decreased ears by 4 0 0 1 and 1 8 similarly m180 from seedling to maturity averagely decreased stems by 35 7 16 3 22 4 21 9 and 10 8 and decreased leaves by 28 3 13 3 16 7 16 0 and 10 3 and decreased ears by 19 9 17 0 and 15 9 across two years evapotranspiration et grain yield and water use efficiency wue all decreased linearly p 0 05 with the amount of residual film increasing except for wue in 2017 fig 5 the three indexes in m90 were reduced than m0 but there was no significant difference compared with m0 et grain yield and wue of m90 decreased by 1 7 3 0 and 1 1 when the amount of residual film exceeded 180 kg hm 2 these three indexes were significantly lower than m0 treatment except et and wue in 2017 compared with m0 et in m180 m360 and m720 were decreased by 2 5 6 2 and 8 5 on average in two years similarly grain yield in m180 m360 and m720 were reduced by 17 1 27 1 and 34 7 on average in two years wue in m180 m360 and m720 were reduced by 16 1 23 4 and 30 8 on average in two years 4 discussion this study established a sine function to simulate the dynamic changes of total root length in the whole growing seasons and analyzed root vertical distribution with a logistic function under different amounts of residual film these findings could help us understand systematically the influence of residual film on root growth and vertical distribution enabling the formulation of appropriate strategies to deal with the residual film problems 4 1 effects of residual film on root growth in whole growing seasons some crop growth models such as the richard and logistic models have been used to simulate plant height grain filling and above ground dry matter du et al 2018 fang et al 2020 but it is difficult for them to describe roots and leaves with negative growth processes sun et al 2019 xing et al 1998 especially with residual film this study innovatively used a sine function to describe the changes of root length and quantify the effect of residual film on roots in the whole growth period considering the increase of x c and the decrease of a and w we could get the conclusion that residual film delayed crops rooting reduced the maximum root length and shortens the root growth period the increase of x c could be explained by mulch fragments wrapping around nearby seeds blocking moisture and air and causing delayed germination or even death jie et al 2007 as roots grew more soil space was needed to accommodate them but the physical barrier formed by residual film prevented roots from expanding reducing the maximum biomass a that the roots could reach qi et al 2018 steinmetz et al 2016 due to the restricted root development the water and nutrients needed for crop growth were insufficient resulting in premature aging and a shortened root growth time w in addition the linear negative correlation between root length and residual film in table 2 also indicated that residual film inhibited root length the absolute value of the slope reflected the sensitivity of root length to residual film a slope with a larger absolute value represented that the root length decreased more with the same increase in the amount of residual film the results in table 2 showed that the root length was more sensitive to residual film at the late stage than the early stage and was most sensitive to residual film at the filling stage this may be because maize at seedling stage had the smallest root biomass and the limiting effect of residual film was therefore relatively weaker as the growth period advanced the contradiction between the need of more space for root growth and the restriction of residual film became more serious however the opposite conclusions that the effects of residual film on roots were larger in the early stage than in the later stage were drawn xin et al 2014 zou et al 2016 the reason may be that the small volume of the containers used in the experiment became the major limiting factor for root growth in the late growth stage covering the role of residual film 4 2 effects of residual film on vertical distribution of roots the soil structure between different soil layers usually has great difference for its spatial difference and residual film further aggravates the complexity of soil structure qi et al 2020 wan et al 2019 due to the randomness of its distribution and shape in soil yan et al 2014 therefore evaluating the effect of residual film on root growth in a soil layer may lead to inconsistency and confusion for example dong et al 2013 found that the effect of residual film on roots was not always negative as the soil depth increased li et al 2017 pointed out that residual film 90 kg ha 1 increased maize root length while du et al 2018 reached the opposite conclusion in this study we used the logistic function to describe the vertical distribution of roots in the entire soil profile to avoid the deficiencies mentioned above the shape parameter c decreasing with the increase of residual film fig 3 suggested that more of roots were concentrated in the soil layer near d 50 with fewer roots in the deeper soil in the presence of residual film fig 2 the reduction of d 50 and d 95 and the increase of p 30 with the increase in the amount of residual film in fig 3 also showed that the presence of residual film resulted in most of the roots gathering in the shallower soil as for the reasons on the one hand the residual film directly impeded root growth downward and on the other hand residual film indirectly reduced deep roots by restricting water and nutrients remaining near the residual film zone this change may reduce the access to water and nutrients in the deep soil li et al 2020 increase the risk of drought and high temperature impacts on the root system and weaken the ability of the crop to resist bad weather yang et al 2016 4 3 effects of residual film on above ground dry matter grain yield and wue residual film inhibiting dry matter accumulation and reducing yield has been widely studied du et al 2018 gao et al 2019 qi et al 2020 xin et al 2014 and the similar conclusions have been obtained in this study residual film inhibited root growth reduced the available water and nutrient decreased the dry matter accumulation of stems and leaves and decreased the organic matter that would be transported to grains during the filling stage resulting in a reduction in et yield and wue moreover we found that residual film significantly decreased the above ground matter and grain yield when the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 which is essential to the local maize production qi et al 2020 found that 300 kg hm 2 residual film significantly decreased the yield of maize in inner mongolia province and gao et al 2019 drew a conclusion that crops yield decreased significantly with residual film 240 kg hm 2 this difference may be related to crop varieties climate soil texture and the size of residual film 5 conclusions root length decreased with residual film increasing at all growth stages and root length was more sensitive to residual film at late growth stage and the most sensitive at filling stages root length was reduced significantly as the amount of residual film reached 180 kg ha 1 the sine function fitted well the dynamic changes of total root length as growth progressed under different amounts of residual film with the increase in the amount of residual film the maximum total root length decreased the time when roots began to grow was delayed and the root growth time was shortened the logistic function described the vertical distribution of roots well residual film decreased the root length in deep soil and gathered roots in the soil layer near the depth of d 50 the presence of residual film decreased d 50 and d 95 and increased p 30 keeping roots in shallower soil this adverse effect increased with residual film amount increasing the above ground dry matter grain yield and water use efficiency decreased significantly with residual film beyond 180 kg ha 1 credit authorship contribution statement pengpeng chen formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization

9781,climate change impacts crop productivity as atmospheric conditions and water supply change particularly in intensive cropping areas this study used the validated aquacrop model which was run with downscaled daily climate data produced by sdsm and canesm2 the changes in the potential grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize and water budget during the cropping seasons were estimated for the huang huai hai plain 3h plain under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the results show that the potential yield of winter wheat is increasing with similar spatial patterns in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s with much of the increase is distributed in shandong and northeastern parts of henan during the winter wheat growth period the water budget deficit will likely improve from 210 mm in the 2030s to 202 mm in 2080s under rcp4 5 and from 206 mm in the 2030s to 191 mm in 2080s under rcp8 5 across the 3h plain the water budget during the winter wheat period will continue to be in deficit in the north 3h plain and improvements are estimated mostly in the lower southern areas of the plain the summer maize potential yield is estimated to increase from the baseline period but yields will decrease by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 during the summer maize growth period the water budget is also estimated to improve from 109 mm in 2030s to 126 mm in 2080s under rcp4 5 and 107 mm in the 2030s to 163 mm in 2080s under rcp8 5 this increase is mainly estimated in the central and south of the 3h plain the estimated etc of winter wheat shows no significant decrease while the reduction of 6 mm and 13 mm for summer maize is observed under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the study provides scientific evidence to devise adaptation and mitigation

issued by the international panel on climate change ipcc in 2018 also indicated that anthropogenic warming is adding around 0 2 to global average temperatures every decade with this rate continued an

temperatures on agricultural productivity as a likely consequence of increased co2 concentration gleick 1986 elevated temperatures can negatively affect crop production due to decreased photosynthetic

producer 260 77 million tons fao 2020 plays an important role in shaping the international markets and global food security greaves and wang 2016 within china the huang huai hai plain 3h plain plays an important role in producing high quality wheat and maize which ensures the country s food security liu et al 2010a 2010b jeong et al 2014 the large scale crop production in the 3h plain is due to the winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system brown 2003 rainfall is abundant in summer to support maize production but is scarce in winter for wheat wang et al 2018 the water deficit for winter wheat is compensated by irrigation practices using groundwater which have been reported to increase crop productivity by 56 compared to rain fed conditions liu et al 2007 the increasing and widespread use of groundwater irrigation in this region has excessively depleted groundwater resources over the past 30 years at a faster rate of 1 m year particularly in the last 20 years wang et al 2018 resulting in water scarcity for winter wheat therefore it is necessary to estimate the impact of climate warming on the potential yield lv et al 2015 as the resulting increase in temperature is likely to shorten the length of the growing season for wheat hu et al 2015 and affect grain filling duration for maize zhang et al 2019 in the 3h plain the resulting decline in crop yields in china is likely to lead to several negative impacts on prices trade and food import dependent countries kent et al 2017 raising serious food security concerns and posing challenges to farmers and resource managers in the agricultural sector the changes and impacts of climate change on crop production can be studied using crop growth models crop growth models have widely been used to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop yields by simulating the physiological processes of plants and their response to management measures and climate stresses zhao et al 2017 the relationship between climate variability and crop yield has been confirmed in many studies using statistical approaches charles et al 2017 tang et al 2018 tang et al 2018 used the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model in the 3h plain and estimated that the potential yield crop water requirement etc and effective precipitation during winter wheat growing seasons might increase in the future under rcp4 5 while irrigation water requirements iwr would decrease wu et al 2006 simulated the effects of climate change on wheat grain yield and water demand using the world food studies wofost model the results quantified the average simulated potential yields that would go up to 9 7 mg ha 1 and 7 5 mg ha 1 in the northern and southern part of the north china plain ncp respectively rainfall is the limiting factor in the northern part of the ncp therefore average simulated potential yields can only reach 3 mg ha 1 in this region wu et al 2006 to date most of the literature has examined the climate change impacts at the global and regional levels ignoring the impacts at the local level and the potential for adaptation in which farmers are engaged zinyengere et al 2013 the county level studies in the 3h plain show that the response of maize yields to climate change varies in spatial pattern with distinct variation in magnitude when impacts were studied in different counties within the same region wang et al 2014 therefore there is a growing need to quantify the impacts of climate change on the potential crop yield changing irrigation water demand and water budgets during crop growing seasons at a finer scale to devise and implement specific adaptation xiao et al 2018 and mitigation strategies in agricultural planning and decision making wigley et al 1990 jones et al 2015 relevant to these locations this study aims to explore the changes in potential yield and water budget in wheat maize rotation areas under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 across the 3h plain the results will provide a theoretical basis to devise adaptation strategies for agricultural productivity water resource allocation and scientific response to climate change impacts on wheat and maize in the huang

rainfall mm daily shortwave radiation w m 2 and wind speed m s1 at 10 m for the period 1979 2018 were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd developed by national tibetan plateau data center tpdc beijing china he et al 2020 cmfd has a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 1 and 3 h respectively and is regularly updated and evaluated by the tpdc the data from the cmfd was extracted using locations from the china meteorological administration cma list of ground weather monitoring stations which is available on the cma website http data cma cn the cmfd has shown a high correlation with the data available from ground observation stations of cma and can therefore be used for a wide range of applications at a finer resolution the meteorological data collected from cmfd for temperature pressure and specific humidity was at a standard height of 2 m as required for crop simulation but the data for wind speed was at a height of 10 m which was adjusted using eq 1 allen

aquacrop model in this study the aquacrop model v6 0 was used to simulate winter wheat and summer maize yield based on the crop management practices representative for each region within the 3h plain for the historical period the growth of winter wheat and summer maize was simulated based on the soil data field management and crop phenology data obtained from published literature including xiaotangshan county in beijing jin et al 2014 luancheng county in hebei umair et al 2017 xinxiang county in henan tang et al 2018 taian county in shandong bian et al 2016 and guangde county in anhui chen et al 2016 the literature also provided sufficient information regarding sowing and harvesting dates irrigation timing amounts and other management measures needed for calibration and validation

values suggested in the literature for wheat jin et al 2014 and maize hsiao et al 2009 the values of conservative parameters are expected to change little despite changes in time and location the crop non conservative parameters which included initial canopy cover cco canopy growth coefficient cgc coefficients for triggering water stress affecting leaf expansion and canopy senescence were adjusted for each location and cultivar until a close match between observed and simulated yield was achieved for the crop simulations inputs were provided as follows climate latitude climate file consisting

winter wheat and summer maize yield using the prevalent management and irrigation practices published in the literature for the study area 2 statistical downscaling of girded climate data provided by canesm2 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to generate future daily climate series using sdsm4 2 3 simulation of winter wheat and summer maize crop yield using downscaled climate daily climate data for 83 selected locations in the 3h plain and 4 analysis of changes in yield water budget and irrigation water requirements in three timelines of 2030s 2016 2040 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2099 under two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 3 1 statistical downscaling for statistical downscaling the observed climate dataset 1979 2018 was split into calibration 1979 1998 and validation period 1999 2018 to enable independent model evaluation first relevant global circulation model gcm predictors were selected for each of the climate predictands precipitation maximum and minimum temperature using correlation matrix partial correlation scatter plot analysis and p value statistics at or above the 95 significance threshold during the calibration period a total of 20 ensembles were created for each climate variable precipitation maximum and minimum temperature at all 83 study sites fig 1 the mean of these 20 ensembles was calculated to obtain daily modeled climate data for the validation period the performance analysis of the observed and modeled data was carried out by analyzing the datasets at monthly scales for the validation period the performance of the sdsm simulated data compared to the observed data was evaluated for maximum and minimum temperature monthly mean monthly maximum and 95th percentile of data and precipitation monthly mean monthly sum and 95th percentile of data bias correction was then applied to correct the model bias in sdsm stochastic techniques are included to improve model performance in reproducing the observed data by artificially inflating the model output variance wilby et al 2002 after the validation of results the calibrated model was used to generate daily future climate data using the canesm2 gcm predictors for three time periods of 2030s 2016 2040 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2099 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 3 2 aquacrop model calibration and validation the aquacrop model was used to simulate crop yield using downscaled data for both the historical period and for future scenarios the model was calibrated using historical wheat and maize experimental data discussed in section 2 2 3 the performance was evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed grain yield data fig 2 under full irrigation for both winter wheat and summer maize during the 2011 2016 periods most of the available literature in the region largely reported on winter wheat cultivars even though most of the 3h plain follow double or triple cropping since the data obtained from the literature had different climatic data sources thermal time and total water supply in the observed and simulated environments were also compared to identify the differences in the simulation of yield 2 3 3 estimating crop coefficient kc and crop evapotranspiration etc the crop coefficient kc was calculated following the procedures established by the food and agriculture organization fao to calculate the kc values for agricultural vegetation eq 11 allen et al 1998 the minimum kcmin and maximum kcmax kc values used in this study were 0 4 and 1 15 for winter wheat tang et al 2018 and 0 4 and 1 2 for summer maize abedinpour 2015 respectively which are representative of the 3h region the value s for leaf area index lai were estimated from canopy cover cc obtained from the aquacrop model using eqs 12 and 13 developed by hsiao et al 2009 which were rewritten as eqs 14 and 15 for winter wheat ww and summer maize sm respectively nielsen et al 2012 crop evapotranspiration etc eq 16 refers to the amount of water that is lost through evapotranspiration a product of crop coefficient kc and the reference evapotranspiration eto calculated through the penman monteith method water budget mm in this study represents the difference between the effective precipitation pe and crop water requirement etc eq 17 which refers to the amount of water that needs to be supplied and the irrigation water requirement iwr can be written as the difference of crop water requirement and effective precipitation both terms are identical 11 kc kcmin kcmax kcmin 1 exp 0 7lai 12 cc 94 00 1 exp 0 43 lai 0 52 f o r w w 13 cc 76 78 1 exp 0 8105 lai 0

aquacrop model crop yields were simulated for both winter wheat and summer maize using agronomic practices mentioned in table 1 which are widely used practices across the 3h plain furthermore full irrigation practice was followed with no water stress during both calibration and validation steps at all locations where simulations for winter wheat were carried out the percent deviation of grain yield model estimates from the observed data was between 0 42 and 11 0 for both the calibration and validation period with variations in results at different locations our results suggested that variation in climatic conditions irrigation supplied and planting schedule can induce some differences in model simulations earlier planting schedule promoted canopy growth grain yield and biomass and lesser variation in the model simulations when cultivars planted at later dates induced slightly larger variations but within an acceptable range similarly for summer maize the percent deviation of grain yield model estimates from the observed data varied between 1 44 and 8 90 for both calibration and validation stages the rmse between observed and simulated grain yield was 0 12 t ha 1 for jingdong8 jd8 in beijing 0 15 t ha 1 for kenong199 kn199 in hebei 0 21 t ha 1 for jimai22 jm22 in shandong and 1 01 t ha 1 for bainong207 bn207 in henan for winter wheat while it was 0 53 t ha 1 for zhengdan958 zd958 in hebei for summer maize overall the calibration results show a reasonably close match between the observed and those simulated by the model for both winter wheat and summer maize as shown in fig 2 the estimated relationship between lai and kc calculated using eqs 11 and 12 are shown in fig 3a and an increase in kc values based on the days after planting dap are shown in fig 3b for winter wheat and summer maize during the calibration phase the maximum kc values for winter wheat varied between 1 08 and 1 13 hebei 1 08 henan 1 13 beijing 1 11 shandong 1 13 and anhui 1 10 and were 1 21 for summer maize depending on the input parameters provided in the model table 1 the kc values were fitting well within the range cited in the literature for the 3h region tang et al 2018 the r2 between lai and kc was found to be 0 982 in hebei 0 970 in beijing 0 944 in shandong 0 953 in henan and 0 978 in anhui during the winter wheat period while it was found to be 0 940 in hebei during the summer maize period at the model calibration location points the r2 has been significant at the locations where lai 3 for winter wheat and lai 2 for summer maize eq 14 predicted the lai values from cc up to 90 for winter wheat and cc up to 70 for summer maize from eq 15 the kc values in the future were in similar ranges as calculated during the calibration period 3 2 spatial distribution of potential winter wheat and summer maize yield under future climate scenarios 3 2 1 potential yield following the calibration and validation stages the aquacrop model was used to simulate annual wheat and maize crop yields from 2016 to 2099 using the downscaled daily climate data for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 crop phenology and crop management practices selected during the model calibration period the soil data s1 was provided at all selected study locations fig 1 under future climate scenarios the spatial changes in mean potential yield for winter wheat and summer maize in the study area for the period of 2030s 2016 2040 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2099 have been shown in figs 4 and 5 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the potential yield of winter wheat and summer maize has been defined as the highest yield of cultivars achieved providing the sowing date and under stress free conditions i e no impact of water and nutrient shortages potential impact of pest disease and natural calamities under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the spatial distribution of yield for winter wheat is considerably similar during the 2030s fig 4a d this similarity persists during the 2050s with the exception of parts of hebei bordering henan north eastern henan and tianjin that exhibit a gradual decrease in winter wheat yields under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 fig 4b e during the 2080s broadly higher yields can be observed during both rcp scenarios but the differences are more pronounced with the exception of shandong which exhibits a continued increase in yield largely similar under both scenarios fig 4c f for summer maize yield continues to increase gradually in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 with the increase evident in the north and central hebei and areas bordering hebei and shandong under rcp8 5 there is clear stress evident in mean potential yields across the 3h region fig 6a g starting from the 2030 2080s the decrease in mean summer maize yields in central shandong and northwest henan is clearly distinguished fig 5d f under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 summer maize yields have decreased by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 considering the large spatial coverage and varying climatic conditions across the 3h region the distribution and change in mean potential yields t ha 1 across provincial levels have also been described in fig 6 a g 3 2 2 water productivity fig 7 a b presents the change in annual water productivity wp of winter wheat and summer maize in the 3h region under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the figure shows the wp of winter wheat ranging from 1 92 to 2 51 kg m 3 and summer maize ranging from 2 24 to 2 83 kg m 3 in this study during the calibration and validation stage of the aquacrop model wp ranged between 1 5 and 2 4 kg m 3 for winter wheat and 1 4 1 9 kg m 3 for summer maize ranging for different cultivars and growing seasons the estimated results in this study show an increasing trend in wp under both rcp scenarios similar to the potential grain yield for winter wheat the relative increase in wp under both rcp scenarios is similar until the 2060s but wp increases under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 in the latter half of the 21st century the effect of climatic variability on wp for summer maize remains the same under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the trend in the increase in wp of summer maize is higher as compared to winter wheat there is no significant change in etc during the winter wheat growth period while etc during the summer maize growth period shows a decreasing trend table 3 winter wheat being a c3 crop is expected to benefit from the co2 enrichment and increase in temperature and precipitation during its growing period however the variation in et and wp seems to be slightly affected by the climate change under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for summer maize the evaporative demand remains unchanged while the reduction in transpiration reduces the overall et demand which is an indication of stomatal closure resulting in an increase in wp under both rcp scenarios 3 3 water budget during winter wheat and summer maize growth period under future scenarios water budget during the winter wheat and summer maize growth period was calculated using eq 17 the spatial changes in water budget during the growth period of winter wheat ww and summer maize sm across the 3h plain has been shown in figs 8 and 9 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively for the period of 2030s 2050s and 2080s the changes at the provincial level have also been analyzed and shown in fig 10 a g during the ww growth period the water budget is estimated to be in deficit through all scenarios and timelines during the ww growth period the spatial distribution map figs 8 and 9a c shows that 35 of the total study area is severely water deficit 250 mm to 315 mm under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios specifically during the 2030s 27 in rcp4 5 and 29 in rcp8 5 of the study area is experiencing water deficiencies between 200 mm and 250 mm in areas along northern and north central hebei beijing and tianjin during the 2050s under both climate scenarios 58 of the study area is observed to be in a deficit of more than 200 mm of water during the winter wheat growth period while during the 2080s same water stress is observed in over 58 in rcp4 5 and 55 in rcp8 5 of the study area broadly 20 and 17 of the study area during rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively will have a water deficit between 150 mm and 200 mm water deficit of less than 150 mm is largely in lower parts of henan while southern areas of the 3h region usually exhibit a water deficit of less than 100 mm during the wheat growth period during the sm growth period beijing tianjin hebei and northeastern henan accounting for 47 of the total study area do not show considerable variations in water budget for both scenarios and largely fall between surplus of 50 100 mm while northern parts of hebei estimated to have a budget less than 50 mm in 2030s under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 under both scenarios the amount of water in access to crop requirements gradually increases from 2030s to 2050s and becomes quite evident in one fifth of the study area during the 2080s mainly in areas bordering shandong and anhui the southern 3h region is estimated to experience increased summer precipitation in 2080s under rcp8 5 scenario ultimately resulting in surplus water in excess to crop requirements figs 8 and 9d f considering the practice of wheat maize crop rotation cycle prevalent in the 3h plain the results show that irrigation demands will remain similar in most of the north 3h plain while the central and lower south are estimated to experience an increase in precipitation events and frequency 3 4 changes of potential yield water productivity water budget and iwr the changes in several critical crop growth factors across the 3h plain during ww and sm growth period for the three selected time periods under both scenarios have been shown in table 3 the potential yield of ww shows largely a similar increase in values beyond 2030s under the two scenarios with rcp8 5 showing slightly lower values as compared to rcp4 5 similarly for sm the potential yield is increasing from 2030s but the effect of increased summer temperature is evident under rcp8 5 scenario resulting in a less increase compared to rcp4 5 precipitation during ww and sm growth period is projected to improve under both rcp scenarios the percent increase in precipitation from the base period for ww and sm is increasing and the change is more prominent moving from 2050s towards 2080s the percentage increase is considerably higher towards 2080s with a more prominent increase during sm growth period this change in precipitation will slightly improve the water budget deficit of the 3h region during ww growth period for both rcp4 5 from 210 mm in 2030s to 202 mm in 2080s and rcp8 5 from 206 mm in 2030s to 191 mm in 2080s reducing the irrigation water demand by about 8 mm and 15 mm respectively similarly the water budget will also increase during sm growth period under rcp4 5 from 109 mm in 2030 s to 126 mm in 2080s and rcp8 5 107 mm in 2030s to 163 mm in 2080s respectively this increase is mainly estimated to be observed in the central and the south 3 h plain figs 8 and 9 the estimated change in etc for ww and sm showed a decreasing trend from 2030 to 2080s under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 increase in temperature and co2 concentration under medium emission scenario was beneficial to the potential yield and etc of winter wheat in case of sm the effect of reduction in transpiration with increased radioactive forcing ultimately reduced the overall et demand of crop reducing the etc from 344 mm to 338 mm under rcp4 5 and 342 329 mm under rcp8 5 from 2030 to 2080 respectively the reduction in etc has resulted in an increase in water productivity but has had an inhibitory effect on the potential yield under rcp8 5 4 discussion statistical downscaling models and crop models are two recognized tools for studying the effects of climate change on crop yields both of these require high quality quantitative description of observed data in terms of physiology agronomy soil and daily weather data to train the crop model to effectively simulate crop growth and development in the calibration and validation periods before using it for future predictions our results show that the changes in the cultivar parameterization of winter wheat and summer maize were captured correctly which resulted in reduced errors and deviations in the calibration and validation stages to study the impact of climate change on potential yield and water budgets during crop cycles it is also necessary to downscale future climate data with improved accuracy if climate data with reduced accuracy will be used as an input in the crop model it will result in further accumulation of error in potential yield and crop water requirement in this study the effort has been made to reduce the percent deviation of simulated mean monthly maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation within the range of 5 from the observed mean monthly data during the calibration period to minimize the accumulation of error for future downscaling the present research not only analyzed the temporal variation in the potential yield but also presented the changes in water budget in the wheat maize rotation cropping system it is evident in many studies yang et al 2015 tang et al 2018 geng et al 2019 that climate change will affect the crop productivity and water requirements of winter wheat and summer maize in north china higher temperatures may lead to higher water vapor deficit shorter crop growth period and an increase in co2 concentration may lead to reduced leaf stomatal conductance for both crops and ultimately reducing the crop evapotranspiration etc in this study higher yield for winter wheat was distributed in shandong and henan which continues to increase in both rcp scenarios the decrease in potential yields is observable in areas along the border between hebei and northern henan at the end of 21st century this trend is similar to tang et al 2018 who used the dssat model with only one winter wheat cultivar bainong 207 to simulate wheat yield using downscaled data from canesm2 in the 3h region in another study tao and zhang 2013 using the wheat model to capture the crop weather relationship over a large area mcwla wheat the effects of climate change on potential wheat yield have been studied with and without the co2 fertilization effects tao and zhang 2013 found the simulated winter wheat yields will increase by 37 7 18 6 67 8 23 1 and 87 2 34 4 during 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively across 80 of the north china plain region with without co2 fertilization effects respectively relative to the 1961 1990s wheat productivity could benefit from an increase in heat and water resources rising co2 concentration levels and shortened growing period could prevent it from high temperature stress our study has found that the water budget deficit during the winter wheat growth period under rcp4 5 will continue to be similar to the present conditions with slight improvements under rcp8 5 the change in increased precipitation patterns will be significant in shandong henan and south 3h region resulting in improved water budget in 2080s the water budget in the northern 3h region will continue to be in deficit but accompanied with increased temperatures it can increase the probability of drought in north china hu et al 2014 the non significant change in the water budget and etc during the winter wheat growth period is also evident in water productivity which has slightly improved from 1 5 to 2 4 kg m 3 in the observed period to 1 7 2 5 kg m 3 under both rcp scenarios another study mo et al 2009 suggests the improvement in water use efficiency of winter wheat by 10 and 7 under a2 and b1 scenarios in the north china plain the a2 and b1 scenarios are projected to result in warming by approximately 3 4 and 1 8 respectively by 2100 nakicenovic et al 2000 this suggests that an increase in temperature can lead to enhanced photosynthesis and early maturity can prevent wheat from high temperature stress improved water resources and rising atmospheric co2 levels will notably contribute to the increased wheat productivity in the future particularly in the central and south 3 h region for summer maize the results of our simulations indicate the increase in potential maize yield from the baseline 8 08 t ha 1 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 but maize yields have decreased by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in 2030 s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 which shows the effect of an increase in warm temperatures on crop phenologic development resulting in early senescence and reduced grain yield and biomass liu et al 2010a 2010b ultimately declining potential maize yield one previous study wang et al 2014 carried out at 10 sites in the north china plain to simulate the maximum maize yield using the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model and compared it with actual yields from the period 1980 2010 the study sites in the south of shandong indicate the increasing trend of precipitation and temperature during maize growth stage from flowering to milking resulting in declining potential maize yield wang et al 2014 indicated the reason in his study that even with sufficient water and nitrogen supply potential maize yields are declining due to an increase in temperature particularly during the pre flowering period which requires the breakthrough in breeding new cultivars with better adaptation potential simulation results of our study show a continuous increase in maize yield under rcp4 5 similar to the findings of wang et al 2014 the decrease in potential maize yield is pronounced in the south 3h region and lower areas of shandong under rcp8 5 in this study during the summer maize growth period beijing tianjin hebei and northeastern henan accounting for 47 of the total study area do not show considerable variations in water budget for both scenarios while the water resources conditions are estimated to improve in the lower shandong henan and south 3h region abundant and concentrated summer rainfall chen et al 2013 with no soil fertility stress and decline in maize yield under rcp8 5 indicate the effect of increasing temperatures and need to improve with the cultivar varieties with longer grain filling period and higher grain filling rate chen et al 2013 simulation results in this study estimate the water shortages in the north 3h region will be similar to the present conditions under both rcp scenarios while south 3h will experience improvements in water budget particularly in the summer maize growth period in contrast to the decline in maize yield the water productivity of the summer maize is estimated to increase due to reduction in et demand under both rcps but the effects are more pronounced under rcp8 5 which indicates the impact of variation in the temperature precipitation and co2 concentrations the significance of this study is that it helps to understand the potential changes in yield and water budget in wheat maize rotation areas on a local scale at different temporal scales across the 3h region although the crop phenological characteristics of local wheat and maize cultivars were used in this study there were some limitations that might influence the wheat and maize potential yield irrigation water requirements and water budget across the 3h plain some of the existing limitations in the aquacrop model are that it does not take into account the genetic characteristics of the cultivars raes et al 2009 and only simulates the growth process based on the phenological characteristics the uncertainties also reside in the prediction of the global circulation model gcm used downscaled information produced and the simulation outputs of the aquacrop model we also need to stress that these simulations do not take into account of pests and disease potentials and loss in yield due to natural calamities such as flooding and droughts dhakal et al 2018 in addition cultivar improvements change in agronomic practices and technological advancement could also affect yield and change in water resources in the future nonetheless our results provide a scientific basis to improve water resource management crop water management and a reference for decision making with a perspective of climate change at a local scale in which farmers and resource managers operate 5 conclusion this study was focused to understand the impacts of climate change on the winter wheat and summer maize potential crop yield and changes in water budget in the huang huai hai plain under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the spatial patterns of winter wheat potential yield were largely similar in 2030s 2050s and 2080s under both emission scenarios with yield increasing in shandong and northeastern parts of henan the water budget deficit during the winter wheat growth period under rcp4 5 will continue to be similar to present conditions with slight improvements but the change in increased precipitation patterns has been estimated to be significant in shandong henan and in the south 3h region resulting in improved water budget in 2080s under rcp8 5 for summer maize our simulations results indicate that maize yields will decrease by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 during the summer maize growth period considerable variations in the water budget for both scenarios are estimated to improve in the lower shandong henan and south 3h region while the north will experience similar conditions as present with increased temperatures

9781,climate change impacts crop productivity as atmospheric conditions and water supply change particularly in intensive cropping areas this study used the validated aquacrop model which was run with downscaled daily climate data produced by sdsm and canesm2 the changes in the potential grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize and water budget during the cropping seasons were estimated for the huang huai hai plain 3h plain under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the results show that the potential yield of winter wheat is increasing with similar spatial patterns in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s with much of the increase is distributed in shandong and northeastern parts of henan during the winter wheat growth period the water budget deficit will likely improve from 210 mm in the 2030s to 202 mm in 2080s under rcp4 5 and from 206 mm in the 2030s to 191 mm in 2080s under rcp8 5 across the 3h plain the water budget during the winter wheat period will continue to be in deficit in the north 3h plain and improvements are estimated mostly in the lower southern areas of the plain the summer maize potential yield is estimated to increase from the baseline period but yields will decrease by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 compared to rcp4 5 during the summer maize growth period the water budget is also estimated to improve from 109 mm in 2030s to 126 mm in 2080s under rcp4 5 and 107 mm in the 2030s to 163 mm in 2080s under rcp8 5 this increase is mainly estimated in the central and south of the 3h plain the estimated etc of winter wheat shows no significant decrease while the reduction of 6 mm and 13 mm for summer maize is observed under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the study provides scientific evidence to devise adaptation and mitigation

1 introduction the world meteorological organization wmo has predicted in its latest climate update that the annual mean global land and sea near surface temperature is likely to be at least 1 warmer than pre industrial levels defined as the 1850 1900 average in the coming five years and is very likely to be within the range of 0 9 1 8 wmo 2021 the special report on global warming of 1 5 c sr1 5 issued by the international panel on climate change ipcc in 2018 also indicated that anthropogenic warming is adding around 0 2 to global average temperatures every decade with this rate continued an increase of 1 5 in global temperature is likely to reach between 2030 and 2052 without large reductions in carbon dioxide co2 emissions leahy 2018 ipcc 2018 anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions are mainly determined by population size energy consumption land use patterns economic activity technology and climate policy the representative concentration pathways rcps represent four different scenarios based on the above mentioned factors they include a stringent mitigation scenario rcp2 6 two intermediate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and one scenario with very high ghg emissions rcp8 5 ipcc 2014 the scenario s names indicate the level of radiative forcing that each scenario produces as a result of an increase in ghg concentration rcp2 6 2 6 w m 2 rcp4 5 4 5 w m 2 rcp6 0 6 0 w m 2 and rcp8 5 8 5 w m 2 across all rcp s with growing ghg emissions global temperature is projected to rise by 0 3 4 8 by the late 21st century relative to 1986 2005 levels ipcc 2013 increasing temperatures will mean higher sea levels melting ice an increase in heat waves and other extreme weather events putting a greater impact on global food security health environment and sustainable development wmo 2021 with an increased understanding of global climate systems several studies battisti and naylor 2009 gornall et al 2010 have raised concerns and awareness about the impact of rising temperatures on agricultural productivity as a likely consequence of increased co2 concentration gleick 1986 elevated temperatures can negatively affect crop production due to decreased photosynthetic accumulation in plants because of shortened growing seasons lobell and field 2007 china as the world s largest wheat producer 133 59 million tons xiao et al 2018 fao 2020 and second largest maize producer 260 77 million tons fao 2020 plays an important role in shaping the international markets and global food security greaves and wang 2016 within china the huang huai hai plain 3h plain plays an important role in producing high quality wheat and maize which ensures the country s food security liu et al 2010a 2010b jeong et al 2014 the large scale crop production in the 3h plain is due to the winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system brown 2003 rainfall is abundant in summer to support maize production but is scarce in winter for wheat wang et al 2018 the water deficit for winter wheat is compensated by irrigation practices using groundwater which have been reported to increase crop productivity by 56 compared to rain fed conditions liu et al 2007 the increasing and widespread use of groundwater irrigation in this region has excessively depleted groundwater resources over the past 30 years at a faster rate of 1 m year particularly in the last 20 years wang et al 2018 resulting in water scarcity for winter wheat therefore it is necessary to estimate the impact of climate warming on the potential yield lv et al 2015 as the resulting increase in temperature is likely to shorten the length of the growing season for wheat hu et al 2015 and affect grain filling duration for maize zhang et al 2019 in the 3h plain the resulting decline in crop yields in china is likely to lead to several negative impacts on prices trade and food import dependent countries kent et al 2017 raising serious food security concerns and posing challenges to farmers and resource managers in the agricultural sector the changes and impacts of climate change on crop production can be studied using crop growth models crop growth models have widely been used to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop yields by simulating the physiological processes of plants and their response to management measures and climate stresses zhao et al 2017 the relationship between climate variability and crop yield has been confirmed in many studies using statistical approaches charles et al 2017 tang et al 2018 tang et al 2018 used the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model in the 3h plain and estimated that the potential yield crop water requirement etc and effective precipitation during winter wheat growing seasons might increase in the future under rcp4 5 while irrigation water requirements iwr would decrease wu et al 2006 simulated the effects of climate change on wheat grain yield and water demand using the world food studies wofost model the results quantified the average simulated potential yields that would go up to 9 7 mg ha 1 and 7 5 mg ha 1 in the northern and southern part of the north china plain ncp respectively rainfall is the limiting factor in the northern part of the ncp therefore average simulated potential yields can only reach 3 mg ha 1 in this region wu et al 2006 to date most of the literature has examined the climate change impacts at the global and regional levels ignoring the impacts at the local level and the potential for adaptation in which farmers are engaged zinyengere et al 2013 the county level studies in the 3h plain show that the response of maize yields to climate change varies in spatial pattern with distinct variation in magnitude when impacts were studied in different counties within the same region wang et al 2014 therefore there is a growing need to quantify the impacts of climate change on the potential crop yield changing irrigation water demand and water budgets during crop growing seasons at a finer scale to devise and implement specific adaptation xiao et al 2018 and mitigation strategies in agricultural planning and decision making wigley et al 1990 jones et al 2015 relevant to these locations this study aims to explore the changes in potential yield and water budget in wheat maize rotation areas under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 across the 3h plain the results will provide a theoretical basis to devise adaptation strategies for agricultural productivity water resource allocation and scientific response to climate change impacts on wheat and maize in the huang

2017 and covers approximately 350 500 km2 yang et al 2015 with 23 3 million ha of arable land the 3h plain contributes more than 70 of the winter wheat and 30 of the summer maize production to china s total harvest therefore is an important agricultural area li et al 2017 the 3h plain is an alluvial plain formed by the intermittent flooding of the huang he yellow river huai he and hai he rivers liu et al 2010a 2010b the region includes jing jin ji beijing tianjin hebei shandong and parts of henan anhui and jiangsu the climate of the region falls in the east asian temperate monsoon climate zone li et al 2017 with an annual mean temperature that varies between 8 and 15 while the variation in the precipitation ranges between 430 mm and 1390 mm which decreases gradually from southeast to northwest fan et al 2012 sun and zhang 2017 the region follows a crop rotation system winter wheat early october to early june of the subsequent year and summer maize mid june to late september wang

data center tpdc beijing china he et al 2020 cmfd has a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 1 and 3 h respectively and is regularly updated and evaluated by the tpdc the data from the cmfd was extracted using locations from the china meteorological administration cma list of ground weather monitoring stations which is available on the cma website http data cma cn the cmfd has shown a high correlation with the data available from ground observation stations of cma and can therefore be used for a wide range of applications at a finer resolution the meteorological data collected from cmfd for temperature pressure and specific humidity was at a standard height of 2 m as required for crop simulation but the data for wind speed was at a height of 10 m which was adjusted using eq 1 allen

aquacrop model in this study the aquacrop model v6 0 was used to simulate winter wheat and summer maize yield based on the crop management practices representative for each region within the 3h plain for the historical period the growth of winter wheat and summer maize was simulated based on the soil data field management and crop phenology data obtained from published literature including xiaotangshan county in beijing jin et al 2014 luancheng county in hebei umair et al 2017 xinxiang county in henan tang et al 2018 taian county in shandong bian et al 2016 and guangde county in anhui

scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 3 1 statistical downscaling for statistical downscaling the observed climate dataset 1979 2018 was split into calibration 1979 1998 and validation period 1999 2018 to enable independent model evaluation first relevant global circulation model gcm predictors were selected for each of the climate predictands precipitation maximum and minimum temperature using correlation matrix partial correlation scatter plot analysis and p value statistics at or above the 95 significance threshold during the calibration period a total of 20 ensembles were created for each climate variable precipitation maximum and minimum temperature at all 83 study sites fig 1 the mean of these 20 ensembles was calculated to obtain daily modeled climate data for the validation period the performance analysis of the observed and modeled data was carried out by analyzing the datasets at monthly scales for the validation period the performance of the sdsm simulated data compared to the observed data was evaluated for maximum and minimum temperature monthly mean monthly maximum and 95th percentile of data and precipitation monthly mean monthly sum and 95th percentile of data bias correction was then applied to correct the model bias in sdsm stochastic techniques are included to improve model performance in reproducing the observed data by artificially inflating the model output variance wilby et al 2002 after the validation of results the calibrated model was used to generate daily future climate data using the canesm2 gcm predictors for three time periods of 2030s 2016 2040 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2099 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 2 3 2 aquacrop model calibration and validation the aquacrop model was used to simulate crop yield using downscaled data for both the historical period and for future scenarios the model was calibrated using historical wheat and maize experimental data discussed in section 2 2 3 the performance was evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed grain yield data fig 2 under full irrigation for both winter wheat and summer maize during the 2011 2016 periods most of the available literature in the region largely reported on winter wheat cultivars even though most of the 3h plain follow double or triple cropping since the data obtained from the literature had different climatic data sources thermal time and total water supply in the observed and simulated environments were also compared to identify the differences in the simulation of yield 2 3 3 estimating crop coefficient kc and crop evapotranspiration etc the crop coefficient kc was calculated following the procedures established by the food and agriculture organization fao to calculate the kc values for agricultural vegetation eq 11 allen et al 1998 the minimum kcmin and maximum kcmax kc values used in this study were 0 4 and 1 15 for winter wheat tang et al 2018 and 0 4 and 1 2 for summer maize abedinpour 2015 respectively which are representative of the 3h region the value s for leaf area index lai were estimated from canopy cover cc obtained from the aquacrop model using eqs 12 and 13 developed by hsiao et al 2009 which were rewritten as eqs 14 and 15 for winter wheat ww and summer maize sm respectively nielsen et al 2012 crop evapotranspiration etc eq 16 refers to the amount of water that is lost through evapotranspiration a product of crop coefficient kc and the reference evapotranspiration eto calculated through the penman monteith method water budget mm in this study represents the difference between the effective precipitation pe and crop water requirement etc eq 17 which refers to the amount of water that needs to be supplied and the irrigation water requirement iwr can be written as the

aquacrop model crop yields were simulated for both winter wheat and summer maize using agronomic practices mentioned in table 1 which are widely used practices across the 3h plain furthermore full irrigation practice was followed with no water stress during both calibration and validation steps at all locations where simulations for winter wheat were carried out the percent deviation of grain yield model estimates from the observed data was between 0 42 and 11 0 for both the calibration and validation period with variations in results at different locations our results suggested that variation in climatic conditions irrigation supplied and planting schedule can induce some differences in model simulations earlier planting schedule promoted canopy growth grain yield and biomass and lesser variation in the model simulations when cultivars planted at later dates induced slightly larger variations but within an acceptable range similarly for summer maize the percent deviation of grain yield model estimates from the observed data varied between 1 44 and 8 90 for both calibration and validation stages the rmse between observed and simulated grain yield was 0 12 t ha 1 for jingdong8 jd8 in beijing 0 15 t ha 1 for kenong199 kn199 in hebei 0 21 t ha 1 for jimai22 jm22 in shandong and 1 01 t ha 1 for bainong207 bn207 in henan for winter wheat while it was 0 53 t ha 1 for zhengdan958 zd958 in hebei for summer maize overall the calibration results show a reasonably close match between the observed and those simulated by the model for both winter wheat and summer maize as shown in fig 2 the estimated relationship between lai and kc calculated using eqs 11 and 12 are shown in fig 3a and an increase in kc values based on the days after planting dap are shown in fig 3b for winter wheat and summer maize during the calibration phase the maximum kc values for winter wheat varied between 1 08 and 1 13 hebei 1 08 henan 1 13 beijing 1 11 shandong 1 13 and anhui 1 10 and were 1 21 for summer maize depending on the input parameters provided in the model table 1 the kc values were fitting well within the range cited in the literature for the 3h region tang et al 2018 the r2 between lai and kc was found to be 0 982 in hebei 0 970 in beijing 0 944 in shandong 0 953 in henan and 0 978 in anhui during the winter wheat period while it was found to be 0 940 in hebei during the summer maize period at the model calibration location points the r2 has been significant at the locations where lai 3 for winter wheat and lai 2 for summer maize eq 14 predicted the lai values from cc up to 90 for winter wheat and cc up to 70 for summer maize from eq 15 the kc values in the future were in similar ranges as calculated during the calibration period 3 2 spatial distribution of potential winter wheat and summer maize yield under future climate scenarios 3 2 1 potential yield following the calibration and validation stages the aquacrop model was used to simulate annual wheat and maize crop yields from 2016 to 2099 using the downscaled daily climate data for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 crop phenology and crop management practices selected during the model calibration period the soil data s1 was provided at all selected study locations fig 1 under future climate scenarios the spatial changes in mean potential yield for winter wheat and summer maize in the study area for the period of 2030s 2016 2040 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2099 have been shown in figs 4 and 5 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the potential yield of winter wheat and summer maize has been defined as the highest yield of cultivars achieved providing the sowing date and under stress free conditions i e no impact of water and nutrient shortages potential impact of pest disease and natural calamities under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the spatial distribution of yield for winter wheat is considerably similar during the 2030s fig 4a d this similarity persists during the 2050s with the exception of parts of hebei bordering henan north eastern henan and tianjin that exhibit a gradual decrease in winter wheat yields under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 fig 4b e during the 2080s broadly higher yields can be observed during both rcp scenarios but the differences are more pronounced with the exception of shandong which exhibits a continued increase in yield largely similar under both scenarios fig 4c f for summer maize yield continues to increase gradually in the 2030s 2050s and 2080s under rcp4 5 with the increase evident in the north and central hebei and areas bordering hebei and shandong under rcp8 5 there is clear stress evident in mean potential yields across the 3h region fig 6a g starting from the 2030 2080s the decrease in mean summer maize yields in central shandong and northwest henan is clearly distinguished fig 5d f under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 summer maize yields have decreased by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 considering the large spatial coverage and varying climatic conditions across the 3h region the distribution and change in mean potential yields t ha 1 across provincial levels have also been described in fig 6 a g 3 2 2 water productivity fig 7 a b presents the change in annual water productivity wp of winter wheat and summer maize in the 3h region under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the figure shows the wp of winter wheat ranging from 1 92 to 2 51 kg m 3 and summer maize ranging from 2 24 to 2 83 kg m 3 in this study during the calibration and validation stage of the aquacrop model wp ranged between 1 5 and 2 4 kg m 3 for winter wheat and 1 4 1 9 kg m 3 for summer maize ranging for different cultivars and growing seasons the estimated results in this study show an increasing trend in wp under both rcp scenarios similar to the potential grain yield for winter wheat the relative increase in wp under both rcp scenarios is similar until the 2060s but wp increases under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 in the latter half of the 21st century the effect of climatic variability on wp for summer maize remains the same under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the trend in the increase in wp of summer maize is higher as compared to winter wheat there is no significant change in etc during the winter wheat growth period while etc during the summer maize growth period shows a decreasing trend table 3 winter wheat being a c3 crop is expected to benefit from the co2 enrichment and increase in temperature and precipitation during its growing period however the variation in et and wp seems to be slightly affected by the climate change under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for summer maize the evaporative demand remains unchanged while the reduction in transpiration reduces the overall et demand which is an indication of stomatal closure resulting in an increase in wp under both rcp scenarios 3 3 water budget during winter wheat and summer maize growth period under future scenarios water budget during the winter wheat and summer maize growth period was calculated using eq 17 the spatial changes in water budget during the growth period of winter wheat ww and summer maize sm across the 3h plain has been shown in figs 8 and 9 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively for the period of 2030s 2050s and 2080s the changes at the provincial level have also been analyzed and shown in fig 10 a g during the ww growth period the water budget is estimated to be in deficit through all scenarios and timelines during the ww growth period the spatial distribution map figs 8 and 9a c shows that 35 of the total study area is severely water deficit 250 mm to 315 mm under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios specifically during the 2030s 27 in rcp4 5 and 29 in rcp8 5 of the study area is experiencing water deficiencies between 200 mm and 250 mm in areas along northern and north central hebei beijing and tianjin during the 2050s under both climate scenarios 58 of the study area is observed to be in a deficit of more than 200 mm of water during the winter wheat growth period while during the 2080s same water stress is observed in over 58 in rcp4 5 and 55 in rcp8 5 of the study area broadly 20 and 17 of the study area during rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively will have a water deficit between 150 mm and 200 mm water deficit of less than 150 mm is largely in lower parts of henan while southern areas of the 3h region usually exhibit a water deficit of less than 100 mm during the wheat growth period during the sm growth period beijing tianjin hebei and northeastern henan accounting for 47 of the total study area do not show considerable variations in water budget for both scenarios and largely fall between surplus of 50 100 mm while northern parts of hebei estimated to have a budget less than 50 mm in 2030s under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 under both scenarios the amount of water in access to crop requirements gradually increases from 2030s to 2050s and becomes quite evident in one fifth of the study area during the 2080s mainly in areas bordering shandong and anhui the southern 3h region is estimated to experience increased summer precipitation in 2080s under rcp8 5 scenario ultimately resulting in surplus water in excess to crop requirements figs 8 and 9d f considering the practice of wheat maize crop rotation cycle prevalent in the 3h plain the results show that irrigation demands will remain similar in most of the north 3h plain while the central and lower south are estimated to experience an increase in precipitation events and frequency 3 4 changes of potential yield water productivity water budget and iwr the changes in several critical crop growth factors across the 3h plain during ww and sm growth period for the three selected time periods under both scenarios have been shown in table 3 the potential yield of ww shows largely a similar increase in values beyond 2030s under the two scenarios with rcp8 5 showing slightly lower values as compared to rcp4 5 similarly for sm the potential yield is increasing from 2030s but the effect of increased summer temperature is evident under rcp8 5 scenario resulting in a less increase compared to rcp4 5 precipitation during ww and sm growth period is projected to improve under both rcp scenarios the percent increase in precipitation from the base period for ww and sm is increasing and the change is more prominent moving from 2050s towards 2080s the percentage increase is considerably higher towards 2080s with a more prominent increase during sm growth period this change in precipitation will slightly improve the water budget deficit of the 3h region during ww growth period for both rcp4 5 from 210 mm in 2030s to 202 mm in 2080s and rcp8 5 from 206 mm in 2030s to 191 mm in 2080s reducing the irrigation water demand by about 8 mm and 15 mm respectively similarly the water budget will also increase during sm growth period under rcp4 5 from 109 mm in 2030 s to 126 mm in 2080s and rcp8 5 107 mm in 2030s to 163 mm in 2080s respectively this increase is mainly estimated to be observed in the central and the south 3 h plain figs 8 and 9 the estimated change in etc for ww and sm showed a decreasing trend from 2030 to 2080s under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 increase in temperature and co2 concentration under medium emission scenario was beneficial to the potential yield and etc of winter wheat in case of sm the effect of reduction in transpiration with increased radioactive forcing ultimately reduced the overall et demand of crop reducing the etc from 344 mm to 338 mm under rcp4 5 and 342 329 mm under rcp8 5 from 2030 to 2080 respectively the reduction in etc has resulted in an increase in water productivity but has had an inhibitory effect on the potential yield under rcp8 5 4 discussion statistical downscaling models and crop models are two recognized tools for studying the effects of climate change on crop yields both of these require high quality quantitative description of observed data in terms of physiology agronomy soil and daily weather data to train the crop model to effectively simulate crop growth and development in the calibration and validation periods before using it for future predictions our results show that the changes in the cultivar parameterization of winter wheat and summer maize were captured correctly which resulted in reduced errors and deviations in the calibration and validation stages to study the impact of climate change on potential yield and water budgets during crop cycles it is also necessary to downscale future climate data with improved accuracy if climate data with reduced accuracy will be used as an input in the crop model it will result in further accumulation of error in potential yield and crop water requirement in this study the effort has been made to reduce the percent deviation of simulated mean monthly maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation within the range of 5 from the observed mean monthly data during the calibration period to minimize the accumulation of error for future downscaling the present research not only analyzed the temporal variation in the potential yield but also presented the changes in water budget in the wheat maize rotation cropping system it is evident in many studies yang et al 2015 tang et al 2018 geng et al 2019 that climate change will affect the crop productivity and water requirements of winter wheat and summer maize in north china higher temperatures may lead to higher water vapor deficit shorter crop growth period and an increase in co2 concentration may lead to reduced leaf stomatal conductance for both crops and ultimately reducing the crop evapotranspiration etc in this study higher yield for winter wheat was distributed in shandong and henan which continues to increase in both rcp scenarios the decrease in potential yields is observable in areas along the border between hebei and northern henan at the end of 21st century this trend is similar to tang et al 2018 who used the dssat model with only one winter wheat cultivar bainong 207 to simulate wheat yield using downscaled data from canesm2 in the 3h region in another study tao and zhang 2013 using the wheat model to capture the crop weather relationship over a large area mcwla wheat the effects of climate change on potential wheat yield have been studied with and without the co2 fertilization effects tao and zhang 2013 found the simulated winter wheat yields will increase by 37 7 18 6 67 8 23 1 and 87 2 34 4 during 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively across 80 of the north china plain region with without co2 fertilization effects respectively relative to the 1961 1990s wheat productivity could benefit from an increase in heat and water resources rising co2 concentration levels and shortened growing period could prevent it from high temperature stress our study has found that the water budget deficit during the winter wheat growth period under rcp4 5 will continue to be similar to the present conditions with slight improvements under rcp8 5 the change in increased precipitation patterns will be significant in shandong henan and south 3h region resulting in improved water budget in 2080s the water budget in the northern 3h region will continue to be in deficit but accompanied with increased temperatures it can increase the probability of drought in north china hu et al 2014 the non significant change in the water budget and etc during the winter wheat growth period is also evident in water productivity which has slightly improved from 1 5 to 2 4 kg m 3 in the observed period to 1 7 2 5 kg m 3 under both rcp scenarios another study mo et al 2009 suggests the improvement in water use efficiency of winter wheat by 10 and 7 under a2 and b1 scenarios in the north china plain the a2 and b1 scenarios are projected to result in warming by approximately 3 4 and 1 8 respectively by 2100 nakicenovic et al 2000 this suggests that an increase in temperature can lead to enhanced photosynthesis and early maturity can prevent wheat from high temperature stress improved water resources and rising atmospheric co2 levels will notably contribute to the increased wheat productivity in the future particularly in the central and south 3 h region for summer maize the results of our simulations indicate the increase in potential maize yield from the baseline 8 08 t ha 1 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 but maize yields have decreased by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in 2030 s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 which shows the effect of an increase in warm temperatures on crop phenologic development resulting in early senescence and reduced grain yield and biomass liu et al 2010a 2010b ultimately declining potential maize yield one previous study wang et al 2014 carried out at 10 sites in the north china plain to simulate the maximum maize yield using the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model and compared it with actual yields from the period 1980 2010 the study sites in the south of shandong indicate the increasing trend of precipitation and temperature during maize growth stage from flowering to milking resulting in declining potential maize yield wang et al 2014 indicated the reason in his study that even with sufficient water and nitrogen supply potential maize yields are declining due to an increase in temperature particularly during the pre flowering period which requires the breakthrough in breeding new cultivars with better adaptation potential simulation results of our study show a continuous increase in maize yield under rcp4 5 similar to the findings of wang et al 2014 the decrease in potential maize yield is pronounced in the south 3h region and lower areas of shandong under rcp8 5 in this study during the summer maize growth period beijing tianjin hebei and northeastern henan accounting for 47 of the total study area do not show considerable variations in water budget for both scenarios while the water resources conditions are estimated to improve in the lower shandong henan and south 3h region abundant and concentrated summer rainfall chen et al 2013 with no soil fertility stress and decline in maize yield under rcp8 5 indicate the effect of increasing temperatures and need to improve with the cultivar varieties with longer grain filling period and higher grain filling rate chen et al 2013 simulation results in this study estimate the water shortages in the north 3h region will be similar to the present conditions under both rcp scenarios while south 3h will experience improvements in water budget particularly in the summer maize growth period in contrast to the decline in maize yield the water productivity of the summer maize is estimated to increase due to reduction in et demand under both rcps but the effects are more pronounced under rcp8 5 which indicates the impact of variation in the temperature precipitation and co2 concentrations the significance of this study is that it helps to understand the potential changes in yield and water budget in wheat maize rotation areas on a local scale at different temporal scales across the 3h region although the crop phenological characteristics of local wheat and maize cultivars were used in this study there were some limitations that might influence the wheat and maize potential yield irrigation water requirements and water budget across the 3h plain some of the existing limitations in the aquacrop model are that it does not take into account the genetic characteristics of the cultivars raes et al 2009 and only simulates the growth process based on the phenological characteristics the uncertainties also reside in the prediction of the global circulation model gcm used downscaled information produced and the simulation outputs of the aquacrop model we also need to stress that these simulations do not take into account of pests and disease potentials and loss in yield due to natural calamities such as flooding and droughts dhakal et al 2018 in addition cultivar improvements change in agronomic practices and technological advancement could also affect yield and change in water resources in the future nonetheless our results provide a scientific basis to improve water resource management crop water management and a reference for decision making with a perspective of climate change at a local scale in which farmers and resource managers operate 5 conclusion this study was focused to understand the impacts of climate change on the winter wheat and summer maize potential crop yield and changes in water budget in the huang huai hai plain under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the spatial patterns of winter wheat potential yield were largely similar in 2030s 2050s and 2080s under both emission scenarios with yield increasing in shandong and northeastern parts of henan the water budget deficit during the winter wheat growth period under rcp4 5 will continue to be similar to present conditions with slight improvements but the change in increased precipitation patterns has been estimated to be significant in shandong henan and in the south 3h region resulting in improved water budget in 2080s under rcp8 5 for summer maize our simulations results indicate that maize yields will decrease by 0 81 1 19 and 2 10 in 2030s 2050s and 2080s respectively under rcp8 5 as compared to rcp4 5 during the summer maize growth period considerable variations in the water budget for both scenarios are estimated to improve in the lower shandong henan and south 3h region while the north will experience similar conditions as present with increased temperatures

9782,mango mangifera indica l is one of the widely grown fruit crops and brings remarkable economic benefit in the xerothermic regions of southwest china however mango yield and quality can not be guaranteed due to the severe seasonal drought low precipitation and extensive management of water and fertilizer to investigate the effects of irrigation amount and fertilizer regime on mango yield fruit quality water use efficiency wue and partial fertilizer productivity pfp an orthogonal experiment l9 3 4 was conducted on mango under drip fertigation during 2018 2019 the four factors were irrigation amount ia and fertilization rate at the flowering fⅰ fruit expansion fⅱ and fruit ripening fⅲ growth stages there were three irrigation amounts i e full irrigation fi 100 etc mild deficit

results showed the order of factors influencing fruit yield and wue in terms of their importance was ia fⅱ fⅰ and fⅲ that influencing water vitamin c and carotenoid contents in fruit was ia fⅲ fⅱ and fⅰ and that influencing soluble solids and total sugar contents was ia fⅲ fⅰ and fⅱ the wue of dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was highest fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 achieved the highest fruit yield pfp and contents of soluble solid vitamin c and carotenoid dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 had the highest total sugar content and the lowest titratable acid content based on the comprehensive scoring method dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 achieved the optimum

benefit to obtain high yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency the recommended water and fertilizer scheduling was irrigation with 75 etc and fertilization with 50 75 and 25 kg ha 1 at the flowering fruit expansion and fruit ripening stages respectively the research results provided a scientific reference for identified optimum combination irrigation and fertilizer in the xerothermic environment of southwest china keywords integrated irrigation and fertilization technology split fertilization yield quality comprehensive evaluation 1 introduction mango mangifera indica l is one of the five most popular fruits in the world and is mainly cultivated in the tropical and subtropical regions welay et al 2021 in recent years tropical agriculture has rapidly developed in the lancang river jinsha river a branch of yangtze river red river and nujiang river basins in southwest china both the planting area and production of mango rise year by year and mango industry has become one of the local characteristic agriculture zhang et al 2020 however seasonal drought in the hot dry valleys is severe because of the southern branch jet of the west wind and the southwest monsoon in addition the effect of leeward rain foehn wind and radiation caused by deep enclosed terrain worsened the drought stress zhang et al 2018a 2018b currently orchard fertilization in hot dry valleys is arbitrary and purposeless the partial or excessive application of chemical fertilizers pursuing maximum yield leads to many issues such as soil nutrients imbalance low fertilizer utilization and poor fruit quality zang et al 2015 therefore it is important to seek a scientific irrigation and fertilization scheduling in order to promote the healthy development of soil micro ecosystem in xerothermic areas and ensure high quality production of mango irrigation can effectively regulate absorption and transfer of nutrients leaf photosynthesis and transpiration division and growth of plant tissue cells and synthesis and transfer of organic substances of tropical fruit trees zuazo et al 2021 at the same time irrigation can significantly increase the mango fruit setting improve productivity and reduce biennial bearing shah et al 2018 irrigation amount with 50 etc reduced the net photosynthetic rate of the leaves during the flowering and fruit differentiation stages inhibited photosynthetic productivity and ultimately declined mango fruit yield santos et al 2013 mild deficit irrigation improved the absorption of water and nutrients by mango roots and balanced the vegetative growth and reproductive growth santos and martinez 2013 irrigation amount with 75 etc significantly inhibited the vegetative growth of fruit trees at the early stage but promoted the development of fruits at later stages and finally saved water and achieved high yield hueso et al 2021 a slight reduction in irrigation amount can speed up the starch decomposition boost the fructose content and increase the fruit dry matter but it would reduce contents of vitamin c and carotenoid khalifa 2018 liu et al 2020 compared with non irrigated treatment irrigation significantly reduced the hardness and titratable acids content of mango fruits madigu et al 2009 different fertilization methods and timing have significant effects on tree growth physiological activity and nutrition transformation drip fertigation with 10 30 reduction of fertilizer had no significant difference from the traditional fertilization ditch or spreading in fruit yield zhang et al 2019 li et al 2011 reported that nitrogen application at one time caused the early flourishing of fruit trees which was not conducive to flower bud differentiation and fruit setting and split nitrogen fertilization could meet the needs of nitrogen for all growth stages of trees resulting in high nitrogen use efficiency shi et al 2012 studied the effects of split nitrogen application on the yield and quality of pineapples and revealed compared with nitrogen application at one time topdressing more than twice significantly increased the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of pineapples leaves and the single fruit weight and fruit yield showed an increasing tendency with topdressing times wang et al 2017 studied the effects of split potassium application on yams and found that split potassium application improved the leaf photosynthetic characteristics enzymes activity in starch synthesis and increased transfer rate and starch accumulation thereby elevating the yield and potassium utilization rate studies on crops like corn wheat and rice demonstrated that the split fertilization increased yield and fertilizer use efficiency and improved quality compared with the single application strategy hanseok et al 2014 kathrin et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a 2018b topdressing fertilizer at different stages could better meet the nutrients absorption and utilization of crops which could avoid excessive fertilization and reduce fertilizer losses liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a 2018b previous research reported that the mango yield increased with the increasing of nitrogen and potassium amounts within a certain range and the sugar acid ratio increased with the increasing potassium amount but titratable acids decreased lin et al 2012 moderate reduction of fertilizer could obtain better fruit morphology and improve fruit quality but insufficient fertilizer application would cut down fruit yield and quality liu et al 2020 wolfram et al 2009 water and fertilizer are essential factors affecting crop growth photosynthetic characteristics and production benefits well coordinated water and fertilizer supply promoted growth leaf photosynthetic capacity and yield as well as water and fertilizer use efficiency li et al 2017a 2017b previous studies found that the coupling effect of water and fertilizer influenced the mango growth ewida et al 2013 sarker et al 2016 for example the increase of both irrigation and nitrogen regimes significantly increased the leaf nitrogen content but a single increase of nitrogen had no obviously effect on it fertigation directly and evenly transported water and nutrients to the crop root zone achieved synchronized water fertilizer application and greatly improved the fertilizer use efficiency fan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 hu et al 2021 kumar et al 2021 li et al 2021 yan et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the fertigation system realized on demand fertilization and provided suitable water and nutrient for crops further promoted the growth and development thereby improving the fruit yield and quality pramanik et al 2016 rong et al 2019 under fertigation fertilization and fertilizer allocation at different growth stages significantly affected the availability of soil nutrients in the root zone the absorption accumulation and utilization of nutrients by crops and then the accumulation of photosynthetic products emerson et al 2020 geng et al 2017 fertigation maintained an appropriate intensity and capacity of effective nutrients which was beneficial for fruit quality ramniwas et al 2013 rasool et al 2020 at present it remains unclear how the fertilizer allocation at various growth stages affects the yield and quality of mango and its overall benefit under drip fertigation the allocation of fertilizer at different growth stages directly affects the distribution of soil nutrients and their absorption by crops and ultimately affects the growth physiological activity yield and quality of crops it is still unclear how to effectively couple the allocation of fertilizer at different growth stages and irrigation amount to improve mango production for this reason it was hypothesized that the combination of optimal fertilization amount at each growth stage with an appropriate irrigation amount can achieve the overall improvement of mango yield quality water and fertilizer utilization the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the coupling effects of irrigation amount and variable topdressing on mango yield quality water and fertilizer use efficiency 2 to evaluate the water and fertilizer management for the overall benefit of mango production based on the comprehensive evaluation method 3 to determine an optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy for mango production to achieve high quality and high efficiency in hot dry areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year field experiment 2018 2019 was carried out in a mango orchard located at the ganzhuang farm in yuanjiang county yunnan province southwest china 102 0 32 e 23 11 42 n 840 m this region has a typical subtropical climate with annual temperature of 24 c and annual precipitation of 750 mm according to the united states department of agriculture usda soil classification system the experiment soil belongs to red loam wang et al 2020 the soil bulk density ph organic matter content alkali hydrolyzable nitrogen content available phosphorus content and the available potassium content in the 0 80 cm were 1 52 g cm 3 6 46 10 12 g kg 1 56 45 mg kg 1 30 34 mg kg 1 and 108 51 mg kg 1 experimental trees were 4 year old mango trees mangiferaindica l guifei with a plan spacing of 3 0 m and a row spacing of 4 0 m the ground diameter of mango trees ranged from 60 to 85 mm and the plant height ranged from 1 8 to 2 0 m the critical stages of mango trees were divided into three stages including the flowering stage stage ⅰ mid february to late march the fruit expansion stage stage ⅱ early april to late may and the fruit ripening

p2o5 k2o 20 20 20 xuelvfeng saigute biotechnology co ltd china was applied drip fertigation was conducted on mid february early april and early june for fⅰ fⅱ and fⅲ respectively considering the extreme shortage of water resource and the severe conflict between water use in agriculture and other industries in xerothermic areas mango was not irrigated from harvest mid july to first month before flowering mid january of next year the other mango orchard management measures were consistent with local fruit farmers habits such as blossom and fruit thinning farm weeding and pest control 2

determined by weighing ripe mangoes had gray stalks yellow peels and were slightly soft to the touch 2 5 2 fruit quality the mango quality indices were measured immediately after picking at the maturity stage the collected mango fruits were checked for infection or insect infestation and they were washed with both tap water and distilled water and then wiped with paper towels liu et al 2020

of rj the more significant the factor and vice versa 3 determine the optimal combination of the factors and levels 2 6 2 comprehensive scoring method 1 indicator weight it was determined by the coefficient of variation method of objective weighting due to the different dimensions of each indicator it was difficult to directly compare the degree of variation therefore the coefficient of variation of each indicator was used to compare the degree of variation 8 v j δ j χ j 9 w j v j 1 n v j where v j is the coefficient of variation of indicator j also known as the standard deviation coefficient δ j is the standard deviation of indicator j χ j is the average value of indicator j and w j is the weight of indicator j 2 the membership function value of each indicator was calculated

maximum and minimum values of indicator j under different treatments 2 6 3 topsis method 1 indicator weight it was determined by the coefficient of variation method of objective weighting as shown in eqs 8 and 9 2 nine treatments were set as evaluation objects with nine evaluation indicators including fruit yield wue pfp ts vc cc fw ss and ta among which the ta indicator was converted to a positive indicator using reciprocal transformation the evaluation indicators were normalized to establish a normalized matrix 11 z ij x ij i 1 n x ij 2 where z ij is the j index normalized value in i treatment x ij is the j index value in the i treatment i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 3 the ideal solution z ij and the negative solution z ij were determined to form the ideal solution vector z and the negative

fertilization at each growth stage demonstrated a significant effect on average fruit yield wue and pfp there were non significant differences in fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency between fifⅰ50fⅱ25fⅲ75 and fifⅰ75fⅱ50fⅲ25 fi increased fruit yield and pfp while dim improved wue under the same fertilization rate 150 kg ha 1 and high fertilizer allocation at fii the range analysis showed that the irrigation amount ia had a greater effect on fruit yield and wue followed by fⅱ and fⅰ and fⅲ was lowest table 3 the optimal combination of irrigation and fertilization for fruit yield was fifⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ50 while that for wue was dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ75 the decreasing effect order of the four factors on pfp was ia fⅰ fⅲ fⅱ and the optimal combination of irrigation and fertilization was fifⅰ25fⅱ25fⅲ25 ia had a greater effect on fruit yield wue and pfp than fertilization at various growth stages regardless of ia the decreasing effect order of fertilization on fruit yield and wue was fⅱ fⅰ fⅲ while that on pfp was fⅰ fⅲ fⅱ there were better fruit yield and water productivity in fⅱ compared to the other fertilization stages but fⅰ displayed a good potential in fertilizer productivity compared with fi dim decreased the mean fruit yield and pfp by 6 88 and 6 87 respectively and dis decreased the mean fruit yield and pfp by 47 30 and 38 63 dim increased the mean wue by 24 23 and dis increased the mean wue by 5 63 compared to fi it can be obtained that dim slightly reduced mean fruit yield and pfp but it significantly increased mean value of wue compared to fi however regardless of fruit yield or water fertilizer use efficiency dis showed poor performance compared with fⅱ25 fⅱ75 increased the mean fruit yield and wue by 14 92 and 16 89 respectively the comprehensive scoring method was applied to analyze the overall benefit of fruit yield wue and pfp table 4 dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 had the highest comprehensive score which indicated that the dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 achieved the optimal overall benefit on fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency 3 2 fruit quality the coupling of irrigation amount and fertilization allocation had significant effects on the nutritional quality indicators table 5 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 had the richest vc cc and ss the ts of dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 was highest fifⅰ50fⅱ25fⅲ75 had the largest fw the ta of disfⅰ25fⅱ25fⅲ25 was highest dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 had the lowest ta and the other five indicators had the smallest values in disfⅰ25fⅱ25fⅲ25 the allocation of fertilization across stages had significant effects on the mean values of fw and vc under dis and it had significant effects on the mean values of the all quality indicators under fi except for fw and ss or dim except for ts and cc the range analysis revealed that ia had a greater effect on fruit quality indicators than fertilization at various growth stages table 6 there was better effect on ts vc cc fw and ss fruit at fⅲ compared to the other growth stages the optimal combination of water and fertilizer for ts vc cc fw ss and ta was dimfⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 and dimfⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 respectively compared with fi dis reduced the mean value of vc cc fw and ss by 25 63 14 42 20 07 and 20 49 and dim reduced them by 1 08 2 17 10 15 and 6 30 respectively compared with fi dim increased the mean ts by 3 48 and decreased

fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 achieved the optimal overall benefit on mango fruit quality 3 3 multi objective decision and evaluation based on the topsis method taking fruit yield wue pfp ts vc cc fw ss and ta as evaluation indicators the topsis method was used to comprehensively determine the optimal water and fertilizer strategy table 8 the topsis analysis showed that dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was the optimal fertigation strategy for mango with high quality high yield and water fertilizer use efficiency in xerothermic areas that is irrigation with 75 etc and fertilization with 50 75 and 25 kg ha 1 at the flowering fruit expansion and ripening stages respectively 4 discussion the integrated irrigation and fertilization technology not only demonstrates outstanding water saving effects but also realizes the coordinated supply of water and nutrients thereby avoiding the imbalance of water and fertilizer supply and improving fertilizer use efficiency pramanik et al 2016 in order to achieve high quality and yield suitable fertilizer rates are required to supply at different growth stages of fruit trees hossein and sepaskhah 2015 the water and fertilizer integration technology has the advantage to regulate timely and effectively the timing and rate of fertilization thereby optimizing the soil nutrients supply capacity liang et al 2017 most studies indicated that fertigation improved crop yield and efficiency of water and fertilizer ghulam et al 2020 li et al 2021 pramanik et al 2016 rasool et al 2020 seasonal droughts water shortages improper irrigation and fertilization have severely impeded the development of mango industry in the xerothermic areas of southwest china therefore the fertigation technology coupling fertilizer allocation at different growth stages and rational irrigation amount is effective and feasible to ensure the high mango yield quality and utilization of water and fertilizer irrigation improves the concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient of soil nutrients thereby enhancing the plant s absorption of water transporting the solute carried in the water flow to the root epidermis and increasing nutrient interception by roots dastranj and sepaskhah 2021 for this reason the plant roots ability to absorb nutrients is restricted by the soil water status in the root zone in this study it was found that the effect of irrigation amount ia on fruit yield wue pfp and fruit quality was greater than that of fertilization at various stages indicating the dominant effect of soil water content on fruit yield wue pfp and fruit quality compared with fi dis reduced the fruit yield significantly which was consistent with the results of previous studies that severe water deficit reduced the fruit setting and limited fruit growth thereby reducing the fruit yield liu et al 2020 zhong et al 2019 this may be because that soil water deficit reduced the water conduction in the plant and affected the contents of hormones and metabolic enzymes thereby inhibiting its reproductive growth yang et al 2013 li et al 2017 the mean fruit yield in dis was increasing with the increase of fertilization rate but it did not increase much after a certain fertilization rate this indicated that the increase of fertilization rate within a certain range could alleviate the effect of drought stress on fruit yield but such alleviation would not work with excessive fertilization optimizing the split nitrogen application promoted the differentiation of flower buds the flowering rate the effective area of photosynthesis and ensured sufficient nutrients supply for later reproductive growth and then increased fruit yield peng et al 2019 studies found that a single nitrogen application that exceeded the normal growth and development needs of crops resulted in the residual nitrogen accumulation in the soil in the short term the crop would over absorb a single type of nutrient and cause out of range carbon nitrogen ratio vegetative growth and reproductive growth would compete for nutrients which hindered reproductive growth and seriously affected fruit yields peng et al 2017 this study found that the allocation of fertilization across various stages had a significant effect on the average fruit yield under fi or dim adjusting the allocation of fertilization across various stages could effectively realize the regulation of water and fertilizer promote fertilization with water optimize soil water potential gradient and accelerate the absorption and utilization of nutrients and water by crop roots thereby improving dry matter accumulation and water and fertilizer use efficiency jayakumara et al 2017 the fⅱ showed the greatest effect on fruit yield and wue compared to the other fertilization stages the primary reason was that fⅱ may supply the nutrients needed for the reproductive growth of mango in a timely manner thereby enhancing the accumulation and transformation of photosynthetic products and the synthesis of cytokinin in the fruit as well as improving fruit yield and efficiency of water and fertilizer hossein and sepaskhah 2015 the fruit yield and pfp of fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 was highest and the wue of dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was largest fi elevated fruit yield and pfp and dim increased wue under fixed fertilization rate and high fertilizer allocation at fii the analysis demonstrated that rational nutrient distribution at different growth stages coordinated the growth and dry matter distribution of vegetative and harvest organs which promoted the transfer of photosynthetic products to the reproductive organs gao et al 2018 therefore it was crucial to apply multiple topdressings according to the fertilizer demand of fruit trees in the different phenological periods by doing so it can not only meet the nutrient demands of fruit trees at different growth and development stages but also improve the fertilizer use efficiency and reduce the leaching losses lu et al 2021 grahmann et al 2016 rens et al 2018 sarker and rahim 2012 timely supplement of nutrients is an effective measure to improve fruit quality potassium fertilizer enhances the activity of enzymes in plants sugar metabolism and protein synthesis and fruit quality maha et al 2021 excessive potassium fertilizer application will inhibit the absorption of magnesium and calcium by plants and affect fruit quality because crops have a characteristic of luxury absorption for potassium wang et al 2017a 2017b fertilizers in the soil need to be decomposed and transformed by soil microorganisms before the plant absorbed and utilized fertilization at one time resulted in overload operations of soil microorganisms in the early stage of crop growth and reduced the decomposition rate and transformation efficiency of soil nutrients in the later stages dinev et al 2016 however multiple topdressings during the growing season of the crop could improve the metabolic capacity of soil microorganisms and increase the chemical and dynamic availability of soil nutrients thereby improving the nutritional quality of harvested organs sarker and rahim 2012 the study demonstrated that compared to other fertilization stage fⅲ had a great effect on fw vc cc ss and ts this may be because fⅲ supplied timely mineral nutrients for the fruit maturation and then improved fruit quality compared with fi dis reduced fw ss ts vc and cc significantly on the one hand water deficit may affect crop transpiration and cause lowered water transmission so nutrients and water of the root zone could not be transported to the canopy or fruit in a timely and effective manner marcelo et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 on the other hand crops may develop a self protection mechanism under drought stress to maintain their growth by slowing down metabolism galindoa et al 2018 compared with fi ts vc cc ss and ta of dim showed little change this indicated that moderately reduced irrigation amount would not affect the ts vc cc ss and ta of mango fruits this may be because mango is a perennial tropical plant with high drought resistance and good adaptability to water deficit moreno ortega et al 2019 li et al 2019 under fi or dim fertilization at various growth stages had a significant effect on the average values of ss ta ts vc and cc it indicated that fertilization at various stages achieved the synergistic effect of water and fertilizer under non severe deficit irrigation and then affected the fruit quality it was effective and feasible to improve mango fruit quality through rational water and fertilizer regulating strategy fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 demonstrated the highest ss vc and cc and dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 showed the highest ts it was indicated that fi increased the ss vc and cc while dim increased the ts under a fixed fertilization rate during the growing season and higher fertilization rate at the later stage with the improvement of agricultural productivity the fruit output of mango is rising however the selling price of mango remains low in both the international trade export market and the domestic consumer market more and more farmers not only care about mango fruit yield but are also very concerned about the nutritional quality and appearance in order to increase economic benefits in addition the input of water and fertilizer has also considered in this study the comprehensive evaluation method was used to analyze the results of the multi index orthogonal experiment and determine the optimal water fertilizer coupling mode with the overall benefits of mango production the comprehensive scoring method showed that dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was optimal for fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency and fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 was optimal for fruit quality the topsis method revealed that the optimal water and fertilizer strategy for high fruit yield quality and water fertilizer efficiency was dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 how to balance the relationship between fruit yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency to improve economic benefit and achieve the sustainable development of the mango production needs further research in addition considering the limitations of the orthogonal experimental design water and fertilizer management strategy for mango production in xerothermic regions needs to be further optimized 5 conclusions compared with the fertilization at various growth stages irrigation amount obtained a greater effect on mango fruit yield water use efficiency wue partial fertilizer productivity pfp and fruit quality fertilization at the fruit expansion stage had the greater effect on fruit yield and wue while fertilization at the fruit ripening stage had greater effect on the contents of total sugar vitamin c carotenoids fruit water and soluble solids full irrigation fi 100 etc elevated fruit yield and pfp and mild deficit irrigation dim 75 etc increased wue under the condition of fixed fertilization rate during the mango growing season and distributed more fertilizer at fruit expansion stage meanwhile fi raised the contents of soluble solids vitamin c and carotenoids and dim increased the total sugar content under the condition of fixed fertilization rate during the mango growing season and distributed more fertilizer at fruit expansion and ripening stages the topsis indicated that dim along with 50 75 and 25 kg ha 1 fertilizer at the flowering fruit expansion and fruit ripening stages could achieve high fruit yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency in xerothermic areas conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests

fⅰ and that influencing soluble solids and total sugar contents was ia fⅲ fⅰ and fⅱ the wue of dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was highest fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 achieved the highest fruit yield pfp and contents of soluble solid vitamin c and carotenoid dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 had the highest total sugar content and the lowest titratable acid content based on the comprehensive scoring method dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 achieved the optimum score in terms of fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency while fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 was optimum for fruit quality further the topsis method indicated dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 had the optimal comprehensive benefit to obtain high yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency the recommended water and fertilizer scheduling was irrigation with 75 etc and fertilization with 50 75 and 25 kg ha 1 at the flowering fruit expansion and fruit ripening stages respectively the research results provided a scientific reference for identified optimum combination irrigation and fertilizer in the xerothermic environment of southwest china keywords integrated irrigation and fertilization technology split fertilization yield quality comprehensive evaluation 1 introduction mango mangifera indica l is one of the five most popular fruits in the world and is mainly cultivated in the tropical and subtropical regions welay et al 2021 in recent years tropical agriculture has rapidly developed in the lancang river jinsha river a branch of yangtze river red river and nujiang river basins in southwest china both the planting area and production of mango rise year by year and mango industry has become one of the local characteristic agriculture zhang et al 2020 however seasonal drought in the hot dry valleys is severe because of the southern branch jet of the west wind and the southwest monsoon in addition the effect of leeward rain foehn wind and radiation caused by deep enclosed terrain worsened the drought stress zhang et al 2018a 2018b currently orchard fertilization in hot dry valleys is arbitrary and purposeless the partial or excessive application of chemical fertilizers pursuing maximum yield leads to many issues such as soil nutrients imbalance low fertilizer utilization and poor fruit quality zang et al 2015 therefore it is important to seek a scientific irrigation and fertilization scheduling in order to promote the healthy development of soil micro ecosystem in xerothermic areas and ensure high quality production of mango irrigation can effectively regulate absorption and transfer of nutrients leaf photosynthesis and transpiration division and growth of plant tissue cells and synthesis and transfer of organic substances of tropical fruit trees zuazo et al 2021 at the same time irrigation can significantly increase the mango fruit setting improve productivity and reduce biennial bearing shah et al 2018 irrigation amount with 50 etc reduced the net photosynthetic rate of the leaves during the flowering and fruit differentiation stages inhibited photosynthetic productivity and ultimately declined mango fruit yield santos et al 2013 mild deficit irrigation improved the absorption of water and nutrients by mango roots and balanced the vegetative growth and reproductive growth santos and martinez 2013 irrigation amount with 75 etc significantly inhibited the vegetative growth of fruit trees at the early stage but promoted the development of fruits at later stages and finally saved water and achieved high yield hueso et al 2021 a slight reduction in irrigation amount can speed up the starch decomposition boost the fructose content and increase the fruit dry matter but it would reduce contents of vitamin c and carotenoid khalifa 2018 liu et al 2020 compared with non irrigated treatment irrigation significantly reduced the hardness and titratable acids content of mango fruits madigu et al 2009 different fertilization methods and timing have significant effects on tree growth physiological activity and nutrition transformation drip fertigation with 10 30 reduction of fertilizer had no significant difference from the traditional fertilization ditch or spreading in fruit yield zhang et al 2019 li et al 2011 reported that nitrogen application at one time caused the early flourishing of fruit trees which was not conducive to flower bud differentiation and fruit setting and split nitrogen fertilization could meet the needs of nitrogen for all growth stages of trees resulting in high nitrogen use efficiency shi et al 2012 studied the effects of split nitrogen application on the yield and quality of pineapples and revealed compared with nitrogen application at one time topdressing more than twice significantly increased the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents of pineapples leaves and the single fruit weight and fruit yield showed an increasing tendency with topdressing times wang et al 2017 studied the effects of split potassium application on yams and found that split potassium application improved the leaf photosynthetic characteristics enzymes activity in starch synthesis and increased transfer rate and starch accumulation thereby elevating the yield and potassium utilization rate studies on crops like corn wheat and rice demonstrated that the split fertilization increased yield and fertilizer use efficiency and improved quality compared with the single application strategy hanseok et al 2014 kathrin et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a 2018b topdressing fertilizer at different stages could better meet the nutrients absorption and utilization of crops which could avoid excessive fertilization and reduce fertilizer losses liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a 2018b previous research reported that the mango yield increased with the increasing of nitrogen and potassium amounts within a certain range and the sugar acid ratio increased with the increasing potassium amount but titratable acids decreased lin et al 2012 moderate reduction of fertilizer could obtain better fruit morphology and improve fruit quality but insufficient fertilizer application would cut down fruit yield and quality liu et al 2020 wolfram et al 2009 water and fertilizer are essential factors affecting crop growth photosynthetic characteristics and production benefits well coordinated water and fertilizer supply promoted growth leaf photosynthetic capacity and yield as well as water and fertilizer use efficiency li et al 2017a 2017b previous studies found that the coupling effect of water and fertilizer influenced the mango growth ewida et al 2013 sarker et al 2016 for example the increase of both irrigation and nitrogen regimes significantly increased the leaf nitrogen content but a single increase of nitrogen had no obviously effect on it fertigation directly and evenly transported water and nutrients to the crop root zone achieved synchronized water fertilizer application and greatly improved the fertilizer use efficiency fan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 hu et al 2021 kumar et al 2021 li et al 2021 yan et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the fertigation system realized on demand fertilization and provided suitable water and nutrient for crops further promoted the growth and development thereby improving the fruit yield and quality pramanik et al 2016 rong et al 2019 under fertigation fertilization and fertilizer allocation at different growth stages significantly affected the availability of soil nutrients in the root zone the absorption accumulation and utilization of nutrients by crops and then the accumulation of photosynthetic products emerson et al 2020 geng et al 2017 fertigation maintained an appropriate intensity and capacity of effective nutrients which was beneficial for fruit quality ramniwas et al 2013 rasool et al 2020 at present it remains unclear how the fertilizer allocation at various growth stages affects the yield and quality of mango and its overall benefit under drip fertigation the allocation of fertilizer at different growth stages directly affects the distribution of soil nutrients and their absorption by crops and ultimately affects the growth physiological activity yield and quality of crops it is still unclear how to effectively couple the allocation of fertilizer at different growth stages and irrigation amount to improve mango production for this reason it was hypothesized that the combination of optimal fertilization amount at each growth stage with an appropriate irrigation amount can achieve the overall improvement of mango yield quality water and fertilizer utilization the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the coupling effects of irrigation amount and variable topdressing on mango yield quality water and fertilizer use efficiency 2 to evaluate the water and fertilizer management for the overall benefit of mango production based on the comprehensive evaluation method 3 to determine an optimal irrigation and fertilization strategy for mango production to achieve high quality and high efficiency in hot dry areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year field experiment 2018 2019 was carried out in a mango orchard located at the ganzhuang farm in yuanjiang county yunnan province

positive indicator using reciprocal transformation the evaluation indicators were normalized to establish a normalized matrix 11 z ij x ij i 1 n x ij 2 where z ij is the j index normalized value in i treatment x ij is the j index value in the i treatment i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 3 the ideal solution z ij and the negative solution z ij were determined to form the ideal solution vector z and the negative solution vector z respectively 12 z i j z i 1 z i 2 z i 3 z i j 13 z i j z i 1 z i 2 z i 3 z i j where z ij and z ij represent the maximum and minimum values of the evaluation object in the j th index respectively 4 the euclidean distances d i and d i were determined 14 d i j 1 m w j z ij z ij 2 15 d i j 1 m w j z ij z ij 2 where w j is the weight of indicator j 5 the relative proximity coefficient r i of each treatment was calculated that is the proximity between the evaluation object and the optimal scheme was calculated as follows 16 r i d i d i d i 3 results 3 1 fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency the coupling of irrigation amount and fertilization allocation at various growth stages had significant effects on fruit yield wue and pfp table 2 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 achieved the highest yield and pfp dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 exhibited the highest wue both the fruit yield and wue were lowest in disfⅰ25fⅱ25fⅲ25 disfⅰ75fⅱ75fⅲ75 had the lowest pfp under dis or dim the allocation of fertilization at each growth stage demonstrated a significant effect on average fruit yield wue and pfp there were non significant differences in fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency between fifⅰ50fⅱ25fⅲ75 and fifⅰ75fⅱ50fⅲ25 fi increased fruit yield and pfp while dim improved wue under the same fertilization rate 150 kg ha 1 and high fertilizer allocation at fii the range analysis showed that the irrigation amount ia had a greater effect on fruit yield and wue followed by fⅱ and fⅰ and fⅲ was lowest table 3 the optimal combination of irrigation and fertilization for fruit yield was fifⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ50 while that for wue was dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ75 the decreasing effect order of the four factors on pfp was ia fⅰ fⅲ fⅱ and the optimal combination of irrigation and fertilization was fifⅰ25fⅱ25fⅲ25 ia had a greater effect on fruit yield wue and pfp than fertilization at various growth stages regardless of ia the decreasing effect order of fertilization on fruit yield and wue was fⅱ fⅰ fⅲ while that on pfp was fⅰ fⅲ fⅱ there were better fruit yield and water productivity in fⅱ compared to the other fertilization stages but fⅰ displayed a good potential in fertilizer productivity compared with fi dim decreased the mean fruit yield and pfp by 6 88 and 6 87 respectively and dis decreased the mean fruit yield and pfp by 47 30 and 38 63 dim increased the mean wue by 24 23 and dis increased the mean wue by 5 63 compared to fi it can be obtained that dim slightly reduced mean fruit yield and pfp but it significantly increased mean value of wue compared to fi however regardless of fruit yield or water fertilizer use efficiency dis showed poor performance compared with fⅱ25 fⅱ75 increased the mean fruit yield and wue by 14 92 and 16 89 respectively the comprehensive scoring method was applied to analyze the overall benefit of fruit yield wue and pfp table 4 dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 had the highest comprehensive score which indicated that the dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 achieved the optimal overall benefit on fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency 3 2 fruit quality the coupling of irrigation amount and fertilization allocation had significant effects on the nutritional quality indicators table 5 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 had the richest vc cc and ss the ts of dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 was highest fifⅰ50fⅱ25fⅲ75 had the largest fw the ta of disfⅰ25fⅱ25fⅲ25 was highest dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 had the lowest ta and the other five indicators had the smallest values in disfⅰ25fⅱ25fⅲ25 the allocation of fertilization across stages had significant effects on the mean values of fw and vc under dis and it had significant effects on the mean values of the all quality indicators under fi except for fw and ss or dim except for ts and cc the range analysis revealed that ia had a greater effect on fruit quality indicators than fertilization at various growth stages table 6 there was better effect on ts vc cc fw and ss fruit at fⅲ compared to the other growth stages the optimal combination of water and fertilizer for ts vc cc fw ss and ta was dimfⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 fifⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 and dimfⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 respectively compared with fi dis reduced the mean value of vc cc fw and ss by 25 63 14 42 20 07 and 20 49 and dim reduced them by 1 08 2 17 10 15 and 6 30 respectively compared with fi dim increased the mean ts by 3 48 and decreased the mean ta by 8 96 while dis decreased the mean ts by 21 60 and increased the mean ta by 11 78 it can be obtained that ts vc cc fw and ss of dis were significantly reduced and ta was significantly increased compared to fi the comprehensive scoring method was applied to analyze the overall benefit of mango fruit quality table 7 fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 showed the highest comprehensive score in other words fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 achieved the optimal overall benefit on mango fruit quality 3 3 multi objective decision and evaluation based on the topsis method taking fruit yield wue pfp ts vc cc fw ss and ta as evaluation indicators the topsis method was used to comprehensively determine the optimal water and fertilizer strategy table 8 the topsis analysis showed that dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was the optimal fertigation strategy for mango with high quality high yield and water fertilizer use efficiency in xerothermic areas that is irrigation with 75 etc and fertilization with 50 75 and 25 kg ha 1 at the flowering fruit expansion and ripening stages respectively 4 discussion the integrated irrigation and fertilization technology not only demonstrates outstanding water saving effects but also realizes the coordinated supply of water and nutrients thereby avoiding the imbalance of water and fertilizer supply and improving fertilizer use efficiency pramanik et al 2016 in order to achieve high quality and yield suitable fertilizer rates are required to supply at different growth stages of fruit trees hossein and sepaskhah 2015 the water and fertilizer integration technology has the advantage to regulate timely and effectively the timing and rate of fertilization thereby optimizing the soil nutrients supply capacity liang et al 2017 most studies indicated that fertigation improved crop yield and efficiency of water and fertilizer ghulam et al 2020 li et al 2021 pramanik et al 2016 rasool et al 2020 seasonal droughts water shortages improper irrigation and fertilization have severely impeded the development of mango industry in the xerothermic areas of southwest china therefore the fertigation technology coupling fertilizer allocation at different growth stages and rational irrigation amount is effective and feasible to ensure the high mango yield quality and utilization of water and fertilizer irrigation improves the concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient of soil nutrients thereby enhancing the plant s absorption of water transporting the solute carried in the water flow to the root epidermis and increasing nutrient interception by roots dastranj and sepaskhah 2021 for this reason the plant roots ability to absorb nutrients is restricted by the soil water status in the root zone in this study it was found that the effect of irrigation amount ia on fruit yield wue pfp and fruit quality was greater than that of fertilization at various stages indicating the dominant effect of soil water content on fruit yield wue pfp and fruit quality compared with fi dis reduced the fruit yield significantly which was consistent with the results of previous studies that severe water deficit reduced the fruit setting and limited fruit growth thereby reducing the fruit yield liu et al 2020 zhong et al 2019 this may be because that soil water deficit reduced the water conduction in the plant and affected the contents of hormones and metabolic enzymes thereby inhibiting its reproductive growth yang et al 2013 li et al 2017 the mean fruit yield in dis was increasing with the increase of fertilization rate but it did not increase much after a certain fertilization rate this indicated that the increase of fertilization rate within a certain range could alleviate the effect of drought stress on fruit yield but such alleviation would not work with excessive fertilization optimizing the split nitrogen application promoted the differentiation of flower buds the flowering rate the effective area of photosynthesis and ensured sufficient nutrients supply for later reproductive growth and then increased fruit yield peng et al 2019 studies found that a single nitrogen application that exceeded the normal growth and development needs of crops resulted in the residual nitrogen accumulation in the soil in the short term the crop would over absorb a single type of nutrient and cause out of range carbon nitrogen ratio vegetative growth and reproductive growth would compete for nutrients which hindered reproductive growth and seriously affected fruit yields peng et al 2017 this study found that the allocation of fertilization across various stages had a significant effect on the average fruit yield under fi or dim adjusting the allocation of fertilization across various stages could effectively realize the regulation of water and fertilizer promote fertilization with water optimize soil water potential gradient and accelerate the absorption and utilization of nutrients and water by crop roots thereby improving dry matter accumulation and water and fertilizer use efficiency jayakumara et al 2017 the fⅱ showed the greatest effect on fruit yield and wue compared to the other fertilization stages the primary reason was that fⅱ may supply the nutrients needed for the reproductive growth of mango in a timely manner thereby enhancing the accumulation and transformation of photosynthetic products and the synthesis of cytokinin in the fruit as well as improving fruit yield and efficiency of water and fertilizer hossein and sepaskhah 2015 the fruit yield and pfp of fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 was highest and the wue of dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was largest fi elevated fruit yield and pfp and dim increased wue under fixed fertilization rate and high fertilizer allocation at fii the analysis demonstrated that rational nutrient distribution at different growth stages coordinated the growth and dry matter distribution of vegetative and harvest organs which promoted the transfer of photosynthetic products to the reproductive organs gao et al 2018 therefore it was crucial to apply multiple topdressings according to the fertilizer demand of fruit trees in the different phenological periods by doing so it can not only meet the nutrient demands of fruit trees at different growth and development stages but also improve the fertilizer use efficiency and reduce the leaching losses lu et al 2021 grahmann et al 2016 rens et al 2018 sarker and rahim 2012 timely supplement of nutrients is an effective measure to improve fruit quality potassium fertilizer enhances the activity of enzymes in plants sugar metabolism and protein synthesis and fruit quality maha et al 2021 excessive potassium fertilizer application will inhibit the absorption of magnesium and calcium by plants and affect fruit quality because crops have a characteristic of luxury absorption for potassium wang et al 2017a 2017b fertilizers in the soil need to be decomposed and transformed by soil microorganisms before the plant absorbed and utilized fertilization at one time resulted in overload operations of soil microorganisms in the early stage of crop growth and reduced the decomposition rate and transformation efficiency of soil nutrients in the later stages dinev et al 2016 however multiple topdressings during the growing season of the crop could improve the metabolic capacity of soil microorganisms and increase the chemical and dynamic availability of soil nutrients thereby improving the nutritional quality of harvested organs sarker and rahim 2012 the study demonstrated that compared to other fertilization stage fⅲ had a great effect on fw vc cc ss and ts this may be because fⅲ supplied timely mineral nutrients for the fruit maturation and then improved fruit quality compared with fi dis reduced fw ss ts vc and cc significantly on the one hand water deficit may affect crop transpiration and cause lowered water transmission so nutrients and water of the root zone could not be transported to the canopy or fruit in a timely and effective manner marcelo et al 2014 zheng et al 2020 on the other hand crops may develop a self protection mechanism under drought stress to maintain their growth by slowing down metabolism galindoa et al 2018 compared with fi ts vc cc ss and ta of dim showed little change this indicated that moderately reduced irrigation amount would not affect the ts vc cc ss and ta of mango fruits this may be because mango is a perennial tropical plant with high drought resistance and good adaptability to water deficit moreno ortega et al 2019 li et al 2019 under fi or dim fertilization at various growth stages had a significant effect on the average values of ss ta ts vc and cc it indicated that fertilization at various stages achieved the synergistic effect of water and fertilizer under non severe deficit irrigation and then affected the fruit quality it was effective and feasible to improve mango fruit quality through rational water and fertilizer regulating strategy fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 demonstrated the highest ss vc and cc and dimfⅰ25fⅱ50fⅲ75 showed the highest ts it was indicated that fi increased the ss vc and cc while dim increased the ts under a fixed fertilization rate during the growing season and higher fertilization rate at the later stage with the improvement of agricultural productivity the fruit output of mango is rising however the selling price of mango remains low in both the international trade export market and the domestic consumer market more and more farmers not only care about mango fruit yield but are also very concerned about the nutritional quality and appearance in order to increase economic benefits in addition the input of water and fertilizer has also considered in this study the comprehensive evaluation method was used to analyze the results of the multi index orthogonal experiment and determine the optimal water fertilizer coupling mode with the overall benefits of mango production the comprehensive scoring method showed that dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 was optimal for fruit yield and water fertilizer use efficiency and fifⅰ25fⅱ75fⅲ50 was optimal for fruit quality the topsis method revealed that the optimal water and fertilizer strategy for high fruit yield quality and water fertilizer efficiency was dimfⅰ50fⅱ75fⅲ25 how to balance the relationship between fruit yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency to improve economic benefit and achieve the sustainable development of the mango production needs further research in addition considering the limitations of the orthogonal experimental design water and fertilizer management strategy for mango production in xerothermic regions needs to be further optimized 5 conclusions compared with the fertilization at various growth stages irrigation amount obtained a greater effect on mango fruit yield water use efficiency wue partial fertilizer productivity pfp and fruit quality fertilization at the fruit expansion stage had the greater effect on fruit yield and wue while fertilization at the fruit ripening stage had greater effect on the contents of total sugar vitamin c carotenoids fruit water and soluble solids full irrigation fi 100 etc elevated fruit yield and pfp and mild deficit irrigation dim 75 etc increased wue under the condition of fixed fertilization rate during the mango growing season and distributed more fertilizer at fruit expansion stage meanwhile fi raised the contents of soluble solids vitamin c and carotenoids and dim increased the total sugar content under the condition of fixed fertilization rate during the mango growing season and distributed more fertilizer at fruit expansion and ripening stages the topsis indicated that dim along with 50 75 and 25 kg ha 1 fertilizer at the flowering fruit expansion and fruit ripening stages could achieve high fruit yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency in xerothermic areas conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests

plastic mulching influences volumetric water availability vwa global stress weighted water footprint per unit of output energy wfo and per unit of net economic return in crop production wfe data extracted from 394 published studies in maize zea mays l wheat triticum aestivum l and potato solanum tuberosum l were used in the meta analysis on crop production at the regional scale and across a range of n fertilization gradients in china plastic mulching reduced vwa by 15 3 14 1 and 16 3 in maize wheat and potato respectively when compared to non mulching practice with corresponding reductions of wfo by 33 3 28 1 and 32 1 and of wfe by 14 8 31 1 and 31 0 in maize wheat and potato respectively water footprint for crop production increased first and then decreased over the past four decades in china and was greater in northwest and north central regions of china than in other regions under moderate and high n fertilization 100 kg n ha 1 in dry regions plastic mulching increased the impact on vwa thereby reducing wfo and wfe water footprint for the production in potato and maize was lower than that in wheat the meta analysis demonstrated that plastic mulching practices reduced water footprint while lowering vwa therefore plastic mulching has potential for saving water resource when appropriate growing region and n fertilizer applications are considered

availability of water resources at regional scale they cannot fully reflect the pressure on water resources for crop production thus the development of inventory guidelines and assessing new methods for water use is an important innovation in life cycle assessment berger and finkbeiner 2010 the water footprint concept has also been extended by incorporating the characterization factors of water stress into the calculation of the water footprint by ridoutt and pfister 2010 this revised approach represents a solution to the above mentioned weaknesses in the calculation of the water footprint

soil water content crop yield and resource utilization efficiency gan et al 2013 it is estimated that over the past 30 years the amount of plastic film applied in china has increased dramatically from 6000 t in 1982 1 5 mt in 2017 a 200 fold increase particularly in cold arid and semiarid regions of china gao et al 2019 additionally the cover area of plastic film has reached about 20 mha in recent years which accounts for 11 of the arable farmland in china wang et al 2020a yan et al 2014 scientific evidence suggests mulching reduced crops water footprint based on virtual water use zhuo and hoekstra 2017 because of a decrease in green water footprint and blue water footprint and an increase in the ratio of green to blue water footprint chukalla et al 2015 however how plastic film mulching affects water stress weighted water footprint in field crops i e wheat maize and potato under different growing region is still unknown it is necessary to make a detailed comparative study of crop water footprint in different regions in addition field experiments are generally conducted in a single area and thus cannot evaluate the comprehensive effect of plastic mulching on macro scale areas meta analysis provides a formal statistical method to compare and integrate the results of multiple studies to reveal underlying factors contributing to responses and make inferences on regional and global scales hedges et al 1999 however a synthesis of the response of blue water availability and water footprint of crop production under plastic mulching is still poorly understood the present meta analysis of field studies in china on crop production and water footprints under plastic mulching practices aims to determine 1 how water footprint of crop production responds to plastic mulching

footprint calculation method was used in this study ridoutt et al 2010 ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 the system boundary and methodology used in this study is outlines in fig 1 the transportation of fertilizer was set at 500 km in this study in the experiment with irrigation the consumption of electric energy is also included in the inventory of agricultural inputs he et al 2017 the volumetric impact on the blue water availability consists of blue water consumption grey water requirement and impact of land use on blue water resources since the production and consumption of green water by agriculture does not lead to the shortage of water resources green water was not included as a direct component of water footprint of crop production and thus green water usage was not considered in this study xu et al 2013 but land use can affect the amount of blue water the calculation of product water footprint based on lca included the influence of land use on blue water resources ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 direct usage of blue water refers to irrigation water the amount of each agricultural inputs was multiplied by their water consumption factors from the ike ebalance v3 0 software ike environment technology co ltd china to compute indirect usage of blue water the water consumption coefficients of different agriculture input used in this study are shown in tables s1 the impact of agricultural inputs on vwa refers to the water resources consumed in their production and transportation the impact of land use on blue water resources was calculated based on the previous studies liu et al 2017 lu et al 2016 xu et al 2013 1 lbw 0 p eff et nat 2 lbw p eff et nat p eff et nat where lbw is the influence of land use on blue water mm etnat is the total annual evapotranspiration from natural ecosystem including herbaceous vegetation and forest mm peff is the effective rainfall 5 mm rainfall data i e effective rainfall or average annual rainfall for

available water coefficient for forest and grassland respectively in this study the lbw value used in this study is 0 because the calculated etnat was greater than peff 2 2 2 calculation of grey water requirement in this study the grey water requirement assessed nitrogen n and phosphorus p contamination but the effects of pesticides and other fertilizers were not covered the grey water requirement which is the freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants and expresses the degradative water use was calculated by the critical dilution volume method liu et al 2017 lu et al 2016 xu et

p ha 1 are the n and p concentrations which is calculated by multiplying the amount of n or p fertilizer application by the loss factor the average n and p loss factors were used in this study according to previous studies lu et al 2016 mo et al 2020 wang et al 2019b xu et al 2013 the n loss factor was established from a literature survey lu et al 2016 mo et al 2020 wang et al 2019b xu et

china lu et al 2016 2 2 3 calculation of water stress index the watergap2 global hydrological and global water consumption models were used to calculate water stress index wsi in this study pfister et al 2009 ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 the model includes a hydrological and socio economic component that calculates annual freshwater availability and withdrawals for various users such as industry agriculture and households xu et al 2013 6 wsi 1 1 e 6 4 wta 1 0 01 1 where wta is the ratio of total annual freshwater withdrawals to hydrological availability and the china water resources bulletin http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb szygb provided the regional wta data 2 2 4 calculation of water footprint water footprint was calculated as 7 wf vwa y bw gw y where wf is the water footprint l kg

calculated by multiplying the wf by the wsi of the given region xu et al 2013 to facilitate international comparison the global stress weighted water footprint was obtained by dividing the regional water footprint by the global average wsi 0 602 ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 because yield and water footprint per unit of yield of the various crops is not directly comparable adjustments for their different economic value or energy equivalent per unit of yield weight are required thus the water footprint per unit of output energy wfo and the water footprint per unit of net economic return wfe for each crop were included in this study 8 wfo vwa energy output bw gw energy output 9 wfe vwa net economic return bw gw net economic return where wfo is the water footprint per unit of output energy l h2oe mj 1 wfe is the water footprint per unit of net economic return l h2oe rmb 1 the energy output from the production was estimated through multiplying the amount of production by the energy equivalent value which in this study was 3 8 mj kg 1 for potato and 16 3 mj kg 1 for maize and wheat respectively the net economic value is computed through deducting the product s revenue from the total manufacturing cost wang et al 2020a xie et al 2020 1 rmb i e chinese yuan 0 148 u s dollar 2 3 data analysis the impact size was calculated as the natural log lnr of the response ratio r which represents the influence of plastic mulching several research papers did not provide standard deviation or standard error values under these circumstances we estimated the average coefficient of variation within each data set and then used the average coefficient of variation to calculate the standard error the meta analysis eliminated groups with less than three valid comparisons for each independent study the weighted mean log ratio in r was determined using the following equations 10 l n r i 1 k w i l n r i i 1 k w i 11 w 1 v 1 sp 2 np xp 2 sc 2 nc x c 2 where wi is the reciprocal of total variance of lnri sp and sc which are the standard deviations for all comparisons in the plastic mulching treatment and non mulching groups respectively np and nc are the sample sizes for the plastic mulching treatment and non mulching groups respectively xp is the mean of water footprint in the plastic mulching treatment and xc is the mean of water footprint in the non mulching treatment the distribution of water footprint does not follow the normal curve according to the kolmogorov smirnov test using the statistical software metawin 2 1 systat software inc san jose ca with a resampling of 9999 iterations based on the bootstrapping test a random effects model was used to assess whether plastic mulching significantly affected any dependent variable shcherbak et al 2014 the percentage change in water footprints was computed as in r 1 100 to make interpretation easier the effect of plastic mulching was judged significant if the 95 confidence interval ci for a dependent variable did not overlap zero if the 95 bootstrapping cis of the different category variables did not overlap the means of the separate categorical variables were judged substantially distinct from

followed by 1 100 and 301 kg n ha 1 28 2 30 3 and without n fertilization 16 7 fig 5 e on average wfo always increased with the increase in n fertilizer rate under both plastic and non plastic

that the decreased grey water requirement by plastic mulching contributed to about 49 51 and 53 reduction in water footprint for maize wheat and potato respectively 3 5 changes in blue water resource availability and water footprint over time in china a gradual increase in blue water resource availability of maize wheat and potato cropping was recorded in plastic mulching and non mulching over time in china during the last 10 years 2010 2019 the growth rate of blue water resource availability in maize and potato has gradually slowed down fig 6 a c wfo in maize and potato was increased between 1980 and 1999 but decreased between 2000 and 2019 fig fig 6 a c in wheat wfo was gradually decreased over the 1990 2019 fig 6 b wfe in maize wheat and potato cropping under both plastic

increased between 1980 and 2009 but decreased between 2010 and 2019 fig 7 f no differences over time in china were found in the benefits of plastic mulching on wfo in wheat fig 7 e compared to non mulching plastic mulching restrained wfo by an average of 30 6 37 2 33 1 and 32 1 in 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 for maize respectively p 0 05 fig 7 d 28 1 27 9 and 29 7 in 1990 1999

31 9 in 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 respectively p 0 05 fig 7 h in potato plastic mulching restricted wfe by 21 0 27 3 32 6 and 40 1 in 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 respectively p 0 05 fig 7 i 4 discussion 4 1 changes in yield blue water resource availability and water footprint of crops over time in china fertilizer s production and application contribute to most of the blue water resource requirement feng and zhao 2020 xu et al 2013 zhai et al 2019b with the increase of n application rates the blue water resource requirement and water footprint were significantly increased during 1980 1999 this is in agreements with the study of lu et al 2016 it is likely because the increase in crop yield during this period mainly depended on the increase of fertilizer application wang et al 2019a however blue water resource availability and water footprint have gradually reduced over the first 20 years of this century owing to the slow growth of fertilization rate and great increase in crop yield in china through optimized fertilizer application improved crop management and the use of new varieties chen et al 2014 cui et al 2018 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 this is consistent with previous research cao et al 2014 chu et al 2017 these results indicated that optimized cultivation practices and newer varieties have great potential in reducing crop water footprint 4 2 response of yield blue water resource availability and water footprint to plastic mulching plastic mulching decreases soil evaporation and increases soil water content gan et al 2013 gao et al 2019 wang et al 2020a xie et al 2020 yu et al 2018 thereby increasing energy output from economic yield by an average of 27 2 20 4 and 24 9 for potato maize and wheat compared to without plastic mulching respectively wang et al 2020a decreased n leaching in plastic mulching resulted in less blue water resource availability mo et al 2020 wang et al 2019b however without n fertilization plastic mulching did not increase blue water resource availability because the most of blue water resource availability under non n fertilization was attributed to phosphate fertilization increasing n fertilization rate increased the inhibitory effect of plastic mulching on grey water requirement thereby decreasing blue water resource availability and water footprint for wheat the decrease in blue water resource availability under plastic mulching was higher in north central china than in other regions it is likely because this region is the main wheat producing area in china where the amount of fertilization is usually higher than other regions he et al 2017 wang et al 2020a plastic mulching reduced crop s water footprint i e wfo and wfe mainly because of the decrease in blue water resource availability and the increase in crop yield however the beneficial effect of plastic film mulching on crop water footprint is mainly contributed by the decrease of n and p leaching the benefits of plastic mulching on water footprint were greatest in northwest china the driest region in china mainly because plastic mulching has greater benefits in enhancing yield in dry environments wang et al 2020a however high crop yield is often achieved by using relative high n fertilizer rate in northwest and north central of china wang et al 2018 consequently the actual water footprint was the greatest in northwest china and north central china fig s3 which is consistent with prior research han et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 in recent years with the development of economy and society the focus of crop production in china has moved northward and westward cao et al 2014 jin 2019 wu et al 2018 this is particularly in the northwest of china where the production area of forage maize jin 2019 li et al 2020 and the exports of forage and grain have been increasing cao et al 2014 han et al 2021 in order to increase farmers income intensifying the water scarcity in the northwest of china han et al 2021 song et al 2020 wu et al 2018 therefore the grain production in northwest of china is best to meet the local food demand although the beneficial effect of plastic mulching on water footprint was the greatest in northwest of china considering also the relatively high crops water footprint in this region the increase in crop yield under plastic mulching was decreased with increasing the gradient of rainfall wang et al 2020a thereby reducing the effect of plastic mulching on water footprint for maize and wheat when compared to north central china the decrease in water footprint in potato rose in the middle and lower yangtze river basins southwest china and south china this is likely because potato is grown in mid spring in north central china high temperature in summer is not conducive to potato growth and subsequently reducing the beneficial effect of plastic mulching on yield in contrast potato is grown in late autumn and winter in these regions and the increase in yield under plastic mulching was greater in environments with relatively low growth temperature thus the greatest increase in yield and economic return of potato under plastic mulching was found in these regions wang et al 2019a subsequently diluting blue water resource availability and reduced crop s water footprint as a result of the limited precipitation and serious soil erosion in the northwest china peng et al 2020 high crop yield is often achieved by using relative high n fertilizer wang et al 2018 consequently northwest china had the greatest crop water footprint than other regions increased n fertilization rate under plastic mulching generated greater increases in yield and net economic return in maize and wheat and greater decreases in blue water resource availability wang et al 2020a lowering water footprint in potato the greatest effect of plastic mulching on water footprint was found at 101 200 kg n ha 1 because the greatest increases in yield and net economic return were observed when n applying was 101 200 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2020a however although the beneficial effect of plastic mulching on blue water availability and water footprint was increased with increased n fertilization rate the actual blue water availability and water footprint were significantly increased under high n fertilization compared to low n fertilization as a result of the trade offs between yield economic benefits blue water availability and water footprint of crop production in china plastic mulching was more effective in reducing water footprint in somewhat droughty situations when n application was between 100 and 200 kg n ha 1 however plastic mulching also causes increased plastic residue gao et al 2019 the residual plastic is not easy to be decomposed if it is not fully recycled and subsequently may cause environmental pollution in addition in this study the average nitrogen leaching coefficient were used to estimate the grey water requirement which may have resulted in an overestimated value under low n input due to the lack of data on the use of herbicides and pesticides herbicides and pesticides quantities were not collected which may have resulted in an underestimated value of water footprint in addition various data sources also present some limitations in the water footprint analysis for example the data related to the machinery operation and the amount of plastic film applied for some crops were unavailable we used the average value to assess their blue water requirement finally water footprint is often affected by climate soil cropping systems and agricultural management practices these factors and their interactions make it difficult for politicians to formulate appropriate policies yu et al 2013 therefore the application of these results must fully consider the current agricultural situation and social environment pandey and agrawal 2014 5 conclusions plastic mulching reduced crops water footprint through increasing yield and generating less volumetric impact on blue water resource availability with the northwest and north central regions of china having higher water footprints than the rest of the regions in dry regions plastic mulching had a stronger effect on crop yield gain and blue water availability under moderate and high n fertilizer application rates i e 100 kg n ha 1 hence enhancing the benefits of plastic mulching on water footprint water footprint varied with crop species high energy output of potato and maize diluted the volumetric impact on blue water resource availability thereby achieving a low water footprint plastic mulching has great potential to increase crop yield and reduce water footprint in china especially in maize and potato in the semiarid

9783,excessive use of water resources is threatening agriculture other business and populations in china india and usa and crop production is expected to play a critical role in the sustainable use of water in china plastic mulching is widely employed in crop production but its impact on agricultural water footprint has not been properly described a meta analysis was performed to examine how plastic mulching influences volumetric water availability vwa global stress weighted water footprint per unit of output energy wfo and per unit of net economic return in crop production wfe data extracted from 394 published studies in maize zea mays l wheat triticum aestivum l and potato solanum tuberosum l were used in the meta analysis on crop production at the regional scale and across a range of n fertilization gradients in china plastic mulching reduced vwa by 15 3 14 1 and 16 3 in maize wheat and potato respectively when compared to non mulching practice with corresponding reductions of wfo by 33 3 28 1 and 32 1 and of wfe by 14 8 31 1 and 31 0 in maize wheat and potato respectively water footprint for crop production increased first and then decreased over the past four decades in china and was greater in northwest and north central regions of china than in other regions under moderate and high n fertilization 100 kg n ha 1 in dry regions plastic mulching increased the impact on vwa thereby reducing wfo and wfe water footprint for the production in potato and maize was lower than that in wheat the meta analysis demonstrated that plastic mulching practices reduced water footprint while lowering vwa therefore plastic mulching has potential for saving water resource when appropriate growing region and n fertilizer applications are considered

mulching affects water stress weighted water footprint in field crops i e wheat maize and potato under different growing region is still unknown it is necessary to make a detailed comparative study of crop water footprint in different regions in addition field experiments are generally conducted in a single area and thus cannot evaluate the comprehensive effect of plastic mulching on macro scale areas meta analysis provides a formal statistical method to compare and integrate the results of multiple studies to reveal underlying factors contributing to responses and make inferences on regional and global scales hedges et al 1999 however a synthesis of the response of blue water availability and water footprint of crop production under plastic mulching is still poorly understood the present meta analysis of field studies in china on crop production and water footprints under plastic mulching practices aims to determine 1 how water footprint of crop production responds to plastic mulching

geography and climatic conditions south china s southwest china sw the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlyr north central china nc northwest china nw and northeast china ne wang et al 2020a 2020b the years were divided into four decades 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 nitrogen n fertilizer rates were categorized as 100 low 100 200 medium 200 300 high 300 400 and 400 kg

footprint calculation method was used in this study ridoutt et al 2010 ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 the system boundary and methodology used in this study is outlines in fig 1 the transportation of fertilizer was set at 500 km in this study in the experiment with irrigation the consumption of electric energy is also included in the inventory of agricultural inputs he et al 2017 the volumetric impact on the blue water availability consists of blue water consumption grey water requirement and impact of land use on blue water resources since the production and consumption of green water by agriculture does not lead to the shortage of water resources green water was not included as a direct component of water footprint of crop production and thus green water usage was not considered in this study xu et al 2013 but land use can affect the amount of blue water the calculation of product water footprint based on lca included the influence of land use on blue water resources ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 direct usage of blue water refers to irrigation water the amount of each agricultural inputs was multiplied by their water consumption factors from the ike ebalance v3 0 software ike environment technology co ltd china to compute indirect usage of blue water the water consumption coefficients of different agriculture input used in this study are shown in tables s1 the impact of agricultural inputs on vwa refers to the water resources consumed in their production and transportation the impact of land use on blue water resources was calculated based on the previous studies liu et al 2017 lu et al 2016 xu et al 2013 1 lbw 0 p eff et nat 2 lbw p eff et nat p eff et nat where lbw is the influence of land use on blue water mm etnat is the total annual evapotranspiration from natural ecosystem including herbaceous vegetation and forest mm peff is the effective rainfall 5 mm rainfall data i e effective rainfall or average annual rainfall for some studies were unavailable in the peer reviewed publications and thus we sourced data from the national meteorological science data center http data cma cn data weatherbk html etnat was calculated as zhang et al 2001 3 et nat f 1 2 1410 p 1 2 1410 p p 1410 1 f 1 0 5 1100 p 1 0 5 1100 p p 1100 p where f is the fractional plant cover p is the average annual rainfall 2 and 0 5 are the plant available water coefficient for forest and grassland respectively in this study the lbw value used in this study is 0 because the calculated etnat was greater than peff 2 2 2 calculation of grey water requirement in this study the grey water requirement assessed nitrogen n and phosphorus p contamination but the effects of pesticides and other fertilizers were not covered the grey water requirement which is the freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants and expresses the degradative water use was calculated by the critical dilution volume method liu et al 2017 lu et al 2016 xu et al 2013 4 gwr n 100 l n c max n c min n 5 gwr p 100 l p c max p c min p where gwrn and gwrp are the grey water requirement derived from n and p loss in water bodies respectively ln kg n ha 1 and lp kg p ha 1 are the n and p concentrations which is calculated by multiplying the amount of n or p fertilizer application by the loss factor the average n and p loss factors were used in this study according to previous studies lu et al 2016 mo et al 2020 wang et al 2019b xu et al 2013 the n loss factor was established from a literature survey lu et al 2016 mo et al 2020 wang et al 2019b xu et al 2013 and assumed to be 10 under non plastic mulching and 7 5 under plastic mulching the p leaching factor under non mulching and plastic mulching was assumed to be 0 2 in dryland farming systems in china lu et al 2016 2 2 3 calculation of water stress index the watergap2 global hydrological and global water consumption models were used to calculate water stress index wsi in this study pfister et al 2009 ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 the model includes a hydrological and socio economic component that calculates annual freshwater availability and withdrawals for various users such as industry agriculture and households xu et al 2013 6 wsi 1 1 e 6 4 wta 1 0 01 1 where wta is the ratio of total annual freshwater withdrawals to hydrological availability and the china water resources bulletin http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb szygb provided the regional wta data 2 2 4 calculation of water footprint water footprint was calculated as 7 wf vwa y bw gw y where wf is the water footprint l kg 1 vwa is the total volumetric impact on blue water availability l ha 1 bw is the total blue water requirement gw is the total grey water requirement and y is the yield kg ha 1 the regional wf was calculated by multiplying the wf by the wsi of the given region xu et al 2013 to facilitate international comparison the global stress weighted water footprint was obtained by dividing the regional water footprint by the global average wsi 0 602 ridoutt and pfister 2010 xu et al 2013 because yield and water footprint per unit of yield of the various crops is not directly comparable adjustments for their different economic value or energy equivalent per unit of yield weight are required thus the water footprint per unit of output energy wfo and the water footprint per unit of net economic return wfe for each crop were included in this study 8 wfo vwa energy output bw gw energy output 9 wfe vwa net economic return bw gw net economic return where wfo is the water footprint per unit of output energy l h2oe mj 1 wfe is the water footprint per unit of net economic return l h2oe rmb 1 the energy output from the production was estimated through multiplying the amount of production by the energy equivalent value which in this study was 3 8 mj kg 1 for potato and 16 3 mj kg 1 for maize and wheat respectively the net economic value is computed through deducting the product s revenue from the total manufacturing cost wang et al 2020a xie et al 2020 1 rmb i e chinese yuan 0 148 u s dollar 2 3 data analysis the impact size was calculated as the natural log lnr of the response ratio r which represents the influence of plastic mulching several research papers did not provide standard deviation or standard error values under these circumstances we estimated the average coefficient of variation within each data set and then used the average coefficient of variation to calculate the standard error the meta analysis eliminated groups with less than three valid comparisons for each independent study the weighted mean log ratio in r was determined using the following equations 10 l n r i 1 k w i l n r i i 1 k w i 11 w 1 v 1 sp 2 np xp 2 sc 2 nc x c 2 where wi is the reciprocal of total variance of lnri sp and sc which are the standard deviations for all comparisons in the plastic mulching treatment and non mulching groups respectively np and nc are the sample sizes for the plastic mulching treatment and non mulching groups respectively xp is the mean of water footprint in the plastic mulching treatment and xc is the mean of water footprint in the non mulching treatment the distribution of water footprint does not follow the normal curve according to the kolmogorov smirnov test using the statistical software metawin 2 1 systat software inc san jose ca with a resampling of 9999 iterations based on the bootstrapping test a random effects model was used to assess whether plastic mulching significantly affected any dependent variable shcherbak et al 2014 the percentage change in water footprints was computed as in r 1 100 to make interpretation easier the effect of plastic mulching was judged significant if the 95 confidence interval ci for a dependent variable did not overlap zero if the 95 bootstrapping cis of the different category variables did not overlap the means of the separate categorical variables were judged substantially distinct from one another wang et al 2017 2020a a negative percentage change showed a decrease in the relevant variable with plastic mulching compared to without plastic mulching whilst a positive value indicated an increase in the corresponding variable we also quantitatively analyzed the contribution of yield increase effect and grey water reduction effect of plastic film mulching to water footprint through principal component analysis using spass software version 16 0 for windows spss chicago usa 3 results 3 1 effects of plastic mulching on the availability of blue water resources and water footprint

followed by 1 100 and 301 kg n ha 1 28 2 30 3 and without n fertilization 16 7 fig 5 e on average wfo always increased with the increase in n fertilizer rate under both plastic and non plastic mulching regardless of mulching the increase in n fertilization rate increased wfo from 11 2 to 69 1 l h2oe mj 1 under 0 300 kg n ha 1 in maize fig s4 d from 2 7 to 199 2 l h2oe mj 1 under 0 400 kg n

that the decreased grey water requirement by plastic mulching contributed to about 49 51 and 53 reduction in water footprint for maize wheat and potato respectively 3 5 changes in blue water resource availability and water footprint over time in china a gradual increase in blue water resource availability of maize wheat and potato cropping was recorded in plastic mulching and non mulching over

increased between 1980 and 2009 but decreased between 2010 and 2019 fig 7 f no differences over time in china were found in the benefits of plastic mulching on wfo in wheat fig 7 e compared to non mulching plastic mulching restrained wfo by an average of 30 6 37 2 33 1 and 32 1 in 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 for maize respectively p 0 05 fig 7 d 28 1 27 9 and 29 7 in 1990 1999

31 9 in 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 respectively p 0 05 fig 7 h in potato plastic mulching restricted wfe by 21 0 27 3 32 6 and 40 1 in 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 respectively p 0 05 fig 7 i 4 discussion 4 1 changes in yield blue water resource availability and water footprint of crops over time in china fertilizer s production and application contribute to most of the blue water resource requirement feng and zhao 2020 xu et al 2013 zhai et al 2019b with the increase of n application rates the blue water resource requirement and water footprint were significantly increased during 1980 1999 this is in agreements with the study of lu et al 2016 it is likely because the increase in crop yield during this period mainly depended on the increase of fertilizer application wang et al 2019a however blue water resource availability and water footprint have gradually reduced over the first 20 years of this century owing to the slow growth of fertilization rate and great increase in crop yield in china through optimized fertilizer application improved crop management and the use of new varieties chen et al 2014 cui et al 2018 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 this is consistent with previous research cao et al 2014 chu et al 2017 these results indicated that optimized cultivation practices and newer varieties have great potential in reducing crop water footprint 4 2 response of yield blue water resource availability and water footprint to plastic mulching plastic mulching decreases soil evaporation and increases soil water content gan et al 2013 gao et al 2019 wang et al 2020a xie et al 2020 yu et al 2018 thereby increasing energy output from economic yield by an average of 27 2 20 4 and 24 9 for potato maize and wheat compared to without plastic mulching respectively wang et al 2020a decreased n leaching in plastic mulching resulted in less blue water resource availability mo et al 2020 wang et al 2019b however without n fertilization plastic mulching did not increase blue water resource availability because the most of blue water resource availability under non n fertilization was attributed to phosphate fertilization increasing n fertilization rate increased the inhibitory effect of plastic mulching on grey water requirement thereby decreasing blue water resource availability and water footprint for wheat the decrease in blue water resource availability under plastic mulching was higher in north central china than in other regions it is likely because this region is the main wheat producing area in china where the amount of fertilization is usually higher than other regions he et al 2017 wang et al 2020a plastic mulching reduced crop s water footprint i e wfo and wfe mainly because of the decrease in blue water resource availability and the increase in crop yield however the beneficial effect of plastic film mulching on crop water footprint is mainly contributed by the decrease of n and p leaching the benefits of plastic mulching on water footprint were greatest in northwest china the driest region in china mainly because plastic mulching has greater benefits in enhancing yield in dry environments wang et al 2020a however high crop yield is often achieved by using relative high n fertilizer rate in northwest and north central of china wang et al 2018 consequently the actual water footprint was the greatest in northwest china and north central china fig s3 which is consistent with prior research han et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 in recent years with the development of economy and society the focus of crop production in china has moved northward and westward cao et al 2014 jin 2019 wu et al 2018 this is particularly in the northwest of china where the production area of forage maize jin 2019 li et al 2020 and the exports of forage and grain have been increasing cao et al 2014 han et al 2021 in order to increase farmers income intensifying the water scarcity in the northwest of china han et al 2021 song et al 2020 wu et al 2018 therefore the grain production in northwest of china is best to meet the local food demand although the beneficial effect of plastic mulching on water footprint was the greatest in northwest of china considering also the relatively high crops water footprint in this region the increase in crop yield under plastic mulching was decreased with increasing the gradient of rainfall wang et al 2020a thereby reducing the effect of plastic mulching on water footprint for maize and wheat when compared to north central china the decrease in water footprint in potato rose in the middle and lower yangtze river basins southwest china and south china this is likely because potato is grown in mid spring in north central china high temperature in summer is not conducive to potato growth and subsequently reducing the beneficial effect of plastic mulching on yield in contrast potato is grown in late autumn and winter in these regions and the increase in yield under plastic mulching was greater in environments with relatively low growth temperature thus the greatest increase in yield and economic return of potato under plastic mulching was found in these regions wang et al 2019a subsequently diluting blue water resource availability and reduced crop s water footprint as a result of the limited precipitation and serious soil erosion in the northwest china peng et al 2020 high crop yield is often achieved by using relative high n fertilizer wang et al 2018 consequently northwest china had the greatest crop water footprint than other regions increased n fertilization rate under plastic mulching generated greater increases in yield and net economic return in maize and wheat and greater decreases in blue water resource availability wang et al 2020a lowering water footprint in potato the greatest effect of plastic mulching on water footprint was found at 101 200 kg n ha 1 because the greatest increases in yield and net economic return were observed when n applying was 101 200 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2020a however although the beneficial effect of plastic mulching on blue water availability and water footprint was increased with increased n fertilization rate the actual blue water availability and water footprint were significantly increased under high n fertilization compared to low n fertilization as a result of the trade offs between yield economic benefits blue water availability and water footprint of crop production in china plastic mulching was more effective in reducing water footprint in somewhat droughty situations when n application was between 100 and 200 kg n ha 1 however plastic mulching also causes increased plastic residue gao et al 2019 the residual plastic is not easy to be decomposed if it is not fully recycled and subsequently may cause environmental pollution in addition in this study the average nitrogen leaching coefficient were used to estimate the grey water requirement which may have resulted in an overestimated value under low n input due to the lack of data on the use of herbicides and pesticides herbicides and pesticides quantities were not collected which may have resulted in an underestimated value of water footprint in addition various data sources also present some limitations in the water footprint analysis for example the data related to the machinery operation and the amount of plastic film applied for some crops were unavailable we used the average value to assess their blue water requirement finally water footprint is often affected by climate soil cropping systems and agricultural management practices these factors and their interactions make it difficult for politicians to formulate appropriate policies yu et al 2013 therefore the application of these results must fully consider the current agricultural situation and social environment pandey and agrawal 2014 5 conclusions plastic mulching reduced crops water footprint through increasing yield and generating less volumetric impact on blue water resource availability with the northwest and north central regions of china having higher water footprints than the rest of the regions in dry regions plastic mulching had a stronger effect on crop yield gain and blue water availability under moderate and high n fertilizer application rates i e 100 kg n ha 1 hence enhancing the benefits of plastic mulching on water footprint water footprint varied with crop species high energy output of potato and maize diluted the volumetric impact on blue water resource availability thereby achieving a low water footprint plastic mulching has great potential to increase crop yield and reduce water footprint in china especially in maize and potato in the semiarid

mixtures with legumes could offer a high quality alternative forage for crop cattle integrated systems including dairy producers in the southern high plains region keywords alternative forage crops forage quality soil water storage water use efficiency 1 introduction there is a growing concern over the sustainability of the agro industries in the u s high plains due to degrading soil quality and declining groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer specifically the southern high plains which covers eastern new mexico western texas and panhandles of oklahoma is characterized by a hot dry semi arid climate with average annual precipitation 520 mm yr 1 dhakal et al 2019 ghimire et al 2019 2021 and summer temperatures often exceeding 40 c agriculture in the region is heavily dependent on the ogallala aquifer for irrigation the ogallala aquifer is the largest known freshwater aquifer on the planet covering 450 660 km2 area underlying eight states in the high plains region and supplies water for agriculture and public consumptions alley et al 1999 cano et al 2018 the rapid decline in water levels in the southern end of the aquifer results from the increasing demand for high quality forage by the large numbers of beef and dairy cattle in the region cabrera and hagevoort 2006 this high demand has led to more groundwater pumping for irrigation at an unsustainable rate further exacerbating the problem of limited water availability for crop production cano et al 2018 irrigated cropping systems in the southern high plains are largely forage crop based either continuous silage corn zea mays production in areas with abundant irrigation water or corn or sorghum sorghum bicolor silage followed by winter wheat triticum aestivum in a limited water continuous cropping scenario corn silage is primarily used as high energy feed for lactating dairy cows however corn is a high resource demanding crop and is exhaustive on soil nutrients and available water high yield in corn silage requires up to 770 mm of annual water input gowda et al 2007 new and dusek 2005 moreover corn silage production removes the total biomass during harvest leaving the soil surface bare and exposed to evaporation and wind erosion alternative cropping practices that improve crop water productivity increase yield and provide alternative winter forage may sustain the corn based cropping systems to support a large forage based economy in the region for both beef and dairy production one approach to sustaining corn silage production in the southern high plains could be to integrate cover crops in the forage production system besides providing ground cover cover crops can provide several ecosystem services such as improving soil organic matter storage nutrient cycling water storage and weed suppression snapp et al 2005 kaspar and singer 2011 petrosino et al 2015 the benefits of cover crops to improve moisture and soil quality are well documented in humid climates acharya et al 2019 fageria et al 2005 however the benefits of cover crops on soil moisture availability during the corn silage growing season in arid and semi arid environments are largely unknown in crop livestock integrated systems of the southern high plains cover crops could provide a supplemental forage during winter and early spring when the forage supply is limited and improve the overall productivity of the system by providing ground cover during the main crop growth and conserving soil moisture grazing cover crops during winter or haying during spring could offer economic benefits to producers plus offset the cost of purchasing and sowing cover crop seeds despite the many benefits that cover cropping could bring to corn silage producers in the southern high plains this practice is yet to gain momentum among producers in arid and semi arid regions under non irrigated and conventionally tilled conditions crop yield following cover crop is often reported to be lower than crop rotations without cover cropping schlegel and havlin 1997 nielsen and vigil 2005 however nielsen and vigil 2005 demonstrated that these adverse effects of cover crops on soil moisture and crop yield usually occur during years with low precipitation recent studies by ghimire et al 2019 and mesbah et al 2019 with limited supplemental irrigation revealed no adverse effects of cover cropping on the yield of subsequent crops when irrigated during the main crop phase this research was conducted to understand how cover crop species mixtures would affect soil water dynamics cover crop biomass and corn silage yield and nutritive values in a semi arid irrigated corn silage production system we hypothesized that winter cover crop species mixtures would improve soil water storage and corn silage yield and forage nutritive values in subsequent corn silage production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and treatments a field experiment was conducted at new mexico state university agricultural science center at clovis 34 35 ꞌ n 103 12 ꞌ w elev 1348 m beginning september 2018 through september 2020 the study site has a semi arid climate and an olton clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic aridic paleustolls soil the average maximum and minimum air temperatures were 22 and 5 5 c in 2019 and 22 and 6 c in 2020 respectively total precipitation in 2019 was 54 4 cm 47 of which was received during the cover crop phase and the remaining 53 during the corn phase in 2020 total precipitation was 45 3 cm and 68 was received during the cover crop phase and the remaining 32 was during the corn phase table 1 the total precipitation was 20 greater and more evenly distributed in 2019 than in 2020 therefore irrigation was adjusted to meet crop water needs based on precipitation amount and distribution in each year irrigation was provided only to facilitate cover crop planting germination and establishment during the cover crop phase in 2019 total irrigation provided was 36 7 cm 18 of which was provided during the cover crop phase and 82 during the corn phase in 2020 65 3 cm of irrigation was applied with 16 in the cover crop phase and 84 during the corn phase the treatments included three winter cover crop mixtures and a fallow or no cover crop ncc established in a randomized complete block design with four replications in this study the term fallow refers to plots left with no vegetation between corn silage harvest and the next planting date i e september may of each cropping year the cover crop mixtures included grasses brassicas legumes gbl grasses brassicas gb and grasses legumes gl table 2 the grasses comprised annual ryegrass lolium multiflorum and winter triticale triticale hexaploide lart brassicas comprised turnip brassica rapa subsp rapa l and daikon radish raphanus sativus var longipinnatus l and legumes comprised austrian winter pea pisum sativum subsp arvense l and berseem clover trifolium alexandrinum l the size of individual plots was 12 m 9 m cover crops were planted on september 18 2018 and terminated on april 28 2019 for the 2019 cropping year and planted on september 23 2019 and terminated on april 22 2020 for the 2020 cropping year seeding rates varied among cover crop mixtures to get the same plant population density for each treatment table 2 the cover crops were planted using a double disc drill opener model 3p600 great plains manufacturing inc salina ks usa calibrated to place seeds at 2 cm depth and 15 cm row spacing at the end of the cover crop phase in each year the cover crops were terminated 3 4 weeks prior to corn planting using a mixture of herbicides containing roundup n phosphonomethyl glycine 48 7 a i at 3 5 l ha 1 panther sc flumioxazin 44 a i at 0 15 l ha 1 first shot

planting corn for post and pre emergence weed control corn variety p1828am was planted on may 16 2019 and harvested on september 11 2019 for the 2019 crop year in the 2020 crop year corn silage was planted on may 17 2020 and harvested on september 15 2020 corn was planted using a four row john deere maxemerge planter deere and company moline il usa calibrated for 4 cm planting depth 76 cm row spacing and a targeted plant population of 62 500 plants ha 1 fertilizer rates were based on soil test results all treatments received a single dose of 168 kg n ha 1 29 kg s ha 1 and 7 0 l ha 1 of chelated zinc 9 zn applied each year all fertilizers were sprayed as a liquid mixture and immediately followed by irrigation irrigation throughout the corn phase was provided uniformly across the entire field using a center pivot irrigation system zimmatic lindsay corporation 2 2 soil water measurements soil volumetric water content vwc was measured weekly during the corn silage phase and once every two weeks during the cover crop phase using a dielectric capacitance probe pr 2 6 soil profile probe delta t devices cambridge uk equipped with a data logger the vwc readings were adjusted for the experimental site using the calibration equation developed by dhakal et al 2019 for measuring soil water content access tubes were installed immediately after cover crops planting to a 1 m depth in the center of each plot between two adjacent cover crop rows the soil water content was monitored from october 4 2018 to september 5 2019 for the 2019 crop year and from november 1 2019 to september 3 2020 for the 2020 crop year the probe can measure soil moisture at six depth increments 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 50 60 and 90 100 cm the vwc at the 40 50 and 60 90 cm depths were estimated by averaging vwc at 30 40 and 50 60 cm and 50 60 and 90 100 cm depths respectively the soil water storage sws at each depth was determined by multiplying the vwc by the depth total sws in the 1 m profile was calculated by summing the sws of all individual depths the change in soil water storage s for each cropping phase cover crop or corn silage was determined by subtracting the sws at the end of a phase from the sws at the beginning of that phase a net negative s indicated soil water depletion and a positive s indicated soil water recharge evapotranspiration et during cover crop or corn silage productions were calculated using the water balance equation of hillel 1998 i et p i u r d s where et evapotranspiration cm p precipitation cm i irrigation cm u capillary rise cm r runoff cm d deep percolation and s change in soil water storage cm runoff was considered negligible because the field has a slope of less than 1 and there was no evidence of runoff after irrigation or precipitation the soil type at the experimental site is clay loam with a deep profile and a hard calcium carbonate b horizon capillary rise and deep percolation beyond the 1 m profile were therefore considered negligible the seasonal et was then calculated as the difference between p i and s the total et of the cover crop corn silage system ettotal was calculated as the sum of et values for cover crop and main crop phases crop water productivity cwp of the cover crop or corn silage was calculated as cover crop biomass or corn silage yield divided by the seasonal et using the formula ii cwp yield mg ha 1 et cm the system water productivity swp was calculated as the ratio of total biomass produced cover crop corn silage to ettotal for a given cropping year 2 3 cover crop biomass and corn silage yield before termination cover crops biomass samples were taken for yield and forage nutritive value determination the biomass samples were taken by cutting the aboveground biomass at the soil surface from four randomly selected 0 25 m2 sections from each plot and then combining it as one composite sample for that plot at the laboratory the fresh weight of each sample was determined the samples were then oven dried at 65 c until constant weight to determine total dry matter yield the samples were ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve using a ball mill thomas willey laboratory mill arthur h thomas company swedesboro nj usa and sent to a commercial laboratory soil and forage analysis laboratory marshfield wi usa for the analysis of selected forage nutritive value parameters the forage quality parameters measured include percent dry matter dm crude protein cp neutral detergent fiber ndf neutral detergent fiber digestibility after 48 h ndfd48 non fat carbohydrates nfc fat total digestible nutrient tdn relative forage quality rfq forage quality index kg milk mg 1 and macronutrients such as phosphorus p calcium ca potassium k and magnesium mg corn silage yield was determined by harvesting a 3 8 m2 section of each plot using a plot corn silage harvester and a custom built receiving wagon equipped with a weighing scale to determine fresh silage yield approximately 1 kg of fresh composite sample was collected from each plot placed in a paper bag and oven dried at 65 c to a constant weight to estimate the silage dry matter yields the dried corn samples were also processed to pass through a 2 mm sieve and analyzed for all forage nutritive value as the cover crop biomass 2 4 statistical analysis the data on soil vwc and sws were analyzed for each phase cover crop or main crop and soil depth using a mixed model procedure in sas v 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa cover crop biomass and corn silage yield and nutritive value parameters and cwp were analyzed separately using the mixed model procedure in sas cover crop treatment and year were considered fixed effects while replication treatment replication and replication year interactions were random effects the data were analyzed by year if a significant treatment year interaction was observed the ncc treatment was not included in the statistical analysis for cover crop biomass yield cover crop et and forage nutritive value parameters because there was no biomass produced treatment means were compared using the lsmeans statement and at a significance probability level of 0 05 using the tukey test 3 results 3 1 cover crop effect on soil volumetric water content the analysis of variance showed no effect of cover crop or year on soil vwc and sws at individual depths during the cover crop phase while a significant treatment year interaction for all depths below 10 cm table 3 cover crop treatments also had no effect on vwc and sws at individual depths during the corn phase while the year effect was significant at 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm depths respectively and treatment year interactions were significant for all depths the soil vwc indicated by different colors in the contour graph fig 1 responded differently at individual soil depths under cover crop mixtures and the ncc during different rotation phases the wet zone indicated by green to dark blue colors was mostly similar among cover crop mixtures during both rotation phases in 2019 vwc within 50 days after cover crop planting julian days 277 327 in the top 0 40 cm profile ranged between 0 10 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 among cover crop mixtures which was higher compared to vwc ranging between 0 05 and 0 10 cm3 cm 3 under ncc during the next 150 days julian days 327 477 vwc was similar among the cover crop mixtures and the ncc however greater vwc was observed under ncc than all cover crop mixtures during the last 50 days of cover cropping julian days 477 527 at lower 40 100 cm depths the average vwc was similar and greater under all cover crop mixtures than the ncc throughout the corn phase julian days 527 627 soil vwc was similar under all cover crop mixtures but greater than the ncc throughout the profile in 2020 the soil vwc within the top 0 40 cm soil profile under the cover crop mixtures ranged between 0 10 and 0 25 cm3 cm 3 which was greater than average vwc ranging between 0 05 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 under the ncc for nearly 200 days of the cover crop phase julian days 627 827 during the final 50 days of the cover crop phase julian days 827 877 vwc was greater under ncc than all cover crop mixtures among the cover crop mixtures the gb mixture had the lowest 0 05 0 20 cm3 cm 3 vwc throughout the 1 m soil profile for the entire duration of the cover crop phase whereas vwc was mostly similar between gbl and gl mixtures during the corn phase julian days 877 977 the average vwc was similar among cover crop mixtures and greater than the ncc within the 0 40 cm depth but there was no difference among treatments in the lower 40 100 cm profile 3 2 cover crops effect on soil water storage and depletion the total soil water storage sws and seasonal change in soil water storage s of the entire 1 m profile were also influenced by cover crop treatments like vwc there was no effect of cover crop or year on the sws at individual depths but treatment year interactions were significant during the cover crop phase at all depths except at the 0 10 cm depth table 3 the sws was also not affected by cover crop treatments in the main crop phase but it was significantly different between years at 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm depths and not different between years at 50 100 cm depths the combined sws in the entire 1 m profile responded similarly to the vwc at individual depths each year during cover crop and corn silage production phases fig 2 the sws for all cover crop mixtures in 2019 was initially higher than the ncc and rapidly declined between late march to mid may but remained nearly stable in the ncc the sws increased again under the cover crop treatments between may and june and remained higher than ncc until corn harvest in september after the corn silage harvest and planting of cover crops for the 2020 cropping year sws increased again in the ncc gbl and gl treatments but continued to decline in the gb the sws increased in all cover crop treatments again when irrigation started after corn silage planting in 2020 changes in sws in cover crop and corn silage phases also affected the seasonal soil water balance in the entire 1 m soil profile fig 3 in both years the net s was negative for all cover crop treatments regardless of the mixtures compared to ncc at the end of cover crop growth phases the gb mixture had the highest negative s among the cover crop treatments compared to the gbl and gl mixtures in 2019 only the ncc had a net recharge of soil water after cover crops termination in both years but to a lesser extent in 2020 than in 2019 the soil water was recharged in all cover crop treatments during the corn growth phase with the gbl mixture retaining the largest amount of water at the time of corn harvest in both years 3 3 cover crop biomass corn silage yield and water productivity cover crop biomass yield was significantly different between years but not among cover crop mixtures table 4 between years biomass yields were 27 and 36 higher in the gbl and gb mixtures in 2020 than in 2019 respectively but remained unchanged for the gl table 5 the cover crop et was different among treatments but not between years and treatment year interactions cover crop cwp was not affected by treatments and treatment year interactions but a significant effect of year was observed like biomass cover crop cwp was also improved by 27 and 36 for gbl and gb mixture in 2020 than in 2019 but it was similar between years for the gl table 5 corn silage yield differed among treatments at p 0 034 and between years at p 0 013 but no treatment year interactions were observed table 4 in 2019 corn silage yield was 18 19 higher among cover crop mixtures than the ncc table 5 in 2020 corn silage yield was 16 9 and 26 higher for the gbl gb and gl mixtures respectively than the ncc average corn silage yields between 2019 and 2020 were statistically similar but slightly higher yields of 3 3 1 3 and 5 3 mg ha 1 were observed for ncc gbl gb and gl respectively in 2020 over 2019 during the corn growth phase the et was affected by treatment and year but not by treatment interactions averaged across years et of corn silage under ncc was 104 2 cm which was significantly greater than 96 3 97 3 and 97 6 cm under the gbl gb and gl mixtures respectively table 4 the average et in all treatments in 2020 was 112 5 cm which was significantly higher than 85 1 cm in 2019 the ettotal cover crop planting to main crop harvest was also not different among treatments and treatment interactions however a significant effect of year was observed table 4 the ettotal was similar among treatments within a year but on average ettotal was 20 greater in 2020 than in 2019 table 5 the cwp of corn silage was also different among treatments at p 0 008 and between years at p 0 005 but there was no treatment interaction the swp was affected by treatment but not by year and treatment interactions on average the swp of corn silage was improved by 41 under gbl and gl and 29 under the gb cover mixtures respectively over the ncc 3 4 cover crop and corn silage nutritive value cover crop forage nutritive values such as dm and cp were affected by year but not by treatment or treatment year interactions table 4 the ndf was affected by treatment and treatment year interactions the gb mixture had 52 ndf in 2019 which was greater than 45 and 43 in the gbl and gl mixtures respectively table 5 the ndf was not different among cover crop mixtures in 2020 but it was higher for the gbl and gl in 2020 than in 2019 while it remained unchanged for the gb mixture between years the ndfd48 was not affected by cover crop mixtures year or their interactions the nfc was affected by cover crop mixtures year and their interactions and fat content was affected by year and treatment interactions table 4 the nfc was 21 and 22 in the gbl and gl mixtures respectively which were higher than 16 in the gb in 2019 but no such difference was observed among treatments in 2020 table 5 all treatments had higher p 0 05 nfc in 2020 when compared to 2019 the fat content was not different among cover crop mixtures but they all showed higher fat content in 2019 than in 2020 table 5 the cover crop species mixtures did not affect the tdn in cover crop forage but the average tdn in 2020 was 67 4 which was higher than 65 1 in 2019 the rfq was affected by cover crop mixtures and treatment year interactions but not by year table 4 the rfq of gbl and gl mixtures were 176 and 186 respectively which were significantly higher than 162 in the gb in 2019 but all mixtures showed similar rfq in 2020 table 5 although individual nutrients responded differently the index of forage quality milk kg mg 1 was not affected by treatments year or their interaction in corn silage the dm was not affected by cover crop treatment year or their interactions table 4 corn silage cp was affected by cover crop treatments with 10 15 higher cp obtained under ncc than the cover crop mixtures the ndf of corn silage was only affected by year averaged across treatments ndf was 44 in 2020 which was significantly greater than 39 in 2019 table 4 the ndfd48 did not differ with treatments year or their interactions however nfc was affected by year and treatment year interactions but not by treatments whereas fat was only affected by year the nfc was 47 in 2019 which was significantly greater than 41 in 2020 but fat content was 2 8 in 2020 which was higher than 1 9 in 2019 table 4 the ncc gbl and gl treatments had greater nfc in 2019 than in 2020 but there was no difference between years for the gb mixture table 5 cover crop treatments and year did not affect corn silage tdn but treatments year interactions were significant tdn in corn silage was similar between years for all cover crop treatments but in ncc it was 74 in 2019 significantly higher than 69 in 2020 table 5 the forage quality index of corn silage was neither affected by cover crop treatments year nor their interactions average cover crop values for p k ca and mg were higher in 2019 than 2020 table 4 but the average ca and mg values for the gbl and gl treatments were higher than the gb treatment for both 2019 and the two year average table 5 however the macronutrient content of corn silage responded differently to cover crop treatments phosphorus was not affected by treatments year or interaction but ca was affected by cover crop treatments and years in contrast k was only affected by year and mg was affected by treatment year interactions table 4 corn silage mg content was similar for cover crop treatments between years but mg content was 0 17 in 2020 which was greater than 0 13 in 2019 for the ncc table 5 4 discussion monitoring changes in soil vwc over time with cover cropping and ncc provides information on the soil water distribution in the profile during the growing season and supports farmers decision making the information on seasonal soil water dynamics and water balance are critical for arid and semi arid regions because cover cropping has been cautioned despite their contributions to soil health and resiliency bilbro 1991 blanco canqui et al 2015 usda nrcs 2015 we observed higher vwc at the top 0 40 cm profile under cover crop mixtures than ncc during the first 50 days after cover crop planting in both years probably due to soil water recharge at the surface after precipitation coupled with enhanced shading by the young cover crop plants freezing temperatures during november to mid march restricted cover crop growth hence there was no difference in vwc among cover crops and the ncc in the top 0 40 cm profile since there was a minimum ground cover for all treatments during this period water lost from the soil surface through evaporation was not different among the cover crops and the ncc within the 0 40 cm profile during this period however soil vwc at the 40 60 cm depth were similar among the cover crop treatments and higher than ncc suggesting better infiltration of winter precipitation in the deeper profile with cover cropping than under ncc warming soil temperatures during the final 50 days of the cover crop phase julian days 477 527 in 2019 and julian days 827 877 in 2020 or march late april enhanced vigorous regrowth of cover crops after the winter freeze increased evapotranspiration and resulted in reduced soil vwc under cover crops than under ncc fig 1 these results are similar to other researchers nielsen et al 2002 nielsen and vigil 2005 ghimire et al 2019 who reported reduced soil water content under cover crops than fallow at main crop planting however soil water was recovered during the corn phase of the crop rotation increased soil vwc under cover crop than ncc during the corn phase was due to cover crops residue left on the surface which reduced evaporation losses of soil moisture leading to a downward movement of water in the profile on the contrary there was no surface residue under the ncc and this may have led to increased evaporation losses of soil moisture from the surface thus leading to greater water extraction from the deeper profile by corn roots completely replacing the fallow period with cover crops in a water limited environment can deplete soil water and negatively affect crop yield nielsen and vigil 2005 however previous study at the study site showed that growing cover crops for a short time and leaving the residue on the surface after termination can conserve soil moisture during the growth of the subsequent crop ghimire et al 2019 the results of this study support the findings of ghimire et al 2019 because soil vwc in our study was lower in all the cover crop treatments at their termination in april of each year whereas vwc rapidly increased in the cover crop plots during the corn phase of the rotation and remained higher than the ncc up to harvest in addition thapa et al 2021 2022 reported higher soil biological activity soil aggregation and improved soil health with cover crops compared to no cover crop in a winter wheat sorghum fallow rotation with supplemental irrigation extraction of soil water by cover crops to support biomass production during the last 50 days of their growth reduced the available soil moisture in the 0 40 cm depth this could negatively affect corn silage establishment without adequate irrigation in the early phase of corn growth or enough precipitation in early summer however having cover crop residues could benefit irrigated cropping systems in semi arid regions by reducing surface evaporation and improving infiltration the benefits are notable because summer temperature often exceeds 40 c in the southern high plains resulting in significant water loss through evapotranspiration maintaining ground cover could reduce soil temperature by 5 6 c thapa et al 2019 thereby lowering evaporation loss increased infiltration under cover crops compared to ncc could further increase water storage the sws rapidly increased after corn silage harvest in 2019 in the ncc gbl and gl treatments but continued to decline in the gb the increase in sws in the ncc gbl and gl treatments resulted from 19 cm of rainfall in october of 2019 since the low temperatures reduced the cover crop growth rate in the fall and winter months it is likely that much of the precipitation received in these months was not used by the cover crop especially in the gbl and gl however brassicas such as turnip and daikon radish which had a higher proportion in the gb than the gbl are tolerant to cold temperatures and continue growing during winter hence they may have used available soil water depleting the sws in the gb treatment during the winter months of the 2020 crop year the effect of cover crops on s was evaluated at the beginning and end of each phase since rainfall is often insufficient in this region and the field is flat enough to prevent runoff any precipitation or irrigation that exceeds evapotranspiration was stored in the soil profile and used by the growing cover crop or main crop at the end of the cover crop phase in each year only the ncc treatment showed soil water retention or recharge fig 3 this was because of the absence of growing plants in this treatment during the cover crop phase which significantly reduced the evapotranspiration rate in the ncc especially during the last 50 days of cover crop growth however the rapid regrowth of the cover crops during this period resulted in increased evapotranspiration and soil water depletion under the cover crop treatments soil water retention in ncc treatment was much greater in 2019 than in 2020 because 2019 was a wetter year compared to 2020 table 1 however soil water retention reversed after corn silage harvest in both years because all cover crop treatments retained soil moisture while ncc could not retain moisture for a long time as soil water infiltration was slow in addition soil temperature was lower with cover crop residues on the surface than ncc slowing down the et rate under cover crops than fallow we also observed improved soil health including increased earthworm activity with cover cropping than without cover crops improved soil health and soil water conservation is often associated with higher crop production in arid and semi arid cropping systems baumhardt et al 2015 cano et al 2018 ghimire et al 2019 therefore improved soil water storage lower et and improved soil health resulted in higher corn silage yield following cover crops compared to ncc in our study the residual moisture after corn harvest supported subsequent cover crop establishment in the second year and ultimately benefited the overall cropping systems response this study shows that cover crops use a significant amount of soil water during their growth period and deplete soil moisture in the top profile which could hinder the subsequent crop germination and yield in the absence of irrigation for the main crop however increased corn yield and moisture conservation after corn harvest demonstrated improvements in system water use efficiency and water productivity therefore in agroecosystems where irrigation water is limited to irrigate cover crops but could irrigate the main crop cover cropping could substantially benefit the cropping systems through increased soil water storage during the main crop growth kristic et al 2018 reported that when there was adequate precipitation during the main crop growth phase the soil water storage was higher at corn harvest in treatments with cover crops than with no cover crops basche et al 2016 indicated that soil water content remained higher during the summer months after cover crop termination because of the mulching effect of the cover crop residue facilitating improvement in soil water holding capacity most ecosystem services from cover crops including soil organic matter input nutrient retention soil protection water conservation and overall soil health are dependent on the biomass potential of cover crops wanic et al 2019 thus cover crop management that maximizes biomass production is critical in arid and semi arid regions even more so if cover crops are grazed or harvested as forage the gbl and gl which contained legumes in the mixtures produced higher biomass averaged across both years than the gb with no legumes table 4 cover crop species such as annual ryegrass triticale turnip and daikon radish which comprise the gbl and gb mixtures are highly competitive for water and nutrients chu et al 2017 hence the lack of a suitable complementary species such as a legume to provide additional nitrogen via biological n fixation may have reduced n fertility level in soil leading to lower biomass production in the gb especially in 2019 table 5 the higher cover crop biomass in 2020 especially for the gbl and gb mixtures was likely due to 19 cm of precipitation in october of 2020 which nearly doubled the precipitation received around the same time in 2019 table 1 results of this study show potential to increase corn silage yield with cover cropping in semi arid irrigated conditions on average corn yields following winter cover crop were 9 26 greater in cover crop treatments than the ncc with the greatest yield increases obtained in the gl mixture table 4 the slight increases in corn silage yields under the gl mixture were probably due to increased soil fertility the gbl and gl had legumes in the mixtures and potentially fixed atmospheric nitrogen in their root nodules increases in corn yields following cover cropping are not consistent across all studies miguez and bollero 2005 reported an overall 21 increase in corn yield while there were also decreases in corn yield following cover crops under rain fed conditions antosh et al 2020 also reported higher corn yields under irrigated conditions following winter cover crops in semi arid new mexico however small decreases in corn yield following winter cover crop were reported by basche et al 2016 in the corn belt of the u s under non irrigated conditions in years with low precipitation in our study while water used by cover crops and corn with cover crops residue did not differ among species mixtures in both years the swp was considerably lower for ncc than the cover crop treatments due to high et in corn phase of the rotation table 4 leaving cover crop residue on the soil surface can reduce crop surface et by reducing soil surface temperature and thereby evapotranspirational loss of water from the corn field while cover crop integration in the corn silage production system is yet to gain momentum among dairy producers willingness to adopt the practice under irrigation is due to direct economic benefits of cover crops as animal feed or higher corn silage yields following cover cropping the use of winter cover crops as forage is of particular interest among dairy producers in eastern new mexico and west texas because good quality green forage is limited during winter in addition an increase in yield of subsequent corn yield further benefits dairy farmers adopting cover cropping evaluation of cover crop nutritive values showed greater nfc ca mg and rfq in the gbl and gl mixes which contain legumes making them more nutritious than the gb which had no legumes however the forage quality index of all cover crop mixtures showed that they all possess nutritive values that could meet the dietary requirement for beef or dairy cattle improved biomass yield and cover crop nutritive values of grass legume mixtures were also reported by other researchers karadag and buyukburc 2004 holman et al 2020 despite the benefits of higher forage nutritive value resulting from including legumes in cover crop mixtures holman et al 2018 suggested that the extra cost of purchasing legume seeds resulted in less direct profits for producers than growing grass only the 6 16 increase in corn silage yields obtained with the gl cover crop than the other mixtures in our study could offset the cost of purchasing the legume seeds making gl a better cover crop choice for semi arid irrigated conditions 5 conclusions the current study shows the positive effects of cover crops on corn silage yield and soil water conservation in a semi arid irrigated condition although the vwc and sws were reduced by cover crop at corn planting corn silage yield increased with previous cover crops despite all treatments receiving the same amount of water input during cover crop and corn growth changes in soil water storage s and crop water productivity showed overall better water use when the cover crops were included in the system on average corn silage yields were 9 26 higher in cover crop treatments than the fallow with mixtures containing legumes mostly higher in yield in one of the two years the gbl and gl mixtures showed higher forage nutritive values than the gb mix in the cover crop biomass therefore it is recommended that producers who intend to grow a cover crop in the southern high plains to use as winter forage should consider including legumes in the mix for better biomass production and higher forage nutritive values further research is needed to quantify how much cover crop biomass can be removed as forage via grazing or haying without negatively

mixtures with legumes could offer a high quality alternative forage for crop cattle integrated systems including dairy producers in the southern high plains region keywords alternative forage crops forage quality soil water storage water use efficiency 1 introduction there is a growing concern over the sustainability of the agro industries in the u s high plains due to degrading soil quality and declining groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer specifically the southern high plains which covers eastern new mexico western texas and panhandles of oklahoma is characterized by a hot dry semi arid climate with average annual precipitation 520 mm yr 1 dhakal et al 2019 ghimire et al 2019 2021 and summer temperatures often exceeding 40 c agriculture in the region is heavily dependent on the ogallala aquifer for irrigation the ogallala aquifer is the largest known freshwater aquifer on the planet covering 450 660 km2 area underlying eight states in the high plains region and supplies water for agriculture and public consumptions alley et al 1999 cano et al 2018 the rapid decline in water levels in the southern end of the aquifer results from the increasing demand for high quality forage by the large numbers of beef and dairy cattle in the region cabrera and hagevoort 2006 this high demand has led to more groundwater pumping for irrigation at an unsustainable rate further exacerbating the problem of limited water availability for crop production cano et al 2018 irrigated cropping systems in the southern high plains are largely forage crop based either continuous silage corn zea mays production in areas with abundant irrigation water or corn or sorghum sorghum bicolor silage followed by winter wheat triticum aestivum in a limited water continuous cropping scenario corn silage is primarily used as high energy feed for lactating dairy cows however corn is a high resource demanding crop and is exhaustive on soil nutrients and available water high yield in corn silage requires up to 770 mm of annual water input gowda et al 2007 new and dusek 2005 moreover corn silage production removes the total biomass during harvest leaving the soil surface bare and exposed to evaporation and wind erosion alternative cropping practices that improve crop water productivity increase yield and provide alternative winter forage may sustain the corn based cropping systems to support a large forage based economy in the region for both beef and dairy production one approach to sustaining corn silage production in the southern high plains could be to integrate cover crops in the forage production system besides providing ground cover cover crops can provide several ecosystem services such as improving soil organic matter storage nutrient cycling water storage and weed suppression snapp et al 2005 kaspar and singer 2011 petrosino et al 2015 the benefits of cover crops to improve moisture and soil quality are well documented in humid climates acharya et al 2019 fageria et al 2005 however the benefits of cover crops on soil moisture availability during the corn silage growing season in arid and semi arid environments are largely unknown in crop livestock integrated systems of the southern high plains cover crops could provide a supplemental forage during winter and early spring when the forage supply is limited and improve the overall productivity of the system by providing ground cover during the main crop growth and conserving soil moisture grazing cover crops during winter or haying during spring could offer economic benefits to producers plus offset the cost of purchasing and sowing cover crop seeds despite the many benefits that cover cropping could bring to corn silage producers in the southern high plains this practice is yet to gain momentum among producers in arid and semi arid regions under non irrigated and conventionally tilled conditions crop yield following cover crop is often reported to be lower than crop rotations without cover cropping schlegel and havlin 1997 nielsen and vigil 2005 however nielsen and vigil 2005 demonstrated that these adverse effects of cover crops on soil moisture and crop yield usually occur during years with low precipitation recent studies by ghimire et al 2019 and mesbah et al 2019 with limited supplemental irrigation revealed no adverse effects of cover cropping on the yield of subsequent crops when irrigated during the main crop phase this research was conducted to understand how cover crop species mixtures would affect soil water dynamics cover crop biomass and corn silage yield and nutritive values in a semi arid irrigated corn silage production system we hypothesized that winter cover crop species mixtures would improve soil water storage and corn silage yield and forage nutritive values in subsequent corn silage production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and treatments a field experiment was conducted at new mexico state university agricultural science center at clovis 34 35 ꞌ n 103 12 ꞌ w elev 1348 m beginning september 2018 through september 2020 the study site has a semi arid climate and an olton clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic aridic paleustolls soil the average maximum and minimum air temperatures were 22 and 5 5 c in 2019 and 22 and 6 c in 2020 respectively total precipitation in 2019 was 54 4 cm 47 of which was received during the cover crop phase and the remaining 53 during the corn phase in 2020 total precipitation was 45 3 cm and 68 was received during the cover crop phase and the remaining 32 was during the corn phase table 1 the total precipitation was 20 greater and more evenly distributed in 2019 than in 2020 therefore irrigation was adjusted to meet crop water needs based on precipitation amount and distribution in each year irrigation was provided only to facilitate cover crop planting germination and establishment during the cover crop phase in 2019 total irrigation provided was 36 7 cm 18 of which was provided during the cover crop phase and 82 during the corn phase in 2020 65 3 cm of irrigation was applied with 16 in the cover crop phase and 84 during the corn phase the treatments included three winter cover crop mixtures and a fallow or no cover crop ncc established in a randomized complete block design with four replications in this study the term fallow refers to plots left with no vegetation between corn silage harvest and the next planting date i e september may of each cropping year the cover crop mixtures included grasses brassicas legumes gbl grasses brassicas gb and grasses legumes gl table 2 the grasses comprised annual ryegrass lolium multiflorum and winter triticale triticale hexaploide lart brassicas comprised turnip brassica rapa subsp rapa l and daikon radish raphanus sativus var longipinnatus l and legumes comprised austrian winter pea pisum sativum subsp arvense l and berseem clover trifolium alexandrinum l the size of individual plots was 12 m 9 m cover crops were planted on september 18 2018 and terminated on april 28 2019 for the 2019 cropping year and planted on september 23 2019 and terminated on april 22 2020 for the 2020 cropping year seeding rates varied among cover crop mixtures to get the same plant population density for each treatment table 2 the cover crops were planted using a double disc drill opener model 3p600 great plains manufacturing inc salina ks usa calibrated to place seeds at 2 cm depth and 15 cm row spacing at the end of the cover crop phase in each year the cover crops were terminated 3 4 weeks prior to corn planting using a mixture of herbicides containing roundup n phosphonomethyl glycine 48 7 a i at 3 5 l ha 1 panther sc flumioxazin 44 a i at 0 15 l ha 1 first shot

planted on may 17 2020 and harvested on september 15 2020 corn was planted using a four row john deere maxemerge planter deere and company moline il usa calibrated for 4 cm planting depth 76 cm row spacing and a targeted plant population of 62 500 plants ha 1 fertilizer rates were based on soil test results all treatments received a single dose of 168 kg n ha 1 29 kg s ha 1 and 7 0 l ha 1 of chelated zinc 9 zn applied each year all fertilizers were sprayed as a liquid mixture and immediately followed by irrigation irrigation throughout the corn phase was provided uniformly across the entire field using a center pivot irrigation system zimmatic lindsay corporation 2 2 soil water measurements soil volumetric water content vwc was measured weekly during the corn silage phase and once every two weeks during the cover crop phase using a dielectric capacitance probe pr 2 6 soil profile probe delta t devices cambridge uk equipped with a data logger the vwc readings were adjusted for the experimental site using the calibration equation developed by dhakal et al 2019 for measuring soil water content access tubes were installed immediately after cover crops planting to a 1 m depth in the center of each plot between two adjacent cover crop rows the soil water content was monitored from october 4 2018 to september 5 2019 for the 2019 crop year and from november 1 2019 to september 3 2020 for the 2020 crop year the probe can measure soil moisture at six depth increments 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 50 60 and 90 100 cm the vwc at the 40 50 and 60 90 cm depths were estimated by averaging vwc at 30 40 and 50 60 cm and 50 60 and 90 100 cm depths respectively the soil water storage sws at each depth was determined by multiplying the vwc by the depth total sws in the 1 m profile was calculated by summing the sws of all individual depths the change in soil water storage s for each cropping phase cover crop or corn silage was determined by subtracting the sws at the end of a phase from the sws at the beginning of that phase a net negative s indicated soil water depletion and a positive s indicated soil water recharge evapotranspiration et during cover crop or corn silage productions were calculated using the water balance equation of hillel 1998 i et p i u r d s where et evapotranspiration cm p precipitation cm i irrigation cm u capillary rise cm r runoff cm d deep percolation and s change in soil water storage cm runoff was considered negligible because the field has a slope of less than 1 and there was no evidence of runoff after irrigation or precipitation the soil type at the experimental site is clay loam with a deep profile and a hard calcium carbonate b horizon capillary rise and deep percolation beyond the 1 m profile were therefore considered negligible the seasonal et was then calculated as the difference between p i and s the total et of the cover crop corn silage system ettotal was calculated as the sum of et values for cover crop and main crop phases crop water productivity cwp of the cover crop or corn silage was calculated as cover crop biomass or corn silage yield divided by the seasonal et using the formula ii cwp yield mg ha 1 et cm the system water productivity swp was calculated as the ratio of total biomass produced cover crop corn silage to ettotal for a given cropping year 2 3 cover crop biomass and corn silage yield before termination cover crops biomass samples were taken for yield and forage nutritive value determination the biomass samples were taken by cutting the aboveground biomass at the soil surface from four randomly selected 0 25 m2 sections from each plot and then combining it as one composite sample for that plot at the laboratory the fresh weight of each sample was determined the samples were then oven dried at 65 c until constant weight to determine total dry matter yield the samples were ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve using a ball mill thomas willey laboratory mill arthur h thomas company swedesboro nj usa and sent to a commercial laboratory soil and forage analysis laboratory marshfield wi usa for the analysis of selected forage nutritive value parameters the forage quality parameters measured include percent dry matter dm crude protein cp neutral detergent fiber ndf neutral detergent fiber digestibility after 48 h ndfd48 non fat carbohydrates nfc fat total digestible nutrient tdn relative forage quality rfq forage quality index kg milk mg 1 and macronutrients such as phosphorus p calcium ca potassium k and magnesium mg corn silage yield was determined by harvesting a 3 8 m2 section of each plot using a plot corn silage harvester and a custom built receiving wagon equipped with a weighing scale to determine fresh silage yield approximately 1 kg of fresh composite sample was collected from each plot placed in a paper bag and oven dried at 65 c to a constant weight to estimate the silage dry matter yields the dried corn samples were also processed to pass through a 2 mm sieve and analyzed for all forage nutritive value as the cover crop biomass 2 4 statistical analysis the data on soil vwc and sws were analyzed for each phase cover crop or main crop and soil depth using a mixed model procedure in sas v 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa cover crop biomass and corn silage yield and nutritive value parameters and cwp were analyzed separately using the mixed model procedure in sas cover crop treatment and year were considered fixed effects while replication treatment replication and replication year interactions were random effects the data were analyzed by year if a significant treatment year interaction was observed the ncc treatment was not included in the statistical analysis for cover crop biomass yield cover crop et and forage nutritive value parameters because there was no biomass produced treatment means were compared using the lsmeans statement and at a significance probability level of 0 05 using the tukey test 3 results 3 1 cover crop effect on soil volumetric water content the analysis of variance showed no effect of cover crop or year on soil vwc and sws at individual depths during the cover crop phase while a significant treatment year interaction for all depths below 10 cm table 3 cover crop treatments also had no effect on vwc and sws at individual depths during the corn phase while the year effect was significant at 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm depths respectively and treatment year interactions were significant for all depths the soil vwc indicated by different colors in the contour graph fig 1 responded differently at individual soil depths under cover crop mixtures and the ncc during different rotation phases the wet zone indicated by green to dark blue colors was mostly similar among cover crop mixtures during both rotation phases in 2019 vwc within 50 days after cover crop planting julian days 277 327 in the top 0 40 cm profile ranged between 0 10 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 among cover crop mixtures which was higher compared to vwc ranging between 0 05 and 0 10 cm3 cm 3 under ncc during the next 150 days julian days 327 477 vwc was similar among the cover crop mixtures and the ncc however greater vwc was observed under ncc than all cover crop mixtures during the last 50 days of cover cropping julian days 477 527 at lower 40 100 cm depths the average vwc was similar and greater under all cover crop mixtures than the ncc throughout the corn phase julian days 527 627 soil vwc was similar under all cover crop mixtures but greater than the ncc throughout the profile in 2020 the soil vwc within the top 0 40 cm soil profile under the cover crop mixtures ranged between 0 10 and 0 25 cm3 cm 3 which was greater than average vwc ranging between 0 05 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 under the ncc for nearly 200 days of the cover crop phase julian days 627 827 during the final 50 days of the cover crop phase julian days 827 877 vwc was greater under ncc than all cover crop mixtures among the cover crop mixtures the gb mixture had the lowest 0 05 0 20 cm3 cm 3 vwc throughout the 1 m soil profile for the entire duration of the cover crop phase whereas vwc was mostly similar between gbl and gl mixtures during the corn phase julian days 877 977 the average vwc was similar among cover crop mixtures and greater than the ncc within the 0 40 cm depth but there was no difference among treatments in the lower 40 100 cm profile 3 2 cover crops effect on soil water storage and depletion the total soil water storage sws and seasonal change in soil water storage s of the entire 1 m profile were also influenced by cover crop treatments like vwc there was no effect of cover crop or year on the sws at individual depths but treatment year interactions were significant during the cover crop phase at all depths except at the 0 10 cm depth table 3 the sws was also not affected by cover crop treatments in the main crop phase but it was significantly different between years at 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm depths and not different between years at 50 100 cm depths the combined sws in the entire 1 m profile responded similarly to the vwc at individual depths each year during cover crop and corn silage production phases fig 2 the sws for all cover crop mixtures in 2019 was initially higher than the ncc and rapidly declined between late march to mid may but remained nearly stable in the ncc the sws increased again under the cover crop treatments between may and june and remained higher than ncc until corn harvest in september after the corn silage harvest and planting of cover crops for the 2020 cropping year sws increased again in the ncc gbl and gl treatments but continued to decline in the gb the sws increased in all cover crop treatments again when irrigation started after corn silage planting in 2020 changes in sws in cover crop and corn silage phases also affected the seasonal soil water balance in the entire 1 m soil profile fig 3 in both years the net s was negative for all cover crop treatments regardless of the mixtures compared to ncc at the end of cover crop growth phases the gb mixture had the highest negative s among the cover crop treatments compared to the gbl and gl mixtures in 2019 only the ncc had a net recharge of soil water after cover crops termination in both years but to a lesser extent in 2020 than in 2019 the soil water was recharged in all cover crop treatments during the corn growth phase with the gbl mixture retaining the largest amount of water at the time of corn harvest in both years 3 3 cover crop biomass corn silage yield and water productivity cover crop biomass yield was significantly different between years but not among cover crop mixtures table 4 between years biomass yields were 27 and 36 higher in the gbl and gb mixtures in 2020 than in 2019 respectively but remained unchanged for the gl table 5 the cover crop et was different among treatments but not between years and treatment year interactions cover crop cwp was not affected by treatments and treatment year interactions but a significant effect of year was observed like biomass cover crop cwp was also improved by 27 and 36 for gbl and gb mixture in 2020 than in 2019 but it was similar between years for the gl table 5 corn silage yield differed among treatments at p 0 034 and between years at p 0 013 but no treatment year interactions were observed table 4 in 2019 corn silage yield was 18 19 higher among cover crop mixtures than the ncc table 5 in 2020 corn silage yield was 16 9 and 26 higher for the gbl gb and gl mixtures respectively than the ncc average corn silage yields between 2019 and 2020 were statistically similar but slightly higher yields of 3 3 1 3 and 5 3 mg ha 1 were observed for ncc gbl gb and gl respectively in 2020 over 2019 during the corn growth phase the et was affected by treatment and year but not by treatment interactions averaged across years et of corn silage under ncc was 104 2 cm which was significantly greater than 96 3 97 3 and 97 6 cm under the gbl gb and gl mixtures respectively table 4 the average et in all treatments in 2020 was 112 5 cm which was significantly higher than 85 1 cm in 2019 the ettotal cover crop planting to main crop harvest was also not different among treatments and treatment interactions however a significant effect of year was observed table 4 the ettotal was similar among treatments within a year but on average ettotal was 20 greater in 2020 than in 2019 table 5 the cwp of corn silage was also different among treatments at p 0 008 and between years at p 0 005 but there was no treatment interaction the swp was affected by treatment but not by year and treatment interactions on average the swp of corn silage was improved by 41 under gbl and gl and 29 under the gb cover mixtures respectively over the ncc 3 4 cover crop and corn silage nutritive value cover crop forage nutritive values such as dm and cp were affected by year but not by treatment or treatment year interactions table 4 the ndf was affected by treatment and treatment year interactions the gb mixture had 52 ndf in 2019 which was greater than 45 and 43 in the gbl and gl mixtures respectively table 5 the ndf was not different among cover crop mixtures in 2020 but it was higher for the gbl and gl in 2020 than in 2019 while it remained unchanged for the gb mixture between years the ndfd48 was not affected by cover crop mixtures year or their interactions the nfc was affected by cover crop mixtures year and their interactions and fat content was affected by year and treatment interactions table 4 the nfc was 21 and 22 in the gbl and gl mixtures respectively which were higher than 16 in the gb in 2019 but no such difference was observed among treatments in 2020 table 5 all treatments had higher p 0 05 nfc in 2020 when compared to 2019 the fat content was not different among cover crop mixtures but they all showed higher fat content in 2019 than in 2020 table 5 the cover crop species mixtures did not affect the tdn in cover crop forage but the average tdn in 2020 was 67 4 which was higher than 65 1 in 2019 the rfq was affected by cover crop mixtures and treatment year interactions but not by year table 4 the rfq of gbl and gl mixtures were 176 and 186 respectively which were significantly higher than 162 in the gb in 2019 but all mixtures showed similar rfq in 2020 table 5 although individual nutrients responded differently the index of forage quality milk kg mg 1 was not affected by treatments year or their interaction in corn silage the dm was not affected by cover crop treatment year or their interactions table 4 corn silage cp was affected by cover crop treatments with 10 15 higher cp obtained under ncc than the cover crop mixtures the ndf of corn silage was only affected by year averaged across treatments ndf was 44 in 2020 which was significantly greater than 39 in 2019 table 4 the ndfd48 did not differ with treatments year or their interactions however nfc was affected by year and treatment year interactions but not by treatments whereas fat was only affected by year the nfc was 47 in 2019 which was significantly greater than 41 in 2020 but fat content was 2 8 in 2020 which was higher than 1 9 in 2019 table 4 the ncc gbl and gl treatments had greater nfc in 2019 than in 2020 but there was no difference between years for the gb mixture table 5 cover crop treatments and year did not affect corn silage tdn but treatments year interactions were significant tdn in corn silage was similar between years for all cover crop treatments but in ncc it was 74 in 2019 significantly higher than 69 in 2020 table 5 the forage quality index of corn silage was neither affected by cover crop treatments year nor their interactions average cover crop values for p k ca and mg were higher in 2019 than 2020 table 4 but the average ca and mg values for the gbl and gl treatments were higher than the gb treatment for both 2019 and the two year average table 5 however the macronutrient content of corn silage responded differently to cover crop treatments phosphorus was not affected by treatments year or interaction but ca was affected by cover crop treatments and years in contrast k was only affected by year and mg was affected by treatment year interactions table 4 corn silage mg content was similar for cover crop treatments between years but mg content was 0 17 in 2020 which was greater than 0 13 in 2019 for the ncc table 5 4 discussion monitoring changes in soil vwc over time with cover cropping and ncc provides information on the soil water distribution in the profile during the growing season and supports farmers decision making the information on seasonal soil water dynamics and water balance are critical for arid and semi arid regions because cover cropping has been cautioned despite their contributions to soil health and resiliency bilbro 1991 blanco canqui et al 2015 usda nrcs 2015 we observed higher vwc at the top 0 40 cm profile under cover crop mixtures than ncc during the first 50 days after cover crop planting in both years probably due to soil water recharge at the surface after precipitation coupled with enhanced shading by the young cover crop plants freezing temperatures during november to mid march restricted cover crop growth hence there was no difference in vwc among cover crops and the ncc in the top 0 40 cm profile since there was a minimum ground cover for all treatments during this period water lost from the soil surface through evaporation was not different among the cover crops and the ncc within the 0 40 cm profile during this period however soil vwc at the 40 60 cm depth were similar among the cover crop treatments and higher than ncc suggesting better infiltration of winter precipitation in the deeper profile with cover cropping than under ncc warming soil temperatures during the final 50 days of the cover crop phase julian days 477 527 in 2019 and julian days 827 877 in 2020 or march late april enhanced vigorous regrowth of cover crops after the winter freeze increased evapotranspiration and resulted in reduced soil vwc under cover crops than under ncc fig 1 these results are similar to other researchers nielsen et al 2002 nielsen and vigil 2005 ghimire et al 2019 who reported reduced soil water content under cover crops than fallow at main crop planting however soil water was recovered during the corn phase of the crop rotation increased soil vwc under cover crop than ncc during the corn phase was due to cover crops residue left on the surface which reduced evaporation losses of soil moisture leading to a downward movement of water in the profile on the contrary there was no surface residue under the ncc and this may have led to increased evaporation losses of soil moisture from the surface thus leading to greater water extraction from the deeper profile by corn roots completely replacing the fallow period with cover crops in a water limited environment can deplete soil water and negatively affect crop yield nielsen and vigil 2005 however previous study at the study site showed that growing cover crops for a short time and leaving the residue on the surface after termination can conserve soil moisture during the growth of the subsequent crop ghimire et al 2019 the results of this study support the findings of ghimire et al 2019 because soil vwc in our study was lower in all the cover crop treatments at their termination in april of each year whereas vwc rapidly increased in the cover crop plots during the corn phase of the rotation and remained higher than the ncc up to harvest in addition thapa et al 2021 2022 reported higher soil biological activity soil aggregation and improved soil health with cover crops compared to no cover crop in a winter wheat sorghum fallow rotation with supplemental irrigation extraction of soil water by cover crops to support biomass production during the last 50 days of their growth reduced the available soil moisture in the 0 40 cm depth this could negatively affect corn silage establishment without adequate irrigation in the early phase of corn growth or enough precipitation in early summer however having cover crop residues could benefit irrigated cropping systems in semi arid regions by reducing surface evaporation and improving infiltration the benefits are notable because summer temperature often exceeds 40 c in the southern high plains resulting in significant water loss through evapotranspiration maintaining ground cover could reduce soil temperature by 5 6 c thapa et al 2019 thereby lowering evaporation loss increased infiltration under cover crops compared to ncc could further increase water storage the sws rapidly increased after corn silage harvest in 2019 in the ncc gbl and gl treatments but continued to decline in the gb the increase in sws in the ncc gbl and gl treatments resulted from 19 cm of rainfall in october of 2019 since the low temperatures reduced the cover crop growth rate in the fall and winter months it is likely that much of the precipitation received in these months was not used by the cover crop especially in the gbl and gl however brassicas such as turnip and daikon radish which had a higher proportion in the gb than the gbl are tolerant to cold temperatures and continue growing during winter hence they may have used available soil water depleting the sws in the gb treatment during the winter months of the 2020 crop year the effect of cover crops on s was evaluated at the beginning and end of each phase since rainfall is often insufficient in this region and the field is flat enough to prevent runoff any precipitation or irrigation that exceeds evapotranspiration was stored in the soil profile and used by the growing cover crop or main crop at the end of the cover crop phase in each year only the ncc treatment showed soil water retention or recharge fig 3 this was because of the absence of growing plants in this treatment during the cover crop phase which significantly reduced the evapotranspiration rate in the ncc especially during the last 50 days of cover crop growth however the rapid regrowth of the cover crops during this period resulted in increased evapotranspiration and soil water depletion under the cover crop treatments soil water retention in ncc treatment was much greater in 2019 than in 2020 because 2019 was a wetter year compared to 2020 table 1 however soil water retention reversed after corn silage harvest in both years because all cover crop treatments retained soil moisture while ncc could not retain moisture for a long time as soil water infiltration was slow in addition soil temperature was lower with cover crop residues on the surface than ncc slowing down the et rate under cover crops than fallow we also observed improved soil health including increased earthworm activity with cover cropping than without cover crops improved soil health and soil water conservation is often associated with higher crop production in arid and semi arid cropping systems baumhardt et al 2015 cano et al 2018 ghimire et al 2019 therefore improved soil water storage lower et and improved soil health resulted in higher corn silage yield following cover crops compared to ncc in our study the residual moisture after corn harvest supported subsequent cover crop establishment in the second year and ultimately benefited the overall cropping systems response this study shows that cover crops use a significant amount of soil water during their growth period and deplete soil moisture in the top profile which could hinder the subsequent crop germination and yield in the absence of irrigation for the main crop however increased corn yield and moisture conservation after corn harvest demonstrated improvements in system water use efficiency and water productivity therefore in agroecosystems where irrigation water is limited to irrigate cover crops but could irrigate the main crop cover cropping could substantially benefit the cropping systems through increased soil water storage during the main crop growth kristic et al 2018 reported that when there was adequate precipitation during the main crop growth phase the soil water storage was higher at corn harvest in treatments with cover crops than with no cover crops basche et al 2016 indicated that soil water content remained higher during the summer months after cover crop termination because of the mulching effect of the cover crop residue facilitating improvement in soil water holding capacity most ecosystem services from cover crops including soil organic matter input nutrient retention soil protection water conservation and overall soil health are dependent on the biomass potential of cover crops wanic et al 2019 thus cover crop management that maximizes biomass production is critical in arid and semi arid regions even more so if cover crops are grazed or harvested as forage the gbl and gl which contained legumes in the mixtures produced higher biomass averaged across both years than the gb with no legumes table 4 cover crop species such as annual ryegrass triticale turnip and daikon radish which comprise the gbl and gb mixtures are highly competitive for water and nutrients chu et al 2017 hence the lack of a suitable complementary species such as a legume to provide additional nitrogen via biological n fixation may have reduced n fertility level in soil leading to lower biomass production in the gb especially in 2019 table 5 the higher cover crop biomass in 2020 especially for the gbl and gb mixtures was likely due to 19 cm of precipitation in october of 2020 which nearly doubled the precipitation received around the same time in 2019 table 1 results of this study show potential to increase corn silage yield with cover cropping in semi arid irrigated conditions on average corn yields following winter cover crop were 9 26 greater in cover crop treatments than the ncc with the greatest yield increases obtained in the gl mixture table 4 the slight increases in corn silage yields under the gl mixture were probably due to increased soil fertility the gbl and gl had legumes in the mixtures and potentially fixed atmospheric nitrogen in their root nodules increases in corn yields following cover cropping are not consistent across all studies miguez and bollero 2005 reported an overall 21 increase in corn yield while there were also decreases in corn yield following cover crops under rain fed conditions antosh et al 2020 also reported higher corn yields under irrigated conditions following winter cover crops in semi arid new mexico however small decreases in corn yield following winter cover crop were reported by basche et al 2016 in the corn belt of the u s under non irrigated conditions in years with low precipitation in our study while water used by cover crops and corn with cover crops residue did not differ among species mixtures in both years the swp was considerably lower for ncc than the cover crop treatments due to high et in corn phase of the rotation table 4 leaving cover crop residue on the soil surface can reduce crop surface et by reducing soil surface temperature and thereby evapotranspirational loss of water from the corn field while cover crop integration in the corn silage production system is yet to gain momentum among dairy producers willingness to adopt the practice under irrigation is due to direct economic benefits of cover crops as animal feed or higher corn silage yields following cover cropping the use of winter cover crops as forage is of particular interest among dairy producers in eastern new mexico and west texas because good quality green forage is limited during winter in addition an increase in yield of subsequent corn yield further benefits dairy farmers adopting cover cropping evaluation of cover crop nutritive values showed greater nfc ca mg and rfq in the gbl and gl mixes which contain legumes making them more nutritious than the gb which had no legumes however the forage quality index of all cover crop mixtures showed that they all possess nutritive values that could meet the dietary requirement for beef or dairy cattle improved biomass yield and cover crop nutritive values of grass legume mixtures were also reported by other researchers karadag and buyukburc 2004 holman et al 2020 despite the benefits of higher forage nutritive value resulting from including legumes in cover crop mixtures holman et al 2018 suggested that the extra cost of purchasing legume seeds resulted in less direct profits for producers than growing grass only the 6 16 increase in corn silage yields obtained with the gl cover crop than the other mixtures in our study could offset the cost of purchasing the legume seeds making gl a better cover crop choice for semi arid irrigated conditions 5 conclusions the current study shows the positive effects of cover crops on corn silage yield and soil water conservation in a semi arid irrigated condition although the vwc and sws were reduced by cover crop at corn planting corn silage yield increased with previous cover crops despite all treatments receiving the same amount of water input during cover crop and corn growth changes in soil water storage s and crop water productivity showed overall better water use when the cover crops were included in the system on average corn silage yields were 9 26 higher in cover crop treatments than the fallow with mixtures containing legumes mostly higher in yield in one of the two years the gbl and gl mixtures showed higher forage nutritive values than the gb mix in the cover crop biomass therefore it is recommended that producers who intend to grow a cover crop in the southern high plains to use as winter forage should consider including legumes in the mix for better biomass production and higher forage nutritive values further research is needed to quantify how much cover crop biomass can be removed as forage via grazing or haying without negatively
