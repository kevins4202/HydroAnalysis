8635,this paper assesses the wtp and wta for improvements and deteriorations respectively in irrigation water supply reliability the assessment relies on a double sided discrete choice experiment valuation using latent class modeling accounting for preference and scale heterogeneity this valuation approach is empirically implemented using a case study of a spanish irrigated district significantly impacted by climate change the results obtained show individual specific preference heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity primarily driven by the different impacts of water reliability on farmers utility changes in business revenues and costs uncertainty in business performance and farm income effects and interindividual differences in loss aversion different degrees of endowment effect additionally the significant scale heterogeneity and ordering effects found suggest that it may be advisable to use modeling approaches that account for them several policy relevant implications can be drawn including the non neutrality of the initial allocation of property rights repercussions on the cost benefit of climate change adaptation measures and the need to account for irrigators preference heterogeneity in order to design successful market based instruments keywords water supply guarantee water policy climate change loss aversion choice experiment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most recent projections for mediterranean semi arid regions indicate a progressive rise in the average temperature a decrease in precipitation and an increase in the frequency and length of extreme drought events 1 these changes in climate parameters are already being felt by farmers prompting them to implement several adaptive strategies 2 as the main water users in these regions irrigators are deeply concerned since climate change is already causing an increase in irrigation water needs higher crop evapotranspiration rates due to rising temperatures and a reduction in water availability both structurally shortages in average rainfall and water inflows feeding irrigation systems and cyclically more frequent and acute drought episodes 3 the combination of these two circumstances adversely affects irrigation water supply reliability seriously jeopardizing the economic sustainability of the irrigators farms lower more volatile income because of smaller more uncertain crop yields in order to deal with this situation two different policy approaches can be considered to maintain or improve irrigation water supply reliability the first approach known as supply side water policy is focused on increasing water availability by building new reservoirs and other water infrastructure this approach was traditionally implemented during the 20th century 4 however it is no longer an option in more developed regions since new increases in water availability are technically and environmentally infeasible or economically unaffordable 5 in these cases the only possible approach is demand side policy which optimizes the management of currently available water resources by improving water use efficiency and reducing the irrigators exposure to water availability risk this type of policy instrument includes the modernization of irrigation systems water pricing water markets and water banks 6 to efficiently design demand side water management instruments information is needed on water users welfare change associated with improvements in water supply reliability i e for those benefiting from the implementation of policy instruments and deteriorations i e for those whose supply reliability is reduced however there is scarce literature in this field regarding irrigated agriculture to the authors knowledge rigby et al 7 mesa jurado et al 8 bell et al 9 alcón et al 10 and guerrero baena et al 11 represent the few studies that assess irrigation water supply reliability all these studies measure irrigators welfare change in terms of willingness to pay wtp for improvements in water supply reliability in line with official recommendations from the noaa panel on contingent valuation which state that benefit cost analyses should be based on wtp 12 however more recent literature suggests that the use of wtp measures for the valuation of deteriorations in water supply reliability i e damages may underestimate the economic value of welfare changes thus leading to suboptimal policy design 13 14 all this evidence calls for the use of wta formats rather than wtp to estimate the welfare changes associated with the progressive deterioration of water supply reliability due to either climate change in a no policy scenario or the implementation of demand side instruments nevertheless such a valuation approach has yet to be implemented and no reliable value estimation of declines in reliability is available in the existing literature within this framework the paper s primary objective is to analyze the disparity between the wtp for improved irrigation water supply reliability and the wta for compensation for deterioration in water supply reliability while a large body of literature provides empirical evidence of the wta wtp disparity 15 16 including a substantial number of papers focusing on ordinary private goods and environmental public goods no study has previously estimated such a disparity focusing on a singular good such as irrigation water a common pool resource which is used as a business input such a double sided valuation will allow us to provide new insights into the disparity between wtp and wta and the heterogeneity of said disparity opening up a discussion on the reasons behind this gap and drawing relevant policy implications for implementing demand side approaches for this purpose this paper relies on an economic experiment with farmers in an irrigated area in the guadalquivir river basin southern spain that is suffering a severe deterioration in water supply reliability because of climate change and increasing demand for water for other economic and environmental uses more stringent requirements for ecological streamflows 17 a choice experiment ce application is employed to assess wtp and wta for improvements and deteriorations in irrigation water supply reliability respectively for a representative sample of irrigators additionally a latent class modeling approach accounting for preference and scale heterogeneity is used for the first time with farmers 2 the wta wtp disparity regarding irrigation water supply reliability the disparity between wta and wtp is one of the most extensively documented phenomena in the literature dealing with economic valuation with many empirical studies reporting evidence that wta values tend to be substantially higher than wtp values in their reviews of the literature horowitz and mcconnell 18 find substantial heterogeneity among case studies in terms of the wta wtp ratio and a mean wta wtp ratio of approximately 7 in a more recent meta analysis tunçel and hammitt 16 report a mean value above 3 although the disparity between wta and wtp related to irrigation water supply reliability has not been studied yet there are a few studies showing a significant wta wtp gap regarding other water services del saz salazar et al 19 focused on improvements in water quality of a river lanz et al 20 and macdonald et al 21 studied the quality of the services provided by urban water supply companies giannoccaro et al 22 analyzed farmers willingness to buy and to sell water through a seasonal market and koetse and brouwer 14 valued changes in flood control all this suggests that there may also be a disparity in wta and wtp values for irrigation water supply reliability considering neoclassical economic theory hicksian welfare theory kim et al 13 suggest various theoretical justifications for differences or asymmetries between wta and wtp income effect substitution effect profit seeking behavior and transaction costs indeed these are plausible reasons for the wta wtp disparity in valuation contexts focusing on irrigation water supply reliability however there is a broad consensus that the degree of wta wtp asymmetry observed in empirical studies cannot be reasonably explained purely by the traditional economic reasons pointed out above and that individuals psychological and behavioral patterns also play a relevant role 18 knetsch 23 was the first to explain the asymmetry of wta wtp as evidence of the endowment effect a manifestation of loss aversion 24 which refers to the notion that people value losses higher than gains that is they usually require more compensation wta to give up a good that they already possess than they would pay to obtain another similar one wtp this intuition was confirmed by kahneman et al 25 who interpreted knetsch s results as support for prospect theory this interpretation has been expanded in a large and growing literature 14 since loss aversion has already been demonstrated among farmers worldwide e g 26 27 it may influence the wta wtp disparity in a valuation exercise focusing on irrigation water reliability finally it has also been suggested that the wta wtp gap could be an artifact caused by inaccurate elicitation techniques and poor experimental designs in this respect the literature identifies two main reasons related to hypothetical bias and other features of the valuation context different framing for wtp and wta time issues sequence bias policy program definition etc 16 28 29 however though hypothetical and other biases may be relevant when analyzing farmers preferences toward policy options 30 a careful experimental design aimed at enhancing survey consequentiality e g by collaborating with management agencies and institutions and informing participants about how results will support their decision making and minimizing hypothetical bias e g using cheap talk 31 32 can largely preclude significant biases related to the elicitation techniques 3 case study the santaella irrigators community 3 1 santaella irrigators community since the water act of 1985 entered into force all water resources in spain have been officially declared public property governed by public basin agencies this legislation also stipulates that any private use e g irrigation has to be approved by the state through legal authorizations when these water rights are granted users are allocated a maximum annual amount of water water concession for uses defined explicitly in the associated legal document however the amount of water actually provided each year water allotments can be lower than water concessions since the spanish public basin agencies have the legal capacity to enforce restrictions depending on the level of water stored in reservoirs the santaella irrigators community ic located in the guadalquivir river basin grb in southern spain has been selected as a case study this ic is a large irrigation district 15 500 ha using surface water resources delivered by the grb agency like many other ics in the basin santaella ic was established at the end of the 20th century but currently operates with modern efficient irrigation technologies most commonly sprinkler and drip irrigation systems 33 the main crops are olive cotton wheat vegetables mainly garlic and onion and sunflower the water fees paid by irrigators are calculated based on fixed costs primarily covering depreciation and maintenance of infrastructures as well as personnel requirements and variable costs mainly covering energy consumed for pumping in the provision of water services irrigators are charged separately for these costs through a two part bill including one component based on the criterion of area a charge for fixed costs of approximately 150 ha year on average and one volumetric component a charge for variable costs of 0 04 m3 year on average like most of the ics in the grb santaella ic typically receives water allotments lower than the legal concession of 5000 m3 ha year to which it is entitled indeed the average water use in the last 20 irrigation seasons has been 2572 m3 ha year 51 of the water concession confirming that water supply reliability is relatively low water allotment can be considered a stochastic variable with its own probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf data on santaella ic s yearly water allotments of the past 20 years fit several possible distribution functions with the normal distribution function turning out to be one of the most accurate for representing the variability in water supply 11 fig 1 shows the normal pdf and cdf for these data displaying the two parameters that characterize the pdf i e parameters μ mean and σ 2 variance this normal pdf represents the reference for the two valuation exercises performed i e ce wtp and ce wta as it is already well known by all the irrigators operating in the santaella ic 3 2 setting the valuation scenarios three scenarios of better water supply reliability were proposed scenarios b1 b2 and b3 representing reductions in the annual gap or difference between concession and allotment of 25 50 and 75 respectively furthermore two scenarios of worse water supply reliability were also proposed scenarios w1 and w2 representing increases in the annual concession allotment gap of 25 and 50 respectively based on these scenarios modified yearly water allotments were calculated for each case in the santaella ic for the last 20 irrigation seasons these modified series of yearly water allotments were used to fit five distribution functions describing the variability in water allotments under each scenario all these fits were consistent with normal distribution functions as confirmed by the a d statistical test the resulting pdfs and cdfs allowed us to focus our analysis on irrigators wtp for better water supply reliability distribution functions describing scenarios b1 b2 and b3 and wta for worse water supply reliability distribution functions describing scenarios w1 and w2 fig 2 shows the resulting cdfs for the five scenarios considered while table 1 shows μ and σ 2 parameters of the normal distribution functions fitted for each scenario with 5th 25th and 50th percentiles also provided 4 methodological approach 4 1 choice experiment approach the ce method is a stated preference valuation technique based on the lancasterian consumer theory of utility maximization with the econometric basis of the approach underpinned by random utility theory hensher et al 34 provide a comprehensive theoretical and practical explanation of the ce method the widespread use of ce both in general 31 32 and in particular with irrigators 7 9 10 indicates its suitability for analyzing irrigators utility changes for variations in water supply reliability two consecutive ce exercises were administered to each interviewee one focused on wtp for better water supply reliability ce wtp and the other on wta for worse water supply reliability ce wta both exercises used the same attributes two non monetary attributes related to the normal pdf describing water supply reliability μ and σ 2 parameters and one monetary attribute the definition of the non monetary attributes relied on a mean variance approach as justified in guerrero baena et al 11 representing possible changes in the pdf for water supply reliability in the irrigated area for this purpose the attribute levels considered were linked to the changes relating to the abovementioned scenarios of better and worse water supply reliability thus for the attribute related to μ the levels were μ s q μ b 1 μ b 2 and μ b 3 for ce wtp and μ s q μ w 1 and μ w 2 for ce wta the levels of the attribute σ 2 were σ s q 2 σ b 1 2 σ b 2 2 and σ b 3 2 for ce wtp and σ s q 2 σ w 1 2 and σ w 2 2 for ce wta table 2 shows the attributes and levels used for the two ce exercises the monetary attribute eur consisted of an additional yearly payment to improve irrigation water supply reliability and an annual monetary compensation to be received in exchange for accepting worse reliability the monetary attribute levels were defined relative to current expenses for irrigation water using the following six levels 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 of the average farmer s total irrigation water expenses 255 ha year these levels corresponded to the following absolute values rounded figures 5 10 25 50 75 and 125 per hectare and year indicating the money paid and received in the case of ce wtp and ce wta respectively to provide a meaningful valuation context to the farmers since the parameterization of the normal pdf is meaningless for them mainly the attribute σ 2 the combinations of the levels of the attributes μ and σ 2 that characterize the changes proposed for each alternative water supply reliability were shown through three points of the resulting cdf corresponding to the 5th 25th and 50th percentiles corresponding to 1 5 and 10 years out of the 20 year period in this way farmers understood the different degrees of irrigation water supply reliability reflected by each combination of attribute levels as for the status quo and the scenarios of better worse water supply reliability see section 3 2 normal pdfs were assumed to represent the water supply probability functions for the combinations of the levels of the attributes μ and σ 2 related to each alternative based on these normal pdfs the values of the 5th 25th and 50th percentiles were obtained for practical reasons all figures were rounded to the nearest hundred for example in an alternative including the combination of the levels μ w 1 and σ w 1 2 red alternative in the example of the choice card presented in fig 3 which happens to coincide with the scenario w1 shown in fig 2 farmers were shown the following information in 1 year out of 20 they would receive less than 200 m3 ha year in 5 years out of 20 they would receive less than 1200 m3 ha year and in 10 years out of 20 they would receive less than 2000 m3 ha year similarly in the alternative derived from the combination of the levels μ s q and σ w 1 2 orange alternative in fig 3 the information shown to farmers indicated that they would receive less than 300 m3 ha year 1600 m3 ha year and 2600 m3 ha year respectively in 1 year 5 years and 10 years out of 20 the same procedure was used for ce wta and ce wtp although the colors were changed orange and red for ce wta and blue and green for ce wtp in both valuation exercises color grey color was used for denoting the sq or no change scenario as well as presenting an accurately framed ce in which increases and decreases in water supply reliability were equally framed several measures were taken to ameliorate potential biases related to the elicitation technique first in the implementation of the ce the help of the irrigation district management board was enlisted they informed the irrigators of the usefulness of the study and the fact that the results would inform their future management decisions this significantly increased survey consequentiality thus substantially reducing hypothetical bias second before presenting the sequence of choices a cheap talk was given focusing on the importance of respondents declaring their actual preferences to properly support policy design third the ces were randomly ordered to control for potential sequence biases 35 therefore any wta wtp disparity found in the study would not simply be an artifact resulting from an inaccurate elicitation technique or a poor valuation design 4 2 experimental design and data gathering a two stage sequential experimental design was geared toward minimizing the expected db error 36 this optimization is computed by simulation on the basis of some prior distributional assumptions in the first stage for the pre test efficient designs db error 0 084 and 0 108 respectively for ce wtp and ce wta with priors assumed to follow triangular distributions were used allowing them to vary within a wide range of values in a second stage the estimates of multinomial logit models mnl calculated from the 40 interviews gathered during the pre test were used to set priors assumed to be normally distributed in order to generate the db optimal efficient designs db error 0 049 and 0 081 respectively for ce wtp and ce wta these final efficient designs included 24 choice tasks distributed into four blocks for each ce exercise with each farmer being presented with one block of six choice tasks per ce exercise i e 12 choice tasks in total including six choice tasks for ce wtp and six choice tasks for ce wta in order to account for order effects in wta wtp disparity the ce exercises were administered in random order so that half of the irrigators interviewed started with the block for ce wtp and the other half with the block for ce wta a representative sample of irrigators operating in santaella ic n 205 accounting for 13 1 of the total number of farmers in the district was drawn following a quota sampling procedure accounting for farm size an ad hoc questionnaire was designed to collect the information needed for the empirical analysis regarding the two ce exercises proposed and the farm and farmer characteristics questionnaires were completed through face to face interviews the representativeness of the sample was confirmed using chi square tests which did not reject the null hypothesis of equality of sample and population proportions in terms of age gender farm size and crop distribution variables thus it is reasonable to assume that the results obtained can be extrapolated to the whole population of irrigators in santaella ic n 1563 farmers of these irrigators responses five were considered to be protests which were defined as respondents who always chose the status quo alternative and who gave protest reasons for doing so 37 the main protest reasons stated were skepticism regarding the possibility of improving water supply lack of trust in the implementing institution and moral grounds for refusal such as the belief that water should not be traded in addition four responses were identified as providing low quality information due to a misunderstanding of the choice sets according to the interviewer s judgment reducing the total number of valid questionnaires eventually obtained to 196 apart from the aforementioned protest responses due to skepticism no issues with regard to the perceived credibility of ce attributes and levels were communicated to the interviewer 1 1 initially we had some concerns about differences between the perceived credibility associated with improvements in irrigation water supply reliability and that associated with deteriorations particularly because of the severe water scarcity that characterizes the river basin where the case study is located however the respondents were informed that the reallocations of irrigation water associated with the improvement and deterioration scenarios would be done by means of several water policy instruments including improvements in water infrastructure and the implementation of water banks and water markets among others these explanations helped respondents to better understand how the different scenarios would be attained probably as a result of these efforts no differences were detected in the perceived credibility of the two ce scenarios 4 3 econometric specification latent class specifications were used to analyze the choices between alternative levels of water supply reliability two main reasons justify the use of a latent class modeling approach here especially compared to other mixed logit solutions e g random parameter models first it systematically showed a better goodness of fit and second it enables a deeper analysis of preference heterogeneity which is an explicit objective of the study by identifying groups of irrigators with similar preference patterns that would otherwise be unobserved by the analyst the final model was an adjusted latent class model salcm the salcm specification was proposed by magidson and vermunt 38 and is built on a standard latent class model lcm specification 39 where differences in the error variance across respondents are controlled while in lcm analysts hypothesize that there are several discrete latent classes of individuals according to their preferences in salcm individuals are probabilistically assigned based on not only their preferences but also scale classes 40 41 this reduces confounding effects between preference and scale heterogeneity which can produce biased welfare estimates 40 42 to the authors knowledge this is the first study using salcm to analyze farmers preferences despite the ever larger number of ce applications relying on farmer surveys that can be found in the literature 37 in our particular case scale adjusted modeling is especially recommended as wtp and wta values may well be affected by high scale heterogeneity 14 moreover the latent class approach is also suitable as we hypothesize that there must be different well defined patterns of wta wtp disparities 43 according to the diverse values irrigators assign to gains and losses related to changes in water supply reliability the identification of these patterns enables the identification of useful policy relevant implications 39 the basic assumption of latent class approaches specifies c 1 c latent segments or classes of respondents within the population each showing a marked profile in terms of preference structure each respondent is allocated to a single class based on a membership probability which is unknown to the analyst the utility u of alternative i to individual n available within the set of j alternatives in a choice situation t who belongs to class c can be written as 1 u int c β c x int η i c ε int where x is a vector of attributes β c is a class specific parameter vector η are alternative specific constants asc and ε is an iid type i extreme value distributed error term with variance π 2 6λ 2 with λ representing a scale parameter within each class choice probabilities are assumed to be generated by the multinomial logit model mnlm unlike lcm where λ is normalized to 1 and omitted in salcm the scale parameter is allowed to vary across different scale classes s thus assuming that individuals within the same preference class may display different levels of uncertainty let λs be the scale parameter specific to each scale class s then the choice probability for alternative i conditional on preference class c is 2 p r n c i s 1 s π s exp λ s β c x j n t η i c j 1 j exp λ s β c x j n t η j c where π s represents scale membership probabilities and λ 1 1 for identification purposes the overall probability of the sequence of choices y 1 y 2 y t is 2 pr y 1 y 2 y t c 1 c π c t 1 t s 1 s π s exp λ s β c x j n t η i c j 1 j exp λ s β c x j n t η j c in our specific application additional sources of preference and scale heterogeneity were controlled in the salcm with regard to the former interaction terms with the ascs η were incorporated into the model following theoretical expectations related to order 44 and farm income 15 effects on general willingness to participate 2 2 other effects related to substitution transaction costs and attitudes toward uncertainty especially related to climate change and future competing water uses mentioned in section 2 were also explored but proved not to be significant moreover individual specific status quo information was considered ex post which proved to significantly improve model fit compared to assuming the same average status quo for all the respondents 3 3 this finding lends support to effects of reference dependence as evidenced by rose and masiero 45 using a pivoted design however a pivoted design could not be implemented here due to time and resource constraints models including the same status quo for all respondents are available on request with regard to the latter following the suggestion by hess and train 46 to further differentiate between preference and scale heterogeneity covariates were used to delve deeper into scale heterogeneity the following procedure was employed to select scale covariates first variables consistent with the theoretical framework were selected second those significant at the 0 1 level in single covariate models were retained and third those found to be significant in models with multiple covariates were the ones ultimately retained as suggested by flynn et al 47 and glenk et al 48 the second and third steps were carried out taking care to ensure that covariates did not create instability in the latent class solution or exhibit unintuitive patterns across covariate categories in addition due to the high proportion of serial non participants for both ce wtp and ce wta one class was modeled including restrictions on attribute parameters to deal with full attribute non attendance in a similar fashion to glenk et al 48 the number of latent preference classes or pclasses imposed exogenously by the analyst was determined based on the evaluation of model fit information criteria bic aic and caic which revealed a relatively low decrease beyond three pclass solutions especially in salcms together with the analyst s appraisal of model parsimony and interpretation of policy implications 49 model fit information is shown in appendix 1 for one to seven class solutions for specifications incorporating a preference heterogeneity b preference and scale heterogeneity with two scale classes or sclasses c preference heterogeneity with interactions with the ascs and restrictions and d preference heterogeneity with interactions with the ascs restrictions and scale heterogeneity two sclasses including covariates two sclass s 2 solutions were used in salcm specifications as a higher number of sclasses did not substantially improve the selection criteria mentioned above 4 4 full model results are available on request to authors with regard to welfare estimates the krinsky robb bootstrapping method 50 was used to compute the median and confidence intervals of wtp wta and ratio estimates both marginal and total wtp and wta estimates were calculated in the latter case following hanemann 51 to estimate welfare changes in symmetric scenarios of improvements and deteriorations of water supply reliability the scenarios considered were defined for changes of 10 25 and 50 in the irrigation water supply reliability to further explain class membership with respondents characteristics and opinions without affecting class membership probabilities and parameter estimation a step 3 approach was used such an approach consists of investigating the association between the posterior class membership from the latent class model with external variables either predictors or outcomes here a covariate step 3 model is employed with covariates acting as predictors of class membership in this model the probability of being assigned to class a i given by z i set of individual specific covariates can be calculated as 52 53 3 p a i z i c 1 c p c z i p a i c where c is the true class membership obtained from the salcm s posterior classification p c z i is the probability of being assigned to the true class c given individual specific information z i and p a i c is the conditional response probabilities between assigned and true membership in particular following vermunt and magidson 53 we use proportional class assignment and the maximum likelihood adjustment method to correct biases created by classification errors step 3 and salcm models were computed using latentgold 5 1 53 for the latter model it is worth noting that the specification incorporates a log scale factor to ensure non negative values table 3 shows the descriptive of the variables related to respondents characteristics used in the final models 5 results 5 1 modeling preference and scale heterogeneity table 4 shows the results of the following models all using pooled data from ce wtp and ce wta a mnl b 3 pclass lcm c 3 pclass lcm model with variables interacting with the ascs and restrictions and d 3 pclass salcm with variables interacting with the ascs restrictions and scale heterogeneity with 2 sclasses with covariates results for the mnl show that all attributes except μ wtp and the ascs are highly significant and present the expected sign positive for the μ parameters meaning the higher the mean water supplied the greater the utility negative for the σ 2 parameters meaning the higher the variance of the water supplied the lower the utility and negative or positive depending on whether the irrigator has to pay eur wtp for water supply improvements or accept eur wta deteriorations in the supply positive ascs ascsq wtp and ascsq wta mean utility for the status quo alternative the three class lcm is more informative showing that there are three classes of irrigators grouped by their preferences toward the ce attributes it is highly significant for all the attributes except μ wtp and there is a marked improvement in the goodness of fit with respect to mnl for mnl pseudo r2 0 11 while for lcm pseudo r2 0 51 however for both ce wtp and ce wta it fails to adequately group serial non participants i e those systematically choosing the status quo alternative in all choices who account for 34 of the valid sample 5 5 all serial non participants are grouped in pclass2 though this class shows significant attribute parameters estimated from the non serial non participants also included in this class thus providing a poor modeling solution for this reason an lcm specification with a class with restricted parameters for all the attributes was subsequently used also including interactions terms with the ascs to delve deeper into preference heterogeneity by doing so serial non participants were successfully grouped together in pclass3 as reflected by the ascs parameters which are positive significant and larger in magnitude when comparing this and the previous lcm solution it can be seen that they display a similar model fit but the former outperforms the latter by successfully grouping together serial non participants and showing significant order wtpfirst and farm income pfarminc effects on general willingness to participate however this last lcm solution does not make it possible to account for scale heterogeneity which is the main reason why the salcm specification was used in the form shown in table 4 6 6 following davis et al 54 we checked for potential sensitiveness to scale normalization finding no significant effects on the results on either membership probabilities or general preference patterns in addition specifications allowing for dependence between sclasses and pclasses were explored but no significant relationship was found so for parsimony the result assuming independence between them was retained models are available on request salcm provides a significantly better fit than the previous models pseudo r2 0 58 by considerably controlling for scale heterogeneity this suggests relevant scale heterogeneity though it seems that effects related to preference heterogeneity are comparatively greater as shown by the relatively higher increase in model fit obtained from previous steps accordingly the following description of results focuses on this salcm solution the modeling results show three different classes of irrigators according to their preferences toward water supply reliability of the three preference class 3 or pclass3 shows the highest membership probability 0 45 grouping together those who are unwilling to pay and or accept respectively for positive and negative changes in the current water reliability in particular this is indicated by the large magnitude of the ascsq wtp and ascsq wtp parameters meaning that irrigators allocated to this class show very high utility attached to the status quo alternative irrespective of the valuation context wtp or wta conversely pclass2 comprises those who are willing to pay for and accept respectively positive and negative changes in both the mean and variance of irrigation water supplied this class shows the lowest membership probability 0 22 lying in between the two pclass1 membership probability 0 33 includes those irrigators who are only willing to pay for improving water supply reliability mainly by increasing the mean water supplied and are generally unwilling to accept deteriorations in reliability additional insights about preference heterogeneity show significant order effects for pclass1 and pclass2 on the general willingness to pay and accept as represented by the interactions ascsq wtp wtpfirst and ascsq wta wtpfirst respectively coupled with the farm income effect on general willingness to accept in both classes see ascsq wta fincomhi with regard to scale heterogeneity a log scale factor significantly different from zero is found for the two scale classes included in the salcm specification this proves scale heterogeneity among irrigators preferences toward water supply reliability with membership probability being 0 80 and 0 20 for sclass1 and sclass2 respectively remarkably the log scale factor value estimated at 2 46 i e yielding a scale factor of 0 085 for sclass2 suggests that compared to sclass1 this class is characterized by higher error variance pointing to a lower choice consistency and certainty among members belonging to this class observing the covariates incorporated in the scale model it can be seen that scale is positively related to an above average water productivity watprohi 1 and negatively related to an above average area devoted to horticultural crops hoareahi 1 meaning lower and higher respondents choice certainty respectively we interpret the first result as reflecting the greater importance of the good under valuation for the irrigators i e the higher the expected profitability from increased water use the higher the importance attached to such use and thus the higher the response certainty it could be argued that the second result is related to the greater complexity of the valuation exercise perceived by the respondent 55 as irrigators with horticultural crops typically decide among a wider range of crops entailing different water needs and more importantly these crops are characterized by higher uncertainty regarding expected profitability not only due to higher production risk but also market risk 56 hence in each choice task irrigators with a higher proportion of horticultural crops had to adjust their crop mix decisions to the scenarios of water supply reliability presented in the alternatives which implies considering uncertainty in expected profitability for their full range of available crop mix alternatives to some extent this reflects previous findings on the inverse relationship between respondents perceived certainty regarding choices and error variance 48 5 2 welfare estimates using the salcm results shown above we can estimate welfare changes for variations in water supply reliability table 5 shows marginal wtp and wta estimates for improvements and deteriorations in reliability for each preference class except pclass3 for which no estimate can be calculated due to non attendance to all the attributes pclass1 irrigators show a significant marginal wtp for increasing mean water supplied with a modest median estimate of 3 1 per increase of 1000 m3 ha year in μ while no significant welfare estimates are obtained for the other attributes i e wta for decreased μ and wtp and wta for decreased and increased variance σ 2 of irrigation water supply however they present significant wtp and wta estimates respectively for any improvement or deterioration of water supply reliability with the median general wtp for improvements being 13 9 ha year and more remarkably the median general wta for deteriorations being 797 7 ha year the latter figure indicates very low willingness to receive monetary compensation in exchange for worsened irrigation water supply reliability this is logically reflected in an extreme wta wtp ratio median around 58 pclass2 irrigators are the only ones who show significant marginal wtp and wta estimates for the two attributes considered with estimates of 56 7 and 146 7 for increases and decreases of 1000 m3 ha year in μ respectively and 37 1 and 37 5 for decreases and increases of 106 m3 ha year 2 in σ 2 in addition pclass2 irrigators show a significant and fairly high wtp and wta for general improvements and deteriorations of water supply reliability median estimates of 291 7 and 175 1 ha year respectively as a result these irrigators show moderate wta wtp ratios for these marginal welfare estimates with median values of 2 6 and 1 0 for the attributes μ and σ 2 and 0 6 for departing from the status quo alternative in terms of impacts on welfare estimates order effects were significant for pclass1 s general wtp for improvements and pclass2 s general wta for deteriorations of water supply reliability those who were presented first with ce wtp wtpfirst 1 show a significantly higher wtp estimated at 3 4 ha year p value 0 1 for pclass1 and far higher wta 264 5 ha year p value 0 01 for pclass2 as compared to the corresponding figures for those who were presented first with ce wta wtpfirst 0 very significant effects of farm income represented by the fincomhi variable on welfare estimates were also found those whose household income is heavily dependent on farm income have significantly higher 961 7 ha year p value 0 1 and lower wta 98 6 ha year p value 0 05 in pclass1 and pclass2 respectively table 6 shows total welfare estimates

1 wta 2 wta and 3 wta pclass1 irrigators show significant median wtp values in the range of 15 5 18 7 ha year for the three scenarios of improvement considered while wta estimates remain invariant due to the non significance of attribute parameters however ratio estimates seem to be more sensitive to the fact that wtp estimates are more certain significant at 0 01 level compared to wta ones showing values within the 43 52 range for this pclass pclass2 irrigators show more sensitivity to changes in the water supply reliability scenarios with significant median wtp and wta values ranging within the 321 373 ha year and 230 400 ha year intervals respectively consequently wta wtp ratios for this pclass fall within the 0 7 1 1 interval 5 3 socioeconomic characteristics associated with class membership table 7 shows the step 3 model where class membership is predicted with covariates using pclass 3 as the reference the model shows that class membership can be predicted by a number of variables including farm characteristics and management namely farm size water needs irrigation management following the ic s suggestions and perceived water use for the main crop and irrigators socioeconomic characteristics namely age in particular compared to pclass3 pclass1 irrigators are more likely to have smaller irrigated areas their irrigated area is more likely to be below 15 ha

pclass2 irrigators are also more likely to make use of the ic s suggestions irrigic opt for crops with higher average water needs waterha and perceive that they consume more water for the main crop than other farmers with the same crop consumhi with no significant differences found for the other variables compared to pclass3 compared to pclass1 pclass2 are more likely to have smaller farm sizes

results add to previous evidence showing the disparity between wta and wtp values but this is the first study to report such findings with regard to a common pool resource used as a business input in this case irrigation water and its supply reliability however the most relevant insight provided by the analysis performed here is the individual specific heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity most of the existing literature assesses the disparity between wta and wtp values in average or median terms i e wta wtp disparity measures at the market level generally ignoring the heterogeneous interpersonal preferences 16 for instance in the case of water related markets or services this issue has been analyzed focusing on the reliability of household water services 21 or the equilibrium prices in spot water markets 22 only a few studies have analyzed interpersonal heterogeneity in wta wtp disparity all of which focus on specific characteristics of interest such as individuals psychological traits 57 marketplace experience 58 or the reference dependence 14 our study adds to the existing knowledge by comprehensively analyzing individual specific heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity considering various different potential sources of this heterogeneity in particular the latent class approach allowed to distinguish three profiles or classes of farmers according to their preferences pclass2 can be labeled as traders since they are willing to pay and accept payment for changes in the mean and variance of irrigation water supplied they thus come close to displaying homo economicus behavior showing a very low wta wtp disparity with wta wtp ratios close to one notably the fact that this class shows the smallest membership probability is in keeping with previous studies focusing on preference heterogeneity e g ref 59 which also found the class behaving in accordance with standard economic assumptions to be the smallest one pclass3 can be labeled as full non traders since they do not trade off their irrigation water supply reliability at all no wta wtp disparity can be assessed though the serial status quo choice in the two dce administered actually suggests wtp tending to zero and wta showing extremely high values these preferences could be explained with reference to their attitudes and opinions against water trading i e irrigation water and related services considered as public goods that should be kept out of the market the fact that this class contains the oldest irrigators and shows the least qualified management as shown by age50 and irrigic variables would lend support to this interpretation mirroring previous findings by alcón et al 60 and giannoccaro et al 22 pclass1 is an intermediate class that can be labeled as partial non traders these farmers make minimal trade offs in water supply reliability especially with regard to worsening scenarios this leads to very high wta wtp ratios far more extreme than in the vast majority of previous studies 16 there is a variety of possible explanations for this including loss aversion income effects and profit seeking as shown below in spite of the preference heterogeneity the results especially those shown in table 6 hint at the non linearity of the utility curve associated with water supply reliability which is something that the three classes of irrigators identified have in common however the results suggest marked differences among classes in terms of the shape of said curve while previous studies provide evidence of the non linearity of the utility curve for wtp and wta in water related goods e g 14 to our knowledge the present study is the first to show this for irrigation water supply reliability moreover salcm models have also shown that within each pclass there are other sources of wta wtp heterogeneity according to our results such heterogeneity in pclass2 and pclass1 could be partially explained by varying degrees of the income effect neoclassical economic theory points to the income effect as one potential explanation for the pervasiveness of higher wta than wtp suggesting that individuals income constrains their demand for goods services in terms of wtp but not the amount for wta required as compensation for relinquishing these goods services 13 however this interpretation only applies to consumers considering how to spend their fixed income among the wide array of goods and services meeting their needs this is not the case for irrigators valuing improvements and deteriorations in their water supply reliability taking into account the fact that irrigation water is an input for their business in these situations it makes more sense to account for effects related to business income i e farm income or the dependence of household income on this business as any change in the availability of inputs irrigation water availability in our case study could entail relevant changes in business income gains or losses thus when changes in input availability are considered any effect related to income must be carefully analyzed with the final impact depending on how these changes affect both business revenues and costs in our case pclass1 irrigators who are more reliant on farm income have a significantly higher wta suggesting that any worsening in water supply reliability involves relevant income losses maybe because they have already adjusted their water use to lower water consumption levels as shown in the step 3 model for variables waterha 7 7 mean water needs waterha per pclass are as follows in m3 ha year 3225 3021 and 2763 for pclass2 pclass1 and pclass3 respectively and especially consumhi meanwhile pclass2 irrigators whose income heavily relies on farm income show lower wta suggesting that their farm income is less sensitive to deteriorating water supply maybe due to irrigators of this class still making excessive use of irrigation water as shown by waterha and consumhi variables 8 8 it could be argued that this excessive water use is also behind the different wta wtp ratios found for pclass2 for scenarios of moderate changes i e ratios of 0 7 and 0 8 for scenarios 1 and 2 as shown in table 6 compared to that for significant changes ratio of 1 1 for scenario 3 as these irrigators use more water it can be assumed that they are generally more inclined to pay for improvements to water supply reliability than to accept compensation for its deterioration this general inclination towards paying for improvements rather than accepting compensation for deteriorations captured by the asc term outweighs the higher marginal wtp estimates compared to wta estimates as shown in table 5 in the levels of the attributes μ and to a much lesser extent σ 2 for moderate changes but not for significant changes for the latter scenarios the deterioration in the mean water supply is so great it makes the pclass2 irrigators total wta higher than the total wtp for the equivalent improvement for pclass1 the farm income effect explains a larger wta wtp ratio similar to the effect found for consumers conversely for pclass2 the farm income effect entails a smaller wta wtp ratio our results indicate significant heterogeneity in preferences for irrigation water reliability showing general asymmetric preferences for improvements and deteriorations in most water reliability attributes as the losses associated with a decline in water reliability are higher than corresponding gains this is consistent with the concept of loss aversion in the prospect theory 14 in this sense it is worth noting that interindividual differences in loss aversion causing differential endowment effects 25 can be suggested as another relevant source of heterogeneity in wta wtp disparity this is in line with the evidence found in several experimental studies accounting for heterogeneous loss aversion among farmers e g 26 27 6 2 methodological aspects looking at the results from a methodological perspective the first finding indicates that wtp and wta for the same good may be notably affected by scale heterogeneity the fact that model fit significantly improves when accounting for it suggests that it may be advisable to consider scale heterogeneity in analyses focusing on the wta wtp disparity related to water use in particular when the water in question represents a productive input we find that scale heterogeneity is very much guided by the role played in the business profitability i e average irrigation water productivity and the uncertainty about business performance i e uncertainty regarding final water productivity in a single season though this study attempted a more in depth exploration of factors determining scale heterogeneity it is worth acknowledging that the scale analysis performed is probably limited by the moderate sample size and the large number of model parameters involved thus it can be argued that there might be other sources of this heterogeneity that remain undetected in this study due to such limitations an analysis controlling for a higher number of scale determinants would likely yield more accurate results as suggested by hess and train 46 but this should be left for further investigation with larger sample sizes the other main methodological finding concerns the significant order effects uncovered in the valuation exercise interestingly the results indicate that the ordering of experiments ce wtp and ce wta significantly affects the final results with these effects varying from one respondent to another several studies focusing on wta wtp disparity have controlled for order effects though very few report significant effects e g ref 44 there could be a number of reasons for order effects including reference dependence 14 profit seeking behavior 13 preference learning effects 61 strategic behavior in hypothetical settings 44 and more generally misconception about the experiments 62 none of these reasons can be fully ruled out as the underlying explanation for the order effects found here though we can plausibly speculate that profit seeking behavior and reference dependence effects may prevail especially given the means used to ameliorate hypothetical biases with regard to the former it can be argued that the nature of the good under valuation i e irrigation water a common pool resource used as a business input incentivizes profit seeking behavior in the two pclasses willing to trade off those who strongly value losses and undervalue gains i e pclass1 partial non traders lean toward even lower wtp values while those similarly valuing gains and losses i e pclass2 full traders lean toward increasing wta in any case we cannot be sure that this is not confounded with reference dependence effects in the sense that the differences in how the change in input irrigation water use impacts the farmers utility function in each pclass changes in supply reliability affect business revenues and costs could also play a relevant role all this makes it clear that the role of order effects in wta wtp disparity deserves further research especially using non hypothetical settings finally the reference point used in the valuation exercises for both wtp and wta merits specific discussion koetse and brouwer 14 show how wtp and wta estimates and the gap between them differ depending on the reference point defined in the experiment in our case study the same reference point probability function derived from historical water allotments in the past 20 years is used for both ces because the irrigators are clearly aware of it they have to manage their farms with these water allotments every year however it is likely that this reference point is already shifting due to climate change i e current expectations for irrigation water allotments are probably not those described in the distribution function fitted with historical data and will continue to do so in the future this could raise some concerns about the suitability of the reference point considered and thus about the results obtained the use of the historical reference point instead of considering a reference point that accounts for climate change is justified for three main reasons a the difficulty of setting a sound future distribution of water allotments accounting for the feasible impact of climate change a task which goes well beyond the scope of this paper b the fact that the climate change reference point would be an unknown scenario for irrigators subject to a high level of uncertainty which could potentially cause biased assessments and c the resources constraints for this research i e the sample size needed to carry out a split sample approach in any case the results shown here are helpful for anticipating gains and losses related to higher and lower levels of water supply reliability in the future however bearing in mind the findings reported by koetse and brouwer 14 such gains and losses could be expected to differ in scenarios accounting for the current and future impacts of climate change i e reference points where the mean water supply decreases and its variance increases in particular one of the implications drawn from their results is that we would expect wta estimates to show a greater change than wtp estimates certainly further research would be needed to confirm these expectations 7 concluding remarks the present paper contributes to the existing knowledge in several ways including the estimation of the wta wtp disparity for a common pool resource such as irrigation water the investigation of preference and scale heterogeneity in such a valuation context and the identification of farm business income and order effects as significant determinants of the disparity to do so the analysis relies on a discrete choice experiment approach with attributes based on probability density functions representing changes in irrigation water supply reliability in terms of improvements and or deteriorations in the mean and variance of the supply and a scale adjusted latent class modeling approach used for the first time with farmers the results show marked heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity with the identification of the following three classes of irrigators according to their preferences in decreasing order of membership probability full non traders 0 45 partial non traders 0 33 and traders 0 22 the first two classes show very high loss aversion most probably due to issues of property rights as in the case study considered irrigation water represents a business input with centralized allocation by a public agency with full non traders entirely unwilling to trade off their irrigation water supply reliability and partial non traders only slightly willing to do so further insights about preference heterogeneity relate to the finding that significant farm income and order effects vary across classes the former basically reflects changes in business revenue and costs as a result of changes in input availability and as such shows diverse impacts depending on the type of farm the latter relative to which choice experiment was administered first ce wtp or ce wta may be attributed to a variety of underlying reasons among which reference dependence effects and profit seeking behavior are probably the most plausible though this undoubtedly represents an open question for future research in addition the modeling approach allowed us to separate preference from scale heterogeneity showing significant scale heterogeneity particularly out of the two scale classes identified the smallest one membership probability 0 20 comprises respondents with higher choice uncertainty with this uncertainty being decreased and increased by business profitability and insecurity about such profitability respectively the identification of significant scale heterogeneity suggests that modeling approaches that consider both preference and scale heterogeneity may be advisable in future assessments of this type in any case the results call for further research to show the extent to which scale heterogeneity significantly affects wtp and wta estimates in ces focused on farmers and or water use the results point to several policy relevant implications first and probably most obviously they provide evidence of the non neutrality of the initial establishment of the property rights therefore it could be argued that more flexible structures of water rights e g the conversion into non permanent rights would yield more efficient results in water management at a basin scale second they confirm the need to implement climate change adaptation measures taking into account the high cost of any deterioration in water supply reliability measured in wta terms much higher than the wtp based estimates suggest third the success of demand side instruments based on water trading including water markets and banks may be jeopardized by a failure to design policy accounting for the large and heterogeneous wta wtp disparity farm income effects and the differing disparity depending on the type and level of change promoted this is of the utmost importance in semi arid regions where demand side instruments often represent one of the very few available options to cope with cyclical water supply scarcity i e drought management however in a context like the case study considered where water markets and banks are strongly contested 63 policy makers should innovate by combining them with incentives to promote participation e g drought insurance priority rights or precautionary savings this clearly represents an open avenue for further research role of the funding source financial support for the

8635,this paper assesses the wtp and wta for improvements and deteriorations respectively in irrigation water supply reliability the assessment relies on a double sided discrete choice experiment valuation using latent class modeling accounting for preference and scale heterogeneity this valuation approach is empirically implemented using a case study of a spanish irrigated district

irrigators preference heterogeneity in order to design successful market based instruments keywords water supply guarantee water policy climate change loss aversion choice experiment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most recent projections for mediterranean semi arid regions indicate a progressive rise in the average temperature a decrease in precipitation and an increase in the frequency and length of extreme drought events 1 these changes in climate parameters are already being felt by farmers prompting them to implement several adaptive strategies 2 as the main water users in these regions irrigators are deeply concerned since climate change is already causing an increase in irrigation water needs higher crop evapotranspiration rates due to rising temperatures and a reduction in water availability both structurally shortages in average rainfall and water inflows feeding irrigation systems and cyclically more frequent and acute drought episodes 3 the combination of these two circumstances adversely affects irrigation water supply reliability seriously jeopardizing the economic sustainability of the irrigators farms lower more volatile income because of smaller more uncertain crop yields in order to deal with this situation two different policy approaches can be considered to maintain or improve irrigation water supply reliability the first approach known as supply side water policy is focused on increasing water availability by building new reservoirs and other water infrastructure this approach was traditionally implemented during the 20th century 4 however it is no longer an option in more developed regions since new increases in water availability are technically and environmentally infeasible or economically unaffordable 5 in these cases the only possible approach is demand side policy which optimizes the management of currently available water resources by improving water use efficiency and reducing the irrigators exposure to water availability risk this type of policy instrument includes the modernization of irrigation systems water pricing water markets and water banks 6 to efficiently design demand side water management instruments information is needed on water users welfare change associated with improvements in water supply reliability i e for those benefiting from the implementation of policy instruments and deteriorations i e for those whose supply reliability is reduced however there is scarce literature in this field regarding irrigated agriculture to the authors knowledge rigby et al 7 mesa jurado et al 8 bell et al 9 alcón et al 10 and guerrero baena et al 11 represent the few studies that assess irrigation water supply reliability all these studies measure irrigators welfare change in terms of willingness to pay wtp for improvements in water supply reliability in line with official recommendations from the noaa panel on contingent valuation which state that benefit cost analyses should be based on wtp 12 however more recent literature suggests that the use of wtp measures for the valuation of deteriorations in water supply reliability i e damages may underestimate the economic value of welfare changes thus leading to suboptimal policy design 13 14 all this evidence calls for the use of wta formats rather than wtp to estimate the welfare changes associated with the progressive deterioration of water supply reliability due to either climate change in a no policy scenario or the implementation of demand side instruments nevertheless such a valuation approach has yet to be implemented and no reliable value estimation of declines in reliability is available in the existing literature within this framework the paper s primary objective is to analyze the disparity between the wtp for improved irrigation water supply reliability and the wta for compensation for deterioration in water supply reliability while a large body of literature provides empirical evidence of the wta wtp disparity 15 16 including a substantial number of papers focusing on ordinary private goods and environmental public goods no study has previously estimated such a disparity focusing on a singular good such as irrigation water a common pool resource which is used as a business input such a double sided valuation will allow us to provide new insights into the disparity between wtp and wta and the heterogeneity of said disparity opening up a discussion on the reasons behind this gap and drawing relevant policy implications for implementing demand side approaches for this purpose this paper relies on an economic experiment with farmers in an irrigated area in the guadalquivir river basin southern spain that is suffering a severe deterioration in water supply reliability because of climate change and increasing demand for water for other economic and environmental uses more stringent requirements for ecological streamflows 17 a choice experiment ce application is employed to assess wtp and wta for improvements and deteriorations in irrigation water supply reliability respectively for a representative sample of irrigators additionally a latent class modeling approach accounting for preference and scale heterogeneity is used for the first time with farmers 2 the wta wtp disparity regarding irrigation water supply reliability the disparity between wta and wtp is one of the most extensively documented phenomena in the literature dealing with economic valuation with many empirical studies reporting evidence that wta values tend to be substantially higher than wtp values in their reviews of the literature horowitz and mcconnell 18 find substantial heterogeneity among case studies in terms of the wta wtp ratio and a mean wta wtp ratio of approximately 7 in a more recent meta analysis tunçel and hammitt 16 report a mean value above 3 although the disparity between wta and wtp related to irrigation water supply reliability has not been studied yet there are a few studies showing a significant wta wtp gap regarding other water services del saz salazar et al 19 focused on improvements in water quality of a river lanz et al 20 and macdonald et al 21 studied the quality of the services provided by urban water supply companies giannoccaro et al 22 analyzed farmers willingness to buy and to sell water through a seasonal market and koetse and brouwer 14 valued changes in flood control all this suggests that there may also be a disparity in wta and wtp values for irrigation water supply reliability considering neoclassical economic theory hicksian welfare theory kim et al 13 suggest various theoretical justifications for differences or asymmetries between wta and wtp income effect substitution effect profit seeking behavior and transaction costs indeed these are plausible reasons for the wta wtp disparity in valuation contexts focusing on irrigation water supply reliability however there is a broad consensus that the degree of wta wtp asymmetry observed in empirical studies cannot be reasonably explained purely by the traditional economic reasons pointed out above and that individuals psychological and behavioral patterns also play a relevant role 18 knetsch 23 was the first to explain the asymmetry of wta wtp as evidence of the endowment effect a manifestation of loss aversion 24 which refers to the notion that people value losses higher than gains that is they usually require more compensation wta to give up a good that they already possess than they would pay to obtain another similar one wtp this intuition was confirmed by kahneman et al 25 who interpreted knetsch s results as support for prospect theory this interpretation has been expanded in a large and growing literature 14 since loss aversion has already been demonstrated among farmers worldwide e g 26 27 it may influence the wta wtp disparity in a valuation exercise focusing on irrigation water reliability finally it has also been suggested that the wta wtp gap could be an artifact caused by inaccurate elicitation techniques and poor experimental designs in this respect the literature identifies two main reasons related to hypothetical bias and other features of the valuation context different framing for wtp and wta time issues sequence bias policy program definition etc 16 28 29 however though hypothetical and other biases may be relevant when analyzing farmers preferences toward policy options 30 a careful experimental design aimed at enhancing survey consequentiality e g by collaborating with management agencies and institutions and informing participants about how results will support their decision making and minimizing hypothetical bias e g using cheap talk 31 32 can largely preclude significant biases related to the elicitation techniques 3 case study the santaella irrigators community 3 1 santaella irrigators community since the water act of 1985 entered into force all water resources in spain have been officially declared public property governed by public basin agencies this legislation also stipulates that any private use e g irrigation has to be approved by the state through legal authorizations when these water rights are granted users are allocated a maximum annual amount of water water concession for uses defined explicitly in the associated legal document however the amount of water actually provided each year water allotments can be lower than water concessions since the spanish public basin agencies have the legal capacity to enforce restrictions depending on the level of water stored in reservoirs the santaella irrigators community ic located in the guadalquivir river basin grb in southern spain has been selected as a case study this ic is a large irrigation district 15 500 ha using surface water resources delivered by the grb agency like many other ics in the basin santaella ic was established at the end of the 20th century but currently operates with modern efficient irrigation technologies most commonly sprinkler and drip irrigation systems 33 the main crops are olive cotton wheat vegetables mainly garlic and onion and sunflower the water fees paid by irrigators are calculated based on fixed costs primarily covering depreciation and maintenance of infrastructures as well as personnel requirements and variable costs mainly covering energy consumed for pumping in the provision of water services irrigators are charged separately for these costs through a two part bill including one component based on the criterion of area a charge for fixed costs of approximately 150 ha year on average and one volumetric component a charge for variable costs of 0 04 m3 year on average like most of the ics in the grb santaella ic typically receives water allotments lower than the legal concession of 5000 m3 ha year to which it is entitled indeed the average water use in the last 20 irrigation seasons has been 2572 m3 ha year 51 of the water concession confirming that water supply reliability is relatively low water allotment can be considered a stochastic variable with its own probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf data on santaella ic s yearly water allotments of the past 20 years fit several possible distribution functions with the normal distribution function turning out to be one of the most accurate for representing the variability in water supply 11 fig 1 shows the normal pdf and cdf for these data displaying the two parameters that characterize the pdf i e parameters μ mean and σ 2 variance this normal pdf represents the reference for the two valuation exercises performed i e ce wtp and ce wta as it is already well known by all the irrigators operating in the santaella ic 3 2 setting the valuation scenarios three scenarios of better water supply reliability were proposed scenarios b1 b2 and b3 representing reductions in the annual gap or difference between concession and allotment of 25 50 and 75 respectively furthermore two scenarios of worse water supply reliability were also proposed scenarios w1 and w2 representing increases in the annual concession allotment gap of 25 and 50 respectively based on these scenarios modified yearly water allotments were calculated for each case in the santaella ic for the last 20 irrigation seasons these modified series of yearly water allotments were used to fit five distribution functions describing the variability in water allotments under each scenario all these fits were consistent with normal distribution functions as confirmed by the a d statistical test the resulting pdfs and cdfs allowed us to focus our analysis on irrigators wtp for better water supply reliability distribution functions describing scenarios b1 b2 and b3 and wta for worse water supply reliability distribution functions describing scenarios w1 and w2 fig 2 shows the resulting cdfs for the five scenarios considered while table 1 shows μ and σ 2 parameters of the normal distribution functions fitted for each scenario with 5th 25th and 50th percentiles also provided 4 methodological approach 4 1 choice experiment approach the ce method is a stated preference valuation technique based on the lancasterian consumer theory of utility maximization with the econometric basis of the approach underpinned by random utility theory hensher et al 34 provide a comprehensive theoretical and practical explanation of the ce method the widespread use of ce both in general 31 32 and in particular with irrigators 7 9 10 indicates its suitability for analyzing irrigators utility changes for variations in water supply reliability two consecutive ce exercises were administered to each interviewee one focused on wtp for better water supply reliability ce wtp and the other on wta for worse water supply reliability ce wta both exercises used the same attributes two non monetary attributes related to the normal pdf describing water supply reliability μ and σ 2 parameters and one monetary attribute the definition of the non monetary attributes relied on a mean variance approach as justified in guerrero baena et al 11 representing possible changes in the pdf for water supply reliability in the irrigated area for this purpose the attribute levels considered were linked to the changes relating to the abovementioned scenarios of better and worse water supply reliability thus for the attribute related to μ the levels were μ s q μ b 1 μ b 2 and μ b 3 for ce wtp and μ s q μ w 1 and μ w 2 for ce wta the levels of the attribute σ 2 were σ s q 2 σ b 1 2 σ b 2 2 and σ b 3 2 for ce wtp and σ s q 2 σ w 1 2 and σ w 2 2 for ce wta table 2 shows the attributes and levels used for the two ce exercises the monetary attribute eur consisted of an additional yearly payment to improve irrigation water supply reliability and an annual monetary compensation to be received in exchange for accepting worse reliability the monetary attribute levels were defined relative to current expenses for irrigation water using the following six levels 2 5 10 20 30 and 50 of the average farmer s total irrigation water expenses 255 ha year these levels corresponded to the following absolute values rounded figures 5 10 25 50 75 and 125 per hectare and year indicating the money paid and received in the case of ce wtp and ce wta respectively to provide a meaningful valuation context to the farmers since the parameterization of the normal pdf is meaningless for them mainly the attribute σ 2 the combinations of the levels of the attributes μ and σ 2 that characterize the changes proposed for each alternative water supply reliability were shown through three points of the resulting cdf corresponding to the 5th 25th and 50th percentiles corresponding to 1 5 and 10 years out of the 20 year period in this way farmers understood the different degrees of irrigation water supply reliability reflected by each combination of attribute levels as for the status quo and the scenarios of better worse water supply reliability see section 3 2 normal pdfs were assumed to represent the water supply probability functions for the combinations of the levels of the attributes μ and σ 2 related to each alternative based on these normal pdfs the values of the 5th 25th and 50th percentiles were obtained for practical reasons all figures were rounded to the nearest hundred for example in an alternative including the combination of the levels μ w 1 and σ w 1 2 red alternative in the example of the choice card presented in fig 3 which happens to coincide with the scenario w1 shown in fig 2 farmers were shown the following information in 1 year out of 20 they would receive less than 200 m3 ha year in 5 years out of 20 they would receive less than 1200 m3 ha year and in 10 years out of 20 they would receive less than 2000 m3 ha year similarly in the alternative derived from the combination of the levels μ s q and σ w 1 2 orange alternative in fig 3 the information shown to farmers indicated that they would receive less than 300 m3 ha year 1600 m3 ha year and 2600 m3 ha year respectively in 1 year 5 years and 10 years out of 20 the same procedure was used for ce wta and ce wtp although the colors were changed orange and red for ce wta and blue and green for ce wtp in both valuation exercises color grey color was used for denoting the sq or no change scenario as well as presenting an accurately framed ce in which increases and decreases in water supply reliability were equally framed several measures were taken to ameliorate potential biases related to the elicitation technique first in the implementation of the ce the help of the irrigation district management board was enlisted they informed the irrigators of the usefulness of the study and the fact that the results would inform their future management decisions this significantly increased survey consequentiality thus substantially reducing hypothetical bias second before presenting the sequence of choices a cheap talk was given focusing on the importance of respondents declaring their actual preferences to properly support policy design third the ces were randomly ordered to control for potential sequence biases 35 therefore any wta wtp disparity found in the study would not simply be an artifact resulting from an inaccurate elicitation technique or a poor valuation design 4 2 experimental design and data gathering a two stage sequential experimental design was geared toward minimizing the expected db error 36 this optimization is computed by simulation on the basis of some prior distributional assumptions in the first stage for the pre test efficient designs db error 0 084 and 0 108 respectively for ce wtp and ce wta with priors assumed to follow triangular distributions were used allowing them to vary within a wide range of values in a second stage the estimates of multinomial logit models mnl calculated from the 40 interviews gathered during the pre test were used to set priors assumed to be normally distributed in order to generate the db optimal efficient designs db error 0 049 and 0 081 respectively for ce wtp and ce wta these final efficient designs included 24 choice tasks distributed into four blocks for each ce exercise with each farmer being presented with one block of six choice tasks per ce exercise i e 12 choice tasks in total including six choice tasks for ce wtp and six choice tasks for ce wta in order to account for order effects in wta wtp disparity the ce exercises were administered in random order so that half of the irrigators interviewed started with the block for ce wtp and the other half with the block for ce wta a representative sample of irrigators operating in santaella ic n 205 accounting for 13 1 of the total number of farmers in the district was drawn following a quota sampling procedure accounting for farm size an ad hoc questionnaire was designed to collect the information needed for the empirical analysis regarding the two ce exercises proposed and the farm and farmer characteristics questionnaires were completed through face to face interviews the representativeness of the sample was confirmed using chi square tests which did not reject the null hypothesis of equality of sample and population proportions in terms of age gender farm size and crop distribution variables thus it is reasonable to assume that the results obtained can be extrapolated to the whole population of irrigators in santaella ic n 1563 farmers of these irrigators responses five were considered to be protests which were defined as respondents who always chose the status quo alternative and who gave protest reasons for doing so 37 the main protest reasons stated were skepticism regarding the possibility of improving water supply lack of trust in the implementing institution and moral grounds for refusal such as the belief that water should not be traded in addition four responses were identified as providing low quality information due to a misunderstanding of the choice sets according to the interviewer s judgment reducing the total number of valid questionnaires eventually obtained to 196 apart from the aforementioned protest responses due to skepticism no issues with regard to the perceived credibility of ce attributes and levels were communicated to the interviewer 1 1 initially we had some concerns about differences between the perceived credibility associated with improvements in irrigation water supply reliability and that associated with deteriorations particularly because of the severe water scarcity that characterizes the river basin where the case study is located however the respondents were informed that the reallocations of irrigation water associated with the improvement and deterioration scenarios would be done by means of several water policy instruments including improvements in water infrastructure and the implementation of water banks and water markets among others these explanations helped respondents to better understand how the different scenarios would be attained probably as a result of these efforts no differences were detected in the perceived credibility of the two ce scenarios 4 3 econometric specification latent class specifications were used to analyze the choices between alternative levels of water supply reliability two main reasons justify the use of a latent class modeling approach here especially compared to other mixed logit solutions e g random parameter models first it systematically showed a better goodness of fit and second it enables a deeper analysis of preference heterogeneity which is an explicit objective of the study by identifying groups of irrigators with similar preference patterns that would otherwise be unobserved by the analyst the final model was an adjusted latent class model salcm the salcm specification was proposed by magidson and vermunt 38 and is built on a standard latent class model lcm specification 39 where differences in the error variance across respondents are controlled while in lcm analysts hypothesize that there are several discrete latent classes of individuals according to their preferences in salcm individuals are probabilistically assigned based on not only their preferences but also scale classes 40 41 this reduces confounding effects between preference and scale heterogeneity which can produce biased welfare estimates 40 42 to the authors knowledge this is the first study using salcm to analyze farmers preferences despite the ever larger number of ce applications relying on farmer surveys that can be found in the literature 37 in our particular case scale adjusted modeling is especially recommended as wtp and wta values may well be affected by high scale heterogeneity 14 moreover the latent class approach is also suitable as we hypothesize that there must be different well defined patterns of wta wtp disparities 43 according to the diverse values irrigators assign to gains and losses related to changes in water supply reliability the identification of these patterns enables the identification of useful policy relevant implications 39 the basic assumption of latent class approaches specifies c 1 c latent segments or classes of respondents within the population each showing a marked profile in terms of preference structure each respondent is allocated to a single class based on a membership probability which is unknown to the analyst the utility u of alternative i to individual n available within the set of j alternatives in a choice situation t who belongs to class c can be written as 1 u int c β c x int η i c ε int where x is a vector of attributes β c is a class specific parameter vector η are alternative specific constants asc and ε is an iid type i extreme value distributed error term with variance π 2 6λ 2 with λ representing a scale parameter within each class choice probabilities are assumed to be generated by the multinomial logit model mnlm unlike lcm where λ is normalized to 1 and omitted in salcm the scale parameter is allowed to vary across different scale classes s thus assuming that individuals within the same preference class may display different levels of uncertainty let λs be the scale parameter specific to each scale class s then the choice probability for alternative i conditional on preference class c is 2 p r n c i s 1 s π s exp λ s β c x j n t η i c j 1 j exp λ s β c x j n t η j c where π s represents scale membership probabilities and λ 1 1 for identification purposes the overall probability of the sequence of choices y 1 y 2 y t is 2 pr y 1 y 2 y t c 1 c π c t 1 t s 1 s π s exp λ s β c x j n t η i c j 1 j exp λ s β c x j n t η j c in our specific application additional sources of preference and scale heterogeneity were controlled in the salcm with regard to the former interaction terms with the ascs η were incorporated into the model following theoretical expectations related to order 44 and farm income 15 effects on general willingness to participate 2 2 other effects related to substitution transaction costs and attitudes toward uncertainty especially related to climate change and future competing water uses mentioned in section 2 were also explored but proved not to be significant moreover individual specific status quo information was considered ex post which proved to significantly improve model fit compared to assuming the same average status quo for all the respondents 3 3 this finding lends support to effects of reference dependence as evidenced by rose and masiero 45 using a pivoted design however a pivoted design could not be implemented here due to time and resource constraints models including the same status quo for all respondents are available on request with regard to the latter following the suggestion by hess and train 46 to further differentiate between preference and scale heterogeneity covariates were used to delve deeper into scale heterogeneity the following procedure was employed to select scale covariates first variables consistent with the theoretical framework were selected second those significant at the 0 1 level in single covariate models were retained and third those found to be significant in models with multiple covariates were the ones ultimately retained as suggested by flynn et al 47 and glenk et al 48 the second and third steps were carried out taking care to ensure that covariates did not create instability in the latent class solution or exhibit unintuitive patterns across covariate categories in addition due to the high proportion of serial non participants for both ce wtp and ce wta one class was modeled including restrictions on attribute parameters to deal with full attribute non attendance in a similar fashion to glenk et al 48 the number of latent preference classes or pclasses imposed exogenously by the analyst was determined based on the evaluation of model fit information criteria bic aic and caic which revealed a relatively low decrease beyond three pclass solutions especially in salcms together with the analyst s appraisal of model parsimony and interpretation of policy implications 49 model fit information is shown in appendix 1 for one to seven class solutions for specifications incorporating a preference heterogeneity b preference and scale heterogeneity with two scale classes or sclasses c preference heterogeneity with interactions with the ascs and restrictions and d preference heterogeneity with interactions with the ascs restrictions and scale heterogeneity two sclasses including covariates two sclass s 2 solutions were used in salcm specifications as a higher number of sclasses did not substantially improve the selection criteria mentioned above 4 4 full model results are available on request to authors with regard to welfare estimates the krinsky robb bootstrapping method 50 was used to compute the median and confidence intervals of wtp wta and ratio estimates both marginal and total wtp and wta estimates were calculated in the latter case following hanemann 51 to estimate welfare changes in symmetric scenarios of improvements and deteriorations of water supply reliability the scenarios considered were defined for changes of 10 25 and 50 in the irrigation water supply reliability to further explain class membership with respondents characteristics and opinions without affecting class membership probabilities and parameter estimation a step 3 approach was used such an approach consists of investigating the association between the posterior class membership from the latent class model with external variables either predictors or outcomes here a covariate step 3 model is employed with covariates acting as predictors of class membership in this model the probability of being assigned to class a i given by z i set of individual specific covariates can be calculated as 52 53 3 p a i z i c 1 c p c z i p a i c where c is the true class membership obtained from the salcm s posterior classification p c z i is the probability of being assigned to the true class c given individual specific information z i and p a i c is the conditional response probabilities between assigned and true membership in particular following vermunt and magidson 53 we use proportional class assignment and the maximum likelihood adjustment method to correct biases created by classification errors step 3 and salcm models were computed using latentgold 5 1 53 for the latter model it is worth noting that the specification incorporates a log scale factor to ensure non negative values table 3 shows the descriptive of the variables related to respondents characteristics used in the final models 5 results 5 1 modeling preference and scale heterogeneity table 4 shows the results of the following models all using pooled data from ce wtp and ce wta a mnl b 3 pclass lcm c 3 pclass lcm model with variables interacting with the ascs and restrictions and d 3 pclass salcm with variables interacting with the ascs restrictions and scale heterogeneity with 2 sclasses with covariates results for the mnl show that all attributes except μ wtp and the ascs are highly significant and present the expected sign positive for the μ parameters meaning the higher the mean water supplied the greater the utility negative for the σ 2 parameters meaning the higher the variance of the water supplied the lower the utility and negative or positive depending on whether the irrigator has to pay eur wtp for water supply improvements or accept eur wta deteriorations in the supply positive ascs ascsq wtp and ascsq wta mean utility for the status quo alternative the three class lcm is more informative showing that there are three classes of irrigators grouped by their preferences toward the ce attributes it is highly significant for all the attributes except μ wtp and there is a marked improvement in the goodness of fit with respect to mnl for mnl pseudo r2 0 11 while for lcm pseudo r2 0 51 however for both ce wtp and ce wta it fails to adequately group serial non participants i e those systematically choosing the status quo alternative in all choices who account for 34 of the valid sample 5 5 all serial non participants are grouped in pclass2 though this class shows significant attribute parameters estimated from the non serial non participants also included in this class thus providing a poor modeling solution for this reason an lcm specification with a class with restricted parameters for all the attributes was subsequently used also including interactions terms with the ascs to delve deeper into preference heterogeneity by doing so serial non participants were successfully grouped together in pclass3 as reflected by the ascs parameters which are positive significant and larger in magnitude when comparing this and the previous lcm solution it can be seen that they display a similar model fit but the former outperforms the latter by successfully grouping together serial non participants and showing significant order wtpfirst and farm income pfarminc effects on general willingness to participate however this last lcm solution does not make it possible to account for scale heterogeneity which is the main reason why the salcm specification was used in the form shown in table 4 6 6 following davis et al 54 we checked for potential sensitiveness to scale normalization finding no significant effects on the results on either membership probabilities or general preference patterns in addition specifications allowing for dependence between sclasses and pclasses were explored but no significant relationship was found so for parsimony the result assuming independence between them was retained models are available on request salcm provides a significantly better fit than the previous models pseudo r2 0 58 by considerably controlling for scale heterogeneity this suggests relevant scale heterogeneity though it seems that effects related to preference heterogeneity are comparatively greater as shown by the relatively higher increase in model fit obtained from previous steps accordingly the following description of results focuses on this salcm solution the modeling results show three different classes of irrigators according to their preferences toward water supply reliability of the three preference class 3 or pclass3 shows the highest membership probability 0 45 grouping together those who are unwilling to pay and or accept respectively for positive and negative changes in the current water reliability in particular this is indicated by the large magnitude of the ascsq wtp and ascsq wtp parameters meaning that irrigators allocated to this class show very high utility attached to the status quo alternative irrespective of the valuation context wtp or wta conversely pclass2 comprises those who are willing to pay for and accept respectively positive and negative changes in both the mean and variance of irrigation water supplied this class shows the lowest membership probability 0 22 lying in between the two pclass1 membership probability 0 33 includes those irrigators who are only willing to pay for improving water supply reliability mainly by increasing the mean water supplied and are generally unwilling to accept deteriorations in reliability additional insights about preference heterogeneity show significant order effects for pclass1 and pclass2 on the general willingness to pay and accept as represented by the interactions ascsq wtp wtpfirst and ascsq wta wtpfirst respectively coupled with the farm income effect on general willingness to accept in both classes see ascsq wta fincomhi with regard to scale heterogeneity a log scale factor significantly different from zero is found for the two scale classes included in the salcm specification this proves scale heterogeneity among irrigators preferences toward water supply reliability with membership probability being 0 80 and 0 20 for sclass1 and sclass2 respectively remarkably the log scale factor value estimated at 2 46 i e yielding a scale factor of 0 085 for sclass2 suggests that compared to sclass1 this class is characterized by higher error variance pointing to a lower choice consistency and certainty among members belonging to this class observing the covariates incorporated in the scale model it can be seen that scale is positively related to an above average water productivity watprohi 1 and negatively related to an above average area devoted to horticultural crops hoareahi 1 meaning lower and higher respondents choice certainty respectively we interpret the first result as reflecting the greater importance of the good under valuation for the irrigators i e the higher the expected profitability from increased water use the higher the importance attached to such use and thus the higher the response certainty it could be argued that the second result is related to the greater complexity of the valuation exercise perceived by the respondent 55 as irrigators with horticultural crops typically decide among a wider range of crops entailing different water needs and more importantly these crops are characterized by higher uncertainty regarding expected profitability not only due to higher production risk but also market risk 56 hence in each choice task irrigators with a higher proportion of horticultural crops had to adjust their crop mix decisions to the scenarios of water supply reliability presented in the alternatives which implies considering uncertainty in expected profitability for their full range of available crop mix alternatives to some extent this reflects previous findings on the inverse relationship between respondents perceived certainty regarding choices and error variance 48 5 2 welfare estimates using the salcm results shown above we can estimate welfare changes for variations in water supply reliability table 5 shows marginal wtp and wta estimates for improvements and deteriorations in reliability for each preference class except pclass3 for which no estimate can be calculated due to non attendance to all the attributes pclass1 irrigators show a significant marginal wtp for increasing mean water supplied with a modest median estimate of 3 1 per increase of 1000 m3 ha year in μ while no significant welfare estimates are obtained for the other attributes i e wta for decreased μ and wtp and wta for decreased and increased variance σ 2 of irrigation water supply however they present significant wtp and wta estimates respectively for any improvement or deterioration of water supply reliability with the median general wtp for improvements being 13 9 ha year and more remarkably the median general wta for deteriorations being 797 7 ha year the latter figure indicates very low willingness to receive monetary compensation in exchange for worsened irrigation water supply reliability this is logically reflected in an extreme wta wtp ratio median around 58 pclass2 irrigators are the only ones who show significant marginal wtp and wta estimates for the two attributes considered with estimates of 56 7 and 146 7 for increases and decreases of 1000 m3 ha year in μ respectively and 37 1 and 37 5 for decreases and increases of 106 m3 ha year 2 in σ 2 in addition pclass2 irrigators show a significant and fairly high wtp and wta for general improvements and deteriorations of water supply reliability median estimates of 291 7 and 175 1 ha year respectively as a result these irrigators show moderate wta wtp ratios for these marginal welfare estimates with median values of 2 6 and 1 0 for the attributes μ and σ 2 and 0 6 for departing from the status quo alternative in terms of impacts on welfare estimates order effects were significant for pclass1 s general wtp for improvements and pclass2 s general wta for deteriorations of water supply reliability those who were presented first with ce wtp wtpfirst 1 show a significantly higher wtp estimated at 3 4 ha year p value 0 1 for pclass1 and far higher wta 264 5 ha year p value 0 01 for pclass2 as compared to the corresponding figures for those who were presented first with ce wta wtpfirst 0 very significant effects of farm income represented by the fincomhi variable on welfare estimates were also found those whose household income is heavily dependent on farm income have significantly higher 961 7 ha year p value 0 1 and lower wta 98 6 ha year p value 0 05 in pclass1 and pclass2 respectively table 6 shows total welfare estimates for scenarios of 10 25 and 50 of improvements in μ and σ 2 enhanced water supply reliability scenarios 1 wtp 2 wtp and 3 wtp and deteriorations in μ and σ 2 worsened water supply reliability scenarios 1 wta 2 wta and 3 wta pclass1 irrigators show significant median wtp values in the range of 15 5 18 7 ha year for the three scenarios of improvement considered while wta estimates remain invariant due to the non significance of attribute parameters however ratio estimates seem to be more sensitive to the fact that wtp estimates are more certain significant at 0 01 level compared to wta ones showing values within the 43 52 range for this pclass pclass2 irrigators show more sensitivity to changes in the water supply reliability scenarios with significant median wtp and wta values ranging within the 321 373 ha year and 230 400 ha year intervals respectively consequently wta wtp ratios for this pclass fall within the 0 7 1 1 interval 5 3 socioeconomic characteristics associated with class membership table 7 shows the step 3 model where class membership is predicted with covariates using pclass 3 as the reference the model shows that class membership can be predicted by a number of variables including farm characteristics and management namely farm size water needs irrigation management following the ic s suggestions and perceived water use for the main crop and irrigators socioeconomic characteristics namely age in particular compared to pclass3 pclass1 irrigators are more likely to have smaller irrigated areas their irrigated area is more likely to be below 15 ha iarea15 make more use of the ic s suggestions for irrigation management decisions irrigic and be younger than 50 age50 with no significant differences found among pclasses for the other variables pclass2 irrigators are also more likely to make use of the ic s suggestions irrigic opt for crops with higher average water needs waterha and perceive that they consume more water for the main crop than other farmers with the same crop consumhi with no significant differences found for the other variables compared to pclass3 compared to pclass1 pclass2 are more likely to have smaller farm sizes less likely to present a total farm area of over 30 ha tarea30 larger irrigated areas iarea15 and higher water use perception consumhi 6 discussion 6 1 heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity our results add to previous evidence showing the disparity between wta and wtp values but this is the first study to report such findings with regard to a common pool resource used as a business input in this case irrigation water and its supply reliability however the most relevant insight provided by the analysis performed here is the individual specific heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity most of the existing literature assesses the disparity between wta and wtp values in average or median terms i e wta wtp disparity measures at the market level generally ignoring the heterogeneous interpersonal preferences 16 for instance in the case of water related markets or services this issue has been analyzed focusing on the reliability of household water services 21 or the equilibrium prices in spot water markets 22 only a few studies have analyzed interpersonal heterogeneity in wta wtp disparity all of which focus on specific characteristics of interest such as individuals psychological traits 57 marketplace experience 58 or the reference dependence 14 our study adds to the existing knowledge by comprehensively analyzing individual specific heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity considering various different potential sources of this heterogeneity in particular the latent class approach allowed to distinguish three profiles or classes of farmers according to their preferences pclass2 can be labeled as traders since they are willing to pay and accept payment for changes in the mean and variance of irrigation water supplied they thus come close to displaying homo economicus behavior showing a very low wta wtp disparity with wta wtp ratios close to one notably the fact that this class shows the smallest membership probability is in keeping with previous studies focusing on preference heterogeneity e g ref 59 which also found the class behaving in accordance with standard economic assumptions to be the smallest one pclass3 can be labeled as full non traders since they do not trade off their irrigation water supply reliability at all no wta wtp disparity can be assessed though the serial status quo choice in the two dce administered actually suggests wtp tending to zero and wta showing extremely high values these preferences could be explained with reference to their attitudes and opinions against water trading i e irrigation water and related services considered as public goods that should be kept out of the market the fact that this class contains the oldest irrigators and shows the least qualified management as shown by age50 and irrigic variables would lend support to this interpretation mirroring previous findings by alcón et al 60 and giannoccaro et al 22 pclass1 is an intermediate class that can be labeled as partial non traders these farmers make minimal trade offs in water supply reliability especially with regard to worsening scenarios this leads to very high wta wtp ratios far more extreme than in the vast majority of previous studies 16 there is a variety of possible explanations for this including loss aversion income effects and profit seeking as shown below in spite of the preference heterogeneity the results especially those shown in table 6 hint at the non linearity of the utility curve associated with water supply reliability which is something that the three classes of irrigators identified have in common however the results suggest marked differences among classes in terms of the shape of said curve while previous studies provide evidence of the non linearity of the utility curve for wtp and wta in water related goods e g 14 to our knowledge the present study is the first to show this for irrigation water supply reliability moreover salcm models have also shown that within each pclass there are other sources of wta wtp heterogeneity according to our results such heterogeneity in pclass2 and pclass1 could be partially explained by varying degrees of the income effect neoclassical economic theory points to the income effect as one potential explanation for the pervasiveness of higher wta than wtp suggesting that individuals income constrains their demand for goods services in terms of wtp but not the amount for wta required as compensation for relinquishing these goods services 13 however this interpretation only applies to consumers considering how to spend their fixed income among the wide array of goods and services meeting their needs this is not the case for irrigators valuing improvements and deteriorations in their water supply reliability taking into account the fact that irrigation water is an input for their business in these situations it makes more sense to account for effects related to business income i e farm income or the dependence of household income on this business as any change in the availability of inputs irrigation water availability in our case study could entail relevant changes in business income gains or losses thus when changes in input availability are considered any effect related to income must be carefully analyzed with the final impact depending on how these changes affect both business revenues and costs in our case pclass1 irrigators who are more reliant on farm income have a significantly higher wta suggesting that any worsening in water supply reliability involves relevant income losses maybe because they have already adjusted their water use to lower water consumption levels as shown in the step 3 model for variables waterha 7 7 mean water needs waterha per pclass are as follows in m3 ha year 3225 3021 and 2763 for pclass2 pclass1 and pclass3 respectively and especially consumhi meanwhile pclass2 irrigators whose income heavily relies on farm income show lower wta suggesting that their farm income is less sensitive to deteriorating water supply maybe due to irrigators of this class still making excessive use of irrigation water as shown by waterha and consumhi variables 8 8 it could be argued that this excessive water use is also behind the different wta wtp ratios found for pclass2 for scenarios of moderate changes i e ratios of 0 7 and 0 8 for scenarios 1 and 2 as shown in table 6 compared to that for significant changes ratio of 1 1 for scenario 3 as these irrigators use more water it can be assumed that they are generally more inclined to pay for improvements to water supply reliability than to accept compensation for its deterioration this general inclination towards paying for improvements rather than accepting compensation for deteriorations captured by the asc term outweighs the higher marginal wtp estimates compared to wta estimates as shown in table 5 in the levels of the attributes μ and to a much lesser extent σ 2 for moderate changes but not for significant changes for the latter scenarios the deterioration in the mean water supply is so great it makes the pclass2 irrigators total wta higher than the total wtp for the equivalent improvement for pclass1 the farm income effect explains a larger wta wtp ratio similar to the effect found for consumers conversely for pclass2 the farm income effect entails a smaller wta wtp ratio our results indicate significant heterogeneity in preferences for irrigation water reliability showing general asymmetric preferences for improvements and deteriorations in most water reliability attributes as the losses associated with a decline in water reliability are higher than corresponding gains this is consistent with the concept of loss aversion in the prospect theory 14 in this sense it is worth noting that interindividual differences in loss aversion causing differential endowment effects 25 can be suggested as another relevant source of heterogeneity in wta wtp disparity this is in line with the evidence found in several experimental studies accounting for heterogeneous loss aversion among farmers e g 26 27 6 2 methodological aspects looking at the results from a methodological perspective the first finding indicates that wtp and wta for the same good may be notably affected by scale heterogeneity the fact that model fit significantly improves when accounting for it suggests that it may be advisable to consider scale heterogeneity in analyses focusing on the wta wtp disparity related to water use in particular when the water in question represents a productive input we find that scale heterogeneity is very much guided by the role played in the business profitability i e average irrigation water productivity and the uncertainty about business performance i e uncertainty regarding final water productivity in a single season though this study attempted a more in depth exploration of factors determining scale heterogeneity it is worth acknowledging that the scale analysis performed is probably limited by the moderate sample size and the large number of model parameters involved thus it can be argued that there might be other sources of this heterogeneity that remain undetected in this study due to such limitations an analysis controlling for a higher number of scale determinants would likely yield more accurate results as suggested by hess and train 46 but this should be left for further investigation with larger sample sizes the other main methodological finding concerns the significant order effects uncovered in the valuation exercise interestingly the results indicate that the ordering of experiments ce wtp and ce wta significantly affects the final results with these effects varying from one respondent to another several studies focusing on wta wtp disparity have controlled for order effects though very few report significant effects e g ref 44 there could be a number of reasons for order effects including reference dependence 14 profit seeking behavior 13 preference learning effects 61 strategic behavior in hypothetical settings 44 and more generally misconception about the experiments 62 none of these reasons can be fully ruled out as the underlying explanation for the order effects found here though we can plausibly speculate that profit seeking behavior and reference dependence effects may prevail especially given the means used to ameliorate hypothetical biases with regard to the former it can be argued that the nature of the good under valuation i e irrigation water a common pool resource used as a business input incentivizes profit seeking behavior in the two pclasses willing to trade off those who strongly value losses and undervalue gains i e pclass1 partial non traders lean toward even lower wtp values while those similarly valuing gains and losses i e pclass2 full traders lean toward increasing wta in any case we cannot be sure that this is not confounded with reference dependence effects in the sense that the differences in how the change in input irrigation water use impacts the farmers utility function in each pclass changes in supply reliability affect business revenues and costs could also play a relevant role all this makes it clear that the role of order effects in wta wtp disparity deserves further research especially using non hypothetical settings finally the reference point used in the valuation exercises for both wtp and wta merits specific discussion koetse and brouwer 14 show how wtp and wta estimates and the gap between them differ depending on the reference point defined in the experiment in our case study the same reference point probability function derived from historical water allotments in the past 20 years is used for both ces because the irrigators are clearly aware of it they have to manage their farms with these water allotments every year however it is likely that this reference point is already shifting due to climate change i e current expectations for irrigation water allotments are probably not those described in the distribution function fitted with historical data and will continue to do so in the future this could raise some concerns about the suitability of the reference point considered and thus about the results obtained the use of the historical reference point instead of considering a reference point that accounts for climate change is justified for three main reasons a the difficulty of setting a sound future distribution of water allotments accounting for the feasible impact of climate change a task which goes well beyond the scope of this paper b the fact that the climate change reference point would be an unknown scenario for irrigators subject to a high level of uncertainty which could potentially cause biased assessments and c the resources constraints for this research i e the sample size needed to carry out a split sample approach in any case the results shown here are helpful for anticipating gains and losses related to higher and lower levels of water supply reliability in the future however bearing in mind the findings reported by koetse and brouwer 14 such gains and losses could be expected to differ in scenarios accounting for the current and future impacts of climate change i e reference points where the mean water supply decreases and its variance increases in particular one of the implications drawn from their results is that we would expect wta estimates to show a greater change than wtp estimates certainly further research would be needed to confirm these expectations 7 concluding remarks the present paper contributes to the existing knowledge in several ways including the estimation of the wta wtp disparity for a common pool resource such as irrigation water the investigation of preference and scale heterogeneity in such a valuation context and the identification of farm business income and order effects as significant determinants of the disparity to do so the analysis relies on a discrete choice experiment approach with attributes based on probability density functions representing changes in irrigation water supply reliability in terms of improvements and or deteriorations in the mean and variance of the supply and a scale adjusted latent class modeling approach used for the first time with farmers the results show marked heterogeneity in the wta wtp disparity with the identification of the following three classes of irrigators according to their preferences in decreasing order of membership probability full non traders 0 45 partial non traders 0 33 and traders 0 22 the first two classes show very high loss aversion most probably due to issues of property rights as in the case study considered irrigation water represents a business input with centralized allocation by a public agency with full non traders entirely unwilling to trade off their irrigation water supply reliability and partial non traders only slightly willing to do so further insights about preference heterogeneity relate to the finding that significant farm income and order effects vary across classes the former basically reflects changes in business revenue and costs as a result of changes in input availability and as such shows diverse impacts depending on the type of farm the latter relative to which choice experiment was administered first ce wtp or ce wta may be attributed to a variety of underlying reasons among which reference dependence effects and profit seeking behavior are probably the most plausible though this undoubtedly represents an open question for future research in addition the modeling approach allowed us to separate preference from scale heterogeneity showing significant scale heterogeneity particularly out of the two scale classes identified the smallest one membership probability 0 20 comprises respondents with higher choice uncertainty with this uncertainty being decreased and increased by business profitability and insecurity about such profitability respectively the identification of significant scale heterogeneity suggests that modeling approaches that consider both preference and scale heterogeneity may be advisable in future assessments of this type in any case the results call for further research to show the extent to which scale heterogeneity significantly affects wtp and wta estimates in ces focused on farmers and or water use the results point to several policy relevant implications first and probably most obviously they provide evidence of the non neutrality of the initial establishment of the property rights therefore it could be argued that more flexible structures of water rights e g the conversion into non permanent rights would yield more efficient results in water management at a basin scale second they confirm the need to implement climate change adaptation measures taking into account the high cost of any deterioration in water supply reliability measured in wta terms much higher than the wtp based estimates suggest third the success of demand side instruments based on water trading including water markets and banks may be jeopardized by a failure to design policy accounting for the large and heterogeneous wta wtp disparity farm income effects and the differing disparity depending on the type and level of change promoted this is of the utmost importance in semi arid regions where demand side instruments often represent one of the very few available options to cope with cyclical water supply scarcity i e drought management however in a context like the case study considered where water markets and banks are strongly contested 63 policy makers should innovate by combining them with incentives to promote participation e g drought insurance priority rights or precautionary savings this clearly represents an open avenue for further research role of the funding source financial support for the

8636,in this paper i investigate the joint impacts of top down targets and social opprobrium on aggregate compliance with government mandates for resource conservation i use data on urban water usage local agency enforcement and reports of water waste by private citizens in california during a period of severe drought in which a year long mandate for water conservation was imposed during the mandate private citizens engaged in opprobrium by drought shaming customers engaged in water waste i find that increases in complaints regarding water waste led to increases in follow up actions by local agencies increased levels of cumulative water conservation and increased compliance with state mandated targets the findings suggest that private citizen involvement in the form of social opprobrium is an important aspect of local agency compliance keywords urban water management drought water conservation mandates social opprobrium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction local agencies e g municipalities may make decisions based on short term objectives that often result in socially inefficient outcomes e g ref 1 consequently higher level government institutions e g state agencies intervene to coordinate local actions through centralized top down mandates with specific requirements 2 yet in spite of higher level government mandates real world outcomes often fall short of legislative objectives because local agencies priorities diverge from those of higher level governments 3 4 1 1 diverging priorities are especially prominent in the context of planning for natural hazards 5 7 in the water sector local outcomes may be improved through citizen involvement in this paper i provide new insights into the dynamics of centralized government mandates i use data on urban water agencies often referred to as water utilities or systems in california subject to a drought related conservation mandate executive order eo b 29 15 henceforth referred to as the conservation mandate 2 2 in the united states states have the legal authority to establish priorities for how water is used among users at various spatial scales e g ref 8 these data allow me to shed light on two distinct aspects of the conservation mandate 1 the extent to which state level legislative objectives explain conservation outcomes and 2 the role that citizen involvement may play during droughts during droughts households are often encouraged to anonymously report instances in which other households are using water in ways that are deemed wasteful this form of mutual monitoring allows end users an active role in promoting conservation by exerting social pressure on other end users i e social opprobrium depending on the situation the entity that establishes the reporting mechanism could be a water agency state or regional government and or a grassroots movement this study features three novel characteristics first the conservation mandate studied in this paper is the first state mandate for water conservation in the history of california a state chronically affected by droughts it was the first in a series of policy decisions to promote conservation as a way of life in california 3 3 making conservation a way of life is a slogan used by california s department of water resources and state water resource control board learning from california s experience as to the effectiveness of mandating specific conservation objectives on agency level water savings is important because droughts are expected to increase in intensity frequency and duration especially in regions like california that are already water scarce 9 second the design of the conservation mandate provides an opportunity to study a large number of heterogeneous local agencies faced with different externally imposed incentives to conserve water under a common drought shock instead of taking a one size fits all approach by uniformly applying the 25 target to all water agencies each water agency was assigned a different conservation target using a multi threshold assignment rule based on the average amount of water used by residential users measured in terms of residential gallons per capita per day gpcd 10 4 4 failure to meet these targets would result in monetary fines however the extent to which the assignment of higher targets led to increased conservation is unclear because there were many cases of both over and under compliance though urban water agencies collectively conserved water by 24 5 over the course of the mandated conservation period just shy of the intended 25 objective approximately 18 of water agencies subjected to the state mandate conserved water by more than 10 points above the conservation target assigned to them over compliance while 28 failed to meet their target under compliance third concurrent with a widespread grassroots movement the state encouraged households to publicly and anonymously shame those who used water in ways deemed wasteful 11 during the state mandate ordinary members of society engaged in drought shaming a form of peer to peer opprobrium where individuals complained about users wasting water on dedicated online platforms e g local agency website or phone app or social media platforms e g twitter with a dedicated hashtag complaints often either implicitly or explicitly identified people individuals engaged in drought shaming took photographs of instances of water waste and shared these images on these platforms to exert pressure on discretionary outdoor water usage 11 to harness some of the outrage against wasting water the state set up an online portal where individuals could lodge water waste complaints in this study i use data from the online state platform these data capture the total number of water waste complaints that are reported to the state online platform directly by individuals or indirectly by water agencies though drought shaming tweets are not included in the state online platform and thus are not analyzed as part of this study the data from the state platform provides an opportunity to understand the role of citizen involvement in driving conservation related behavior empirically i first study the extent to which exogenously legislated determined top down targets imposed by the state explain local agencies cumulative water conservation i do so by exploiting quasi experimental policy variation in the assignment of the targets to compare local agencies with similar characteristics but with different conservation targets i then complement this analysis by studying the causal mechanisms behind water conservation namely social opprobrium and local agency enforcement i e follow up actions using mediation analysis an approach commonly used in the policy evaluation literature 12 both sets of analyses provide evidence that citizen complaints are informative water agencies are more likely to follow up on cases of water waste in areas with increased complaints and have higher levels of conservation my findings are two fold first i do not find that mandating specific conservation objectives necessarily leads to more water conservation second i find that social opprobrium was an impactful channel through which communities conserved water during the mandated conservation period notably the results suggest that enforcement actions driven by complaints contributed to water conservation on the order of 1 75 residential gallons per capita per day gpcd whereas enforcement actions not driven by complaints contributed to water conservation of 0 34 residential gpcd in this context citizen involvement in the enforcement process appears to be an important and perhaps overlooked aspect of local agency compliance this paper contributes to several different literatures by studying a state mandate for water conservation this paper contributes to the vast literature on environmental federalism for a review see ref 13 decentralized management of water and other natural resources is often promoted as a policy objective because local agencies have better knowledge of and more responsive to the environmental and socio economic problems that they face than do higher level government institutions 14 18 in the context of scarce water resources local water agencies face significant financial and socio political disincentives to aggressively pursue conservation and often choose to delay implementing conservation measures a state mandate for water conservation would 1 increase political acceptance of local conservation efforts by shifting some of the responsibility from local water agencies to the state agency and 2 re align financial incentives through the threat of monetary fines and legal action against a water agency as punishment for noncompliance 5 5 this characterization is based on 19 conceptual framework of state approaches for managing natural hazard risks previous work on environmental federalism related to water has explored the problems of institutional uncertainty e g ref 20 and transboundary pollution 21 22 to my knowledge this literature does not address the context of water scarcity this paper also contributes to the literature on water demand which has explored households extrinsic motivations to conserve studies on extrinsic motivations have explored household responses to demand side management strategies e g refs 23 29 to my knowledge the literature on demand side management does not explore peer to peer influence such as social opprobrium which has been shown to have an effect in the water and sanitation literature e g ref 30 and in environmental conservation efforts e g ref 31 brühl and visser 32 document a similar public shaming campaign in cape town south africa but are unable to study the extent to which this campaign contributed to conservation outcomes using the same data as this study zhang teodoro and switzer 33 examine how socio demographic characteristics e g communities income income distributions and racial ethnic compositions correlate with overall reporting and document a positive association between water waste complaints and conservation outcomes they do not attempt to disentangle how much public shaming contributed to conservation outcomes this paper also contributes to a growing literature on citizen complaints in other environmental contexts and the broader literature on monitoring and enforcement as determinants of regulatory behavior e g ref 34 this literature generally focuses on the relationship between regulators and private actors studies in this literature generally find that complaints can play a nontrivial role in environmental regulation regulators are more likely to catch violations that result from following up on a citizen complaint relative to an average inspection e g refs 35 36 to my knowledge this is the first paper to study the relationships between local agencies their customers and their regulators in the context of a mandate for water conservation by shedding light on the role of engaging private citizens as partners in achieving policy objectives this paper also contributes to work on customer buy in that spans several disciplines including public economics e g ref 37 public administration e g refs 38 41 and urban planning e g ref 42 in these works scholars argue that individuals are more likely to engage in moral or ethical acts when the community is involved in monitoring behavior the results of this study support this argument as compliance with mandates seems to have been easier in services areas where individuals helped promote social norms around conservation through drought shaming in this light the lessons learned from studying the role of customer driven complaints during california s drought could be generalized to contexts where compliance with mandated requirements may be supported by the promulgation of social norms through opprobrium and mutual monitoring from the general public 2 background 2 1 institutional setting in response to the severity of the ongoing drought governor jerry brown signed executive order b 29 15 on april 1st 2015 6 6 a copy of the executive order can be found at https www waterboards ca gov waterrights water issues programs drought docs 040115 executive order pdf the policy mandated that all large urban water agencies serving at least 3000 residential connections collectively conserve water by 25 from june 2015 to february 2016 relative to water usage over the same time period in 2013 43 to induce conservation the state introduced tier based targets based on ranges of average residential gallons per capita per day gpcd during july september 2014 10 7 7 residential gallons per capita per day is calculated as total water sold to the residential sector divided by the service area population this approach has been commonly used to measure efficiency in previous conservation efforts e g ca water conservation act 2009 and is also the basis for current policies 44 each urban water agency in the state was assigned a conservation target that ranged between 8 and 36 the rule that the state used to assign conservation targets can be expressed by the following piecewise function s di where the variable di represents water agency i s residential gpcd in the summer of 2014 using exogenously determined cutoffs ci s d i 8 0 d i 65 12 65 d i 80 16 80 d i 95 20 95 d i 110 24 110 d i 130 28 130 d i 170 32 170 d i 215 36 215 d i in february 2016 the mandate was extended through may 2016 as part of the extension the state adopted a resolution to provide water agencies with the opportunity to have their initially assigned conservation standard adjusted downward the adjustments made to conservation targets are meant to reflect exogenous information affect their ability to conserve that should have been taken into account when designing the initial cutoffs 45 8 8 adjustments to the targets were made to reflect 1 differences in climate measured in terms of differences between average service area evapotranspiration and the statewide average during july through september 2015 2 water efficient growth in population plus additional commercial and agricultural service connections and 3 the establishment of new local drought resilient water sources e g water reuse 45 climate adjustments were applied automatically whereas water agencies had to supply the state with additional documentation and evidence to qualify for adjustments on the basis of water efficient growth or new local drought resilient water sources the cap for all possible adjustments per water agency was set at 8 points 45 the revised conservation targets were in effect during the last three months of the mandate march through the end of may 2016 for the main set of analyses presented in this paper the revised conservation targets are used as the relevant targets the institutional setup of california s conservation mandate consists of three main actors the designated state agency responsible for carrying out the state mandate water agencies subject to the mandate and residential customers end users the designated state agency the state water resource control board henceforth referred to as the state mandated conservation targets in response water agencies would presumably increase efforts to encourage their customers end users to conserve water in response to actions taken by water agencies end users could conserve or not which determines water agencies conservation outcomes as part of the mandate water agencies were required to generate monthly reports that included information on local agency level water usage in terms of gpcd and enforcement the information included in these reports at the service provider by month level is the primary dataset used in this study provide an opportunity to study california s experience with its conservation mandate the state monitored water agencies progress with their assigned target by tracking water agencies total monthly potable water usage levels 9 9 the swrcb sent monthly warning letters to water agencies between 1 and 5 points below their assigned target and notices of violations to those more than 5 points below their assigned target water agencies who were within 1 point or that had conserved in excess of their target received notices of congratulations water agencies performance was ultimately judged at the end of the mandate in may 2016 consequences for failing to be in compliance with the mandate ranged from providing the state with information documenting their efforts to hefty fines of up to 10 000 a day 46 2 2 context on drought shaming in the year prior to the mandate 2014 2015 people began expressing their outrage over excess water usage during a severe drought through drought shaming people engaging in this type of public shaming took pictures of visible instances of water waste and posted them on online platforms e g twitter with the hashtag droughtshame or droughtshaming though people engaged in drought shaming for situations where trace amounts of water trickled onto pavements most instances of drought shaming are attributable to specific individuals such as neighbors or other residents e g ref 47 in parallel to the mandate the state also set up savewater ca gov to support the response to drought the website often referred to in the media as a drought shaming platform lets anyone easily report water waste from his or her phone tablet or computer the water waste report is directed to the water agency serving the location where the report was made customers can report instances of water waste without knowing the name of the local water agency or how to contact them 10 10 the state portal for reporting instances water waste can be accessed at https savewater ca gov the only information required to lodge a complaint is the nature of the observed water waste and the address at which it is observed there was also an option of attaching pictures water agencies are then able to search for their service area and then follow up on these complaints and potentially issue warnings or fines individuals could also complain about water waste directly to their local agency many water agencies set up their own local hotlines and portals water agencies then provided information on the number of these complaints to the state the data used in this study consist of the aggregated number of complaints reported to the state in each month for each water agency i e complaints lodged using the state online portal whether directly reported by individuals or indirectly by water agencies it does not include twitter data or complaints lodged using other third party platforms 3 theoretical framework 3 1 water agency dis incentives for water conservation water agencies both public and private operate under a dual responsibility of providing safe and reliable services at affordable rates while also remaining financially solvent public water agencies are generally non profit entities managed by local governments whereas private agencies also referred to as investor owned agencies are for profit entities managed by investors investor owned agencies are subject to the oversight of the state s public utility commission water agencies faced with water shortages can either taking their water supply constraints as binding and encourage their customers to use less water i e promote conservation or by attempting to unbind the supply constraint by increasing available water supplies i e supply augmentation supply augmentation involves investments in infrastructure to stem leaks the construction of large scale infrastructure projects such as dams reservoirs desalination facilities 11 11 the australian government for instance invested billions of dollars in alternative water sources such as recycling and desalination to diversify their water supply portfolio during the millennium drought 48 investments in water reuse and inter basin water transfers e g ref 49 though supply augmentation projects may do little to alleviate short term need because they are typically less flexible and longer term in nature incentives to increase capacity are often stronger than those to pursue conservation despite water agency managers goal of ensuring continuity of service and prevent supplies falling below minimum reserve levels i e running out of water 50 water agencies face several disincentives to aggressively pursue conservation first aggressive conservation reduces revenue as less water is sold reductions in revenue can be substantial the total amount of forgone net revenue due to conservation during the course of the mandate is estimated to have been more than 500 million 51 more importantly reductions in revenue puts financial pressure on water agencies many of which are already financially insecure 52 second aggressively pursuing conservation may also be met with social and political pressure to which water agency managers may be sensitive 53 55 for example residential customers may resist restrictions on water usage because of either strong preferences for lush green lawns or a perceived threat to lifestyles 56 due to these pressures water agency managers often delay pursuing conservation as long as possible 57 weigh ing the risks of delay against potential public relations problems 58 notwithstanding there is evidence that water agencies do voluntarily pursue conservation in spite of the potential political costs of doing so for instance ref 54 shows that water agencies in texas adopted water usage restrictions despite strong political resistance to any policies that restrict water use in contrast to local agencies state governments have a clearer stake in reducing the risks of drought for two reasons first state governments may bear a significant share of the economic costs if droughts are not mitigated including the costs of disaster assistance 59 60 12 12 the national centers for environmental information estimates that the average economic cost that a typical drought episode incurs is approximately 9 5 billion 61 second and perhaps more importantly state governments are not typically subject to the same electoral pressure that local governments face because decision making is local managers of public water agencies come up with recommended actions necessary to achieve their objectives which then must then be approved by locally elected officials local governments are particularly sensitive to potential electoral backlash for promoting unpopular water conservation policies e g ref 62 as described by ref 19 state mandates provide a type of political decoupling 13 13 see refs 63 64 for reviews on how state mandates are characterized in the context considered in this paper the mandate is meant to 1 increase the political acceptance of local conservation efforts by shifting some of the responsibility from the local level to the state level and 2 enforce water agency level conservation through a coercive regulatory approach consisting of a threat of monetary fines and legal action against the water agency as punishment mechanisms for noncompliance using a similar line of reasoning 55 argue that regulation via the utilities commission provides investor owned agencies a similar type of political decoupling insulating investor owned agencies from some of the political pressures that public agencies may face as a result of being directly accountable to voters also using data on the same conservation mandate examined in this study 55 find evidence that investor owned water agencies were more likely to conserve water more than public water agencies during the mandate 3 2 water conservation channels in this section i consider the channels through which local agencies in the water sector can influence customer behavior i assume that residential households i e customers may use water in ways that society deems either non wastefully or wastefully and that they may consume a mix of wasteful and non wasteful units of consumption residential households may change their consumption levels of wasteful units in response to external reward mechanisms such as monetary incentives in response to the pressure from the state mandate water agencies may be motived to directly alter residential households incentives to consume wasteful units through two main channels first water agencies may use one or more demand side management strategies for instance public agencies can increase prices design prices such that higher amounts of consumption are subject to higher prices e g block pricing or design prices such that usage beyond a pre determined amount is effectively subject to a fine e g budget based rates water agencies may also impose usage restrictions that limit the ways in which households are permitted to use water or encourage the adoption of water saving technologies through rebates second households may be sensitive to the enforcement of water agency policies water agencies typically enforce their policies in several ways ranging from following up with customers with high water usage and issuing warnings and penalties if violations occur and persist among other factors household responses to enforcement efforts may vary depending on the credibility of the threat the probability of enforcement and the size of the penalty as a result of the increased pressure from the state mandate water agencies may enhance conservation through channel by dedicating more resources to strictly enforce their policies because promoting conservation through both the demand side management and enforcement channels may be met with social and political pressure public agencies often try to harness a third channel referred to here as the opprobrium channel this third channel relies on the fact that households may also be sensitive to other non monetary external reward mechanisms such as shame or social opprobrium exerted by their peers though non monetary in nature shaming particular uses of a resource can act as an effective increase in the price of the resource public agencies therefore often ask private citizens customers and the public at large to be the eyes and ears of the community by anonymously reporting instances of leaks sightings of water running down the street sprinklers on during the middle of the day or other potential instances of water waste e g glendale water and power individuals exerting social opprobrium may do so in one of two ways individuals may directly exert social pressure on households that they observe to be wasting water through their interactions e g disapproving looks disputes between neighbors social shaming on social media ex ante one expects the cost of directly exerting social opprobrium may be high if the cost of confrontation is high with the advent of shaming using social media tools the costs of engaging in opprobrium may be significantly reduced individuals could also report the observed wasteful consumption to the public agency who could then follow up on the reported instance these actions are not mutually exclusive and would presumably be highly correlated i e one might expect that individuals reporting instances of waste to the local agency are also directly exerting pressure on those they observe to be wasting the resource fig 1 summarizes the channels through which the effects of the mandate on water usage are moderated the effect of enforcement on water conservation is said to be serially mediated because increases in enforcement can not only be induced by the mandate but also through mandate induced increases in opprobrium this pathway represents the extent to which opprobrium was harnessed by water agencies in achieving water conservation the degree to which the effect of enforcement on water usage is serially mediated through opprobrium represents an important policy option for influencing conservation behavior because it allows public agencies to distinguish between wasteful and non wasteful units of consumption though water agencies are able to observe a customer s overall usage they are unable to discern how customers use water moreover water agencies typically observe usage at the end of billing cycles in the water sector billing cycles are typically one or two months following up with households and other enforcement actions may therefore not occur in real time leveraging reports of waste from private citizens could presumably allow water agencies to both better identify and follow up with customers with higher mixes of wasteful units and do so in real time 4 data the main source of data used in this study is from the state s monthly reporting archive these data consist of information for all 393 retail water agencies subject to the mandate the dataset includes each water agency s primary water system identifier assigned by u s environmental protection agency s safe drinking water information system monthly self reported water usage in terms of gpcd average residential usage 2014 water usage levels in terms of gpcd assigned conservation target and an estimate of the number of residential customers the dataset also contains information on the number of reported cases of water waste complaints data related to enforcement and an optional comment section that water agencies could use to provide additional context related to enforcement i supplement these data with additional information to identify characteristics that may influence water agencies incentive to pursue conservation data on the proportion of residential household types obtained from urban water management plans submitted to california s department of water resources in 2015 information on primary water source from u s environmental protection agency s safe drinking water information system 14 14 surface water is listed as the primary source of water if any portion of an agency s water is drawn from surface water and data from california s public utilities commission to identify investor owned water agencies subject to the commission s authority i also supplement these data with information on local drought severity because environ mental conditions are significant drivers of demand for lawn irrigation and outdoor water usage since drought conditions vary by geography otherwise similar water agency service areas may differ in their exposure to severe drought conditions using spatial boundaries for each water utility that i obtain from california s department of water resources i capture each agency s exposure to severe drought conditions using the palmer drought severity index a measure of relative dryness based on a physical water balance model that i obtain from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the 393 water agencies a total of 14 water agencies in the state s database are excluded from the study three because they received exemptions from the initial conservation target and an additional 11 because they did not submit urban water management plans to the california s department of water resources 15 15 only two of the 11 agencies were not required to submit an urban water management plan 4 1 conservation targets as shown in panel a of table 1 the mean cumulative amount of water conservation over the entire period was 25 5 with a standard deviation of 7 2 16 16 aggregate conservation is not necessarily the same as mean conservation i n x i 2015 i n x i 2013 i n x i 2013 1 n i n x i 2015 x i 2013 x i 2013 all of the water agencies in the sample reported at least 6 0 savings by the end of the mandatory conservation period with a maximum savings of 45 4 as shown in panel b 274 of the water agencies subject to the mandate had their conservation targets revised downwards in february 2016 specifically 211 water agencies received automatic climate adjustments and 77 water agencies applied for adjustments of the 77 water agencies 34 received growth adjustments and 35 received drought resilient supply adjustments a total of three applications were denied 65 conservation was not uniformly achieved relative to the assigned conservation targets as shown in panel b water agencies with higher initial conservation targets achieved greater conservation levels but were also generally less successful in meeting their revised targets than those with lower initial targets as shown in panel c of table 1 281 agencies 72 met or were within one percentage point of their conservation standard 65 4 2 complaints reported by the general public as part of their reporting to the state water agencies were required to log the number of publicly reported cases in their monthly reports to the state referred to in the dataset as complaints received in fig 2 panel a i plot a measure of interest in drought shaming obtained from google trends alongside the number of complaints in the data to show that complaints are related to drought shaming the two series are highly correlated of note the drought shaming search term was exclusively searched for in california primarily in the san francisco oakland san jose san diego and los angles metro areas in panel b i plot the number of complaints in the data alongside drought severity measured by the palmer drought severity index complaints seem to decrease as drought conditions ease in addition to measuring private citizen involvement in terms of the number of complaints i also construct a relative measure using the number of complaints received during months before the mandate was implemented i identify a water agency s customer base as having a high amount of water waste complaints if the total number of complaints per capita received is above the median and low otherwise to shed some light on what characteristics may be associated with levels of water waste complaints i provide summary statistics on service area characteristics by level of complaints in appendix a service areas differing in the amount of water waste complaints do not seem to vary substantially along any particular dimension this echoes findings by ref 33 who also show that there are no clear associations between levels of water waste complaints and demographic characteristics 4 3 water agency enforcement water agencies reported several metrics related to how intensely they implemented their policies first they reported on the total number of cases they followed up on referred to in the dataset as follow ups water agencies followed up on cases reported by private citizens complaints received from hotlines or online portals in addition to cases reported by water agency staff the number of follow ups in the data represent the total number of follow up actions and do not distinguish between the two sources water agencies also reported on the number of warnings issued to violators and the number of penalties issued water agencies were also required to report the number of drought surcharge penalties issued referred to as rate penalties 17 17 water agencies define and report information on warnings penalties and rate penalties differently from each other some water agencies defined warnings in ways that overlapped with follow ups or with penalties additionally several definitions of rate penalties emerge though there are discrepancies in the data follow ups are the measure of enforcement that seems to be recorded the most consistently across water agencies i define water agency enforcement in terms of the number of follow ups 66 argue that follow ups reflect the degree to which water agencies convey information about their policies building on this argument i further argue that they also reflect the degree to which water agencies exert effort because they capture instances in which water agencies actively seek out cases of water waste water agencies taking a more active role towards enforcement would theoretically follow up on more cases than were reported or take more than one follow up action for each reported case of water waste 4 4 residential household types the assigned conservation targets were based on residential gallons per capita per day gpcd this approach assumes that water agencies with similar residential gpcd are similar it may be possible however for two water agencies with similar residential gpcds to differ in the proportion of water that is used by their single family customers versus multifamily residential customers in comparing usage characteristics by sector single family residential multi family residential commercial other for five water agencies subject to the conservation mandate 67 find that usage among single family households generally fell whereas multifamily residential water usage remained generally uniform this difference could impact a water agency s ability to conserve therefore i use information from each water agency s urban water management plans submitted to the california s department of water resources in 2015 to calculate the percentage of residential water usage that is single family to control for differences between service areas with similar measures of residential gpcd 4 5 data limitation though the state s dataset provides a unique opportunity to study a large number of water agencies with different incentives to pursue conservation the dataset contains limited information on demand side management strategies that water agencies implemented during the mandate the dataset includes the average number of outdoor watering days permitted and references to the adoption of pricing and other non pricing practices in the optional enforcement comments section from the comments section water agencies used a variety of demand side management strategies to achieve their conservation targets these are summarized in table 2 however most water agencies did not provide any comments because the optional nature of the comments section i am therefore unable to use the comments section to determine demand side management strategies without significantly reducing the number of agencies and potentially introducing sample selection issues 5 the in effectiveness of specific targets on water conservation in this section i assess the extent to which the exogenously imposed state level conservation targets explain conservation outcomes one of the innovations of the conservation mandate adopted by california is that it assigned different conservation targets based on historical per capita water usage gpcd during the summer of 2014 the policy innovation generated quasi experimental variation in the data that can be used to study the role of mandating legislative objectives the analysis in this section exploits discontinuities in the mechanism used to assign conservation targets described in section 2 1 to study the relationship between the legislated conservation targets and the extent to which water agencies were able to conserve water by the end of the mandated conservation period i use a sharp regression discontinuity rd design to estimate local average treatment effects that capture the impact of mandating a higher conservation target relative to a lower target for otherwise similar local agencies 18 18 a key feature of regression discontinuity design is the existence of a score that determines treatment assignment for each unit in the sample given a cutoff score an important feature of the assignment mechanism used by the state is that it essentially generates a random assignment of the treatment among agencies around the cutoffs a potential threat to validity would arise if water agencies were able to self select into particular cutoffs by manipulating their july august 2014 residential gpcd this is unlikely to have been the case for two inter related reasons first the conservation mandate examined in this study is the first mandate in california s history and its structure is different from mandates used in other states to manage drought second water agencies could not have influenced their residential gpcd during july august 2014 in direct anticipation of the mandate the mandate was announced in april of 2015 and was followed by several weeks of public comments public comments were used to formulate the assignment mechanism that was officially adopted in may 2015 though it may be possible that public comments may have resulted in water agencies having some influence over the assignment variable water agencies inability to precisely manipulate it is sufficient to assume that variation in treatment near the cutoffs is random 68 a common practice in the literature estimating regression discontinuity designs with multiple cutoffs is to estimate a pooled regression using a normalized running variable 69 following this convention i compute the distance between agency i s score di and the closest cutoff ci defined in 2 1 agencies with gpcd scores di ci c i c i 1 2 are considered treated and compared to agencies with scores between c i 1 c i 2 and ci applying to all di s normalizes the running variable for all units using a common cutoff of 0 and allows for estimation using a standard rd design the local average treatment effect late is given by τ ˆ lim ξ 0 e y i x i ξ lim ξ 0 e y i x i ξ where τ ˆ represents a weighted average across cutoffs of the local average treatment effects across all units facing each particular cutoff value 70 formally this implies that the average effect of treatment does not vary with higher values of residential gpcd τ ˆ is identified by estimating the following reduced form equation 1 y i d i τ ˆ δ 1 f x i δ 2 f x i d i β 1 w i β 2 x i ε i where di is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if di di ci c i c i 1 2 and 0 otherwise wi low high denotes the level of water waste complaints unlike in the mediation analysis presented in the next section i use the level of complaints in the months prior to the mandate to capture the level of mutual monitoring that is characteristic of the service area in the mediation analysis this measure would be collinear with agency level fixed effects the function f xi is a polynomial of the distance from the cutoff xi in the main specification f xi is a simple linear function 19 19 the estimation results are robust to the order of polynomial chosen the outcome of interest yi is the percentage cumulative water savings achieved by each local agency during the mandatory conservation period relative to their 2013 levels in appendix b i estimate a cutoff specific regression discontinuity design for cumulative cutoffs the results support the findings using the pool and normalize approach following 71 i include additional covariates represented by xi to account for differences among agencies with similar gpcds using a simple covariate adjusted estimator this estimate is consistent under the assumption that the treatment has no mean effect on the covariates at the cutoffs i control for water agency specific characteristics including the percentage of residential water usage that is usually delivered to single family households an indicator variable for whether or not the water agency is investor owned and an indicator variable for whether or not groundwater is the primary source of water i also control for the severity of local drought conditions that each water agency experienced during the mandated conservation period measured as the number of months in extreme drought conditions palmer drought severity index measure of 4 or less as a sensitivity check i also estimate 1 without covariates in appendix c the results for the effect of treatment also qualitatively similar because the effects of public awareness campaigns are likely to have extended beyond the boundaries of a particular water agency i attempt to capture the general effect of public awareness of campaigns using boundaries for nielsen district market areas areas in which households can be expected to have received the same or similar media content e g television radio newspaper internet in the preferred specification i account for media related spillover effects by clustering standard errors at the district market area level 20 20 in california there are 13 district market areas with an average of 27 water agencies per district market area i obtain spatial boundary information for district market areas from gaurav 2016 in appendix table d1 and appendix table d2 i consider alternative approaches to accounting for media related spillover effects in particular i estimate a model where standard errors are clustered at the water agency level and another model where district market area fixed effects are included as controls the results from these alternative approaches are qualitatively similar to the main set of results table 3 provides estimates for key coefficients of 1 as a sensitivity check i provide results for several different distance bandwidths narrowing the bandwidth ensures increased similarly in terms of residential gpcd at the expense of fewer observations the results do not suggest that the differential incentives provided by the mandate had a strong effect though generally statistically insignificant at smaller bandwidths point estimates for the effect of treatment is negative this finding would indicate that water agencies with higher conservation targets generally did not conserve more than similar water agencies with lower targets in fact the results suggest that water agencies with higher conservation targets may have conserved less water than otherwise similar water agencies this may indicate a giving up effect for water agencies that were far enough from their assigned target fig 3 graphically depicts the discontinuity in water conservation induced by the conservation targets turning to the effects of social opprobrium in enforcement the results suggest that social opprobrium improved conservation outcomes all else equal water agencies with higher levels of water waste complaints conserved more than otherwise similar water agencies across most bandwidths water agencies with high levels of pre mandate opprobrium conserved on the order of three percentage points more than water agencies with low levels of complaints these findings suggest that water waste complaints affect the levels of water conservation that water agencies are able to achieve 6 quantifying the impacts of water conservation mandate in this section i complement the previous analysis that examines the effectiveness of the legislated conservation targets with an analysis of the various mechanisms through which water agencies promoted conservation at the local level to do so i use mediation analysis to disentangle the impacts of the channels that mediate the effect of the mandate summarized in fig 1 this approach often used in the policy analysis literature to estimate the underlying mechanisms behind a policy intervention e g ref 12 relies on estimating a causal theoretical framework to disentangle the effects of the various pathways and does not exploit quasi experimental variation in the data using mediation analysis the effects of the various pathways on the outcome of interest can be interpreted as having been generated by the mandate if 1 there is a clear association between the channels and the main outcome of interest and 2 the mandate enhances the use of each channel to show both 1 and 2 i estimate three sets of specifications first i estimate a specification where i decompose the mandate into its sub components to estimate the effects of the mediators on the main outcome of interest water usage to establish the existence of a negative relationship between the mediators and the main outcome of interest second i estimate the effect of the mandate on each of the mediating channels to show that the implementation of the mandate is associated with changes in the use of the various channels lastly i use a structural equation modeling framework to estimate the impact each mediator has on water conservation while accounting for the endogenous relationships depicted in fig 1 the mediation analysis is based on the following linear model 2 w i t α β m t φ t η i ε i t where w i t represents water agency i s aggregate water usage in period t in terms of gallons per capita the variable mt 0 1 takes the value 1 during the mandated conservation period and 0 during the pre mandate period it represents the relationship between the introduction of the mandate and water conservation at the water agency level the parameter β captures the overall impact of the mandate on conservation the model also includes month specific fixed effects φ t to control for seasonality and agency specific fixed effects η i to control for time invariant agency specific characteristics the error term ε i t captures unobserved idiosyncratic shocks decomposing the m t term in 2 into the channels mediating the effect of the mandate yields 3 3 w i t α β d i t γ 1 o i t γ 2 e i t φ t η i ε i t where d i t o i t and e i t respectively represent demand side strategies opprobrium and enforcement given the lack of data on demand side management strategies however i am unable to directly account for the demand side management channel assuming that water agencies increased the use of demand side management strategies following the implementation of the mandate as a means to reduce water usage the effects of the demand side management channel would largely be captured by mt i therefore treat the unmediated link between the mandate and water usage as a proxy for demand side management strategies notwithstanding it is possible that the effect of mt may also capture other factors that reduced water usage unrelated to demand side management strategies the coefficient β should be therefore be interpreted as an upper bound on the effect of demand side management strategies replacing d i t with mt i estimate 4 to show that the channels mediating the effect of the mandate are negatively associated with water usage 4 w i t α β m t γ 1 o i t γ 2 e i t φ t η i ε i t in 4 the interpretation of the variable mt changes relative to its interpretation in 3 it represents the direct unmediated link between pressure to conserve introduced by the mandate and water conservation at the water agency level if mt captures other factors unrelated to demand side management strategies that reduced water usage the coefficient β would be upwards biased using m t as a proxy for demand management may therefore potentially overstate their impact following this i estimate three separate equations given by 5 to show an association between the implementation of the mandate and each of the mediating channels 5 y i t α β m t φ t η i ε i t where y i t represents opprobrium o i t enforcement e i t and water usage w i t table 4 show the results for the estimation of 4 in panel a and 5 in panel b the results highlight that the amount of enforcement opprobrium and water conservation are all significantly associated with the pressure induced by the mandate panel a shows how the outcomes of interest changed during the mandatory conservation period for all water agencies the results also highlight that pressure induced by the mandate is strongly and positively associated with levels of both enforcement and complaints panel b shows how the outcomes of interest changed during the mandatory conservation period for all water agencies when controlling for month specific and water agency specific influences the preferred specification the results show the pressure from the mandate period is associated with a decrease in water consumption of approximately 21 gallons per month per capita the results also highlight that pressure induced by the mandate is strongly and positively associated with levels of both enforcement and complaints in appendix e i re estimate 4 and 5 interacting the mandate term with the initially assigned conservation targets to allow for heterogeneous effects at the various tiers the results are consistent with those in table 4 and show that mandating higher target levels are associated with higher levels conservation to account for endogeneity i use a structural equation modeling framework to estimate the channel specific effects on water usage the model is described by the following system of equations given by 6 o i t α 0 β 0 m t γ 0 s i t φ t η i ε i t e i t α e β 1 e m t β 2 e o i t γ e s i t φ t η i ε i t 6 w i t α w β 1 w m t β 2 w o i t β 3 w e i t γ w s i t φ t η i ε i t where s i t represents drought severity for water agency i in month t the system of equations estimated simultaneously models the various relationships between opprobrium enforcement and water usage summarized in fig 1 the results from the mediation analysis shown in table 5 indicate that the effect of the mandate on water conservations operated primarily through the demand side management channel the estimated direct effect of the mandate is associated with a reduction of aggregate water usage on the order of 16 37 residential gpcd notwithstanding the results also show that the mediating effects of opprobrium are not only statistically significant but also economically relevant the mandate increased levels by opprobrium by 2 29 β 1 0 and each percent increase in levels of complaints is associated with a 0 93 decrease β 2 w in residential gpcd the opprobrium channel computed as β 1 0 β 2 w resulted in a decrease in residential water usage of approximately 2 13 gallons per capita per day gpcd the serially mediated effect of opprobrium through local agency enforcement computed as β 1 o β 2 e β 3 w suggests a decrease in water usage of approximately 1 75 gpcd of note the effect of enforcement of the enforcement channel without the opprobrium channel computed as β 1 e β 3 w is only 0 34 residential gpcd 7 discussion and conclusion higher level governments often use mandates to impose safeguards and mitigate the waste of scarce resources policy makers and local agencies are interested in understanding the impact of such policies and the mechanisms that drive their effectiveness in this paper i study the effectiveness of legislating explicit conservation objectives and assess the impact of the various mechanisms that drive conservation using data for california water agencies subjected to a year long emergency water conservation mandate 2015 2016 the policy provided exogenous variation in the assigned conservation targets i start by explore how cumulative conservation over the course of the mandate differs by exogenously assigned conservation targets next i investigate two potential drivers of local water conservation enforcement actions taken by the water agencies measured in terms of follow up actions and the degree to which local communities called out wasteful water consumption complaints in this paper there are three main findings first i find that mandating higher targets alone did not lead to higher water conservation though water agencies with higher exogenously set conservation targets generally conserved more a regression discontinuity analysis shows that water agencies with higher conservation targets generally did not conserve more than otherwise similar water agencies with lower targets this result suggests that higher pressure for water conservation on agencies may not alter equilibrium consumption this analysis also provides evidence that water agencies servicing areas with more customer driven complaints regarding water waste were able to conserve more there are several potential explanations for the finding regarding the ineffectiveness of mandating higher targets one possible explanation is that the rd design is underpowered at narrower bandwidths thus making it difficult to detect small increases in conservation by water agencies with higher conservation targets this explanation would suggest that conservation targets at each of the cutoffs may not have been high enough to induce large amounts of conservation though beyond the scope of this paper this explanation would suggest that a better understanding of the process through which the cutoff values are set is needed viewed from a principal agent perspective another explanation is that it was difficult for the state to enforce its policies with water agencies though the state could observe and contract upon outcomes the importance of fines for municipalities that failed to achieve mandated reductions is unclear to my knowledge the state only pursued legal action against four of the water agencies for failing to comply with their mandated conservation target 21 21 see ref 72 for an example of formal legal action this explanation would point to the state governments need for local agency cooperation to achieve desired policy objectives i e water conservation second i find that the majority of the decrease in water usage can likely be attributed to the demand side management strategies adopted during the mandate unfortunately the state dataset primarily consisted of information on enforcement and does not include information on the demand side management strategies adopted by water agencies across the state in spite of a large and growing literature on demand management strategies for managing water demand there is much uncertainty regarding the relative efficacy of these strategies moreover little is known regarding how social opprobrium can be harnessed as a demand management strategy future reporting requirements should also aim to systematically collect information on the var ious demand side management strategies to better understand these dynamics in the context of promoting conservation lastly an investigation of the mechanisms related to enforcement reveals that a significant amount of the conservation gains can be explained by differences in the extent to which private citizens complained about other people s wasteful consumption i e social opprobrium a mediation analysis shows that 1 the mandate period is found to be associated with a significant increase in complaints regarding wasteful water consumption submitted to local agencies 2 that enforcement actions taken by local agencies that led to water conservation were significantly impacted by local social opprobrium and 3 that changes in local social opprobrium during the mandate period also independently lead to reductions in aggregate agency level water usage thus the results suggest that social opprobrium is an important driver of water conservation the relevance of social opprobrium in the context of conservation is consistent with previous work that finds that extracting agents operating in complex social networks can be pressured into complying depending on the population of compliers and the nature of the network 73 what drives opprobrium a plausible explanation for this type of behavior is that people who lodge a water waste complaint are likely driven by nosy preferences i e preferences that depend on the actions of others e g refs 74 75 customers with these preferences may be outraged over water waste a perceived moral norm violation and express their preferences through overt opprobrium or through anonymous online reports moreover availability of digital media platforms and anonymous reporting mechanisms can amplify the expression of moral outrage in part by reducing individual level costs 76 this explanation is consistent with anecdotal evidence social media posts news reports during the study period related to drought shaming e g ref 47 from a policy perspective the findings regarding the significance of local opprobrium points to the potential for water agencies to harness citizen outrage and provide an opportunity for citizens with nosy preferences to be part of the enforcement process notably water agencies could presumably leverage reported instances of wasted water to identify and follow up with customers with high water usage in real time without expending resources on staff to drive around neighborhoods looking for water waste though harnessing social opprobrium may seem promising there may be some significant drawbacks that suggest caution for instance there may be nontrivial psychological costs associated with the use of social opprobrium to pressure people into conserving water in the energy sector for example 77 find that a significant number of people exhibit a positive willingness to pay wtp to stop receiving social comparison reports in energy because of a negative perception of the state nudging them to do the right thing relatedly heavy reliance on social opprobrium may also make people feel uneasy 33 use the term participatory surveillance to describe using a system based on complaints to curb water usage a potential avenue for future work would be to consider the welfare effects of social opprobrium as a water conservation tool moreover social opprobrium may not appropriately target households using large volumes of water on low value activities for example it could be the case that some water users who are shamed for wasting water may not be high water users overall conversely it could also be the case that high water users may take precautions to avoid outward signs of water usage e g watering at night more sophisticated interventions that would enable the use of data analytic techniques to monitor water usage in real time e g installation of smart meters with an automated meter infrastructure system may better support water conservation efforts author statement this paper has one sole author declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a service area characteristics in this section i provide summary statistics on service area characteristics that may be associated with water waste complaints defined in terms of the median level of per capita water waste com plaints prior to the start of the state mandate for water conservation in particular i provide summary statistics on four categories of characteristics first i provide information on the average amounts of water that water agencies generally provide to various customer classes obtained from their 2015 urban water management plans submitted to ca department of water resources second i provide information regarding density using a variety of metrics i construct two simple measures of density the first defined in terms of population per square mile and the second in terms of the number of service connections per square mile the numerator used for these measures are obtained from us environmental protection agency s safe drinking water information system the denominator area is computed using gis from spatial maps of each water agency s service area boundaries i also provide information on the percentage of people for whom their work commutes exceed 1 h using data at the us census block group level 22 22 census data is obtained from us census obtained from ipums national historic geographic information system nhgis using data from 2015 american community survey 5 year 2011 2015 estimates 78 third i also compare service areas using a measure of geographic isolation developed by ref 79 at the us census tract level this measure is meant to capture geographical differences based on measures that correlate strongly with population density and access to resources in relative close proximity lastly i compare measures social and demographic characteristics at the us census block group level these characteristics include race education and per capita income and information on housing characteristics also at the us census block group level as shown in in appendix table a1 service areas with high water waste complaints had higher average levels of conservation both prior to and during the mandated conservation period but do not seem to significantly differ along any of the characteristics examined this is consistent with findings by ref 33 appendix table a1

21 notes the level of water waste complaints is defined in terms of the total number of complaints per capita received prior to the start of the mandate in june 2015 the level of water waste complaints is defined in terms of the overall median level agencies with a total number of complaints per capita received above the median are labeled as high and low otherwise us census estimates are

specific regression discontinuity i also explore the effect of treatment at each of the specified cutoffs 23 23 this model is estimated using the rdmulti routine in stata 80 given that the assignment of conservation targets treatment is based on a deterministic function of water agencies summer 2014 residential gpcd i follow 69 in estimating a regression discontinuity with cumulative cutoffs using this framework identification of average effects at each cutoff c i c k is given by τ ˆ lim ξ c j e y i x i ξ lim ξ c j e y i x i ξ bandwidths are chosen to restrict observations around each cutoff such that no observation is below or above the preceding or following cutoff respectively for example the maximum range around the second cutoff 80 is restricted to residential gpcd values between 65 and 94 not doing so would result in inconsistent estimators 69 as shown in appendix fig b1 the point estimates for the effect of receiving a higher conservation target at the various cutoffs is negative though generally not statistically different from zero the estimate at the fifth cutoff comparing agencies with a 24 target with those receiving a 28 at the 130 residential gpcd cutoff is negative and statistically significant the results of this estimation are robust to the choice of bandwidth choice of kernel and inclusion of various sets of covariates and support the pooled

8636,in this paper i investigate the joint impacts of top down targets and social opprobrium on aggregate compliance with government mandates for resource conservation i use data on urban water usage local agency enforcement and reports of water waste by private citizens in california during a period of severe drought in which a year long mandate for water conservation was imposed during the mandate private citizens engaged in opprobrium by drought shaming customers engaged in water waste i find that increases in complaints regarding water waste led to increases in follow up actions by local agencies increased levels of cumulative water conservation and increased compliance with state mandated targets the findings suggest that private citizen involvement in the form of social opprobrium is an important aspect of local agency compliance keywords urban water management drought water conservation mandates social opprobrium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction local agencies e g municipalities may make decisions based on short term objectives that often result in socially inefficient outcomes e g ref 1 consequently higher level government institutions e g state agencies intervene to coordinate local actions through centralized top down mandates with specific requirements 2 yet in spite of higher level government mandates real world outcomes often fall short of legislative objectives because local agencies priorities diverge from those of higher level governments 3 4 1 1 diverging priorities are especially prominent in the context of planning for natural hazards 5 7 in the water sector local outcomes may be improved through citizen involvement in this paper i provide new insights into the dynamics of centralized government mandates i use data on urban water agencies often referred to as water utilities or systems in california subject to a drought related conservation mandate executive order eo b 29 15 henceforth referred to as the conservation mandate 2 2 in the united states states have the legal authority to establish priorities for how water is used among users at various spatial scales e g ref 8 these data allow me to shed light on two distinct aspects of the conservation mandate 1 the extent to which state level legislative objectives explain conservation outcomes and 2 the role that citizen involvement may play during droughts during droughts households are often encouraged to anonymously report instances in which other households are using water in ways that are deemed wasteful this form of mutual monitoring allows end users an active role in promoting conservation by exerting social pressure on other end users i e social opprobrium depending on the situation the entity that establishes the reporting mechanism could be a water agency state or regional government and or a grassroots movement this study features three novel characteristics first the conservation mandate studied in this paper is the first state mandate for water conservation in the history of california a state chronically affected by droughts it was the first in a series of policy decisions to promote conservation as a way of life in california 3 3 making conservation a way of life is a slogan used by california s department of water resources and state water resource control board learning from california s experience as to the effectiveness of mandating specific conservation objectives on agency level water savings is important because droughts are expected to increase in intensity frequency and duration especially in regions like california that are already water scarce 9 second the design of the conservation mandate provides an opportunity to study a large number of heterogeneous local agencies faced with different externally imposed incentives to conserve water under a common drought shock instead of taking a one size fits all approach by uniformly applying the 25 target to all water agencies each water agency was assigned a different conservation target using a multi threshold assignment rule based on the average amount of water used by residential users measured in terms of residential gallons per capita per day gpcd 10 4 4 failure to meet these targets would result in monetary fines however the extent to which the assignment of higher targets led to increased conservation is unclear because there were many cases of both over and under compliance though urban water agencies collectively conserved water by 24 5 over the course of the mandated conservation period just shy of the intended 25 objective approximately 18 of water agencies subjected to the state mandate conserved water by more than 10 points above the conservation target assigned to them over compliance while 28 failed to meet their target under compliance third concurrent with a widespread grassroots movement the state encouraged households to publicly and anonymously shame those who used water in ways deemed wasteful 11 during the state mandate ordinary members of society engaged in drought shaming a form of peer to peer opprobrium where individuals complained about users wasting water on dedicated online platforms e g local agency website or phone app or social media platforms e g twitter with a dedicated hashtag complaints often either implicitly or explicitly identified people individuals engaged in drought shaming took photographs of instances of water waste and shared these images on these platforms to exert pressure on discretionary outdoor water usage 11 to harness some of the outrage against wasting water the state set up an online portal where individuals could lodge water waste complaints in this study i use data from the online state platform these data capture the total number of water waste complaints that are reported to the state online platform directly by individuals or indirectly by water agencies though drought shaming tweets are not included in the state online platform and thus are not analyzed as part of this study the data from the state platform provides an opportunity to understand the role of citizen involvement in driving conservation related behavior empirically i first study the extent to which exogenously legislated determined top down targets imposed by the state explain local agencies cumulative water conservation i do so by exploiting quasi experimental policy variation in the assignment of the targets to compare local agencies with similar characteristics but with different conservation targets i then complement this analysis by studying the causal mechanisms behind water conservation namely social opprobrium and local agency enforcement i e follow up actions using mediation analysis an approach commonly used in the policy evaluation literature 12 both sets of analyses provide evidence that citizen complaints are informative water agencies are more likely to follow up on cases of water waste in areas with increased complaints and have higher levels of conservation my findings are two fold first i do not find that mandating specific conservation objectives necessarily leads to more water conservation second i find that social opprobrium was an impactful channel through which communities conserved water during the mandated conservation period notably the results suggest that enforcement actions driven by complaints contributed to water conservation on the order of 1 75 residential gallons per capita per day gpcd whereas enforcement actions not driven by complaints contributed to water conservation of 0 34 residential gpcd in this context citizen involvement in the enforcement process appears to be an important and perhaps overlooked aspect of local agency compliance this paper contributes to several different literatures by studying a state mandate for water conservation this paper contributes to the vast literature on environmental federalism for a review see ref 13 decentralized management of water and other natural resources is often promoted as a policy objective because local agencies have better knowledge of and more responsive to the environmental and socio economic problems that they face than do higher level government institutions 14 18 in the context of scarce water resources local water agencies face significant financial and socio political disincentives to aggressively pursue conservation and often choose to delay implementing conservation measures a state mandate for water conservation would 1 increase political acceptance of local conservation efforts by shifting some of the responsibility from local water agencies to the state agency and 2 re align financial incentives through the threat of monetary fines and legal action against a water agency as punishment for noncompliance 5 5 this characterization is based on 19 conceptual framework of state approaches for managing natural hazard risks previous work on environmental federalism related to water has explored the problems of institutional uncertainty e g ref 20 and transboundary pollution 21 22 to my knowledge this literature does not address the context of water scarcity this paper also contributes to the literature on water demand which has explored households extrinsic motivations to conserve studies on extrinsic motivations have explored household responses to demand side management strategies e g refs 23 29 to my knowledge the literature on demand side management does not explore peer to peer influence such as social opprobrium which has been shown to have an effect in the water and sanitation literature e g ref 30 and in environmental conservation efforts e g ref 31 brühl and visser 32 document a similar public shaming campaign in cape town south africa but are unable to study the extent to which this campaign contributed to conservation outcomes using the same data as this study zhang teodoro and switzer 33 examine how socio demographic characteristics e g communities income income distributions and racial ethnic compositions correlate with overall reporting and document a positive association between water waste complaints and conservation outcomes they do not attempt to disentangle how much public shaming contributed to conservation outcomes this paper also contributes to a growing literature on citizen complaints in other environmental contexts and the broader literature on monitoring and enforcement as determinants of regulatory behavior e g ref 34 this literature generally focuses on the relationship between regulators and private actors studies in this literature generally find that complaints can play a nontrivial role in environmental regulation regulators are more likely to catch violations that result from following up on a citizen complaint relative to an average inspection e g refs 35 36 to my knowledge this is the first paper to study the relationships between local agencies their customers and their regulators in the context of a mandate for water conservation by shedding light on the role of engaging private citizens as partners in achieving policy objectives this paper also contributes to work on customer buy in that spans several disciplines including public economics e g ref 37 public administration e g refs 38 41 and urban planning e g ref 42 in these works scholars argue that individuals are more likely to engage in moral or ethical acts when the community is involved in monitoring behavior the results of this study support this argument as compliance with mandates seems to have been easier in services areas where individuals helped promote social norms around conservation through drought shaming in this light the lessons learned from studying the role of customer driven complaints during california s drought could be generalized to contexts where compliance with mandated requirements may be supported by the promulgation of social norms through opprobrium and mutual monitoring from the general public 2 background 2 1 institutional setting in response to the severity of the ongoing drought governor jerry brown signed executive order b 29 15 on april 1st 2015 6 6 a copy of the executive order can be found at https www waterboards ca gov waterrights water issues programs drought docs 040115 executive order pdf the policy mandated that all large urban water agencies serving at least 3000 residential connections collectively conserve water by 25 from june 2015 to february 2016 relative to water usage over the same time period in 2013 43 to induce conservation the state introduced tier based targets based on ranges of average residential gallons per capita per day gpcd during july september 2014 10 7 7 residential gallons per capita per day is calculated as total water sold to the residential sector divided by the service area population this approach has been commonly used to measure efficiency in previous conservation efforts e g ca water conservation act 2009 and is also the basis for current policies 44 each urban water agency in the state was assigned a conservation target that ranged between 8 and 36 the rule that the state used to assign conservation targets can be expressed by the following piecewise function s di where the variable di represents water agency i s residential gpcd in the summer of 2014 using exogenously determined cutoffs ci s d i 8 0 d i 65 12 65 d i 80 16 80 d i 95 20 95 d i 110 24 110 d i 130 28 130 d i 170 32 170 d i 215 36 215 d i in february 2016 the mandate was extended through may 2016 as part of the extension the state adopted a resolution to provide water agencies with the opportunity to have their initially assigned conservation standard adjusted downward the adjustments made to conservation targets are meant to reflect exogenous information affect their ability to conserve that should have been taken into account when designing the initial cutoffs 45 8 8 adjustments to the targets were made to reflect 1 differences in climate measured in terms of differences between average service area evapotranspiration and the statewide average during july through september 2015 2 water efficient growth in population plus additional commercial and agricultural service connections and 3 the establishment of new local drought resilient water sources e g water reuse 45 climate adjustments were applied automatically whereas water agencies had to supply the state with additional documentation and evidence to qualify for adjustments on the basis of water efficient growth or new local drought resilient water sources the cap for all possible adjustments per water agency was set at 8 points 45 the revised conservation targets were in effect during the last three months of the mandate march through the end of may 2016 for the main set of analyses presented in this paper the revised conservation targets are used as the relevant targets the institutional setup of california s conservation mandate consists of three main actors the designated state agency responsible for carrying out the state mandate water agencies subject to the mandate and residential customers end users the designated state agency the state water resource control board henceforth referred to as the state mandated conservation targets in response water agencies would presumably increase efforts to encourage their customers end users to conserve water in response to actions taken by water agencies end users could conserve or not which determines water agencies conservation outcomes as part of the mandate water agencies were required to generate monthly reports that included information on local agency level water usage in terms of gpcd and enforcement the information included in these reports at the service provider by month level is the primary dataset used in this study provide an opportunity to study california s experience with its conservation mandate the state monitored water agencies progress with their assigned target by tracking water agencies total monthly potable water usage levels 9 9 the swrcb sent monthly warning letters to water agencies between 1 and 5 points below their assigned target and notices of violations to those more than 5 points below their assigned target water agencies who were within 1 point or that had conserved in excess of their target received notices of congratulations water agencies performance was ultimately judged at the end of the mandate in may 2016 consequences for failing to be in compliance with the mandate ranged from providing the state with information documenting their efforts to hefty fines of up to 10 000 a day 46 2 2 context on drought shaming in the year prior to the mandate 2014 2015 people began expressing their outrage over excess water usage during a severe drought through drought shaming people engaging in this type of public shaming took pictures of visible instances of water waste and posted them on online platforms e g twitter with the hashtag droughtshame or droughtshaming though people engaged in drought shaming for situations where trace amounts of water trickled onto pavements most instances of drought shaming are attributable to specific individuals such as neighbors or other residents e g ref 47 in parallel to the mandate the state also set up savewater ca gov to support the response to drought the website often referred to in the media as a drought shaming platform lets anyone easily report water waste from his or her phone tablet or computer the water waste report is directed to the water agency serving the location where the report was made customers can report instances of water waste without knowing the name of the local water agency or how to contact them 10 10 the state portal for reporting instances water waste can be accessed at https savewater ca gov the only information required to lodge a complaint is the nature of the observed water waste and the address at which it is observed there was also an option of attaching pictures water agencies are then able to search for their service area and then follow up on these complaints and potentially issue warnings or fines individuals could also complain about water waste directly to their local agency many water agencies set up their own local hotlines and portals water agencies then provided information on the number of these complaints to the state the data used in this study consist of the aggregated number of complaints reported to the state in each month for each water agency i e complaints lodged using the state online portal whether directly reported by individuals or indirectly by water agencies it does not include twitter data or complaints lodged using other third party platforms 3 theoretical framework 3 1 water agency dis incentives for water conservation water agencies both public and private operate under a dual responsibility of providing safe and reliable services at affordable rates while also remaining financially solvent public water agencies are generally non profit entities managed by local governments whereas private agencies also referred to as investor owned agencies are for profit entities managed by investors investor owned agencies are subject to the oversight of the state s public utility commission water agencies faced with water shortages can either taking their water supply constraints as binding and encourage their customers to use less water i e promote conservation or by attempting to unbind the supply constraint by increasing available water supplies i e supply augmentation supply augmentation involves investments in infrastructure to stem leaks the construction of large scale infrastructure projects such as dams reservoirs desalination facilities 11 11 the australian government for instance invested billions of dollars in alternative water sources such as recycling and desalination to diversify their water supply portfolio during the millennium drought 48 investments in water reuse and inter basin water transfers e g ref 49 though supply augmentation projects may do little to alleviate short term need because they are typically less flexible and longer term in nature incentives to increase capacity are often stronger than those to pursue conservation despite water agency managers goal of ensuring continuity of service and prevent supplies falling below minimum reserve levels i e running out of water 50 water agencies face several disincentives to aggressively pursue conservation first aggressive conservation reduces revenue as less water is sold reductions in revenue can be substantial the total amount of forgone net revenue due to conservation during the course of the mandate is estimated to have been more than 500 million 51 more importantly reductions in revenue puts financial pressure on water agencies many of which are already financially insecure 52 second aggressively pursuing conservation may also be met with social and political pressure to which water agency managers may be sensitive 53 55 for example residential customers may resist restrictions on water usage because of either strong preferences for lush green lawns or a perceived threat to lifestyles 56 due to these pressures water agency managers often delay pursuing conservation as long as possible 57 weigh ing the risks of delay against potential public relations problems 58 notwithstanding there is evidence that water agencies do voluntarily pursue conservation in spite of the potential political costs of doing so for instance ref 54 shows that water agencies in texas adopted water usage restrictions despite strong political resistance to any policies that restrict water use in contrast to local agencies state governments have a clearer stake in reducing the risks of drought for two reasons first state governments may bear a significant share of the economic costs if droughts are not mitigated including the costs of disaster assistance 59 60 12 12 the national centers for environmental information estimates that the average economic cost that a typical drought episode incurs is approximately 9 5 billion 61 second and perhaps more importantly state governments are not typically subject to the same electoral pressure that local governments face because decision making is local managers of public water agencies come up with recommended actions necessary to achieve their objectives which then must then be approved by locally elected officials local governments are particularly sensitive to potential electoral backlash for promoting unpopular water conservation policies e g ref 62 as described by ref 19 state mandates provide a type of political decoupling 13 13 see refs 63 64 for reviews on how state mandates are characterized in the context considered in this paper the mandate is meant to 1 increase the political acceptance of local conservation efforts by shifting some of the responsibility from the local level to the state level and 2 enforce water agency level conservation through a coercive regulatory approach consisting of a threat of monetary fines and legal action against the water agency as punishment mechanisms for noncompliance using a similar line of reasoning 55 argue that regulation via the utilities commission provides investor owned agencies a similar type of political decoupling insulating investor owned agencies from some of the political pressures that public agencies may face as a result of being directly accountable to voters also using data on the same conservation mandate examined in this study 55 find evidence that investor owned water agencies were more likely to conserve water more than public water agencies during the mandate 3 2 water conservation channels in this section i consider the channels through which local agencies in the water sector can influence customer behavior i assume that residential households i e customers may use water in ways that society deems either non wastefully or wastefully and that they may consume a mix of wasteful and non wasteful units of consumption residential households may change their consumption levels of wasteful units in response to external reward mechanisms such as monetary incentives in response to the pressure from the state mandate water agencies may be motived to directly alter residential households incentives to consume wasteful units through two main channels first water agencies may use one or more demand side management strategies for instance public agencies can increase prices design prices such that higher amounts of consumption are subject to higher prices e g block pricing or design prices such that usage beyond a pre determined amount is effectively subject to a fine e g budget based rates water agencies may also impose usage restrictions that limit the ways in which households are permitted to use water or encourage the adoption of water saving technologies through rebates second households may be sensitive to the enforcement of water agency policies water agencies typically enforce their policies in several ways ranging from following up with customers with high water usage and issuing warnings and penalties if violations occur and persist among other factors household responses to enforcement efforts may vary depending on the credibility of the threat the probability of enforcement and the size of the penalty as a result of the increased pressure from the state mandate water agencies may enhance conservation through channel by dedicating more resources to strictly enforce their policies because promoting conservation through both the demand side management and enforcement channels may be met with social and political pressure public agencies often try to harness a third channel referred to here as the opprobrium channel this third channel relies on the fact that households may also be sensitive to other non monetary external reward mechanisms such as shame or social opprobrium exerted by their peers though non monetary in nature shaming particular uses of a resource can act as an effective increase in the price of the resource public agencies therefore often ask private citizens customers and the public at large to be the eyes and ears of the community by anonymously reporting instances of leaks sightings of water running down the street sprinklers on during the middle of the day or other potential instances of water waste e g glendale water and power individuals exerting social opprobrium may do so in one of two ways individuals may directly exert social pressure on households that they observe to be wasting water through their interactions e g disapproving looks disputes between neighbors social shaming on social media ex ante one expects the cost of directly exerting social opprobrium may be high if the cost of confrontation is high with the advent of shaming using social media tools the costs of engaging in opprobrium may be significantly reduced individuals could also report the observed wasteful consumption to the public agency who could then follow up on the reported instance these actions are not mutually exclusive and would presumably be highly correlated i e one might expect that individuals reporting instances of waste to the local agency are also directly exerting pressure on those they observe to be wasting the resource fig 1 summarizes the channels through which the effects of the mandate on water usage are moderated the effect of enforcement on water conservation is said to be serially mediated because increases in enforcement can not only be induced by the mandate but also through mandate induced increases in opprobrium this pathway represents the extent to which opprobrium was harnessed by water agencies in achieving water conservation the degree to which the effect of enforcement on water usage is serially mediated through opprobrium represents an important policy option for influencing conservation behavior because it allows public agencies to distinguish between wasteful and non wasteful units of consumption though water agencies are able to observe a customer s overall usage they are unable to discern how customers use water moreover water agencies typically observe usage at the end of billing cycles in the water sector billing cycles are typically one or two months following up with households and other enforcement actions may therefore not occur in real time leveraging reports of waste from private citizens could presumably allow water agencies to both better identify and follow up with customers with higher mixes of wasteful units and do so in real time 4 data the main source of data used in this study is from the state s monthly reporting archive these data consist of information for all 393 retail water agencies subject to the mandate the dataset includes each water agency s primary water system identifier assigned by u s environmental protection agency s safe drinking water information system monthly self reported water usage in terms of gpcd average residential usage 2014 water usage levels in terms of gpcd assigned conservation target and an estimate of the number of residential customers the dataset also contains information on the number of reported cases of water waste complaints data related to enforcement and an optional comment section that water agencies could use to provide additional context related to enforcement i supplement these data with additional information to identify characteristics that may influence water agencies incentive to pursue conservation data on the proportion of residential household types obtained from urban water management plans submitted to california s department of water resources in 2015 information on primary water source from u s environmental protection agency s safe drinking water information system 14 14 surface water is listed as the primary source of water if any portion of an agency s water is drawn from surface water and data from california s public utilities commission to identify investor owned water agencies subject to the commission s authority i also supplement these data with information on local drought severity because environ mental conditions are significant drivers of demand for lawn irrigation and outdoor water usage since drought conditions vary by geography otherwise similar water agency service areas may differ in their exposure to severe drought conditions using spatial boundaries for each water utility that i obtain from california s department of water resources i capture each agency s exposure to severe drought conditions using the palmer drought severity index a measure of relative dryness based on a physical water balance model that i obtain from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration of the 393 water agencies a total of 14 water agencies in the state s database are excluded from the study three because they received exemptions from the initial conservation target and an additional 11 because they did not submit urban water management plans to the california s department of water resources 15 15 only two of the 11 agencies were not required to submit an urban water management plan 4 1 conservation targets as shown in panel a of table 1 the mean cumulative amount of water conservation over the entire period was 25 5 with a standard deviation of 7 2 16 16 aggregate conservation is not necessarily the same as mean conservation i n x i 2015 i n x i 2013 i n x i 2013 1 n i n x i 2015 x i 2013 x i 2013 all of the water agencies in the sample reported at least 6 0 savings by the end of the mandatory conservation period with a maximum savings of 45 4 as shown in panel b 274 of the water agencies subject to the mandate had their conservation targets revised downwards in february 2016 specifically 211 water agencies received automatic climate adjustments and 77 water agencies applied for adjustments of the 77 water agencies 34 received growth adjustments and 35 received drought resilient supply adjustments a total of three applications were denied 65 conservation was not uniformly achieved relative to the assigned conservation targets as shown in panel b water agencies with higher initial conservation targets achieved greater conservation levels but were also generally less successful in meeting their revised targets than those with lower initial targets as shown in panel c of table 1 281 agencies 72 met or were within one percentage point of their conservation standard 65 4 2 complaints reported by the general public as part of their reporting to the state water agencies were required to log the number of publicly reported cases in their monthly reports to the state referred to in the dataset as complaints received in fig 2 panel a i plot a measure of interest in drought shaming obtained from google trends alongside the number of complaints in the data to show that complaints are related to drought shaming the two series are highly correlated of note the drought shaming search term was exclusively searched for in california primarily in the san francisco oakland san jose san diego and los angles metro areas in panel b i plot the number of complaints in the data alongside drought severity measured by the palmer drought severity index complaints seem to decrease as drought conditions ease in addition to measuring private citizen involvement in terms of the number of complaints i also construct a relative measure using the number of complaints received during months before the mandate was implemented i identify a water agency s customer base as having a high amount of water waste complaints if the total number of complaints per capita received is above the median and low otherwise to shed some light on what characteristics may be associated with levels of water waste complaints i provide summary statistics on service area characteristics by level of complaints in appendix a service areas differing in the amount of water waste complaints do not seem to vary substantially along any particular dimension this echoes findings by ref 33 who also show that there are no clear associations between levels of water waste complaints and demographic characteristics 4 3 water agency enforcement water agencies reported several metrics related to how intensely they implemented their policies first they reported on the total number of cases they followed up on referred to in the dataset as follow ups water agencies followed up on cases reported by private citizens complaints received from hotlines or online portals in addition to cases reported by water agency staff the number of follow ups in the data represent the total number of follow up actions and do not distinguish between the two sources water agencies also reported on the number of warnings issued to violators and the number of penalties issued water agencies were also required to report the number of drought surcharge penalties issued referred to as rate penalties 17 17 water agencies define and report information on warnings penalties and rate penalties differently from each other some water agencies defined warnings in ways that overlapped with follow ups or with penalties additionally several definitions of rate penalties emerge though there are discrepancies in the data follow ups are the measure of enforcement that seems to be recorded the most consistently across water agencies i define water agency enforcement in terms of the number of follow ups 66 argue that follow ups reflect the degree to which water agencies convey information about their policies building on this argument i further argue that they also reflect the degree to which water agencies exert effort because they capture instances in which water agencies actively seek out cases of water waste water agencies taking a more active role towards enforcement would theoretically follow up on more cases than were reported or take more than one follow up action for each reported case of water waste 4 4 residential household types the assigned conservation targets were based on residential gallons per capita per day gpcd this approach assumes that water agencies with similar residential gpcd are similar it may be possible however for two water agencies with similar residential gpcds to differ in the proportion of water that is used by their single family customers versus multifamily residential customers in comparing usage characteristics by sector single family residential multi family residential commercial other for five water agencies subject to the conservation mandate 67 find that usage among single family households generally fell whereas multifamily residential water usage remained generally uniform this difference could impact a water agency s ability to conserve therefore i use information from each water agency s urban water management plans submitted to the california s department of water resources in 2015 to calculate the percentage of residential water usage that is single family to control for differences between service areas with similar measures of residential gpcd 4 5 data limitation though the state s dataset provides a unique opportunity to study a large number of water agencies with different incentives to pursue conservation the dataset contains limited information on demand side management strategies that water agencies implemented during the mandate the dataset includes the average number of outdoor watering days permitted and references to the adoption of pricing and other non pricing practices in the optional enforcement comments section from the comments section water agencies used a variety of demand side management strategies to achieve their conservation targets these are summarized in table 2 however most water agencies did not provide any comments because the optional nature of the comments section i am therefore unable to use the comments section to determine demand side management strategies without significantly reducing the number of agencies and potentially introducing sample selection issues 5 the in effectiveness of specific targets on water conservation in this section i assess the extent to which the exogenously imposed state level conservation targets explain conservation outcomes one of the innovations of the conservation mandate adopted by california is that it assigned different conservation targets based on historical per capita water usage gpcd during the summer of 2014 the policy innovation generated quasi experimental variation in the data that can be used to study the role of mandating legislative objectives the analysis in this section exploits discontinuities in the mechanism used to assign conservation targets described in section 2 1 to study the relationship between the legislated conservation targets and the extent to which water agencies were able to conserve water by the end of the mandated conservation period i use a sharp regression discontinuity rd design to estimate local average treatment effects that capture the impact of mandating a higher conservation target relative to a lower target for otherwise similar local agencies 18 18 a key feature of regression discontinuity design is the existence of a score that determines treatment assignment for each unit in the sample given a cutoff score an important feature of the assignment mechanism used by the state is that it essentially generates a random assignment of the treatment among agencies around the cutoffs a potential threat to validity would arise if water agencies were able to self select into particular cutoffs by manipulating their july august 2014 residential gpcd this is unlikely to have been the case for two inter related reasons first the conservation mandate examined in this study is the first mandate in california s history and its structure is different from mandates used in other states to manage drought second water agencies could not have influenced their residential gpcd during july august 2014 in direct anticipation of the mandate the mandate was announced in april of 2015 and was followed by several weeks of public comments public comments were used to formulate the assignment mechanism that was officially adopted in may 2015 though it may be possible that public comments may have resulted in water agencies having some influence over the assignment variable water agencies inability to precisely manipulate it is sufficient to assume that variation in treatment near the cutoffs is random 68 a common practice in the literature estimating regression discontinuity designs with multiple cutoffs is to estimate a pooled regression using a normalized running variable 69 following this convention i compute the distance between agency i s score di and the closest cutoff ci defined in 2 1 agencies with gpcd scores di ci c i c i 1 2 are considered treated and compared to agencies with scores between c i 1 c i 2 and ci applying to all di s normalizes the running variable for all units using a common cutoff of 0 and allows for estimation using a standard rd design the local average treatment effect late is given by τ ˆ lim ξ 0 e y i x i ξ lim ξ 0 e y i x i ξ where τ ˆ represents a weighted average across cutoffs of the local average treatment effects across all units facing each particular cutoff value 70 formally this implies that the average effect of treatment does not vary with higher values of residential gpcd τ ˆ is identified by estimating the following reduced form equation 1 y i d i τ ˆ δ 1 f x i δ 2 f x i d i β 1 w i β 2 x i ε i where di is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if di di ci c i c i 1 2 and 0 otherwise wi low high denotes the level of water waste complaints unlike in the mediation analysis presented in the next section i use the level of complaints in the months prior to the mandate to capture the level of mutual monitoring that is characteristic of the service area in the mediation analysis this measure would be collinear with agency level fixed effects the function f xi is a polynomial of the distance from the cutoff xi in the main specification f xi is a simple linear function 19 19 the estimation results are robust to the order of polynomial chosen the outcome of interest yi is the percentage cumulative water savings achieved by each local agency during the mandatory conservation period relative to their 2013 levels in appendix b i estimate a cutoff specific regression discontinuity design for cumulative cutoffs the results support the findings using the pool and normalize approach following 71 i include additional covariates represented by xi to account for differences among agencies with similar gpcds using a simple covariate adjusted estimator this estimate is consistent under the assumption that the treatment has no mean effect on the covariates at the cutoffs i control for water agency specific characteristics including the percentage of residential water usage that is usually delivered to single family households an indicator variable for whether or not the water agency is investor owned and an indicator variable for whether or not groundwater is the primary source of water i also control for the severity of local drought conditions that each water agency experienced during the mandated conservation period measured as the number of months in extreme drought conditions palmer drought severity index measure of 4 or less as a sensitivity check i also estimate 1 without covariates in appendix c the results for the effect of treatment also qualitatively similar because the effects of public awareness campaigns are likely to have extended beyond the boundaries of a particular water agency i attempt to capture the general effect of public awareness of campaigns using boundaries for nielsen district market areas areas in which households can be expected to have received the same or similar media content e g television radio newspaper internet in the preferred specification i account for media related spillover effects by clustering standard errors at the district market area level 20 20 in california there are 13 district market areas with an average of 27 water agencies per district market area i obtain spatial boundary information for district market areas from gaurav 2016 in appendix table d1 and appendix table d2 i consider alternative approaches to accounting for media related spillover effects in particular i estimate a model where standard errors are clustered at the water agency level and another model where district market area fixed effects are included as controls the results from these alternative approaches are qualitatively similar to the main set of results table 3 provides estimates for key coefficients of 1 as a sensitivity check i provide results for several different distance bandwidths narrowing the bandwidth ensures increased similarly in terms of residential gpcd at the expense of fewer observations the results do not suggest that the differential incentives provided by the mandate had a strong effect though generally statistically insignificant at smaller bandwidths point estimates for the effect of treatment is negative this finding would indicate that water agencies with higher conservation targets generally did not conserve more than similar water agencies with lower targets in fact the results suggest that water agencies with higher conservation targets may have conserved less water than otherwise similar water agencies this may indicate a giving up effect for water agencies that were far enough from their assigned target fig 3 graphically depicts the discontinuity in water conservation induced by the conservation targets turning to the effects of social opprobrium in enforcement the results suggest that social opprobrium improved conservation outcomes all else equal water agencies with higher levels of water waste complaints conserved more than otherwise similar water agencies across most bandwidths water agencies with high levels of pre mandate opprobrium conserved on the order of three percentage points more than water agencies with low levels of complaints these findings suggest that water waste complaints affect the levels of water conservation that water agencies are able to achieve 6 quantifying the impacts of water conservation mandate in this section i complement the previous analysis that examines the effectiveness of the legislated conservation targets with an analysis of the various mechanisms through which water agencies promoted conservation at the local level to do so i use mediation analysis to disentangle the impacts of the channels that mediate the effect of the mandate summarized in fig 1 this approach often used in the policy analysis literature to estimate the underlying mechanisms behind a policy intervention e g ref 12 relies on estimating a causal theoretical framework to disentangle the effects of the various pathways and does not exploit quasi experimental variation in the data using mediation analysis the effects of the various pathways on the outcome of interest can be interpreted as having been generated by the mandate if 1 there is a clear association between the channels and the main outcome of interest and 2 the mandate enhances the use of each channel to show both 1 and 2 i estimate three sets of specifications first i estimate a specification where i decompose the mandate into its sub components to estimate the effects of the mediators on the main outcome of interest water usage to establish the existence of a negative relationship between the mediators and the main outcome of interest second i estimate the effect of the mandate on each of the mediating channels to show that the implementation of the mandate is associated with changes in the use of the various channels lastly i use a structural equation modeling framework to estimate the impact each mediator has on water conservation while accounting for the endogenous relationships depicted in fig 1 the mediation analysis is based on the following linear model 2 w i t α β m t φ t η i ε i t where w i t represents water agency i s aggregate water usage in period t in terms of gallons per capita the variable mt 0 1 takes the value 1 during the mandated conservation period and 0 during the pre mandate period it represents the relationship between the introduction of the mandate and water conservation at the water agency level the parameter β captures the overall impact of the mandate on conservation the model also includes month specific fixed effects φ t to control for seasonality and agency specific fixed effects η i to control for time invariant agency specific characteristics the error term ε i t captures unobserved idiosyncratic shocks decomposing the m t term in 2 into the channels mediating the effect of the mandate yields 3 3 w i t α β d i t γ 1 o i t γ 2 e i t φ t η i ε i t where d i t o i t and e i t respectively represent demand side strategies opprobrium and enforcement given the lack of data on demand side management strategies however i am unable to directly account for the demand side management channel assuming that water agencies increased the use of demand side management strategies following the implementation of the mandate as a means to reduce water usage the effects of the demand side management channel would largely be captured by mt i therefore treat the unmediated link between the mandate and water usage as a proxy for demand side management strategies notwithstanding it is possible that the effect of mt may also capture other factors that reduced water usage unrelated to demand side management strategies the coefficient β should be therefore be interpreted as an upper bound on the effect of demand side management strategies replacing d i t with mt i estimate 4 to show that the channels mediating the effect of the mandate are negatively associated with water usage 4 w i t α β m t γ 1 o i t γ 2 e i t φ t η i ε i t in 4 the interpretation of the variable mt changes relative to its interpretation in 3 it represents the direct unmediated link between pressure to conserve introduced by the mandate and water conservation at the water agency level if mt captures other factors unrelated to demand side management strategies that reduced water usage the coefficient β would be upwards biased using m t as a proxy for demand management may therefore potentially overstate their impact following this i estimate three separate equations given by 5 to show an association between the implementation of the mandate and each of the mediating channels 5 y i t α β m t φ t η i ε i t where y i t represents opprobrium o i t enforcement e i t and water usage w i t table 4 show the results for the estimation of 4 in panel a and 5 in panel b the results highlight that the amount of enforcement opprobrium and water conservation are all significantly associated with the pressure induced by the mandate panel a shows how the outcomes of interest changed during the mandatory conservation period for all water agencies the results also highlight that pressure induced by the mandate is strongly and positively associated with levels of both enforcement and complaints panel b shows how the outcomes of interest changed during the mandatory conservation period for all water agencies when controlling for month specific and water agency specific influences the preferred specification the results show the pressure from the mandate period is associated with a decrease in water consumption of approximately 21 gallons per month per capita the results also highlight that pressure induced by the mandate is strongly and positively associated with levels of both enforcement and complaints in appendix e i re estimate 4 and 5 interacting the mandate term with the initially assigned conservation targets to allow for heterogeneous effects at the various tiers the results are consistent with those in table 4 and show that mandating higher target levels are associated with higher levels conservation to account for endogeneity i use a structural equation modeling framework to estimate the channel specific effects on water usage the model is described by the following system of equations given by 6 o i t α 0 β 0 m t γ 0 s i t φ t η i ε i t e i t α e β 1 e m t β 2 e o i t γ e s i t φ t η i ε i t 6 w i t α w β 1 w m t β 2 w o i t β 3 w e i t γ w s i t φ t η i ε i t where s i t represents drought severity for water agency i in month t the system of equations estimated simultaneously models the various relationships between opprobrium enforcement and water usage summarized in fig 1 the results from the mediation analysis shown in table 5 indicate that the effect of the mandate on water conservations operated primarily through the demand side management channel the estimated direct effect of the mandate is associated with a reduction of aggregate water usage on the order of 16 37 residential gpcd notwithstanding the results also show that the mediating effects of opprobrium are not only statistically significant but also economically relevant the mandate increased levels by opprobrium by 2 29 β 1 0 and each percent increase in levels of complaints is associated with a 0 93 decrease β 2 w in residential gpcd the opprobrium channel computed as β 1 0 β 2 w resulted in a decrease in residential water usage of approximately 2 13 gallons per capita per day gpcd the serially mediated effect of opprobrium through local agency enforcement computed as β 1 o β 2 e β 3 w suggests a decrease in water usage of approximately 1 75 gpcd of note the effect of enforcement of the enforcement channel without the opprobrium channel computed as β 1 e β 3 w is only 0 34 residential gpcd 7 discussion and conclusion higher level governments often use mandates to impose safeguards and mitigate the waste of scarce resources policy makers and local agencies are interested in understanding the impact of such policies and the mechanisms that drive their effectiveness in this paper i study the effectiveness of legislating explicit conservation objectives and assess the impact of the various mechanisms that drive conservation using data for california water agencies subjected to a year long emergency water conservation mandate 2015 2016 the policy provided exogenous variation in the assigned conservation targets i start by explore how cumulative conservation over the course of the mandate differs by exogenously assigned conservation targets next i investigate two potential drivers of local water conservation enforcement actions taken by the water agencies measured in terms of follow up actions and the degree to which local communities called out wasteful water consumption complaints in this paper there are three main findings first i find that mandating higher targets alone did not lead to higher water conservation though water agencies with higher exogenously set conservation targets generally conserved more a regression discontinuity analysis shows that water agencies with higher conservation targets generally did not conserve more than otherwise similar water agencies with lower targets this result suggests that higher pressure for water conservation on agencies may not alter equilibrium consumption this analysis also provides evidence that water agencies servicing areas with more customer driven complaints regarding water waste were able to conserve more there are several potential explanations for the finding regarding the ineffectiveness of mandating higher targets one possible explanation is that the rd design is underpowered at narrower bandwidths thus making it difficult to detect small increases in conservation by water agencies with higher conservation targets this explanation would suggest that conservation targets at each of the cutoffs may not have been high enough to induce large amounts of conservation though beyond the scope of this paper this explanation would suggest that a better understanding of the process through which the cutoff values are set is needed viewed from a principal agent perspective another explanation is that it was difficult for the state to enforce its policies with water agencies though the state could observe and contract upon outcomes the importance of fines for municipalities that failed to achieve mandated reductions is unclear to my knowledge the state only pursued legal action against four of the water agencies for failing to comply with their mandated conservation target 21 21 see ref 72 for an example of formal legal action this explanation would point to the state governments need for local agency cooperation to achieve desired policy objectives i e water conservation second i find that the majority of the decrease in water usage can likely be attributed to the demand side management strategies adopted during the mandate unfortunately the state dataset primarily consisted of information on enforcement and does not include information on the demand side management strategies adopted by water agencies across the state in spite of a large and growing literature on demand management strategies for managing water demand there is much uncertainty regarding the relative efficacy of these strategies moreover little is known regarding how social opprobrium can be harnessed as a demand management strategy future reporting requirements should also aim to systematically collect information on the var ious demand side management strategies to better understand these dynamics in the context of promoting conservation lastly an investigation of the mechanisms related to enforcement reveals that a significant amount of the conservation gains can be explained by differences in the extent to which private citizens complained about other people s wasteful consumption i e social opprobrium a mediation analysis shows that 1 the mandate period is found to be associated with a significant increase in complaints regarding wasteful water consumption submitted to local agencies 2 that enforcement actions taken by local agencies that led to water conservation were significantly impacted by local social opprobrium and 3 that changes in local social opprobrium during the mandate period also independently lead to reductions in aggregate agency level water usage thus the results suggest that social opprobrium is an important driver of water conservation the relevance of social opprobrium in the context of conservation is consistent with previous work that finds that extracting agents operating in complex social networks can be pressured into complying depending on the population of compliers and the nature of the network 73 what drives opprobrium a plausible explanation for this type of behavior is that people who lodge a water waste complaint are likely driven by nosy preferences i e preferences that depend on the actions of others e g refs 74 75 customers with these preferences may be outraged over water waste a perceived moral norm violation and express their preferences through overt opprobrium or through anonymous online reports moreover availability of digital media platforms and anonymous reporting mechanisms can amplify the expression of moral outrage in part by reducing individual level costs 76 this explanation is consistent with anecdotal evidence social media posts news reports during the study period related to drought shaming e g ref 47 from a policy perspective the findings regarding the significance of local opprobrium points to the potential for water agencies to harness citizen outrage and provide an opportunity for citizens with nosy preferences to be part of the enforcement process notably water agencies could presumably leverage reported instances of wasted water to identify and follow up with customers with high water usage in real time without expending resources on staff to drive around neighborhoods looking for water waste though harnessing social opprobrium may seem promising there may be some significant drawbacks that suggest caution for instance there may be nontrivial psychological costs associated with the use of social opprobrium to pressure people into conserving water in the energy sector for example 77 find that a significant number of people exhibit a positive willingness to pay wtp to stop receiving social comparison reports in energy because of a negative perception of the state nudging them to do the right thing relatedly heavy reliance on social opprobrium may also make people feel uneasy 33 use the term participatory surveillance to describe using a system based on complaints to curb water usage a potential avenue for future work would be to consider the welfare effects of social opprobrium as a water conservation tool moreover social opprobrium may not appropriately target households using large volumes of water on low value activities for example it could be the case that some water users who are shamed for wasting water may not be high water users overall conversely it could also be the case that high water users may take precautions to avoid outward signs of water usage e g watering at night more sophisticated interventions that would enable the use of data analytic techniques to monitor water usage in real time e g installation of smart meters with an automated meter infrastructure system may better support water conservation efforts author statement this paper has one sole author declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a service area characteristics in this section i provide summary statistics on service area characteristics that may be associated with water waste complaints defined in terms of the median level of per capita water waste com plaints prior to the start of the state mandate for water conservation in particular i provide summary statistics on four categories of characteristics first i provide information on the average amounts of water that water agencies generally provide to various customer classes obtained from their 2015 urban water management plans submitted to ca department of water resources second i provide information regarding density using a variety of metrics i construct two simple measures of density the first defined in terms of population per square mile and the second in terms of the number of service connections per square mile the numerator used for these measures are obtained from us environmental protection agency s safe drinking water information system the denominator area is computed using gis from spatial maps of each water agency s service area boundaries i also provide information on the percentage of people for whom their work commutes exceed 1 h using data at the us census block group level 22 22 census data is obtained from us census obtained from ipums national historic geographic information system nhgis using data from 2015 american community survey 5 year 2011 2015 estimates 78 third i also compare service areas using a measure of geographic isolation developed by ref 79 at the us census tract level this measure is meant to capture geographical differences based on measures that correlate strongly with population density and access to resources in relative close proximity lastly i compare measures social and demographic characteristics at the us census block group level these characteristics include race education and per capita income and information on housing characteristics also at the us census block group level as shown in in appendix table a1 service areas with high water waste complaints had higher average levels of conservation both prior to and during the mandated conservation period but do not seem to significantly differ along any of the characteristics examined this is consistent with findings by ref 33 appendix table a1

21 notes the level of water waste complaints is defined in terms of the total number of complaints per capita received prior to the start of the mandate in june 2015 the level of water waste complaints is defined in terms of the overall median level agencies with a total number of complaints per capita received above the median are labeled as high and low otherwise us census estimates are

8637,freshwater scarcity is worsening as we quickly approach the freshwater planetary boundary there has been extensive research and policy development in the space of water scarcity pollution and accessibility centered around the sustainable development goals sdgs a large body of literature examines household and climate characteristics predictive of water consumption by households however there does not appear to be any research on the role of views of and proximity to water bodies in household water consumption in this paper we develop a simple model of water consumption which depends on the perceptions of water scarcity and the perceptions of whether water scarcity is an issue using geographic information systems gis viewshed analysis we model whether properties in tauranga new zealand have views of lakes and the coast we then use these variables in an sa1 unit fixed effects model of water consumption we find that views of lakes are associated with higher water consumption and views of the coast are associated with lower water consumption we suggest that these associations are driven by psychological biases which alter the perceptions of water scarcity and concern for water scarcity we deploy a range of robustness checks and argue that our results may be causal though further research is required to confirm this keywords water consumption viewshed analysis water scarcity fixed effects water demand jel classification d12 d91 q21 q25 data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is a prominent issue globally and we are fast approaching the freshwater consumption planetary boundary 1 2 much research and policymaking have focussed on reducing water scarcity pollution and making water accessible for all these foci are clearly evident in the united nation s sustainable development goals sdgs which provide the foundations of research and initiatives around the world 3 moreover water accounting methodologies have become popularised as a means of tracking the extraction use and return of water across regions and countries 4 these approaches aim to improve the management of water resources at a regional level in aotearoa new zealand towns cities and regions are facing more intense and frequent droughts worsening with climate change which are adding stress to water resources 5 these threats along with declining water quality and a historic underinvestment in water management infrastructure have led to the proposal of the controversial three waters reforms 6 in light of these global and local issues understanding water demand and household water consumption behaviour is more critical than ever for designing effective water management policy and infrastructure there is a large body of literature that demonstrates clear associations between household characteristics demographics and water demand for a review see ref 7 research shows that higher incomes and higher property values are associated with greater water consumption across a range of contexts 7 11 moreover 7 describe a range of other demographic factors that affect water consumption like household size which also operates through the property value and income channels age interest in gardening and education level 7 these types of findings are important to policymakers as they allow water policy and demand interventions to be more targeted and thus more efficient indeed there is a burgeoning literature which assesses how and where policy interventions reduce water consumption and encourage pro environmental behaviours for a review of field experiments in environmental economics see ref 12 there is also a large field of research that looks into the role of nudges altering choice architecture without changing incentives or using coercion in reducing water consumption 13 14 one household characteristic that may influence water consumption but has received relatively little attention is the views of nearby water bodies could living near the coast or a lake impact water consumption if so what does that mean for future policy work around reducing water consumption and addressing water scarcity in this paper we use water consumption data for tauranga new zealand to investigate the association between views of water bodies and proximity to water bodies and water consumption this is the first study that we know of that tests such associations we first use geographic information systems gis viewshed analysis to calculate whether properties have views of water bodies and how far they are from these water bodies we distinguish between views of lakes and views of the coast as these two types of water bodies are quite distinct in tauranga and views of them may have differential impacts on water consumption we then use these variables in standard econometric models of water consumption to examine whether household views of water bodies and proximity to water bodies are associated with water consumption there is an extensive literature that uses viewshed analysis and variations of viewshed analysis to determine if properties have views of the sea and of lakes a substantial proportion of this literature uses viewshed output as a regressor in hedonic models for property valuations and find positive relationships between views of the sea or lakes and property value 15 18 19 uses viewshed analysis in developing the new zealand landscape classification nzlc which depends on the views and perceptions of landforms from a particular location 20 uses viewshed analysis to find that the effects of views of water bodies on property value diminishes with distance from the water body 18 find views of small man made lakes have significant positive effects on property value this is particularly relevant for the tauranga region which mostly contains small lakes views of water affect perceptions of landscape character 15 19 we propose that views of water also affect the perceptions of water scarcity and the perceptions of the intrinsic value of water in line with the literature on pro environmental attitudes and behaviours see ref 21 these perceptions may subsequently affect water consumption and undermine public water conservation campaigns run during warm periods and droughts usually in summer as far as we are aware there are no studies econometrically linking water consumption and views of water we develop a simple theoretical model of water consumption building on the literature on the relationship between perceived water scarcity and water consumption some studies have shown negative associations between awareness of water scarcity issues and water consumption 22 24 in our model if views of water bodies increase decrease the perceptions of water scarcity or the concern for water scarcity issues water consumption will decrease increase we then run fixed effects regression models regressing views of water bodies on water consumption controlling for seasonality and time invariant unobservables we propose possible interpretations of results in line with our theoretical model using insights from behavioural economics and psychology we note that we are unable to explicitly test our theoretical model and the mechanisms driving the associations between water views and water consumption we leave this for future research our empirical results are robust to changes in the specification of the independent variable adding controls using more conservative modelling approaches using a sub sample of the tauranga area and selection on unobservables which we test using the methods described by ref 25 this leads us to conclude that the associations we find may be causal although we can not conclude this definitively our contribution to the literature is three fold first we empirically estimate the association between views of water bodies lakes and the coast and water consumption which hasn t been done as far as we are aware our data and modelling approach also mean that the associations we present may indeed be causal relationships second we develop a novel theoretical model describing the association between views of water bodies and water consumption third we link this model to the behavioural economics and psychology literature to suggest why the effects of views of water bodies may differ depending on the type of water body while we cannot directly test our theoretical model and proposed mechanisms they along with our empirical results provide a strong foundation for future research in this area 2 empirical context tauranga fig 1 is a coastal city in new zealand which is well suited for analysing the effects of water views because it has both a coastline and freshwater lakes the beaches and sea are highly regarded internationally the lakes are relatively small and arguably less appealing indeed there are no major lakes in tauranga 27 1 1 major refers to the top twenty lakes in new zealand by surface area this study uses quarterly household level water consumption data for approximately 39 224 single unit residential properties in tauranga for the year 2020 21 tauranga has a relatively simple water price structure with a single volumetric price per cubic meter for all residential water users the price is set by the tauranga city council each winter and applies for the 12 months from july 1st to june 30 3 theory 3 1 model overview below we develop a theoretical model linking water views and water consumption that we will use to suggest explanations for our later empirical results we do not test our theoretical model in this paper but make recommendations on how this model could be tested in the future we adapt the approaches taken in refs 28 29 to theorise a simple utility function 1 u u y θ k where utility u is a function increasing in water consumption y decreasing in the perceived contribution to water scarcity k and quasi concave θ is a normalised indicator of whether the consumer cares about water scarcity θ 0 1 in reality θ could take on many values between zero and one but for simplicity we could assume there are two types of consumers those who care θ 1 and those who do not care θ 0 about water scarcity the perceived contribution to water scarcity k can be written as a function of water consumption itself as higher water consumption reduces the availability of water for others and the perceived extent of the water scarcity issue 2 k k ρ y where ρ is the perception of the extent of the water scarcity issue and is a real number between 0 and 1 ρ r 0 ρ 1 we can see that if ρ 0 that is the individual doesn t believe there are any water scarcity issues the perceived contribution to water scarcity k will be equal to zero and the utility function will contract to only be increasing in the consumption of water y we can re write 1 by integrating 2 3 u u y θ ρ y u y 1 θ ρ from 3 our model shows that if consumers perceive greater water scarcity and care about water scarcity utility from water consumption will decline at all levels of consumption and ceteris paribus we expect individuals to consume less water we propose that views of water bodies affect parameters ρ and θ and thus affect water consumption we diagrammatically illustrate this in fig 2 this model would lend itself to structural estimation if you could measure perceived scarcity and concern for scarcity which is out of the scope for this paper 3 2 model background and research propositions our simple framework is consistent with the literature on the relationship between perceived water scarcity and water consumption several studies show negative associations between awareness of water scarcity or water conservation issues and water consumption 22 23 30 for example 24 in the context of agricultural water use posits that farmers water use strongly relates to their awareness and perception of water shortage 24 develops a structural model to examine the determinants of farmers perceptions of water scarcity and find that age time spent farming and social networks significantly influence these perceptions however the authors do not consider views of water bodies as determinants of the perceptions of water scarcity and do not empirically link perceptions of water scarcity to water consumption in line with 31 we argue that persistent views of water bodies are part of peoples experiences and interactions with water and this in turn influences their perceptions of water scarcity issues and the degree to which they care about such issues indeed there is an extensive literature that acknowledges that experiences shape people s identities and values for example see refs 32 34 hence in our theoretical framework we propose that views of and proximity to water affects consumption by influencing ρ and θ however views and proximity to water will only influence water consumption if people care about water scarcity in the first place θ 0 we show the proposed effect on perceived water scarcity of having views of water bodies in fig 2 in fig 2 the blue lines represent the proposed mechanism for the effect of views of water bodies on water consumption the observable effect shown by the green arrow we note that in our later analysis we cannot directly observe perceptions of water scarcity and the extent to which consumers care about water scarcity and we therefore cannot show whether our proposed mechanisms are true nonetheless the model in fig 2 provides a useful foundation for future research that may couple structural estimation in line with 24 and the empirical analysis of water consumption data concerning the differential impact of views of lakes and views of the coast on water consumption we state two propositions that are in line with our theoretical conceptualization of water demand the local context and the economics and psychology literature we suggest that consistent views of and interactions with lakes may lead to downward bias estimates of the severity of water scarcity issues and thus lead to higher water consumption individuals who are frequently exposed to freshwater may be prone to the baader meinhof phenomenon frequency bias where they believe there is more freshwater than there actually is 35 36 describe a similar notion of availability bias where an individual s perceptions of a group are based on readily available information hence we may expect individuals to form their views of the state of water assets and scarcity in part by their immediate surroundings proposition 1 individuals with lake views will have a lower perception of water scarcity ρ and ceteris paribus consume more water on the other hand we suggest that consistent views of the beautiful tauranga coastline may garner a higher level of intrinsic value for water and thus reduce water consumption 100 26 in the study area tauranga the beaches and coast are of high quality nationally and internationally for example 100 26 describes mount maunganui beach in tauranga as one of the most stunning beaches in new zealand fig 1 moreover in 2019 mount maunganui beach was ranked as the top beach on tripadvisor for the sixth year running moreover the seawater in tauranga is of a high quality nationally and internationally 37 we hypothesise that views of such stunning beaches and coastline may generate a greater appreciation and concern for water scarcity analogous to beauty premiums in the labour market 38 being exposed to beautiful bodies of water may increase the value placed on water and result in a greater concern for water scarcity issues indeed there are many studies linking positive interactions with nature to a higher perceived values of nature 21 39 40 proposition 2 individuals with sea views will have greater concern for water scarcity and ceteris paribus consume less water in our econometric model of water demand we estimate the associations between views of lakes and views of the coast and water consumption controlling for important property level characteristics seasonality and regional heterogeneity again we cannot elicit the exact mechanism through which this association is operating however if the associations are significant and in line with our propositions it implies some support for the mechanisms proposed above 4 gis data and methods all necessary data to determine views of and proximity to the coast and lakes for tauranga city properties are publicly available the full set of publicly available gis data used in this paper are described in table 1 we provide full details in appendix a on the steps we take to operationalise the layers in table 1 and compute variables for the views of and distance to lakes and the coast the dem with a 24 m resolution obtains a good balance between achieving a sufficient level of detail and processing capability a 24 m dem is well within the range of dem resolutions used in the academic literature and is manageable with standard computing hardware 16 17 41 moreover the source of our dem data worlddem dataset airbus defence and space 2022 is widely used in academic research for recent examples see refs 41 43 in urban areas the dem is essentially a digital terrain model dtm so surface level distortions are removed for example other buildings which improves the accuracy of the dem airbus defence and space 2022 this means our subsequent views variables are conservative because they do not account for blocking buildings however this is not a concern for our analysis as our interest in views and their association with water consumption relate to how frequently people see such water bodies on a day to day basis see the theory section hence viewshed output using a dtm rather than a dsm is appropriate here as a proxy for whether a household sees the water body on a regular basis other papers also use dtms instead of dsms 18 44 and the decision on the best tool is highly context dependent 45 using a dtm 18 show the viewshed output is highly accurate when compared with ground truthed results another option was to use lidar data 1 m resolution dem which is available for some areas of new zealand however as our viewshed analysis uses the entire tauranga city territory the computational requirements were excessive and unnecessarily precise for computing a view variable to be used in later econometric models particularly given our focus on how regularly households view the water bodies rather than a specific line of sight 16 developed an adaptation of the typical viewshed analysis for assessing the impact of water views on property values they generate a unique dem for each property to ensure that individual properties don t block their own view of amenities and so that a full 360 degree view can be accounted for this approach was not necessary for our analysis as we are only interested in views of specific water bodies on a day to day basis which are in a pre defined direction from each property our distance to water bodies variables are relatively simple planar euclidian distance to the nearest water body in line with work by ref 46 this is because visual distance not travel distance which could be estimated using network analysis for example see ref 47 is the variable of interest moreover euclidian distance is a common measure used in hedonic property value models for computing distance to water bodies and other amenities like parks see refs 17 20 48 51 the distance to water bodies variable is a useful alternative independent variable because distance to water bodies and views of water bodies are closely related if our results are robust to using the view and distance variables we can be confident that our viewshed analysis is performing well not including areas that shouldn t be and vice versa moreover the distance to water bodies variable can help us investigate whether the strength of the association between views of water bodies and water consumption declines with distance as the effects of views of water bodies on property prices do a natural extension of work by ref 20 5 econometric data and methods water demand at the household level is influenced by various socio demographic factors such as household size age income interest in gardening and education level 7 as with most water demand studies socio demographic information is not available at the household level 7 like other studies we therefore use property characteristics as proxy variables house area is a proxy for household size site area for outdoor water needs building age as a proxy for water efficiency of fixtures and capital value as a measure of wealth we also include statistical area 1 sa1 census unit socio demographic variables which capture some of the variation between small communities 2 2 sa1 units usually contain 100 200 residents and are capped at 500 residents see table 1 for more information on the sa1 units these variables include median income median age homeownership rate and proportion of residents with post secondary school education property level variables are hereafter referred to as group 1 variables while the census area variables are referred to as group 2 contextual variables there are four water meter readings for each property group 1 unit representing the quarters between 1 july 2020 and 30 june 2021 the volumetric price per cubic meter of water was constant at 2 23 over this period apartment blocks in our dataset have separate water meter readings for each apartment there are a few apartment blocks in tauranga that do not have separate water meter readings for each apartment and these were not included in our data we elect to pool the four quarters together and include time fixed effects dummies for each time period to account for period specific or seasonal shocks as 52 show pooled ordinary least squares ols enables us to consistently estimate the coefficients on time invariant variables views of water bodies as we have a large number of properties n 39 224 a small number time periods n 4 and we include time fixed effects in our modelling estimates will still be consistent if there is serial correlation 53 55 in our modelling we apply log transformations to our dependent variable and continuous predictor variables this is in line with the extensive water demand and water consumption modelling literature and has the advantage the estimates can be interpreted as elasticities for example see refs 10 56 57 for panel data clustered by level 2 groups sa1 units in our case the literature suggests using fixed effects or mixed models with random effects for the level 2 groups also known as within between hierarchical mundlak or correlated random effects models 53 58 59 fixed effects models are more popular in the economics literature while mixed models are more commonly used in other social science disciplines 59 suggests this is because endogeneity is considered more of a problem in economics while psychology traditionally focussed on controlled experiments we start with a properly defined fixed effects model and then use a within between mixed model specification which allows for random slopes as a robustness check the fixed effects model is desirable because it accounts for all time invariant level 2 variables and ensures these variables do not bias the within estimates of level 1 variables 54 hence we account for all demographic factors at the statistical area 1 level the demographics are time invariant over the four quarters the fixed effects model is as follows 4 y i j t β 0 β 1 n t β 2 x i t β 3 p i t c j ε i t where y i t is logged daily water consumption for property i in sa1 area j at time t n t is a vector of time period dummies x i t is a column vector of our regressors of interest views of water bodies lakes and sea p i t is a column vector of control variables logged if appropriate that vary at level 1 c j is a vector of intercepts for each level 2 group and ε i t is an idiosyncratic error term under 4 β 2 are the coefficients of interest on our independent variables and they represent within sa 1 effects as between sa 1 effects are removed by the sa 1 fixed effects for example if x i t is a dummy variable 0 1 for views of the sea β 2 reflects the average change in water consumption between properties in the same sa 1 unit who have and don t have views of the sea evidently this is a useful model because we only compare properties in the same sa 1 unit and sa 1 units are relatively fine spatial aggregations in terms of population statistics to obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of x i j t on water consumption we would have to assume contemporaneous exogeneity 5 e ε i j t x i j t p i j t c j 0 where for this assumption to be valid variables that may affect x i t and y i t causing omitted variable bias must be time invariant and appropriately defined at level 2 this is the assumption required to show causality given the lack of household sociodemographic data we can only report associations however our robustness checks allow us to get closer to satisfying the assumption in equation 5 to test for the appropriateness of the sa 1 fixed effects we use a mundlak approach to test whether the means of our level 1 variables by level 2 groups are jointly zero in a random effects model 53 unlike the hausman test we are able to include a robust variance covariance matrix when we perform this diagnostic test we find strong evidence p value 0 01 that the time invariant sa 1 level variables are related to our predictors and outcome variable and that sa 1 level fixed effects are appropriate 5 1 robustness checks and causality discussion 5 1 1 mundlak mixed effects modelling moreover we provide supplementary within between mundlak modelling to include between sa 1 associations where we control for a set of sa 1 level covariates for the between sa1 estimates we are less worried about non classical measurement error that may arise from assuming sa 1 demographics appropriately control for property demographics that influence water consumption 60 the within between or mundlak models are random effects type models that relax some of the restrictive assumptions in typical random effects models 53 55 58 in a typical random effects model we would model random intercepts c j for each sa 1 unit and assume that these intercepts are uncorrelated with x i j t 6 c o v c j x i j t 0 in our fixed effects model we were not required to assume a relationship between the sa 1 intercepts and our level 1 varying regressors in a correlated random effects model mundlak model we relax the random effects assumption and explicitly model the relationship between the sa 1 intercepts and the level 1 regressors x i j t and p i j t usually the modelled relationship developed by ref 61 and 53 is as follows 7 e c j x j φ δ 1 x j δ 2 p j where x j and p j are vectors of averages across each sa 1 unit and φ is random variation we can thus decompose c j into 8 c j φ δ 1 x j δ 2 p j a j where a j are the random intercepts for each sa 1 unit with an expectation of zero by substituting 8 into the fixed effects model 4 we get the final correlated random effects model 9 y i j t β 0 β 1 n t β 2 x i j t β 3 p i j t β 3 h j φ δ 1 x j δ 1 p j a j ε i j t where it is well documented that the estimate of β 2 in 9 is identical to the estimate from the fixed effects model in 4 for further discussion see ref 59 however in 9 we can now include sa 1 level variables h j and we can estimate the contextual essentially the between effects δ 1 of our regressors of interest x to put it in context estimates of δ 1 will show the change in average water consumption when moving from an sa 1 unit without views of water bodies to an sa 1 unit with views another advantage of 9 is that we can include random slopes on x for each sa 1 unit 53 59 if the random slopes are important excluding them may generate bias estimates and standard errors excluding random slopes where they are significant will lead to anti conservative standard errors 58 62 in saying that modelling random effects and slopes interactions between each sa1 unit and the view of water variables is not a parsimonious approach and uses up many degrees of freedom indeed our initial fixed effects model 4 minimises the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic compared to the within between models with and without random slopes equation 9 in this sense these models are conservative and a good test of whether results from our preferred fixed effects models are robust 5 1 2 distance to water bodies variables as a robustness check for our viewshed gis analysis which we use to generate x i j t we run our fixed effects 4 models using a categorical distance to the nearest water body term x within 500 m between 500 m and 1 km between 1 and 2 km greater than 2 km as an alternative measure of view exposure to types of water bodies if being close to water bodies has a similar association with water consumption as being able to view water bodies we can be confident that our viewshed analysis is performing well we also run interactions between our views of water variables and time period dummies to check whether certain periods or seasons are driving key results finally we run interactions between our categorical distance to water variables and views of water variables in line with insights from ref 20 this enables us to observe if the strength of the association declines with distance from the water body 5 1 3 sa1 size and causality assumptions in our main models see equation 4 identification relies on the assumption in equation 5 that the error term is uncorrelated with our views of water bodies variables conditional on our property level controls sa1 fixed effects and time fixed effects the perfect hypothetical counterfactual in our design for the properties with views of water bodies would be the exact same property but without views of water bodies our model and sa1 fixed effects mean we are essentially comparing water consumption between properties with and without views of water bodies in the same sa1 unit controlling for property level characteristics like value comparing properties within the same sa1 unit is a useful way of constructing a reasonable counterfactual for our analysis famously tobler s 1970 first law of geography famously stated that near things are more related than distant things indeed it seems reasonable to use properties without views that are in close proximity to those with views as the counterfactual for this analysis of course these counterfactuals are more convincing the smaller the sa1 unit size this is because the properties within small sa1 units are closer together and less likely to differ on unobservable attributes that may cause omitted variable bias for example the likelihood of a property being a holiday home to explore this further in the results section we map the population of sa1 units in the tauranga area and show that most units are relatively small in size there are only a few sa1 units that appear relatively large and these are the sa1 units we would be most concerned about in terms of omitted variable bias as such as an additional robustness check we re run our main models four times excluding properties in a the largest 10 of sa1 units b the largest 20 of sa1 units c the largest 30 of sa1 units and d sa1 units with an above average geographical area 5 1 4 other robustness checks we estimate variance covariance matrices that are robust to unknown forms of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation we also ensure our standard errors are clustered at the property level and in the supplementary within between modelling clustered at the more conservative sa1 unit level finally we use well cited methods described by ref 25 to assess the possibility that omitted variable bias is driving our results using tools developed by ref 25 we can estimate the coefficients of our view variables if selection on unobservables is equally as strong as selection on observables we also compute oster s delta values to determine how strong selection on unobservables would need to be to reduce our coefficients to zero 6 results 6 1 descriptive results viewshed results show that large areas of tauranga city have views of the harbour and ocean fig 3 properties with lake views tend to be further inland but are spread across most areas of the city fig 4 we present summary statistics for the variables used in the fixed effects models table 2 in column one we show statistics for the whole sample while in columns two and three we show statistics for the sub sample with views of lakes and views of the coast respectively there is a reasonably high proportion of properties that have some view of a lake or the coast 31 7 and 30 4 respectively we note that this arises because of the way we compute our viewshed variables which are designed to indicate whether a resident regularly sees the water body rather than whether the specific water body is in view from a window of the house the average water consumption per property per day is 0 47 m3 equivalent to 171 55 m3 or 171 55 thousand litres per property per year the average building age is 29 years old the average capital value cv is nzd 781 446 the average built area is 111 m2 and median personal income per year is nzd 34 224 overall the summary statistics are similar between the overall sample and the two sub samples with views however properties with views of lakes appear newer and properties with views of the coast appear older on average moreover properties with views of the coast have higher values cvs on average interestingly properties with views of the coast that have higher cvs are in sa1 units with slightly lower incomes this may arise because homes in tauranga by the beach are older table 2 and more likely to have been with families for a longer period of time hence fewer of these properties go up for sale and there is less sorting of higher income families into higher cv properties moreover the dramatic increases in house price rises in tauranga have only recently occurred and before this it would have been much easier for households of a range of income levels to afford such properties 63 these differences highlight the importance of controlling for property level and sa1 level characteristics when we look at the association between views of water bodies and water consumption as mentioned previously we also show the full population of sa1 units in fig 5 evidently most sa1 units are small with a median size of 6 ha mean size of 17 ha and a maximum size of 1 156 ha for our robustness checks we re run our main models sequentially removing properties in a the largest 10 of sa1 units sa1 cut off of 23 8 ha b the largest 20 of sa1 units sa1 cut off of 10 9 ha c the largest 30 of sa1 units sa1 cut off of 8 3 ha and d sa1 units with an above average geographical area sa1 cut off of 16 6 ha 6 2 empirical results table 3 presents the fixed effects model estimates with different inclusions with respect to the predictors of interest the first three columns present results for regressors that relate to lakes and the final three columns relate to the coast in each set of three the first column 1 and 4 reports the results for the model with the view of water variable the second column 2 and 5 shows the results for the model with the categorical distance from water variable and the third column 3 and 6 shows the results for the model with the interaction between the view of water and distance to water variables in table 3 and subsequent tables care must be taken when interpreting the coefficients the dependent variable is logged and so are the continuous predictors while the categorical or binary predictors are not the coefficients on log variables may be interpreted as elasticities the coefficients on dummy and linear variables are semi elasticities which are the percent change in water consumption associated with a one unit change in the explanatory variable 6 2 1 views and distance to water bodies variables we find that having views of lakes are associated with 4 52 higher water consumption conversely views of the coast are associated with 4 26 lower water consumption these results are robust to using a distance to water measure instead properties more than 500 m from a lake consume 6 1 more water than properties less than 500 m from a lake we perform two tailed t tests and find that there is no significant further decline associated with living more than 500 m from a lake households living closer to lakes or with views of lakes have higher water consumption on average conversely households more than 500 m from the coast consume 4 5 6 1 more water as with the lakes model the effect of additional distance is statistically insignificant these results suggest that people living in close proximity to the coast and people living with views of the coast consume less water on average when we include an interaction between views of water bodies and distance to water bodies we find that the association between views of lakes and the coast are stronger for those living within 500 m of the water body itself and the strength of the association declines with distance from the water bodies for example when living within 500 m of a lake views of the lake are associated with 7 3 higher water consumption however when living 500 m to 1 km or 1 2 km from a lake views of the lake are associated with only 1 1 or 4 4 higher water consumption respectively turning to the coast when living within 500 m of the coast properties with views of the coast have 6 8 lower average water consumption however when living 500 m to 1 km or 1 2 km from the coast properties with views of the coast have lower water consumption by only 1 1 or 3 3 respectively these interactions minimise the aic and bic criteria relative to models with either views of water bodies or distance to water bodies variables alone this validates the inclusion of the interaction 6 2 2 other variables we also find that a 10 increase in the cv is associated with 5 greater water use between 4 7 and 5 2 depending on the exact model and a 10 increase in the building age is associated with approximately 0 75 higher water use built area m2 does not enter our model with any significance and we suspect any relationship is likely incorporated into the cv regressor coefficient 6 2 3 interactions with time in table 4 we present the results for our preferred fixed effects model with an interaction with time period dummies each period 1 4 lines up reasonably closely with the four seasons in new zealand hence in table 4 we label the periods by the season they correspond to noting that winter is the base and starting period these results show that the association between views of lakes and water consumption doesn t vary across the seasons periods however the associations between views of the coast and water consumption are stronger more negative in spring and autumn than winter and summer 6 2 4 interactions with demographics we also present the results of some full interaction models with our available demographics variables in table 5 for each of the demographic variables we generate below and above median sub samples and re estimate our main fixed effects models for views of lakes and the coast we use the variables income cv as a proxy for wealth education age and sa1 size these represent common interactions for the water consumption literature for variables that we have access to ref 7 our results show that higher income sa1 areas and wealthier households as proxied by cv have stronger associations between views of lakes and water consumption coefficient is greater in magnitude likewise the negative association between views of the coast and water consumption is stronger for high income and wealthier households the association for lake views is relatively consistent between high and low education sa1 units but the views of coast coefficient is significantly stronger more negative for higher educated sa1 units also the sub sample of relatively younger sa1 units yields a stronger coefficient for the lake views model finally we can see that above median sized sa1 units yield significantly stronger coefficients for both lakes and the coast 6 2 5 results for mixed model and smaller sa1 models as a robustness check we present our within between model results in appendix b using a likelihood ratio lr test we found random slopes to be an important addition to the within between models we also find the variance of the random effects and random slopes are large and significant indicating that the association between views of water bodies and water consumption vary considerably by sa1 unit the estimates for the associations between views of water bodies and water consumption without random slopes in appendix b are significant and identical to the fixed effects results in table 3 as we would expect however the standard errors are larger and more conservative when we introduce random slopes the coefficients decrease slightly in size but retain statistical significance given the conservative nature of these results we find good support for our main fixed effects results these tables also report between sa1 effects which are really associations rather than effects because they do not control for time invariant sa1 heterogeneity we also note that when we run our main models and exclude larger sa1 units from the model our results are still significant and the coefficients are largely similar this shows that when we limit the comparisons between properties to those in close proximity in the same small sa1 unit where omitted variable bias is less of a concern our results stand 6 2 6 selection on unobservables as the potential for omitted variable bias is a concern we present results highlighting the likelihood and effects of selection on unobservables table 6 as in ref 25 paper for our view variables we report uncontrolled coefficients first column and the model r2 controlled coefficients our fixed effects estimates in column three and the model r2 and bias adjusted coefficients which assume selection on unobservables is equal to selection on observables column 5 we find that adding controls sa1 fixed effects property level characteristics time dummies significantly increases the explanatory power of the model and doesn t shift the coefficients on our view variables by much if anything adding controls strengthens the observed association for views of the coast further the bias adjusted coefficient on views of lakes is very similar to our main findings and the bias adjusted coefficient on views of coast is more negative than our main findings we also report oster s deltas in column 6 which shows that selection on unobservables would need to be at least 1 34 and 1 42 times greater than selection on observables to reduce our views of lakes and views of the coast coefficients to zero to put that in context the majority of cases in ref 25 paper have an oster s delta that is less than one average is 0 46 and 86 of deltas fall in the 0 1 range as such 25 suggests using one as an upper bound and a common heuristic is that if oster s deltas are greater than one the main results are supported taken together the stability of our coefficients to controls the similarity of our coefficients to bias adjusted coefficients and the relatively large oster s deltas the results in table 6 show that omitted variable bias is likely not a major issue for our results 7 discussion our empirical results provide some support for our propositions 1 and 2 in section 2 we described a model of water consumption that depends on the perceived scarcity of water and the concern about water scarcity generally in short we postulate that people who believe that water resources are scarce or under pressure and are concerned about water scarcity will consume less water in proposition 1 we drew upon notions of frequency and availability bias 35 36 to suggest that people living near lakes may believe there is more freshwater than there actually is in believing this these individuals would have a lower perception of water scarcity and thus consume more water than an equivalent person who doesn t live near a lake our results support proposition 1 because we find that properties with views of lakes have significantly greater water consumption 4 6 greater and this association is more pronounced for people who live closer to the lakes than people who live further away whilst these associations may sound small they are equivalent to a substantial change in average annual water consumption over the region and are even larger if the results scale up to the national level a 4 6 increase in water consumption is equivalent to an additional 7 9 m3 7 900 l of water per property per year if our suggested mechanism of availability bias is correct and our effects are found to be causal the existence of the lakes may cause 98 134 m3 of additional water consumption 7 9 times number of properties with views per year in proposition 2 we made a distinctive link between beauty premiums in the labour market and beauty premiums in water consumption we suggest that views and proximity to beautiful bodies of water may increase the value people associate with water if people value water more they may have a greater concern for water scarcity and thus consume less water our results also support proposition 2 and we find that those with views of the coast consume significantly less water 4 26 less and that this association diminishes with distance from the coast we also note that the association is weaker during winter and summer one possibility is that warmer weather is associated with higher occupation of coastal holidays homes and more positive experiences and perceptions of the coast and beaches however perhaps during the summer period overcrowding of beaches and coastal suburbs during peak tourist months 64 may diminish those positive perceptions slightly as a result the association between views of the coast and water use during winter being the coldest season and summer being the season with the highest incidence of overcrowding are lower this is one possible interpretation and it aligns with the perception mechanisms we propose in the theory section in our framework the beauty and frequency bias mechanisms might offset each other however tauranga lakes are all relatively small and are not well known nationally or internationally hence we see less scope for the proposed beauty effects to apply to the lakes although they may still exist to a lesser degree for some groups of the population indeed our summary statistics in table 2 support this notion as on average properties with views of the sea have higher property values conversely properties with views of the small lakes in tauranga do not have higher market values on average suggesting the quality of the views are insufficient to generate a market premium moreover we suspect that views of and proximity to the coast wouldn t result in the proposed frequency bias effects because the frequency bias mechanism operates through perceptions of freshwater availability not saltwater availability we stress that our theory and proposed mechanisms are not the only way our observed results may be operating while we have built our theory section on previous work in the economics and psychology literature we are unable to directly test whether the mechanism is correct we believe this to be an important area for future research along with studying this phenomenon in different contexts for example future work may want to incorporate our theoretical model into a structural equation model to estimate the relationships between views of water bodies and the parameters in our theoretical model perceptions of scarcity and concern for scarcity this would require primary data collection to elicit perceptions of scarcity and levels of concern there are other explanations for our results that lie outside of our proposed model for example coastal properties may use less water because their gardens have more salt resistant plants that need less water alternatively coastal properties may consume less water because they are more likely to be holiday homes which are occupied less frequently on average for the lake views model it may be that differences in sociodemographics induce sorting into properties with and without lake views and this is driving the observed associations however in our modelling we include sa1 unit fixed effects which should control for local conditions local climate visitation patterns etc our approach means we are comparing properties in the same sa1 unit so we are comparing properties in the same coastal sa1 units or lake adjacent sa1 units therefore factors like more resistant vegetation and the incidence of holiday homes are unlikely to be driving our results as these factors are likely to be stable across the sa1 geographically scale also when sa1 units are relatively small there are likely fewer differences in sociodemographics and we find our results hold when restricting our analyses to only relatively small sa1 units moreover we find that our results are not sensitive to the addition of controls nor are they sensitive to selection on unobservables the results for our control variables align with our expectations economic theory and the literature on water demand several previous studies have found positive relationships between property value cv as a proxy for income and water demand and property value itself and water demand 7 9 11 65 basic economics informs us that households with higher incomes proxied by property value are able to purchase more goods and services water in this case moreover property values increase as property and building size increase ceteris paribus and larger properties tend to use more water on average 8 9 older buildings tend to have less efficient household appliances and plumbing and therefore have a higher average water consumption than newer buildings 7 indeed 66 also find a small but significant positive effect of building age on residential water consumption and they propose a similar mechanism however in our supplementary within between models appendix b we find small negative associations between average building age for an sa1 unit and water consumption 67 encountered similar associations and proposed that it may reflect older suburbs having greater tree and foliage cover which means less water is used particularly for gardening purposes if this is the case our fixed effects estimates will account for this unobserved factor but the between sa1 associations will not our demographics interaction results provide some further insights into the associations between water views and water consumption for starters when we look at higher income or more highly educated sa1 units the negative association between views of the coast and water consumption is greater likewise the models for higher income sa1 units yield a stronger positive association between lake views and water consumption this could be because higher income households have more discretionary income and flexibility in their water consumption which means any potential effects of water views on consumption would be stronger as they have more scope to respond interestingly the association between lake views and water consumption in relatively younger sa1 units is also stronger this could also be explained by our theoretical model and considerations around lived experiences and perceptions of water scarcity if indeed as our model suggests views of lakes reduce perceptions of water scarcity it may be that because younger households have had fewer experiences in their lifetime views of lakes have stronger effects on beliefs around water scarcity indeed in the identity economics literature experiences shape identity and our identity and attitudes change more when we are younger see ref 34 again though we recognise that we can not explicitly test our theoretical model and proposed mechanisms in this paper and that is a useful area for future research moreover the heterogeneity in our results has important policy implications around which households may be more or less influenced by water views and where intervention may be most effective 8 conclusion overall our results show that having views of water bodies or living within a short distance from water bodies is associated with and may affect water consumption we suggest that these associations are driven by perceptions of water scarcity and perceptions of the intrinsic value of water if our suggested mechanisms are correct views of lakes may undermine the information campaigns that water authorities run during droughts water authorities might want to emphasize in their communications that city water comes from a different source underground aquifers in the case of tauranga and that small lakes are too shallow or have too poor water quality to be useful sources alternatively water authorities might choose to specifically target people living near freshwater lakes with their water conservation campaigns and interventions moreover our theory suggests that if policymakers can increase the perceptions of scarcity or the concern for scarcity by increasing the value associated with water they will see reductions in household water demand this reinforces suggestions to encourage and enable citizens to have positive experiences in nature as this could generate stronger environmental attitudes and increase the incidence of pro environmental behaviours one of which is water conservation another interesting insight from our work revolves around the results for the association between views of lakes and water consumption in urban areas most of the freshwater lakes are small and man made often as is the case for many of the lakes in tauranga these are stormwater or storage lakes for new developments developers usually design these artificial lakes to be as visually pleasing as possible so that they can enhance the value of their property see our literature review for the effects of views of water bodies on house prices and meet regulatory requirements in new zealand developers must ensure their structures and lakes are aesthetically pleasing or at a minimum are not displeasing under resource management and consenting laws 68 if our results are causal the creation of these lakes may increase water consumption in surrounding properties this is an important factor to consider when evaluating the effects of artificial lakes on societal wellbeing see ref 69 for details on the effects of artificial lakes on human health promoting awareness of these potential effects to developers and residents could be a strategy to mitigate this however our research has important limitations one of which is the degree of causality our results imply we deploy several estimation techniques sa1 fixed effects including property level controls and estimating a set of results with conservative random sa1 slopes and robustness checks alternative specifications of the independent variable checking the stability of coefficients to the addition of control and assessing the likelihood of selection on unobservables to mitigate against omitted variable bias see appendix c for full discussion moreover while we cannot rule out reverse causality we find reverse causality arguments to be unconvincing see appendix c for more discussion our results suggest that there may be a causal relationship between views of different water bodies and water consumption future work should try to verify this effect using variation in views over time to avoid potential reverse causality issues additionally more research needs to occur to establish the true mechanism through which these effects may operate we also only look at this relationship in one regional context and for two types of water bodies and we do not have data on some relevant variables like water tank incidence solar panels water scarcity concerns and efficiency of household water appliances nonetheless we hope our empirical results theoretical model and proposed mechanisms describing the associations between views of water bodies and water consumption spur more research in this space future research could incorporate our theoretical model into existing frameworks for the formation of water scarcity perceptions and test these models empirically using structural estimation future researchers may also want to run lab or field experiments to investigate the environmental beauty premium hypothesis and the notion of availability or frequency bias as it relates to water consumption if researchers have access to survey data on environmental perceptions and water scarcity concerns they could evaluate how these vary between properties that do and do not have views of different water bodies using an approach like propensity score matching to balance on other covariates moreover there may be more complex relationships between perceptions of water scarcity and water consumption than our model suggests for example water conservation behaviours may have a feedback effect and reduce scarcity concerns thus increasing water consumption this is in line with work by ref 70 this highlights the importance of testing our model in future research additionally the quality of the water body in terms of pollutant concentration or water level is also likely to be important in mediating the relationship between views of water bodies and water consumption exploring this interaction would be a useful area for future research finally future research could examine the relationship between views of water bodies and water consumption in different geographical and social contexts originality statement the

brabyn and john gibson for their excellent advice and feedback on gis methods and econometric estimation methods finally we would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments which have significantly improved the paper appendix a further methodological details and steps for computing water views and distance variables the following steps are used in arcgis pro to operationalise the layers in table 1 to produce variables for views of the coast and lakes and distance to the coast and lakes these steps produce a series of points on the coast and around lakes that represent the locations we are calculating the viewsheds for arcgis pro step by step methods 1 select the tauranga city polygon in the territorial authorities layer and create a new layer with only this polygon 2 clip the nz coastlines nz lakes and nz property parcels layers to the new tauranga city polygon 3 3 to clip the coastline layer we digitised a new polygon which encompasses some of the pacific ocean because the tauranga city territorial authority boundary does not include some relevant parts of the coast 3 use the near arcgis pro function to calculate the shortest distance from each tauranga property parcel to the coastline and the nearest lake these are our proximity to the coast and lakes variables 4 use the generate points along lines arcgis pro function to generate a series of points n 999 in close proximity around the perimeter of all tauranga lakes which are relatively small 4 4 the number of points is somewhat arbitrary we had to keep the number of points beneath 1000 for the viewshed tool and we selected as close to the maximum as possible to give us greater accuracy 5 use the generate points along lines arcgis pro function to generate a series of points along the tauranga coastline n 750 6 generate a 3 km buffer around the coastline and then only select the buffer area that is in the ocean not on land 2 7 select only ocean areas within the buffer by running a union between the buffer layer and the tauranga territorial authority boundary layer and selecting for areas outside tauranga city s boundary which doesn t cover the coastal marine area 8 use the generate random points arcgis pro function to generate random points n 250 in the 3 km sea buffer region 5 5 properties may not be able to view the coast or beach but may have views of the sea just beyond the coastline hence we create additional points in the sea to calculate viewsheds for we do not do this for lakes because the lakes in tauranga are relatively small and are fully enclosed polygons hence the points on the opposite side of the lake will have the same effect as the additional random points we generate for the coast which is not an enclosed polygon 9 merge the random points in the sea buffer with the points along the coastline 10 use the viewshed ready to use arcgis pro function to calculate a raster for all locations cells within a 5 km radius that have views of any of the points around the lakes this uses a 24 m dem airbus defence and space 2022 11 use the viewshed ready to use arcgis pro function to calculate a raster for all locations cells within a 5 km radius that have views of any of the points on the coast or in the sea buffer this uses a 24 m dem airbus defence and space 2022 12 run a spatial join between the tauranga properties layer and each viewshed lakes and coast respectively using the match option have their centre in this returns a value of one if the geometric centre of the property is in a location with views of the lake or sea depending on which viewshed was used 13 finally to clean the coast viewshed output we intersect the resulting layer with the tauranga city boundary to only include locations on land within the

authors are often arguing whether the relationships they report are causal or correlational the conditions for true causality are strong and require that the observed coefficients are not subject to 1 significant omitted variable bias where an unobservable confounding variable affects both the treatment views of water bodies and the outcome water consumption or 2 simultaneity bias reverse causality where the outcome is actually determining the treatment or they are both determined at the same time in our paper we employ estimation techniques and robustness checks that aim to minimise the possibility of omitted variable bias we use a fixed effects approach which enables us to control for all time invariant over a 1 year period statistical area 1 sa1 unobservable characteristics which may be affecting both the views of water bodies and water consumption for example properties in particular coastal suburbs may be more likely to be holiday homes and consume less water our sa1 fixed effects will control for these spatial confounding variables 1 we control for property level characteristics like property value built area and property age that will undoubtedly be related to both views of water bodies and water consumption for example previous work shows that wealthier households proxied by property value consume more water and properties with views of water bodies have higher valuations 2 we find that our coefficients of interest are relatively stable to adding property level controls seasonal controls and sa1 fixed effects this suggests that our coefficients are not strongly related to other potentially confounding variables 3 using methods from ref 25 we find that selection on unobservables is unlikely to be an issue for our results 4 when we use distance as an alternative specification for the independent variable we find similar results 5 when we run a mixed model which allows for conservative random slopes for each sa1 unit our coefficients decrease slightly but are largely unchanged and still significant one major caveat is that our sa1 controls imperfectly control for property socio demographics and if we had property level fixed effects we wouldn t be able to assess the effects of views of water bodies because there is no variation over time however give the points made above we are reasonably confident that our results are not subject to omitted variable bias and selection on unobservables meanwhile we do have concerns over potential reverse causality because our views of water bodies variables are cross sectional this means we cannot track changing individual views for water users over time and we cannot completely rule out reverse causality arguments in saying that it is important to think through the reverse causality argument and what that actually means in the context of our paper reverse causality would suggest that water consumption is affecting views of water bodies through some mechanism this would occur for example if environmentally inclined individuals consume less water and also chose to locate closer to or further from water bodies in this case one may be concerned that environmentally conscious consumers locate within view of the coast and this drives our observed result while we cannot rule this out we would also expect environmentally conscious and aware consumers to locate further from the coast to minimise their residential impact on coastal ecosystems and as they are more acutely aware of rising sea levels as a result of climate change moreover if environmentally conscious consumers are driving our results we would not expect people living near lakes to consume more water the effect should operate in the opposite direction whereby environmentally conscious consumers locate closer to freshwater lakes and biodiversity and also consume less water further environmentally conscious consumers are much less likely to fall prey to the availability bias mechanism we suggest because these individuals are thinking more critically about environmental issues such as water scarcity therefore overall we do not find the reverse causality argument convincing however we cannot rule it out 
8637,freshwater scarcity is worsening as we quickly approach the freshwater planetary boundary there has been extensive research and policy development in the space of water scarcity pollution and accessibility centered around the sustainable development goals sdgs a large body of literature examines household and climate characteristics predictive of water consumption by households however there does not appear to be any research on the role of views of and proximity to water bodies in household water consumption in this paper we develop a simple model of water consumption which depends on the perceptions of water scarcity and the perceptions of whether water scarcity is an issue using geographic information systems gis viewshed analysis we model whether properties in tauranga new zealand have views of lakes and the coast we then use these variables in an sa1 unit fixed effects model of water consumption we find that views of lakes are associated with higher water consumption and views of the coast are associated with lower water consumption we suggest that these associations are driven by psychological biases which alter the perceptions of water scarcity and concern for water scarcity we deploy a range of robustness checks and argue that our results may be causal though further research is required to confirm this keywords water consumption viewshed analysis water scarcity fixed effects water demand jel classification d12 d91 q21 q25 data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is a prominent issue globally and we are fast approaching the freshwater consumption planetary boundary 1 2 much research and policymaking have focussed on reducing water scarcity pollution and making water accessible for all these foci are clearly evident in the united nation s sustainable development goals sdgs which provide the foundations of research and initiatives around the world 3 moreover water accounting methodologies have become popularised as a means of tracking the extraction use and return of water across regions and countries 4 these approaches aim to improve the management of water resources at a regional level in aotearoa new zealand towns cities and regions are facing more intense and frequent droughts worsening with climate change which are adding stress to water resources 5 these threats along with declining water quality and a historic underinvestment in water management infrastructure have led to the proposal of the controversial three waters reforms 6 in light of these global and local issues understanding water demand and household water consumption behaviour is more critical than ever for designing effective water management policy and infrastructure there is a large body of literature that demonstrates clear associations between household characteristics demographics and water demand for a review see ref 7 research shows that higher incomes and higher property values are associated with greater water consumption across a range of contexts 7 11 moreover 7 describe a range of other demographic factors that affect water consumption like household size which also operates through the property value and income channels age interest in gardening and education level 7 these types of findings are important to policymakers as they allow water policy and demand interventions to be more targeted and thus more efficient indeed there is a burgeoning literature which assesses how and where policy interventions reduce water consumption and encourage pro environmental behaviours for a review of field experiments in environmental economics see ref 12 there is also a large field of research that looks into the role of nudges altering choice architecture without changing incentives or using coercion in reducing water consumption 13 14 one household characteristic that may influence water consumption but has received relatively little attention is the views of nearby water bodies could living near the coast or a lake impact water consumption if so what does that mean for future policy work around reducing water consumption and addressing water scarcity in this paper we use water consumption data for tauranga new zealand to investigate the association between views of water bodies and proximity to water bodies and water consumption this is the first study that we know of that tests such associations we first use geographic information systems gis viewshed analysis to calculate whether properties have views of water bodies and how far they are from these water bodies we distinguish between views of lakes and views of the coast as these two types of water bodies are quite distinct in tauranga and views of them may have differential impacts on water consumption we then use these variables in standard econometric models of water consumption to examine whether household views of water bodies and proximity to water bodies are associated with water consumption there is an extensive literature that uses viewshed analysis and variations of viewshed analysis to determine if properties have views of the sea and of lakes a substantial proportion of this literature uses viewshed output as a regressor in hedonic models for property valuations and find positive relationships between views of the sea or lakes and property value 15 18 19 uses viewshed analysis in developing the new zealand landscape classification nzlc which depends on the views and perceptions of landforms from a particular location 20 uses viewshed analysis to find that the effects of views of water bodies on property value diminishes with distance from the water body 18 find views of small man made lakes have significant positive effects on property value this is particularly relevant for the tauranga region which mostly contains small lakes views of water affect perceptions of landscape character 15 19 we propose that views of water also affect the perceptions of water scarcity and the perceptions of the intrinsic value of water in line with the literature on pro environmental attitudes and behaviours see ref 21 these perceptions may subsequently affect water consumption and undermine public water conservation campaigns run during warm periods and droughts usually in summer as far as we are aware there are no studies econometrically linking water consumption and views of water we develop a simple theoretical model of water consumption building on the literature on the relationship between perceived water scarcity and water consumption some studies have shown negative associations between awareness of water scarcity issues and water consumption 22 24 in our model if views of water bodies increase decrease the perceptions of water scarcity or the concern for water scarcity issues water consumption will decrease increase we then run fixed effects regression models regressing views of water bodies on water consumption controlling for seasonality and time invariant unobservables we propose possible interpretations of results in line with our theoretical model using insights from behavioural economics and psychology we note that we are unable to explicitly test our theoretical model and the mechanisms driving the associations between water views and water consumption we leave this for future research our empirical results are robust to changes in the specification of the independent variable adding controls using more conservative modelling approaches using a sub sample of the tauranga area and selection on unobservables which we test using the methods described by ref 25 this leads us to conclude that the associations we find may be causal although we can not conclude this definitively our contribution to the literature is three fold first we empirically estimate the association between views of water bodies lakes and the coast and water consumption which hasn t been done as far as we are aware our data and modelling approach also mean that the associations we present may indeed be causal relationships second we develop a novel theoretical model describing the association between views of water bodies and water consumption third we link this model to the behavioural economics and psychology literature to suggest why the effects of views of water bodies may differ depending on the type of water body while we cannot directly test our theoretical model and proposed mechanisms they along with our empirical results provide a strong foundation for future research in this area 2 empirical context tauranga fig 1 is a coastal city in new zealand which is well suited for analysing the effects of water views because it has both a coastline and freshwater lakes the beaches and sea are highly regarded internationally the lakes are relatively small and arguably less appealing indeed there are no major lakes in tauranga 27 1 1 major refers to the top twenty lakes in new zealand by surface area this study uses quarterly household level water consumption data for approximately 39 224 single unit residential properties in tauranga for the year 2020 21 tauranga has a relatively simple water price structure with a single volumetric price per cubic meter for all residential water users the price is set by the tauranga city council each winter and applies for the 12 months from july 1st to june 30 3 theory 3 1 model overview below we develop a theoretical model linking water views and water consumption that we will use to suggest explanations for our later empirical results we do not test our theoretical model in this paper but make recommendations on how this model could be tested in the future we adapt the approaches taken in refs 28 29 to theorise a simple utility function 1 u u y θ k where utility u is a function increasing in water consumption y decreasing in the perceived contribution to water scarcity k and quasi concave θ is a normalised indicator of whether the consumer cares about water scarcity θ 0 1 in reality θ could take on many values between zero and one but for simplicity we could assume there are two types of consumers those who care θ 1 and those who do not care θ 0 about water scarcity the perceived contribution to water scarcity k can be written as a function of water consumption itself as higher water consumption reduces the availability of water for others and the perceived extent of the water scarcity issue 2 k k ρ y where ρ is the perception of the extent of the water scarcity issue and is a real number between 0 and 1 ρ r 0 ρ 1 we can see that if ρ 0 that is the individual doesn t believe there are any water scarcity issues the perceived contribution to water scarcity k will be equal to zero and the utility function will contract to only be increasing in the consumption of water y we can re write 1 by integrating 2 3 u u y θ ρ y u y 1 θ ρ from 3 our model shows that if consumers perceive greater water scarcity and care about water scarcity utility from water consumption will decline at all levels of consumption and ceteris paribus we expect individuals to consume less water we propose that views of water bodies affect parameters ρ and θ and thus affect water consumption we diagrammatically illustrate this in fig 2 this model would lend itself to structural estimation if you could measure perceived scarcity and concern for scarcity which is out of the scope for this paper 3 2 model background and research propositions our simple framework is consistent with the literature on the relationship between perceived water scarcity and water consumption several studies show negative associations between awareness of water scarcity or water conservation issues and water consumption 22 23 30 for example 24 in the context of agricultural water use posits that farmers water use strongly relates to their awareness and perception of water shortage 24 develops a structural model to examine the determinants of farmers perceptions of water scarcity and find that age time spent farming and social networks significantly influence these perceptions however the authors do not consider views of water bodies as determinants of the perceptions of water scarcity and do not empirically link perceptions of water scarcity to water consumption in line with 31 we argue that persistent views of water bodies are part of peoples experiences and interactions with water and this in turn influences their perceptions of water scarcity issues and the degree to which they care about such issues indeed there is an extensive literature that acknowledges that experiences shape people s identities and values for example see refs 32 34 hence in our theoretical framework we propose that views of and proximity to water affects consumption by influencing ρ and θ however views and proximity to water will only influence water consumption if people care about water scarcity in the first place θ 0 we show the proposed effect on perceived water scarcity of having views of water bodies in fig 2 in fig 2 the blue lines represent the proposed mechanism for the effect of views of water bodies on water consumption the observable effect shown by the green arrow we note that in our later analysis we cannot directly observe perceptions of water scarcity and the extent to which consumers care about water scarcity and we therefore cannot show whether our proposed mechanisms are true nonetheless the model in fig 2 provides a useful foundation for future research that may couple structural estimation in line with 24 and the empirical analysis of water consumption data concerning the differential impact of views of lakes and views of the coast on water consumption we state two propositions that are in line with our theoretical conceptualization of water demand the local context and the economics and psychology literature we suggest that consistent views of and interactions with lakes may lead to downward bias estimates of the severity of water scarcity issues and thus lead to higher water consumption individuals who are frequently exposed to freshwater may be prone to the baader meinhof phenomenon frequency bias where they believe there is more freshwater than there actually is 35 36 describe a similar notion of availability bias where an individual s perceptions of a group are based on readily available information hence we may expect individuals to form their views of the state of water assets and scarcity in part by their immediate surroundings proposition 1 individuals with lake views will have a lower perception of water scarcity ρ and ceteris paribus consume more water on the other hand we suggest that consistent views of the beautiful tauranga coastline may garner a higher level of intrinsic value for water and thus reduce water consumption 100 26 in the study area tauranga the beaches and coast are of high quality nationally and internationally for example 100 26 describes mount maunganui beach in tauranga as one of the most stunning beaches in new zealand fig 1 moreover in 2019 mount maunganui beach was ranked as the top beach on tripadvisor for the sixth year running moreover the seawater in tauranga is of a high quality nationally and internationally 37 we hypothesise that views of such stunning beaches and coastline may generate a greater appreciation and concern for water scarcity analogous to beauty premiums in the labour market 38 being exposed to beautiful bodies of water may increase the value placed on water and result in a greater concern for water scarcity issues indeed there are many studies linking positive interactions with nature to a higher perceived values of nature 21 39 40 proposition 2 individuals with sea views will have greater concern for water scarcity and ceteris paribus consume less water in our econometric model of water demand we estimate the associations between views of lakes and views of the coast and water consumption controlling for important property level characteristics seasonality and regional heterogeneity again we cannot elicit the exact mechanism through which this association is operating however if the associations are significant and in line with our propositions it implies some support for the mechanisms proposed above 4 gis data and methods all necessary data to determine views of and proximity to the coast and lakes for tauranga city properties are publicly available the full set of publicly available gis data used in this paper are described in table 1 we provide full details in appendix a on the steps we take to operationalise the layers in table 1 and compute variables for the views of and distance to lakes and the coast the dem with a 24 m resolution obtains a good balance between achieving a sufficient level of detail and processing capability a 24 m dem is well within the range of dem resolutions used in the academic literature and is manageable with standard computing hardware 16 17 41 moreover the source of our dem data worlddem dataset airbus defence and space 2022 is widely used in academic research for recent examples see refs 41 43 in urban areas the dem is essentially a digital terrain model dtm so surface level distortions are removed for example other buildings which improves the accuracy of the dem airbus defence and space 2022 this means our subsequent views variables are conservative because they do not account for blocking buildings however this is not a concern for our analysis as our interest in views and their association with water consumption relate to how frequently people see such water bodies on a day to day basis see the theory section hence viewshed output using a dtm rather than a dsm is appropriate here as a proxy for whether a household sees the water body on a regular basis other papers also use dtms instead of dsms 18 44 and the decision on the best tool is highly context dependent 45 using a dtm 18 show the viewshed output is highly accurate when compared with ground truthed results another option was to use lidar data 1 m resolution dem which is available for some areas of new zealand however as our viewshed analysis uses the entire tauranga city territory the computational requirements were excessive and unnecessarily precise for computing a view variable to be used in later econometric models particularly given our focus on how regularly households view the water bodies rather than a specific line of sight 16 developed an adaptation of the typical viewshed analysis for assessing the impact of water views on property values they generate a unique dem for each property to ensure that individual properties don t block their own view of amenities and so that a full 360 degree view can be accounted for this approach was not necessary for our analysis as we are only interested in views of specific water bodies on a day to day basis which are in a pre defined direction from each property our distance to water bodies variables are relatively simple planar euclidian distance to the nearest water body in line with work by ref 46 this is because visual distance not travel distance which could be estimated using network analysis for example see ref 47 is the variable of interest moreover euclidian distance is a common measure used in hedonic property value models for computing distance to water bodies and other amenities like parks see refs 17 20 48 51 the distance to water bodies variable is a useful alternative independent variable because distance to water bodies and views of water bodies are closely related if our results are robust to using the view and distance variables we can be confident that our viewshed analysis is performing well not including areas that shouldn t be and vice versa moreover the distance to water bodies variable can help us investigate whether the strength of the association between views of water bodies and water consumption declines with distance as the effects of views of water bodies on property prices do a natural extension of work by ref 20 5 econometric data and methods water demand at the household level is influenced by various socio demographic factors such as household size age income interest in gardening and education level 7 as with most water demand studies socio demographic information is not available at the household level 7 like other studies we therefore use property characteristics as proxy variables house area is a proxy for household size site area for outdoor water needs building age as a proxy for water efficiency of fixtures and capital value as a measure of wealth we also include statistical area 1 sa1 census unit socio demographic variables which capture some of the variation between small communities 2 2 sa1 units usually contain 100 200 residents and are capped at 500 residents see table 1 for more information on the sa1 units these variables include median income median age homeownership rate and proportion of residents with post secondary school education property level variables are hereafter referred to as group 1 variables while the census area variables are referred to as group 2 contextual variables there are four water meter readings for each property group 1 unit representing the quarters between 1 july 2020 and 30 june 2021 the volumetric price per cubic meter of water was constant at 2 23 over this period apartment blocks in our dataset have separate water meter readings for each apartment there are a few apartment blocks in tauranga that do not have separate water meter readings for each apartment and these were not included in our data we elect to pool the four quarters together and include time fixed effects dummies for each time period to account for period specific or seasonal shocks as 52 show pooled ordinary least squares ols enables us to consistently estimate the coefficients on time invariant variables views of water bodies as we have a large number of properties n 39 224 a small number time periods n 4 and we include time fixed effects in our modelling estimates will still be consistent if there is serial correlation 53 55 in our modelling we apply log transformations to our dependent variable and continuous predictor variables this is in line with the extensive water demand and water consumption modelling literature and has the advantage the estimates can be interpreted as elasticities for example see refs 10 56 57 for panel data clustered by level 2 groups sa1 units in our case the literature suggests using fixed effects or mixed models with random effects for the level 2 groups also known as within between hierarchical mundlak or correlated random effects models 53 58 59 fixed effects models are more popular in the economics literature while mixed models are more commonly used in other social science disciplines 59 suggests this is because endogeneity is considered more of a problem in economics while psychology traditionally focussed on controlled experiments we start with a properly defined fixed effects model and then use a within between mixed model specification which allows for random slopes as a robustness check the fixed effects model is desirable because it accounts for all time invariant level 2 variables and ensures these variables do not bias the within estimates of level 1 variables 54 hence we account for all demographic factors at the statistical area 1 level the demographics are time invariant over the four quarters the fixed effects model is as follows 4 y i j t β 0 β 1 n t β 2 x i t β 3 p i t c j ε i t where y i t is logged daily water consumption for property i in sa1 area j at time t n t is a vector of time period dummies x i t is a column vector of our regressors of interest views of water bodies lakes and sea p i t is a column vector of control variables logged if appropriate that vary at level 1 c j is a vector of intercepts for each level 2 group and ε i t is an idiosyncratic error term under 4 β 2 are the coefficients of interest on our independent variables and they represent within sa 1 effects as between sa 1 effects are removed by the sa 1 fixed effects for example if x i t is a dummy variable 0 1 for views of the sea β 2 reflects the average change in water consumption between properties in the same sa 1 unit who have and don t have views of the sea evidently this is a useful model because we only compare properties in the same sa 1 unit and sa 1 units are relatively fine spatial aggregations in terms of population statistics to obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of x i j t on water consumption we would have to assume contemporaneous exogeneity 5 e ε i j t x i j t p i j t c j 0 where for this assumption to be valid variables that may affect x i t and y i t causing omitted variable bias must be time invariant and appropriately defined at level 2 this is the assumption required to show causality given the lack of household sociodemographic data we can only report associations however our robustness checks allow us to get closer to satisfying the assumption in equation 5 to test for the appropriateness of the sa 1 fixed effects we use a mundlak approach to test whether the means of our level 1 variables by level 2 groups are jointly zero in a random effects model 53 unlike the hausman test we are able to include a robust variance covariance matrix when we perform this diagnostic test we find strong evidence p value 0 01 that the time invariant sa 1 level variables are related to our predictors and outcome variable and that sa 1 level fixed effects are appropriate 5 1 robustness checks and causality discussion 5 1 1 mundlak mixed effects modelling moreover we provide supplementary within between mundlak modelling to include between sa 1 associations where we control for a set of sa 1 level covariates for the between sa1 estimates we are less worried about non classical measurement error that may arise from assuming sa 1 demographics appropriately control for property demographics that influence water consumption 60 the within between or mundlak models are random effects type models that relax some of the restrictive assumptions in typical random effects models 53 55 58 in a typical random effects model we would model random intercepts c j for each sa 1 unit and assume that these intercepts are uncorrelated with x i j t 6 c o v c j x i j t 0 in our fixed effects model we were not required to assume a relationship between the sa 1 intercepts and our level 1 varying regressors in a correlated random effects model mundlak model we relax the random effects assumption and explicitly model the relationship between the sa 1 intercepts and the level 1 regressors x i j t and p i j t usually the modelled relationship developed by ref 61 and 53 is as follows 7 e c j x j φ δ 1 x j δ 2 p j where x j and p j are vectors of averages across each sa 1 unit and φ is random variation we can thus decompose c j into 8 c j φ δ 1 x j δ 2 p j a j where a j are the random intercepts for each sa 1 unit with an expectation of zero by substituting 8 into the fixed effects model 4 we get the final correlated random effects model 9 y i j t β 0 β 1 n t β 2 x i j t β 3 p i j t β 3 h j φ δ 1 x j δ 1 p j a j ε i j t where it is well documented that the estimate of β 2 in 9 is identical to the estimate from the fixed effects model in 4 for further discussion see ref 59 however in 9 we can now include sa 1 level variables h j and we can estimate the contextual essentially the between effects δ 1 of our regressors of interest x to put it in context estimates of δ 1 will show the change in average water consumption when moving from an sa 1 unit without views of water bodies to an sa 1 unit with views another advantage of 9 is that we can include random slopes on x for each sa 1 unit 53 59 if the random slopes are important excluding them may generate bias estimates and standard errors excluding random slopes where they are significant will lead to anti conservative standard errors 58 62 in saying that modelling random effects and slopes interactions between each sa1 unit and the view of water variables is not a parsimonious approach and uses up many degrees of freedom indeed our initial fixed effects model 4 minimises the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic compared to the within between models with and without random slopes equation 9 in this sense these models are conservative and a good test of whether results from our preferred fixed effects models are robust 5 1 2 distance to water bodies variables as a robustness check for our viewshed gis analysis which we use to generate x i j t we run our fixed effects 4 models using a categorical distance to the nearest water body term x within 500 m between 500 m and 1 km between 1 and 2 km greater than 2 km as an alternative measure of view exposure to types of water bodies if being close to water bodies has a similar association with water consumption as being able to view water bodies we can be confident that our viewshed analysis is performing well we also run interactions between our views of water variables and time period dummies to check whether certain periods or seasons are driving key results finally we run interactions between our categorical distance to water variables and views of water variables in line with insights from ref 20 this enables us to observe if the strength of the association declines with distance from the water body 5 1 3 sa1 size and causality assumptions in our main models see equation 4 identification relies on the assumption in equation 5 that the error term is uncorrelated with our views of water bodies variables conditional on our property level controls sa1 fixed effects and time fixed effects the perfect hypothetical counterfactual in our design for the properties with views of water bodies would be the exact same property but without views of water bodies our model and sa1 fixed effects mean we are essentially comparing water consumption between properties with and without views of water bodies in the same sa1 unit controlling for property level characteristics like value comparing properties within the same sa1 unit is a useful way of constructing a reasonable counterfactual for our analysis famously tobler s 1970 first law of geography famously stated that near things are more related than distant things indeed it seems reasonable to use properties without views that are in close proximity to those with views as the counterfactual for this analysis of course these counterfactuals are more convincing the smaller the sa1 unit size this is because the properties within small sa1 units are closer together and less likely to differ on unobservable attributes that may cause omitted variable bias for example the likelihood of a property being a holiday home to explore this further in the results section we map the population of sa1 units in the tauranga area and show that most units are relatively small in size there are only a few sa1 units that appear relatively large and these are the sa1 units we would be most concerned about in terms of omitted variable bias as such as an additional robustness check we re run our main models four times excluding properties in a the largest 10 of sa1 units b the largest 20 of sa1 units c the largest 30 of sa1 units and d sa1 units with an above average geographical area 5 1 4 other robustness checks we estimate variance covariance matrices that are robust to unknown forms of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation we also ensure our standard errors are clustered at the property level and in the supplementary within between modelling clustered at the more conservative sa1 unit level finally we use well cited methods described by ref 25 to assess the possibility that omitted variable bias is driving our results using tools developed by ref 25 we can estimate the coefficients of our view variables if selection on unobservables is equally as strong as selection on observables we also compute oster s delta values to determine how strong selection on unobservables would need to be to reduce our coefficients to zero 6 results 6 1 descriptive results viewshed results show that large areas of tauranga city have views of the harbour and ocean fig 3 properties with lake views tend to be further inland but are spread across most areas of the city fig 4 we present summary statistics for the variables used in the fixed effects models table 2 in column one we show statistics for the whole sample while in columns two and three we show statistics for the sub sample with views of lakes and views of the coast respectively there is a reasonably high proportion of properties that have some view of a lake or the coast 31 7 and 30 4 respectively we note that this arises because of the way we compute our viewshed variables which are designed to indicate whether a resident regularly sees the water body rather than whether the specific water body is in view from a window of the house the average water consumption per property per day is 0 47 m3 equivalent to 171 55 m3 or 171 55 thousand litres per property per year the average building age is 29 years old the average capital value cv is nzd 781 446 the average built area is 111 m2 and median personal income per year is nzd 34 224 overall the summary statistics are similar between the overall sample and the two sub samples with views however properties with views of lakes appear newer and properties with views of the coast appear older on average moreover properties with views of the coast have higher values cvs on average interestingly properties with views of the coast that have higher cvs are in sa1 units with slightly lower incomes this may arise because homes in tauranga by the beach are older table 2 and more likely to have been with families for a longer period of time hence fewer of these properties go up for sale and there is less sorting of higher income families into higher cv properties moreover the dramatic increases in house price rises in tauranga have only recently occurred and before this it would have been much easier for households of a range of income levels to afford such properties 63 these differences highlight the importance of controlling for property level and sa1 level characteristics when we look at the association between views of water bodies and water consumption as mentioned previously we also show the full population of sa1 units in fig 5 evidently most sa1 units are small with a median size of 6 ha mean size of 17 ha and a maximum size of 1 156 ha for our robustness checks we re run our main models sequentially removing properties in a the largest 10 of sa1 units sa1 cut off of 23 8 ha b the largest 20 of sa1 units sa1 cut off of 10 9 ha c the largest 30 of sa1 units sa1 cut off of 8 3 ha and d sa1 units with an above average geographical area sa1 cut off of 16 6 ha 6 2 empirical results table 3 presents the fixed effects model estimates with different inclusions with respect to the predictors of interest the first three columns present results for regressors that relate to lakes and the final three columns relate to the coast in each set of three the first column 1 and 4 reports the results for the model with the view of water variable the second column 2 and 5 shows the results for the model with the categorical distance from water variable and the third column 3 and 6 shows the results for the model with the interaction between the view of water and distance to water variables in table 3 and subsequent tables care must be taken when interpreting the coefficients the dependent variable is logged and so are the continuous predictors while the categorical or binary predictors are not the coefficients on log variables may be interpreted as elasticities the coefficients on dummy and linear variables are semi elasticities which are the percent change in water consumption associated with a one unit change in the explanatory variable 6 2 1 views and distance to water bodies variables we find that having views of lakes are associated with 4 52 higher water consumption conversely views of the coast are associated with 4 26 lower water consumption these results are robust to using a distance to water measure instead properties more than 500 m from a lake consume 6 1 more water than properties less than 500 m from a lake we perform two tailed t tests and find that there is no significant further decline associated with living more than 500 m from a lake households living closer to lakes or with views of lakes have higher water consumption on average conversely households more than 500 m from the coast consume 4 5 6 1 more water as with the lakes model the effect of additional distance is statistically insignificant these results suggest that people living in close proximity to the coast and people living with views of the coast consume less water on average when we include an interaction between views of water bodies and distance to water bodies we find that the association between views of lakes and the coast are stronger for those living within 500 m of the water body itself and the strength of the association declines with distance from the water bodies for example when living within 500 m of a lake views of the lake are associated with 7 3 higher water consumption however when living 500 m to 1 km or 1 2 km from a lake views of the lake are associated with only 1 1 or 4 4 higher water consumption respectively turning to the coast when living within 500 m of the coast properties with views of the coast have 6 8 lower average water consumption however when living 500 m to 1 km or 1 2 km from the coast properties with views of the coast have lower water consumption by only 1 1 or 3 3 respectively these interactions minimise the aic and bic criteria relative to models with either views of water bodies or distance to water bodies variables alone this validates the inclusion of the interaction 6 2 2 other variables we also find that a 10 increase in the cv is associated with 5 greater water use between 4 7 and 5 2 depending on the exact model and a 10 increase in the building age is associated with approximately 0 75 higher water use built area m2 does not enter our model with any significance and we suspect any relationship is likely incorporated into the cv regressor coefficient 6 2 3 interactions with time in table 4 we present the results for our preferred fixed effects model with an interaction with time period dummies each period 1 4 lines up reasonably closely with the four seasons in new zealand hence in table 4 we label the periods by the season they correspond to noting that winter is the base and starting period these results show that the association between views of lakes and water consumption doesn t vary across the seasons periods however the associations between views of the coast and water consumption are stronger more negative in spring and autumn than winter and summer 6 2 4 interactions with demographics we also present the results of some full interaction models with our available demographics variables in table 5 for each of the demographic variables we generate below and above median sub samples and re estimate our main fixed effects models for views of lakes and the coast we use the variables income cv as a proxy for wealth education age and sa1 size these represent common interactions for the water consumption literature for variables that we have access to ref 7 our results show that higher income sa1 areas and wealthier households as proxied by cv have stronger associations between views of lakes and water consumption coefficient is greater in magnitude likewise the negative association between views of the coast and water consumption is stronger for high income and wealthier households the association for lake views is relatively consistent between high and low education sa1 units but the views of coast coefficient is significantly stronger more negative for higher educated sa1 units also the sub sample of relatively younger sa1 units yields a stronger coefficient for the lake views model finally we can see that above median sized sa1 units yield significantly stronger coefficients for both lakes and the coast 6 2 5 results for mixed model and smaller sa1 models as a robustness check we present our within between model results in appendix b using a likelihood ratio lr test we found random slopes to be an important addition to the within between models we also find the variance of the random effects and random slopes are large and significant indicating that the association between views of water bodies and water consumption vary considerably by sa1 unit the estimates for the associations between views of water bodies and water consumption without random slopes in appendix b are significant and identical to the fixed effects results in table 3 as we would expect however the standard errors are larger and more conservative when we introduce random slopes the coefficients decrease slightly in size but retain statistical significance given the conservative nature of these results we find good support for our main fixed effects results these tables also report between sa1 effects which are really associations rather than effects because they do not control for time invariant sa1 heterogeneity we also note that when we run our main models and exclude larger sa1 units from the model our results are still significant and the coefficients are largely similar this shows that when we limit the comparisons between properties to those in close proximity in the same small sa1 unit where omitted variable bias is less of a concern our results stand 6 2 6 selection on unobservables as the potential for omitted variable bias is a concern we present results highlighting the likelihood and effects of selection on unobservables table 6 as in ref 25 paper for our view variables we report uncontrolled coefficients first column and the model r2 controlled coefficients our fixed effects estimates in column three and the model r2 and bias adjusted coefficients which assume selection on unobservables is equal to selection on observables column 5 we find that adding controls sa1 fixed effects property level characteristics time dummies significantly increases the explanatory power of the model and doesn t shift the coefficients on our view variables by much if anything adding controls strengthens the observed association for views of the coast further the bias adjusted coefficient on views of lakes is very similar to our main findings and the bias adjusted coefficient on views of coast is more negative than our main findings we also report oster s deltas in column 6 which shows that selection on unobservables would need to be at least 1 34 and 1 42 times greater than selection on observables to reduce our views of lakes and views of the coast coefficients to zero to put that in context the majority of cases in ref 25 paper have an oster s delta that is less than one average is 0 46 and 86 of deltas fall in the 0 1 range as such 25 suggests using one as an upper bound and a common heuristic is that if oster s deltas are greater than one the main results are supported taken together the stability of our coefficients to controls the similarity of our coefficients to bias adjusted coefficients and the relatively large oster s deltas the results in table 6 show that omitted variable bias is likely not a major issue for our results 7 discussion our empirical results provide some support for our propositions 1 and 2 in section 2 we described a model of water consumption that depends on the perceived scarcity of water and the concern about water scarcity generally in short we postulate that people who believe that water resources are scarce or under pressure and are concerned about water scarcity will consume less water in proposition 1 we drew upon notions of frequency and availability bias 35 36 to suggest that people living near lakes may believe there is more freshwater than there actually is in believing this these individuals would have a lower perception of water scarcity and thus consume more water than an equivalent person who doesn t live near a lake our results support proposition 1 because we find that properties with views of lakes have significantly greater water consumption 4 6 greater and this association is more pronounced for people who live closer to the lakes than people who live further away whilst these associations may sound small they are equivalent to a substantial change in average annual water consumption over the region and are even larger if the results scale up to the national level a 4 6 increase in water consumption is equivalent to an additional 7 9 m3 7 900 l of water per property per year if our suggested mechanism of availability bias is correct and our effects are found to be causal the existence of the lakes may cause 98 134 m3 of additional water consumption 7 9 times number of properties with views per year in proposition 2 we made a distinctive link between beauty premiums in the labour market and beauty premiums in water consumption we suggest that views and proximity to beautiful bodies of water may increase the value people associate with water if people value water more they may have a greater concern for water scarcity and thus consume less water our results also support proposition 2 and we find that those with views of the coast consume significantly less water 4 26 less and that this association diminishes with distance from the coast we also note that the association is weaker during winter and summer one possibility is that warmer weather is associated with higher occupation of coastal holidays homes and more positive experiences and perceptions of the coast and beaches however perhaps during the summer period overcrowding of beaches and coastal suburbs during peak tourist months 64 may diminish those positive perceptions slightly as a result the association between views of the coast and water use during winter being the coldest season and summer being the season with the highest incidence of overcrowding are lower this is one possible interpretation and it aligns with the perception mechanisms we propose in the theory section in our framework the beauty and frequency bias mechanisms might offset each other however tauranga lakes are all relatively small and are not well known nationally or internationally hence we see less scope for the proposed beauty effects to apply to the lakes although they may still exist to a lesser degree for some groups of the population indeed our summary statistics in table 2 support this notion as on average properties with views of the sea have higher property values conversely properties with views of the small lakes in tauranga do not have higher market values on average suggesting the quality of the views are insufficient to generate a market premium moreover we suspect that views of and proximity to the coast wouldn t result in the proposed frequency bias effects because the frequency bias mechanism operates through perceptions of freshwater availability not saltwater availability we stress that our theory and proposed mechanisms are not the only way our observed results may be operating while we have built our theory section on previous work in the economics and psychology literature we are unable to directly test whether the mechanism is correct we believe this to be an important area for future research along with studying this phenomenon in different contexts for example future work may want to incorporate our theoretical model into a structural equation model to estimate the relationships between views of water bodies and the parameters in our theoretical model perceptions of scarcity and concern for scarcity this would require primary data collection to elicit perceptions of scarcity and levels of concern there are other explanations for our results that lie outside of our proposed model for example coastal properties may use less water because their gardens have more salt resistant plants that need less water alternatively coastal properties may consume less water because they are more likely to be holiday homes which are occupied less frequently on average for the lake views model it may be that differences in sociodemographics induce sorting into properties with and without lake views and this is driving the observed associations however in our modelling we include sa1 unit fixed effects which should control for local conditions local climate visitation patterns etc our approach means we are comparing properties in the same sa1 unit so we are comparing properties in the same coastal sa1 units or lake adjacent sa1 units therefore factors like more resistant vegetation and the incidence of holiday homes are unlikely to be driving our results as these factors are likely to be stable across the sa1 geographically scale also when sa1 units are relatively small there are likely fewer differences in sociodemographics and we find our results hold when restricting our analyses to only relatively small sa1 units moreover we find that our results are not sensitive to the addition of controls nor are they sensitive to selection on unobservables the results for our control variables align with our expectations economic theory and the literature on water demand several previous studies have found positive relationships between property value cv as a proxy for income and water demand and property value itself and water demand 7 9 11 65 basic economics informs us that households with higher incomes proxied by property value are able to purchase more goods and services water in this case moreover property values increase as property and building size increase ceteris paribus and larger properties tend to use more water on average 8 9 older buildings tend to have less efficient household appliances and plumbing and therefore have a higher average water consumption than newer buildings 7 indeed 66 also find a small but significant positive effect of building age on residential water consumption and they propose a similar mechanism however in our supplementary within between models appendix b we find small negative associations between average building age for an sa1 unit and water consumption 67 encountered similar associations and proposed that it may reflect older suburbs having greater tree and foliage cover which means less water is used particularly for gardening purposes if this is the case our fixed effects estimates will account for this unobserved factor but the between sa1 associations will not our demographics interaction results provide some further insights into the associations between water views and water consumption for starters when we look at higher income or more highly educated sa1 units the negative association between views of the coast and water consumption is greater likewise the models for higher income sa1 units yield a stronger positive association between lake views and water consumption this could be because higher income households have more discretionary income and flexibility in their water consumption which means any potential effects of water views on consumption would be stronger as they have more scope to respond interestingly the association between lake views and water consumption in relatively younger sa1 units is also stronger this could also be explained by our theoretical model and considerations around lived experiences and perceptions of water scarcity if indeed as our model suggests views of lakes reduce perceptions of water scarcity it may be that because younger households have had fewer experiences in their lifetime views of lakes have stronger effects on beliefs around water scarcity indeed in the identity economics literature experiences shape identity and our identity and attitudes change more when we are younger see ref 34 again though we recognise that we can not explicitly test our theoretical model and proposed mechanisms in this paper and that is a useful area for future research moreover the heterogeneity in our results has important policy implications around which households may be more or less influenced by water views and where intervention may be most effective 8 conclusion overall our results show that having views of water bodies or living within a short distance from water bodies is associated with and may affect water consumption we suggest that these associations are driven by perceptions of water scarcity and perceptions of the intrinsic value of water if our suggested mechanisms are correct views of lakes may undermine the information campaigns that water authorities run during droughts water authorities might want to emphasize in their communications that city water comes from a different source underground aquifers in the case of tauranga and that small lakes are too shallow or have too poor water quality to be useful sources alternatively water authorities might choose to specifically target people living near freshwater lakes with their water conservation campaigns and interventions moreover our theory suggests that if policymakers can increase the perceptions of scarcity or the concern for scarcity by increasing the value associated with water they will see reductions in household water demand this reinforces suggestions to encourage and enable citizens to have positive experiences in nature as this could generate stronger environmental attitudes and increase the incidence of pro environmental behaviours one of which is water conservation another interesting insight from our work revolves around the results for the association between views of lakes and water consumption in urban areas most of the freshwater lakes are small and man made often as is the case for many of the lakes in tauranga these are stormwater or storage lakes for new developments developers usually design these artificial lakes to be as visually pleasing as possible so that they can enhance the value of their property see our literature review for the effects of views of water bodies on house prices and meet regulatory requirements in new zealand developers must ensure their structures and lakes are aesthetically pleasing or at a minimum are not displeasing under resource management and consenting laws 68 if our results are causal the creation of these lakes may increase water consumption in surrounding properties this is an important factor to consider when evaluating the effects of artificial lakes on societal wellbeing see ref 69 for details on the effects of artificial lakes on human health promoting awareness of these potential effects to developers and residents could be a strategy to mitigate this however our research has important limitations one of which is the degree of causality our results imply we deploy several estimation techniques sa1 fixed effects including property level controls and estimating a set of results with conservative random sa1 slopes and robustness checks alternative specifications of the independent variable checking the stability of coefficients to the addition of control and assessing the likelihood of selection on unobservables to mitigate against omitted variable bias see appendix c for full discussion moreover while we cannot rule out reverse causality we find reverse causality arguments to be unconvincing see appendix c for more discussion our results suggest that there may be a causal relationship between views of different water bodies and water consumption future work should try to verify this effect using variation in views over time to avoid potential reverse causality issues additionally more research needs to occur to establish the true mechanism through which these effects may operate we also only look at this relationship in one regional context and for two types of water bodies and we do not have data on some relevant variables like water tank incidence solar panels water scarcity concerns and efficiency of household water appliances nonetheless we hope our empirical results theoretical model and proposed mechanisms describing the associations between views of water bodies and water consumption spur more research in this space future research could incorporate our theoretical model into existing frameworks for the formation of water scarcity perceptions and test these models empirically using structural estimation future researchers may also want to run lab or field experiments to investigate the environmental beauty premium hypothesis and the notion of availability or frequency bias as it relates to water consumption if researchers have access to survey data on environmental perceptions and water scarcity concerns they could evaluate how these vary between properties that do and do not have views of different water bodies using an approach like propensity score matching to balance on other covariates moreover there may be more complex relationships between perceptions of water scarcity and water consumption than our model suggests for example water conservation behaviours may have a feedback effect and reduce scarcity concerns thus increasing water consumption this is in line with work by ref 70 this highlights the importance of testing our model in future research additionally the quality of the water body in terms of pollutant concentration or water level is also likely to be important in mediating the relationship between views of water bodies and water consumption exploring this interaction would be a useful area for future research finally future research could examine the relationship between views of water bodies and water consumption in different geographical and social contexts originality statement the

brabyn and john gibson for their excellent advice and feedback on gis methods and econometric estimation methods finally we would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments which have significantly improved the paper appendix a further methodological details and steps for computing water views and distance variables the following steps are used in arcgis pro to operationalise the layers in table 1 to produce variables for views of the coast and lakes and distance to the coast and lakes these steps produce a series of points on the coast and around lakes that represent the locations we are calculating the viewsheds for arcgis pro step by step methods 1 select the tauranga city polygon in the territorial authorities layer and create a new layer with only this polygon 2 clip the nz coastlines nz lakes and nz property parcels layers to the new tauranga city polygon 3 3 to clip the coastline layer we digitised a new polygon which encompasses some of the pacific ocean because the tauranga city territorial authority boundary does not include some relevant parts of the coast 3 use the near arcgis pro function to calculate the shortest distance from each tauranga property parcel to the coastline and the nearest lake these are our proximity to the coast and lakes variables 4 use the generate points along lines arcgis pro function to generate a series of points n 999 in close proximity around the perimeter of all tauranga lakes which are relatively small 4 4 the number of points is somewhat arbitrary we had to keep the number of points beneath 1000 for the viewshed tool and we selected as close to the maximum as possible to give us greater accuracy 5 use the generate points along lines arcgis pro function to generate a series of points along the tauranga coastline n 750 6 generate a 3 km buffer around the coastline and then only select the buffer area that is in the ocean not on land 2 7 select only ocean areas within the buffer by running a union between the buffer layer and the tauranga territorial authority boundary layer and selecting for areas outside tauranga city s boundary which doesn t cover the coastal marine area 8 use the generate random points arcgis pro function to generate random points n 250 in the 3 km sea buffer region 5 5 properties may not be able to view the coast or beach but may have views of the sea just beyond the coastline hence we create additional points in the sea to calculate viewsheds for we do not do this for lakes because the lakes in tauranga are relatively small and are fully enclosed polygons hence the points on the opposite side of the lake will have the same effect as the additional random points we generate for the coast which is not an enclosed polygon 9 merge the random points in the sea buffer with the points along the coastline 10 use the viewshed ready to use arcgis pro function to calculate a raster for all locations cells within a 5 km radius that have views of any of the points around the lakes this uses a 24 m dem airbus defence and space 2022 11 use the viewshed ready to use arcgis pro function to calculate a raster for all locations cells within a 5 km radius that have views of any of the points on the coast or in the sea buffer this uses a 24 m dem airbus defence and space 2022 12 run a spatial join between the tauranga properties layer and each viewshed lakes and coast respectively using the match option have their centre in this returns a value of one if the geometric centre of the property is in a location with views of the lake or sea depending on which viewshed was used 13 finally to clean the coast viewshed output we intersect the resulting layer with the tauranga city boundary to only include locations on land within the tauranga city boundaries appendix b mixed correlated random effects model results for views of water bodies with and without random slopes log daily water use m3 1 2 3 4 lake lake coast coast within

authors are often arguing whether the relationships they report are causal or correlational the conditions for true causality are strong and require that the observed coefficients are not subject to 1 significant omitted variable bias where an unobservable confounding variable affects both the treatment views of water bodies and the outcome water consumption or 2 simultaneity bias reverse causality where the outcome is actually determining the treatment or they are both determined at the same time in our paper we employ estimation techniques and robustness checks that aim to minimise the possibility of omitted variable bias we use a fixed effects approach which enables us to control for all time invariant over a 1 year period statistical area 1 sa1 unobservable characteristics which may be affecting both the views of water bodies and water consumption for example properties in particular coastal suburbs may be more likely to be holiday homes and consume less water our sa1 fixed effects will control for these spatial confounding variables 1 we control for property level characteristics like property value built area and property age that will undoubtedly be related to both views of water bodies and water consumption for example previous work shows that wealthier households proxied by property value consume more water and properties with views of water bodies have higher valuations 2 we find that our coefficients of interest are relatively stable to adding property level controls seasonal controls and sa1 fixed effects this suggests that our coefficients are not strongly related to other potentially confounding variables 3 using methods from ref 25 we find that selection on unobservables is unlikely to be an issue for our results 4 when we use distance as an alternative specification for the independent variable we find similar results 5 when we run a mixed model which allows for conservative random slopes for each sa1 unit our coefficients decrease slightly but are largely unchanged and still significant one major caveat is that our sa1 controls imperfectly control for property socio demographics and if we had property level fixed effects we wouldn t be able to assess the effects of views of water bodies because there is no variation over time however give the points made above we are reasonably confident that our results are not subject to omitted variable bias and selection on unobservables meanwhile we do have concerns over potential reverse causality because our views of water bodies variables are cross sectional this means we cannot track changing individual views for water users over time and we cannot completely rule out reverse causality arguments in saying that it is important to think through the reverse causality argument and what that actually means in the context of our paper reverse causality would suggest that water consumption is affecting views of water bodies through some mechanism this would occur for example if environmentally inclined individuals consume less water and also chose to locate closer to or further from water bodies in this case one may be concerned that environmentally conscious consumers locate within view of the coast and this drives our observed result while we cannot rule this out we would also expect environmentally conscious and aware consumers to locate further from the coast to minimise their residential impact on coastal ecosystems and as they are more acutely aware of rising sea levels as a result of climate change moreover if environmentally conscious consumers are driving our results we would not expect people living near lakes to consume more water the effect should operate in the opposite direction whereby environmentally conscious consumers locate closer to freshwater lakes and biodiversity and also consume less water further environmentally conscious consumers are much less likely to fall prey to the availability bias mechanism we suggest because these individuals are thinking more critically about environmental issues such as water scarcity therefore overall we do not find the reverse causality argument convincing however we cannot rule it out 
8638,water scarcity can constrain industrial development while industrial development can exacerbate the high consumption of industrial water resulting in the industrial water rebound effect this study measures the economic contribution of industrial water to industrial economic growth with the help of the cobb douglas production function then industrial water rebound effect is estimated in the context of technological progress the empirical results suggest that the production elasticity of industrial water in the yangtze river delta is 0 121 and the industrial water rebound effect is 55 11 particularly shanghai has achieved industrial economic growth by strictly controlling the total amount of water use while anhui has the higher economic contribution of industrial water its industrial economic growth mainly relies on water input the overall industrial water rebound effect is relatively prominent in zhejiang anhui and jiangsu accordingly the yangtze river delta urgently needs to advocate the development of the water economy strengthen the rigid constraints on water use indicators and promote water use efficiency in industrial enterprises keywords the yangtze river delta industrial water economic contribution rebound effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is not only an important strategic and economic resource indispensable for human social development but also an indispensable scarce resource china s per capita water endowment is only one quarter of the world average and water scarcity has turn into choking points which restrain china s economic growth 1 although only one of many production factors the adequate and reliable water supply is the key factor for industrial development by 2020 china s industrial water consumption was 103 04 billion cu m accounting for 17 77 of the total water usage and the water usage per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value has reached 32 9 cu m about twice as much as that of developed countries water plays an irreplaceable part in industrial development and the rapid growth of industrial output will bring about exponential growth in industrial water consumption 2 because china s industrial development has already faced limitations on the total industrial water supply 3 trading off the relationship between industrial development and water saving is an essential trouble for china 4 as a strategic economic zone in china the yangtze river delta yrd is china s most internationally competitive and developed industrialized region the growth of the industrial economy in the yrd is inseparable from the replenishment of water resources however some cities in the yrd face the pressure of water shortages and even enter the list of severe water deficient cities although the yrd has reduced water consumption by improving industrial water efficiency the huge industry scale and its growth have also resulted in an increase in industrial water usage as industrialization progresses to a higher level the yrd has been facing severe resource and environmental problems the increasing demand for industrial water and the low efficiency of water usage this study calculates the economic contribution of water to industrial growth and measures the degree to which industrial economic growth affects the industrial water rebound effect responding to the call for the synergistic development strategies of water resources and industrial economy to achieve sustainable growth of the industrial sector in the yrd the significance of water to economic growth has led to an increasing discussion of the relationship between the two some scholars have investigated the connection between water usage and economic growth by adopting the translog model 5 multiple regression model 6 seemingly unrelated semiparametric model locally weighted scatterplot smoothing model 7 decoupling model 8 coupling coordination degree model and projection pursuit model 9 in order to highlight and quantify the contribution of water resources to economic growth some scholars have adopted the cobb douglas production function cdpf taking water resources as a factor of production they have calculated the impact of water input on agricultural production 10 11 the economic value of water in manufacturing factories 12 and the marginal contribution of green water to the market price of crops 13 as the development of circular economy is widely advocated scholars have argued that an integrated management approach is needed to manage water related socio economic and non economic activities symbiotically to enhance water recycling management 14 16 since water resources have rigid constraints on economic growth and the scarcity of water resources will restrict economic activities 17 a variety of techniques to improve water use efficiency have a promoting effect on water conservation 15 18 however scholars have found that the rebound effect exists so that water consumption does not decrease due to increased water efficiency 19 20 this is because the rebound effect happens when the additional water usage resulting from increased factor productivity exceeds the water savings from technical efficiency 21 22 the rebound effect re refers to when a new technology increases energy efficiency consumers and producers are incentivized to consume more energy 23 in other words energy consumption may not be with a reduction but may even be an increase 24 25 while improving energy efficiency to reduce energy consumption 26 technological progress creates the energy rebound effect by increasing new energy demand through price effects and economic scale effects 27 the environmental rebound effect ere has subsequently received attention from scholars as technological progress has often failed to achieve the desired effect on resource efficiency and pollution control efficiency 28 29 some scholars have since applied the rebound effect to water resources but mainly in the case of agricultural water use they have found that technological advance in irrigation is critical in improving agricultural water usage efficiency 30 31 however the rebound effect leads to the amount of water saved from increased water efficiency being partly wiped out by the growth of agricultural water consumption resulting from the progress of irrigation technology 32 33 because of the water rebound effect the european commission has alerted the consequences of investing heavily in modern irrigation networks and systems 19 in the murray darling basin irrigation survey 22 confirmed the rebound effect of irrigation water withdrawals in agriculture 20 assessed the impact of increased water productivity in spain on global water use they assumed an overall 50 increase in water efficiency throughout the year and found a global water use rebound effect of 100 47 this means that there is no saving in water use following efficiency gains and in fact a slight increase in global water use 34 found a strong rebound effect when it came to increased productivity and more efficient use of irrigation water the authors therefore argue that such effects must be taken into account in order to provide a realistic estimate of the resource savings achieved by efficiency improvements in china scholars found a rebound effect of 61 49 for agricultural water use in china from 1998 to 2014 33 while 30 found short and long term rebound effects for agricultural water use in china of 49 and 66 respectively the water rebound rate was positive in all chinese provinces meaning that the water rebound effect is prevalent in the chinese agricultural water market a case study in the hetao irrigation district in the yellow river basin showed that the expansion of sown area and irrigation areas from 1949 to 2017 were the main drivers of the rebound effect of irrigation water use in the hetao irrigation district 35 the above studies all provide ample evidence of the rebound effect on agricultural irrigation and water use accordingly it would appear that the water rebound effect must be given enough attention there is less research on the rebound effect of industrial water use although industrial water does not appear to be as scarce compared to agricultural water industrial water is similar to agricultural water in that it is highly sensitive to changes in macro factors such as economy and technology furthermore much of the current research has focused on measuring industrial water use efficiency but has ignored the reality of whether industrial water use increases or decreases as a result of increased industrial water use efficiency is there a situation where industrial water consumption increases rather than decreases following an increase in water use efficiency in the same way as for agricultural water it is therefore of theoretical interest to explore the rebound effect of industrial water use so this study chooses yrd as a case study and investigates the economic contribution of water input and the rebound effect on industrial water use the structure of this study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methods adopted in this study in section 3 we describe the situation of industrial water usage in the yrd and display the data and empirical results section 4 gives a discussion of the empirical results conclusions and policy implications are presented in section 5 2 methods in terms of estimating the contribution rate of input factors and technological progress the mainstream models include cobb douglas production function solow residual value method data envelopment analysis and frontier production function 36 c d production function and solow residual value method are generally used to measure the role of technological progress and various input factors in economic growth 36 for example c d production function has been widely applied to investigate the impact of capital labour 37 fdi 38 international trade and financial development 39 energy consumption 40 climate precipitation planting area 41 and other factors on national economic growth or agricultural crop yield growth although c d production function has the advantages of a simple structure easy modeling and high prediction precision 42 it relies on the strong statistical assumptions on the regression model variance leading to unreliable estimated efficiency scores 43 moreover scholars have explored productivity growth by introducing capital labour and other factors with the help of the classic solow residual value model 44 45 the solow residual value model reveals the significance of labour and capital accumulation to the production process 46 it is also found that solow residual value effect will increase water consumption with the water technological progress 47 it must be mentioned that solow residual value cannot accurately reflect all actual technological contributions to economic growth because it contains too broad a range of factors 23 when it comes to efficiency analysis data envelopment analysis is often applied to measure water efficiency energy efficiency water energy food nexus efficiency and ecological efficiency 30 48 52 which can measure the input output efficiency under the condition of multiple inputs and multiple outputs frontier production function is also adopted in estimating the contribution rate of technological progress but it has the shortcomings of large sample demand and complicated estimation process 36 to examine the contribution rate of industrial water as an input factor and the contribution rate of technological progress this study has chosen to use the c d production function and solow residual value method the c d production function often applied to analyze the linkage between factor inputs and final outputs quantitatively has been and still is widely used by economists 53 due to its versatility flexibility and the ability to expand the number of factors depending on the needs of the analysis or the availability of statistical data 54 thus we can introduce industrial water consumption w to the traditional c d production function in eq 1 an extended c d production function is established and logarithmically transformed 1 ln y i t ln a i 0 r t α ln k i t β ln l i t γ ln w i t where y it k it l it w it separately represent the total industrial output capital input labour input and water input and α β γ denote the production elasticities of k it l it w it respectively the production elasticity of each factor is calculated by considering the partial derivative of output with respect to the factor under consideration 12 for example the elasticity of water can be expressed as γ y y w w a i0 represents the level of science and technology in the base period r is the rate of technological progress the contribution rate of industrial water to economic output is deduced based on solow residual value method and the growth rate equation is wrriten as follows 55 2 y r α k β l γ w where y k l w separately represent the growth rate of total industrial output capital labour water the growth rate of industrial output can be decomposed into four parts the contribution rate of capital k labour l water w and technological progress ρ 3 k α k y 4 l β l y 5 w γ w y 6 ρ r y y α k β l γ w y 1 α k y β l y γ w y 1 k l w for the better interpretation of the contribution rate we demonstrate the contribution rate of industrial water use w intuitively w is influenced by three factors the production elasticity of industrial water use γ the growth rate of industrial water use w and the growth rate of the industrial economy y the input of water resources is generally considered to have a positive effect on the development of the industrial economy and the production elasticity of factors takes values in the range of 0 1 so the production elasticity is greater than 0 thus it would appear that the positive and negative signs of w depend on the positive and negative aspects of both the growth rate of industrial water use and the growth rate of the industrial economy the contribution rate of capital k and labour l can be interpreted in a similar way additionally the contribution rate of technological progress is the ratio of the rate of technological progress to the rate of economic growth the contribution rate of technological progress to economic growth in the broad sense refers to the sum of contribution rate of other factors to output increase excluding those of the increase in capital and labour 56 broadly speaking technological progress is not limited to the innovation of science and technology it can also be reflected in the improvement of the quality of input factors the expansion of economies of scale the optimization of resource allocation etc the c d production function is then used to measure the industrial water rebound effect in the yrd with the help of calculating the contribution rate of technological progress two different methods have been developed to estimate the rebound effect one that directly compares water resources demand before and after efficiency improvements 33 and the other that focuses on calculating the rebound effect in terms of price elasticity 57 both are the primary methods for measuring the rebound effect but the price elasticity approach often requires a well functioning water resources market that accurately reflects water resources supply and demand in terms of water price due to the poorly functioning water resources market in china and the industrial water price is set by the government the price elasticity method is not applicable to this study the direct comparison method is less precise but it has a better ability to estimate macro economic issues a direct comparison method therefore is adopted in this study to compare water resources demand before and after water use efficiency improvements and estimate the industrial water rebound effect in the context of technological progress the measurement method of the water rebound effect is defined as the formula w r e e w s a w s e w s 100 r w u e w s 100 in which wre denotes the industrial water rebound effect ews means the expected water savings due to production technological advance and aws represents the actual water savings due to production technological advance in addition rwu ews aws it represents rebound or additional water use as the efficiency of a unit of water increased 33 the size of wre can be classified into five rebound effects 30 over storage wre 0 zero rebound wre 0 partial rebound 0 wre 100 full rebound wre 100 and backfire phenomenon wre 100 then the difference in industrial water input δw t from year t 1 to year t can be decomposed into two components the change in industrial water input resulting from the change in water productivity y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 and the change coming from industrial growth δ y t w p t 1 the relationship amongst water input and productivity is w p y w where wp is industrial water productivity y is the amount of industrial output and w is the quantity of industrial water input based on the above the change in industrial water use δw t is written as follows 7 δ w t w t w t 1 y t w p t y t 1 w p t 1 y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 δ y t w p t 1 eventually we add ρ in eq 7 to the formula of wre accordingly rebound water rwu is converted to ρ i t δ y i t w p i t 1 and the expected industrial water savings from water productivity improvement ews is converted to ρ i t y i t δ w p i t w p i t w p i t 1 therefore the industrial water rebound effect within t years can be expressed as follows 8 w r e ρ i t δ y i t w p i t 1 ρ i t y i t δ w p i t w p i t w p i t 1 3 empirical analysis 3 1 data collection this study is based on the yrd region which contains 27 cities data on industrial water consumption prior to 2000 was not available as some of the cities did not have water resources bulletins in place prior to 2000 additionally at the time of data collection the 2020 water resources bulletins for most cities had not yet been officially released to the public so the panel data of industrial enterprises in the yrd from 2000 to 2019 are used in the study the employed data include three production inputs capital k labour l water w and one output y presented by the industrial added value of the yrd s 27 cities we adopt the industrial added value 100 million yuan at the 2000 price level to express comparable industrial output y the industrial added value can all be collected in the statistical yearbooks of the 27 cities capital k is represented by the total industrial fixed assets at the 2000 price level 100 million yuan except for shanghai the total industrial fixed assets were missing for 26 cities in 2003 in the statistical yearbooks the interpolation method is used to fill in the missing values the average annual number of industrial employees is used to assess industrial labour input l 10 thousand persons we searched the data through the municipal statistical yearbooks and the china city statistical yearbook the consumption of industrial water represents the industrial water input w 100 million cu m industrial water consumption in some cities can be retrieved from the water resources bulletin published by each municipal water authority however some municipalities do not publish water resources bulletin on their websites we obtained unpublished industrial water use data by email and telephone and have finally assembled all the data table 1 shows summary statistics of the variables 3 2 situation of industrial water usage in the yrd the yrd is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china bordering the yellow sea and the east china sea and encompassing three provinces and one city including shanghai jiangsu zhejiang and anhui the yrd is the region with the highest density of river networks in china and is rich in water resources however as industrialization urbanization and modernization continue to accelerate and the population is highly dense the per capita water resources are only 1 3 of the china s average and there is a serious imbalance between water supply and demand at the same time the large scale discharge of domestic sewage agricultural and industrial wastewater has seriously exceeded the regional environmental carrying capacity leading to the deterioration of the water environment and severely restricting the sustainable development of the region annual water consumption in the yrd has shown an overall trend of growth with an average annual growth rate of approximately 1 78 58 in terms of industrial water use fig 1 illustrates the inter annual variation in industrial water consumption for 27 cities in the yrd from 2000 to 2019 shanghai shows a steep decline in industrial water use it is reported that shanghai has added water conservation targets for the first time in 2010 especially to improve the efficiency of water use on industrial water use and formally included the water consumption of ten thousand yuan of gross regional product in shanghai s statistical indicator system to consolidate the achievements of building a conservation oriented society suzhou has the largest industrial water consumption in jiangsu in reality suzhou s industrial economy is indeed more developed in jiangsu however in order to improve the efficiency of water use suzhou introduced relevant water conservation management measures in 2014 to enhance water conservation management in zhejiang industrial water use remains high in hangzhou as the capital city of zhejiang hangzhou s industrial economy cannot develop without a strong investment in water resources ma anshan and wuhu where there are extraordinarily large iron and steel plants has thus become a major water user in anhui according to statistics the total industrial water consumption in the yrd had once reached its peak in 2010 from 2000 when the tenth five year plan proposed the construction of a water saving society to 2002 when the construction of water saving cities began china has always attached importance to the issue of water conservation the yrd has strived to respond to the call for steady economic growth while also striving to achieve the goal of water conservation especially in the industrial sector next we focus on the trends of industrial water intensity in the yrd over time and the spatial differences between cities in this paper we use water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial value added e to measure industrial water intensity in the yrd 59 the industrial water intensity of the yrd is the sum of the industrial water intensity of each city adjusted by weighting factors e e i f i where e i is the industrial water intensity of each city f i is the proportion of industrial value added in each city to total industrial value added in the yrd the higher the industrial water intensity the less efficient the industrial water use the overall industrial water intensity in the yrd is consistently decreasing over the study period specifically industrial water intensity has largely shown a decline in almost cities this fully implies that the yrd industrial water use is becoming more efficient the results could provide evidence that the yrd has been making efforts and contributions to industrial water conservation however there are significant differences in industrial water intensity between provinces and cities within the yrd see fig 2 notably several cities in anhui e g ma anshan tongling chizhou have very high industrial water use intensity and low industrial water use efficiency during the period 2000 2010 some cities made efforts to expand their economies and focus on building key projects creating a greater demand for industrial water for example tongling s focus on improving the market competitiveness of the chemical and building materials industries in 2002 saw a dramatic increase in demand for industrial water while chizhou focused on high tech industries from 2006 to 2010 neglecting the issue of industrial water use efficiency although the industrial water use efficiency in the yrd has gradually improved over time it is important to pay attention to the variability in industrial water use efficiency between cities in order to develop a synergistic green economy within the yrd 3 3 empirical results 3 3 1 estimation of production elasticity coefficients the results of parameter estimation are shown in table 2 in this paper based on the estimation of the pooled model individual effects between cities in the yrd were added to obtain the parameter estimation results under the fixed effects model the likelihood ratio test lr test 364 82 prob 0 000 proved that the individual fixed effects model should be chosen next we further considered time effects and developed a two way fixed effects model we concluded that the model has the time effects after the likelihood ratio test lr test 512 87 prob 0 000 the above analysis has largely demonstrated the existence of individual effects but individual effects may still be present in the form of random effects after the hausman test hausman test 173 12 prob 0 000 it was found that the individual fixed effects model is superior in summary the two way fixed effects model gave the best fit ultimately this paper chose to build a two way fixed effects model with robust standard errors for the subsequent empirical analysis by observing the regression results it can be seen that an increase in water input capital input and labour input will promote an increase in industrial economic output from the estimation results of the c d model it is evident that the production elasticity coefficient of industrial water consumption γ is 0 121 which means that for every 1 increase in industrial water consumption industrial added value will increase by 0 121 it tells the truth that industrial water has a positive effect on promoting industrial economic growth which again confirms that industrial economic development is inseparable from the support of water resources water is an indispensable factor in securing industrial economic growth however in absolute terms the changes in economic output are less sensitive to the changes in water input suggesting that the yrd has a weak ability to convert water input into industrial economic benefits therefore the elasticity coefficient of water resources should be further improved to increase the contribution of unit water consumption 3 3 2 estimated results of economic contribution of industrial water use the economic contribution of industrial water input in the yrd is calculated by eq 5 as displayed in fig 3 the industrial water in the yrd has shown the negative contribution to industrial economic growth since 2011 except for 2013 and 2016 but it does not mean the industrial water consumption has not contributed to the industrial economic growth it is observed that the industrial economy in the yrd has maintained a positive growth trend while industrial water consumption has shown negative growth at times resulting in the negative economic contribution of industrial water use as the interpretation of fig 1 shows the total industrial water consumption in the yrd has decreased in the post 2010 industrial economic development the yrd has been making efforts to control or even reduce the total industrial water use so that the unit of industrial water use can bring about greater economic output according to fig 4 it can be found that the economic contribution of industrial water use to the industrial economic growth is negative in almost half of the cities this is particularly concentrated in two provinces jiangsu and zhejiang shanghai has the lowest economic contribution of industrial water use of all cities and the highest in anhui in recent years shanghai has been promoting the reuse of industrial water setting industrial water quotas and implementing the shanghai water conservation action plan with remarkable effects shanghai has maximized the economic contribution of industrial water consumption per unit to the industrial economic output enabling rapid economic growth and industrial water conservation shanghai is the leader in the economic development of the yrd and its advanced industrial technology and knowledge can help shanghai achieve the dual goals of industrial economic development and industrial water conservation also shanghai s advanced high technology will flow to the neighboring jiangsu and zhejiang and the sharing of high technology will drive jiangsu and zhejiang to actively adjust their industrial structure and improve the efficiency of factor inputs in the optimization of production to achieve joint development as a result industrial water consumption in jiangsu and zhejiang will to a certain extent decline as a result of technological progress and industrial optimization so jiangsu and zhejiang are slowly decoupling industrial economic growth from industrial water consumption as fig 2 demonstrates the intensity of industrial water use in jiangsu and zhejiang has gradually declined and as a result the economic contribution of industrial water use in these two provinces does not reflect the heavy dependence of industrial development on water resources on the contrary anhui has invested a large amount of water for its industrial economic development and anhui has greatly relied on water resources for its industrial economy this phenomenon is largely consistent with the fact that the overall industrial water intensity in anhui is high and some cities in anhui such as ma anshan and wuhu have shown a significant increase in their industrial water consumption industrial water usage therefore makes a positive significant economic contribution to the development of anhui s industrial economy combined with the different performance of each province and city over the study period see fig 5 shanghai shows an almost negative economic contribution of industrial water use after 2011 in particular in 2011 shanghai s economic contribution of industrial water use reached an extremely negative value this is because shanghai s industrial economy grew at a much slower rate after 2011 than before and the city has made many efforts to save water in industry hence the negative economic contribution the contribution of industrial water use in jiangsu and zhejiang was largely positive in the early stages indicating that the industrial economy of the two provinces could not grow without the supply of water resources in the later period there was a decline in industrial water use the positive growth rate of industrial water input boosted the strength of anhui s industry thus the contribution of industrial water use in anhui was positive for much of the study period 3 3 3 estimated results of rebound effect of industrial water use according to fig 6 the rebound effect from 2001 to 2019 is 55 11 which implies 55 11 of the industrial water savings generated by efficiency improvement has been offset by increased water use for industrial production growth also six cities have a rebound effect of industrial water greater than 100 belonging to the backfire effect the industrial water rebound effects in other twenty cities fall within 0 100 referring to partial rebound compared with the average industrial water rebound effect of the yrd seven cities are below the average and twenty cities are above the average of all the cities only wuhu has a negative rebound effect value in reviewing the rebound effect measurements it is found that wuhu s rwu value is 13 82 and its ews value is 42 72 which is less than 0 this results in a negative rebound effect value for wuhu in fact this estimate does not mean that there is an over storage effect on wuhu s industrial water use on the contrary this estimate is absurd because wre can be calculated for any value when ews 0 under such circumstances the implicit assumption of the water rebound effect calculation that water productivity is increased is not met thus the estimated value is meaningless this judgement is consistent with the empirical research on the energy rebound effect 33 in terms of the provincial gap all nine cities in zhejiang exceeds the yrd s average and zhejiang s industrial water rebound effect is the highest nearly 100 indicating that the industrial economic growth brought by the improvement of water efficiency in zhejiang has almost consumed the original water saving amount the rebound effect of industrial water in anhui is 87 19 it is clear that the industrial economic growth in anhui has offset most of the water saving amount with the improvement of water efficiency only producing a small positive water saving impact the rebound effect of industrial water in jiangsu is 70 58 ranking third shanghai has the lowest industrial water rebound effect at 27 08 compared with the other three provinces the industrial economic growth in shanghai has offset a small proportion of water saving amount and the increased water efficiency has had a significantly positive effect on water savings the annual rebound effect of industrial water in the yrd is shown in fig 7 the industrial water rebound effects in the yrd are in the range of 0 100 for fourteen years and over 100 for five years it had the highest industrial water rebound effect at 396 22 in 2013 while the lowest industrial water rebound effect at 14 35 in 2011 meanwhile the industrial water rebound effect prior to 2011 was higher than that of the historical yrd period reflecting that the amount of industrial water required in the early industrial economic development offset more than half of the original water savings the years below the average level of the historical rebound effect are all after 2011 inferring that the increased technological progress rate could contribute to positive water savings and that the growth of the industrial economy did not significantly stimulate excessive demand for industrial water the yrd s industrial water rebound effect was characterized by a decline from 2011 to 2019 compared to the previous decade this finding is consistent with the overall downward trend in total industrial water use in the yrd after 2010 telling of a degree of improvement in the management of industrial water use in terms of spatial temporal heterogeneity see fig 8 there has been a significant reduction in the rebound effect of industrial water use in shanghai since 2011 however it maintained continuous growth from 2011 to 2018 suggesting that the rebound effect of industrial water use in shanghai has been exacerbated over the past few years and shanghai should be wary of a rebound in industrial water use in the future jiangsu s industrial water rebound effect almost exceeds the yrd s average during the study period it is very close to the full rebound implying that jiangsu should pay attention to controlling the amount of water input and avoid blindly pursuing rapid industrial economic growth at the expense of over consume water resources prior to 2014 the demand for industrial water from zhejiang s industrial economic development not only consumed the original industrial water saving amount but also added additional water consumption resulting in the industrial water rebound effect that was almost always greater than 100 except in 2005 and 2009 it was only after 2014 that zhejiang focused on building the water saving capacity of industrial enterprises the rebound effect in anhui shows an erratic temporal trend with a downward trend in recent years but it is still important to beware of an aggravation in the rebound effect of industrial water in the future 4 discussion among many factors affecting economic growth scholars have focused on the main input factors such as capital labour energy technological advance and development 60 61 the yangtze river delta as the economic plate with the most potential for development has witnessed rapid industrial development and a sharp increase in industrial water consumption coupled with the fact that industrial water is partly sourced from freshwater 62 industrial water supply requirements are highly increasing making the industrial water shortage in the yrd inevitable hence to develop the circular economy and advocate water recycling it is necessary to study the influence of industrial water use on the industrial economy in the yrd and compare the industrial water demand before and after the water use efficiency improvements additionally the rebound effect of industrial energy 63 65 and agricultural water 32 66 in china have been well discussed while few studies are focusing on rebound effect of industrial water consumption thus the contribution of this paper is to examine the question of whether industrial economic development stimulates additional inputs to industrial water use due to efficiency improvements while exploring the economic contribution of industrial water use inputs to industrial economic growth we hope that this study can enrich the existing research in the context of china s industrialization the empirical analysis illustrates that industrial water input has to some extent contributed to industrial economic growth the industrial economic growth has in turn brought out additional water input even though there are technological enhancements and industrial water use efficiency improvements this suggests that industrial water has a rebound effect similar to that of energy consumption in this study the industrial water rebound effect is generally high in the cities of the yrd but such results are expected the yrd region has seen rapid economic development in recent years and with its numerous rivers and lakes and dense water network its water resources are relatively abundant as a result the growth of industrial water use is less constrained resulting in a high rebound of industrial water use and a more severe rebound effect also people often fail to recognize the problems of high water consumption water scarcity water ecological degradation and serious water pollution in the region 67 to better maintain the further development of the industrial economy the demand for industrial water by producers rises repeatedly and then water consumption becomes even larger 68 in many cases the extra demand for industrial water to meet the needs of industrial economic growth and development often goes unnoticed and the quiet increase in industrial water consumption is not easily detected the pursuit of industrial economic growth at the expense of more water resources is a serious breach of the concept of sustainable development industrial development needs to meet the requirements of green development with water resources as an important factor of production providing security services for industrial economic production thus it is necessary to strictly restrict industrial water usage and promote the sustainable use of water resources there are some limitations to this paper that 1 we employed the c d production function to measure the rate of technological progress taking technological progress as an exogenous variable and neglecting the endogeneity of technological progress we then introduced the contribution rate of technological progress in the rebound effect measurement and such an approach could lead to questions about the validity of estimating the contribution of technological progress and the reasonableness of using technological progress to represent water productivity improvements future research should develop a more rational method to estimate the rebound effect of water 2 this paper only selected capital labour water consumption and technological progress as influencing factors of industrial economic growth without taking into account other factors that affect the industrial economic growth of the yrd such as fdi urbanization level and industrial structure etc 3 this study only focuses on the rebound effect of industrial water consumption but ignores the change and rebound effect of household water consumption the development of the industrial economy will drive residents toward a more affluent life by creating jobs and increasing incomes promoting an improvement in their quality of living the improved standard of living will lead to an increased demand for domestic water so the development of the industrial economy can not only expand the increase of industrial water consumption but could also stimulate the growth of domestic water usage 4 it has been pointed out that the c d production function is not suitable for measuring the benefits and value of water use because water as a production input reflects only a portion of its total contribution to economic output 69 future studies could notice those elements that reflect the value of water namely industrial water saving investment and adjustment of water structure 5 conclusions and suggestions this study has estimated the economic contribution to industrial economic growth and the rebound effect of industrial water in the yrd from 2001 to 2019 it is found that the production elasticity of industrial water in the yrd is 0 121 that is if the industrial water consumption increases by 1 the industrial output of the yrd will increase by 0 121 moreover total industrial water consumption control has been effective in the last decade the consumption of water resources has significantly contributed to the anhui s industrial economic development it is still necessary to control the total industrial water consumption avoiding over consume water resources for the industrial economic growth in shanghai the industrial economic development has not led to excessive consumption of water resources and has to some extent achieved the goal of industrial water saving moreover the industrial water rebound effect in the yrd is 55 11 it means 55 11 of the industrial water saving amount is offset due to technological advances and industrial economic growth the industrial water rebound effect has shown an increasing trend in recent years the overall rebound effect of industrial water is more severe in zhejiang anhui and jiangsu shanghai keeps tight control on the total amount of industrial water and achieves a low rebound effect shanghai is the most effective in the yrd in terms of industrial water saving while jiangsu zhejiang and anhui still need to strengthen their water saving measures based on the conclusions above this study argues that there is an urgent need to advocate the water economy water economy refers to taking water resources as an essential factor of production to prioritize water conservation and water protection the precondition for the construction of the water economy is to guarantee the sustainable utilization of water so as an important factor of production for industrial economic development water resources must be developed and utilized rationally following the principles of sustainable use regional equity inter generational equity and water conservation priority while maintaining good water and ecological environment the yrd should harvest as many economic benefits as possible with as little consumption of water resources achieving a win win goal between water protection and industrial development given these requirements the yrd needs to take total water consumption as an important basis for planning construction and assessment of industrial enterprises require the industrial sector to implement a strict water management system promote industrial water budgeting encourage water saving production and strive to reduce the amount of water use of industrial added value per ten thousand yuan in terms of water allocation policy the water resources carrying capacity is an important basis for the initial allocation of water right to strengthen the rigid constraints on water resources in accordance with the conditions of water endowment and the actual economic and social development while playing the role of the government in the initial allocation of water use rights and the regulation of transactions the market mechanism such as water right trading among users can be brought into full play to optimize the allocation of water resources and stimulate the endogenous impetus for water conservation for each province or municipality shanghai should adhere to long term water conservation improve the rate of industrial water reuse and strengthen rigid constraints on water use targets jiangsu should strengthen water conservation supervision of large water users comprehensively strengthen water conservation management of high water consuming industrial enterprises and key water using units and promote the improvement of water efficiency of enterprises zhejiang needs to make efforts to drive the transformation of water consumption from inefficient to intensive and efficient anhui needs to strictly manage the whole process of water use strengthen the management of industrial water conservation at source improve the collection and audit of industrial enterprises water use data and guide industrial enterprises to promote the technologic

8638,water scarcity can constrain industrial development while industrial development can exacerbate the high consumption of industrial water resulting in the industrial water rebound effect this study measures the economic contribution of industrial water to industrial economic growth with the help of the cobb douglas production function then industrial water rebound effect is estimated in the context of technological progress the empirical results suggest that the production elasticity of industrial water in the yangtze river delta is 0 121 and the industrial water rebound effect is 55 11 particularly shanghai has achieved industrial economic growth by strictly controlling the total amount of water use while anhui has the higher economic contribution of industrial water its industrial economic growth mainly relies on water input the overall industrial water rebound effect is relatively prominent in zhejiang anhui and jiangsu accordingly the yangtze river delta urgently needs to advocate the development of the water economy strengthen the rigid constraints on water use indicators and promote water use efficiency in industrial enterprises keywords the yangtze river delta industrial water economic contribution rebound effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is not only an important strategic and economic resource indispensable for human social development but also an indispensable scarce resource china s per capita water endowment is only one quarter of the world average and water scarcity has turn into choking points which restrain china s economic growth 1 although only one of many production factors the adequate and reliable water supply is the key factor for industrial development by 2020 china s industrial water consumption was 103 04 billion cu m accounting for 17 77 of the total water usage and the water usage per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value has reached 32 9 cu m about twice as much as that of developed countries water plays an irreplaceable part in industrial development and the rapid growth of industrial output will bring about exponential growth in industrial water consumption 2 because china s industrial development has already faced limitations on the total industrial water supply 3 trading off the relationship between industrial development and water saving is an essential trouble for china 4 as a strategic economic zone in china the yangtze river delta yrd is china s most internationally competitive and developed industrialized region the growth of the industrial economy in the yrd is inseparable from the replenishment of water resources however some cities in the yrd face the pressure of water shortages and even enter the list of severe water deficient cities although the yrd has reduced water consumption by improving industrial water efficiency the huge industry scale and its growth have also resulted in an increase in industrial water usage as industrialization progresses to a higher level the yrd has been facing severe resource and environmental problems the increasing demand for industrial water and the low efficiency of water usage this study calculates the economic contribution of water to industrial growth and measures the degree to which industrial economic growth affects the industrial water rebound effect responding to the call for the synergistic development strategies of water resources and industrial economy to achieve sustainable growth of the industrial sector in the yrd the significance of water to economic growth has led to an increasing discussion of the relationship between the two some scholars have investigated the connection between water usage and economic growth by adopting the translog model 5 multiple regression model 6 seemingly unrelated semiparametric model locally weighted scatterplot smoothing model 7 decoupling model 8 coupling coordination degree model and projection pursuit model 9 in order to highlight and quantify the contribution of water resources to economic growth some scholars have adopted the cobb douglas production function cdpf taking water resources as a factor of production they have calculated the impact of water input on agricultural production 10 11 the economic value of water in manufacturing factories 12 and the marginal contribution of green water to the market price of crops 13 as the development of circular economy is widely advocated scholars have argued that an integrated management approach is needed to manage water related socio economic and non economic activities symbiotically to enhance water recycling management 14 16 since water resources have rigid constraints on economic growth and the scarcity of water resources will restrict economic activities 17 a variety of techniques to improve water use efficiency have a promoting effect on water conservation 15 18 however scholars have found that the rebound effect exists so that water consumption does not decrease due to increased water efficiency 19 20 this is because the rebound effect happens when the additional water usage resulting from increased factor productivity exceeds the water savings from technical efficiency 21 22 the rebound effect re refers to when a new technology increases energy efficiency consumers and producers are incentivized to consume more energy 23 in other words energy consumption may not be with a reduction but may even be an increase 24 25 while improving energy efficiency to reduce energy consumption 26 technological progress creates the energy rebound effect by increasing new energy demand through price effects and economic scale effects 27 the environmental rebound effect ere has subsequently received attention from scholars as technological progress has often failed to achieve the desired effect on resource efficiency and pollution control efficiency 28 29 some scholars have since applied the rebound effect to water resources but mainly in the case of agricultural water use they have found that technological advance in irrigation is critical in improving agricultural water usage efficiency 30 31 however the rebound effect leads to the amount of water saved from increased water efficiency being partly wiped out by the growth of agricultural water consumption resulting from the progress of irrigation technology 32 33 because of the water rebound effect the european commission has alerted the consequences of investing heavily in modern irrigation networks and systems 19 in the murray darling basin irrigation survey 22 confirmed the rebound effect of irrigation water withdrawals in agriculture 20 assessed the impact of increased water productivity in spain on global water use they assumed an overall 50 increase in water efficiency throughout the year and found a global water use rebound effect of 100 47 this means that there is no saving in water use following efficiency gains and in fact a slight increase in global water use 34 found a strong rebound effect when it came to increased productivity and more efficient use of irrigation water the authors therefore argue that such effects must be taken into account in order to provide a realistic estimate of the resource savings achieved by efficiency improvements in china scholars found a rebound effect of 61 49 for agricultural water use in china from 1998 to 2014 33 while 30 found short and long term rebound effects for agricultural water use in china of 49 and 66 respectively the water rebound rate was positive in all chinese provinces meaning that the water rebound effect is prevalent in the chinese agricultural water market a case study in the hetao irrigation district in the yellow river basin showed that the expansion of sown area and irrigation areas from 1949 to 2017 were the main drivers of the rebound effect of irrigation water use in the hetao irrigation district 35 the above studies all provide ample evidence of the rebound effect on agricultural irrigation and water use accordingly it would appear that the water rebound effect must be given enough attention there is less research on the rebound effect of industrial water use although industrial water does not appear to be as scarce compared to agricultural water industrial water is similar to agricultural water in that it is highly sensitive to changes in macro factors such as economy and technology furthermore much of the current research has focused on measuring industrial water use efficiency but has ignored the reality of whether industrial water use increases or decreases as a result of increased industrial water use efficiency is there a situation where industrial water consumption increases rather than decreases following an increase in water use efficiency in the same way as for agricultural water it is therefore of theoretical interest to explore the rebound effect of industrial water use so this study chooses yrd as a case study and investigates the economic contribution of water input and the rebound effect on industrial water use the structure of this study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methods adopted in this study in section 3 we describe the situation of industrial water usage in the yrd and display the data and empirical results section 4 gives a discussion of the empirical results conclusions and policy implications are presented in section 5 2 methods in terms of estimating the contribution rate of input factors and technological progress the mainstream models include cobb douglas production function solow residual value method data envelopment analysis and frontier production function 36 c d production function and solow residual value method are generally used to measure the role of technological progress and various input factors in economic growth 36 for example c d production function has been widely applied to investigate the impact of capital labour 37 fdi 38 international trade and financial development 39 energy consumption 40 climate precipitation planting area 41 and other factors on national economic growth or agricultural crop yield growth although c d production function has the advantages of a simple structure easy modeling and high prediction precision 42 it relies on the strong statistical assumptions on the regression model variance leading to unreliable estimated efficiency scores 43 moreover scholars have explored productivity growth by introducing capital labour and other factors with the help of the classic solow residual value model 44 45 the solow residual value model reveals the significance of labour and capital accumulation to the production process 46 it is also found that solow residual value effect will increase water consumption with the water technological progress 47 it must be mentioned that solow residual value cannot accurately reflect all actual technological contributions to economic growth because it contains too broad a range of factors 23 when it comes to efficiency analysis data envelopment analysis is often applied to measure water efficiency energy efficiency water energy food nexus efficiency and ecological efficiency 30 48 52 which can measure the input output efficiency under the condition of multiple inputs and multiple outputs frontier production function is also adopted in estimating the contribution rate of technological progress but it has the shortcomings of large sample demand and complicated estimation process 36 to examine the contribution rate of industrial water as an input factor and the contribution rate of technological progress this study has chosen to use the c d production function and solow residual value method the c d production function often applied to analyze the linkage between factor inputs and final outputs quantitatively has been and still is widely used by economists 53 due to its versatility flexibility and the ability to expand the number of factors depending on the needs of the analysis or the availability of statistical data 54 thus we can introduce industrial water consumption w to the traditional c d production function in eq 1 an extended c d production function is established and logarithmically transformed 1 ln y i t ln a i 0 r t α ln k i t β ln l i t γ ln w i t where y it k it l it w it separately represent the total industrial output capital input labour input and water input and α β γ denote the production elasticities of k it l it w it respectively the production elasticity of each factor is calculated by considering the partial derivative of output with respect to the factor under consideration 12 for example the elasticity of water can be expressed as γ y y w w a i0 represents the level of science and technology in the base period r is the rate of technological progress the contribution rate of industrial water to economic output is deduced based on solow residual value method and the growth rate equation is wrriten as follows 55 2 y r α k β l γ w where y k l w separately represent the growth rate of total industrial output capital labour water the growth rate of industrial output can be decomposed into four parts the contribution rate of capital k labour l water w and technological progress ρ 3 k α k y 4 l β l y 5 w γ w y 6 ρ r y y α k β l γ w y 1 α k y β l y γ w y 1 k l w for the better interpretation of the contribution rate we demonstrate the contribution rate of industrial water use w intuitively w is influenced by three factors the production elasticity of industrial water use γ the growth rate of industrial water use w and the growth rate of the industrial economy y the input of water resources is generally considered to have a positive effect on the development of the industrial economy and the production elasticity of factors takes values in the range of 0 1 so the production elasticity is greater than 0 thus it would appear that the positive and negative signs of w depend on the positive and negative aspects of both the growth rate of industrial water use and the growth rate of the industrial economy the contribution rate of capital k and labour l can be interpreted in a similar way additionally the contribution rate of technological progress is the ratio of the rate of technological progress to the rate of economic growth the contribution rate of technological progress to economic growth in the broad sense refers to the sum of contribution rate of other factors to output increase excluding those of the increase in capital and labour 56 broadly speaking technological progress is not limited to the innovation of science and technology it can also be reflected in the improvement of the quality of input factors the expansion of economies of scale the optimization of resource allocation etc the c d production function is then used to measure the industrial water rebound effect in the yrd with the help of calculating the contribution rate of technological progress two different methods have been developed to estimate the rebound effect one that directly compares water resources demand before and after efficiency improvements 33 and the other that focuses on calculating the rebound effect in terms of price elasticity 57 both are the primary methods for measuring the rebound effect but the price elasticity approach often requires a well functioning water resources market that accurately reflects water resources supply and demand in terms of water price due to the poorly functioning water resources market in china and the industrial water price is set by the government the price elasticity method is not applicable to this study the direct comparison method is less precise but it has a better ability to estimate macro economic issues a direct comparison method therefore is adopted in this study to compare water resources demand before and after water use efficiency improvements and estimate the industrial water rebound effect in the context of technological progress the measurement method of the water rebound effect is defined as the formula w r e e w s a w s e w s 100 r w u e w s 100 in which wre denotes the industrial water rebound effect ews means the expected water savings due to production technological advance and aws represents the actual water savings due to production technological advance in addition rwu ews aws it represents rebound or additional water use as the efficiency of a unit of water increased 33 the size of wre can be classified into five rebound effects 30 over storage wre 0 zero rebound wre 0 partial rebound 0 wre 100 full rebound wre 100 and backfire phenomenon wre 100 then the difference in industrial water input δw t from year t 1 to year t can be decomposed into two components the change in industrial water input resulting from the change in water productivity y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 and the change coming from industrial growth δ y t w p t 1 the relationship amongst water input and productivity is w p y w where wp is industrial water productivity y is the amount of industrial output and w is the quantity of industrial water input based on the above the change in industrial water use δw t is written as follows 7 δ w t w t w t 1 y t w p t y t 1 w p t 1 y t δ w p t w p t w p t 1 δ y t w p t 1 eventually we add ρ in eq 7 to the formula of wre accordingly rebound water rwu is converted to ρ i t δ y i t w p i t 1 and the expected industrial water savings from water productivity improvement ews is converted to ρ i t y i t δ w p i t w p i t w p i t 1 therefore the industrial water rebound effect within t years can be expressed as follows 8 w r e ρ i t δ y i t w p i t 1 ρ i t y i t δ w p i t w p i t w p i t 1 3 empirical analysis 3 1 data collection this study is based on the yrd region which contains 27 cities data on industrial water consumption prior to 2000 was not available as some of the cities did not have water resources bulletins in place prior to 2000 additionally at the time of data collection the 2020 water resources bulletins for most cities had not yet been officially released to the public so the panel data of industrial enterprises in the yrd from 2000 to 2019 are used in the study the employed data include three production inputs capital k labour l water w and one output y presented by the industrial added value of the yrd s 27 cities we adopt the industrial added value 100 million yuan at the 2000 price level to express comparable industrial output y the industrial added value can all be collected in the statistical yearbooks of the 27 cities capital k is represented by the total industrial fixed assets at the 2000 price level 100 million yuan except for shanghai the total industrial fixed assets were missing for 26 cities in 2003 in the statistical yearbooks the interpolation method is used to fill in the missing values the average annual number of industrial employees is used to assess industrial labour input l 10 thousand persons we searched the data through the municipal statistical yearbooks and the china city statistical yearbook the consumption of industrial water represents the industrial water input w 100 million cu m industrial water consumption in some cities can be retrieved from the water resources bulletin published by each municipal water authority however some municipalities do not publish water resources bulletin on their websites we obtained unpublished industrial water use data by email and telephone and have finally assembled all the data table 1 shows summary statistics of the variables 3 2 situation of industrial water usage in the yrd the yrd is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china bordering the yellow sea and the east china sea and encompassing three provinces and one city including shanghai jiangsu zhejiang and anhui the yrd is the region with the highest density of river networks in china and is rich in water resources however as industrialization urbanization and modernization continue to accelerate and the population is highly dense the per capita water resources are only 1 3 of the china s average and there is a serious imbalance between water supply and demand at the same time the large scale discharge of domestic sewage agricultural and industrial wastewater has seriously exceeded the regional environmental carrying capacity leading to the deterioration of the water environment and severely restricting the sustainable development of the region annual water consumption in the yrd has shown an overall trend of growth with an average annual growth rate of approximately 1 78 58 in terms of industrial water use fig 1 illustrates the inter annual variation in industrial water consumption for 27 cities in the yrd from 2000 to 2019 shanghai shows a steep decline in industrial water use it is reported that shanghai has added water conservation targets for the first time in 2010 especially to improve the efficiency of water use on industrial water use and formally included the water consumption of ten thousand yuan of gross regional product in shanghai s statistical indicator system to consolidate the achievements of building a conservation oriented society suzhou has the largest industrial water consumption in jiangsu in reality suzhou s industrial economy is indeed more developed in jiangsu however in order to improve the efficiency of water use suzhou introduced relevant water conservation management measures in 2014 to enhance water conservation management in zhejiang industrial water use remains high in hangzhou as the capital city of zhejiang hangzhou s industrial economy cannot develop without a strong investment in water resources ma anshan and wuhu where there are extraordinarily large iron and steel plants has thus become a major water user in anhui according to statistics the total industrial water consumption in the yrd had once reached its peak in 2010 from 2000 when the tenth five year plan proposed the construction of a water saving society to 2002 when the construction of water saving cities began china has always attached importance to the issue of water conservation the yrd has strived to respond to the call for steady economic growth while also striving to achieve the goal of water conservation especially in the industrial sector next we focus on the trends of industrial water intensity in the yrd over time and the spatial differences between cities in this paper we use water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial value added e to measure industrial water intensity in the yrd 59 the industrial water intensity of the yrd is the sum of the industrial water intensity of each city adjusted by weighting factors e e i f i where e i is the industrial water intensity of each city f i is the proportion of industrial value added in each city to total industrial value added in the yrd the higher the industrial water intensity the less efficient the industrial water use the overall industrial water intensity in the yrd is consistently decreasing over the study period specifically industrial water intensity has largely shown a decline in almost cities this fully implies that the yrd industrial water use is becoming more efficient the results could provide evidence that the yrd has been making efforts and contributions to industrial water conservation however there are significant differences in industrial water intensity between provinces and cities within the yrd see fig 2 notably several cities in anhui e g ma anshan tongling chizhou have very high industrial water use intensity and low industrial water use efficiency during the period 2000 2010 some cities made efforts to expand their economies and focus on building key projects creating a greater demand for industrial water for example tongling s focus on improving the market competitiveness of the chemical and building materials industries in 2002 saw a dramatic increase in demand for industrial water while chizhou focused on high tech industries from 2006 to 2010 neglecting the issue of industrial water use efficiency although the industrial water use efficiency in the yrd has gradually improved over time it is important to pay attention to the variability in industrial water use efficiency between cities in order to develop a synergistic green economy within the yrd 3 3 empirical results 3 3 1 estimation of production elasticity coefficients the results of parameter estimation are shown in table 2 in this paper based on the estimation of the pooled model individual effects between cities in the yrd were added to obtain the parameter estimation results under the fixed effects model the likelihood ratio test lr test 364 82 prob 0 000 proved that the individual fixed effects model should be chosen next we further considered time effects and developed a two way fixed effects model we concluded that the model has the time effects after the likelihood ratio test lr test 512 87 prob 0 000 the above analysis has largely demonstrated the existence of individual effects but individual effects may still be present in the form of random effects after the hausman test hausman test 173 12 prob 0 000 it was found that the individual fixed effects model is superior in summary the two way fixed effects model gave the best fit ultimately this paper chose to build a two way fixed effects model with robust standard errors for the subsequent empirical analysis by observing the regression results it can be seen that an increase in water input capital input and labour input will promote an increase in industrial economic output from the estimation results of the c d model it is evident that the production elasticity coefficient of industrial water consumption γ is 0 121 which means that for every 1 increase in industrial water consumption industrial added value will increase by 0 121 it tells the truth that industrial water has a positive effect on promoting industrial economic growth which again confirms that industrial economic development is inseparable from the support of water resources water is an indispensable factor in securing industrial economic growth however in absolute terms the changes in economic output are less sensitive to the changes in water input suggesting that the yrd has a weak ability to convert water input into industrial economic benefits therefore the elasticity coefficient of water resources should be further improved to increase the contribution of unit water consumption 3 3 2 estimated results of economic contribution of industrial water use the economic contribution of industrial water input in the yrd is calculated by eq 5 as displayed in fig 3 the industrial water in the yrd has shown the negative contribution to industrial economic growth since 2011 except for 2013 and 2016 but it does not mean the industrial water consumption has not contributed to the industrial economic growth it is observed that the industrial economy in the yrd has maintained a positive growth trend while industrial water consumption has shown negative growth at times resulting in the negative economic contribution of industrial water use as the interpretation of fig 1 shows the total industrial water consumption in the yrd has decreased in the post 2010 industrial economic development the yrd has been making efforts to control or even reduce the total industrial water use so that the unit of industrial water use can bring about greater economic output according to fig 4 it can be found that the economic contribution of industrial water use to the industrial economic growth is negative in almost half of the cities this is particularly concentrated in two provinces jiangsu and zhejiang shanghai has the lowest economic contribution of industrial water use of all cities and the highest in anhui in recent years shanghai has been promoting the reuse of industrial water setting industrial water quotas and implementing the shanghai water conservation action plan with remarkable effects shanghai has maximized the economic contribution of industrial water consumption per unit to the industrial economic output enabling rapid economic growth and industrial water conservation shanghai is the leader in the economic development of the yrd and its advanced industrial technology and knowledge can help shanghai achieve the dual goals of industrial economic development and industrial water conservation also shanghai s advanced high technology will flow to the neighboring jiangsu and zhejiang and the sharing of high technology will drive jiangsu and zhejiang to actively adjust their industrial structure and improve the efficiency of factor inputs in the optimization of production to achieve joint development as a result industrial water consumption in jiangsu and zhejiang will to a certain extent decline as a result of technological progress and industrial optimization so jiangsu and zhejiang are slowly decoupling industrial economic growth from industrial water consumption as fig 2 demonstrates the intensity of industrial water use in jiangsu and zhejiang has gradually declined and as a result the economic contribution of industrial water use in these two provinces does not reflect the heavy dependence of industrial development on water resources on the contrary anhui has invested a large amount of water for its industrial economic development and anhui has greatly relied on water resources for its industrial economy this phenomenon is largely consistent with the fact that the overall industrial water intensity in anhui is high and some cities in anhui such as ma anshan and wuhu have shown a significant increase in their industrial water consumption industrial water usage therefore makes a positive significant economic contribution to the development of anhui s industrial economy combined with the different performance of each province and city over the study period see fig 5 shanghai shows an almost negative economic contribution of industrial water use after 2011 in particular in 2011 shanghai s economic contribution of industrial water use reached an extremely negative value this is because shanghai s industrial economy grew at a much slower rate after 2011 than before and the city has made many efforts to save water in industry hence the negative economic contribution the contribution of industrial water use in jiangsu and zhejiang was largely positive in the early stages indicating that the industrial economy of the two provinces could not grow without the supply of water resources in the later period there was a decline in industrial water use the positive growth rate of industrial water input boosted the strength of anhui s industry thus the contribution of industrial water use in anhui was positive for much of the study period 3 3 3 estimated results of rebound effect of industrial water use according to fig 6 the rebound effect from 2001 to 2019 is 55 11 which implies 55 11 of the industrial water savings generated by efficiency improvement has been offset by increased water use for industrial production growth also six cities have a rebound effect of industrial water greater than 100 belonging to the backfire effect the industrial water rebound effects in other twenty cities fall within 0 100 referring to partial rebound compared with the average industrial water rebound effect of the yrd seven cities are below the average and twenty cities are above the average of all the cities only wuhu has a negative rebound effect value in reviewing the rebound effect measurements it is found that wuhu s rwu value is 13 82 and its ews value is 42 72 which is less than 0 this results in a negative rebound effect value for wuhu in fact this estimate does not mean that there is an over storage effect on wuhu s industrial water use on the contrary this estimate is absurd because wre can be calculated for any value when ews 0 under such circumstances the implicit assumption of the water rebound effect calculation that water productivity is increased is not met thus the estimated value is meaningless this judgement is consistent with the empirical research on the energy rebound effect 33 in terms of the provincial gap all nine cities in zhejiang exceeds the yrd s average and zhejiang s industrial water rebound effect is the highest nearly 100 indicating that the industrial economic growth brought by the improvement of water efficiency in zhejiang has almost consumed the original water saving amount the rebound effect of industrial water in anhui is 87 19 it is clear that the industrial economic growth in anhui has offset most of the water saving amount with the improvement of water efficiency only producing a small positive water saving impact the rebound effect of industrial water in jiangsu is 70 58 ranking third shanghai has the lowest industrial water rebound effect at 27 08 compared with the other three provinces the industrial economic growth in shanghai has offset a small proportion of water saving amount and the increased water efficiency has had a significantly positive effect on water savings the annual rebound effect of industrial water in the yrd is shown in fig 7 the industrial water rebound effects in the yrd are in the range of 0 100 for fourteen years and over 100 for five years it had the highest industrial water rebound effect at 396 22 in 2013 while the lowest industrial water rebound effect at 14 35 in 2011 meanwhile the industrial water rebound effect prior to 2011 was higher than that of the historical yrd period reflecting that the amount of industrial water required in the early industrial economic development offset more than half of the original water savings the years below the average level of the historical rebound effect are all after 2011 inferring that the increased technological progress rate could contribute to positive water savings and that the growth of the industrial economy did not significantly stimulate excessive demand for industrial water the yrd s industrial water rebound effect was characterized by a decline from 2011 to 2019 compared to the previous decade this finding is consistent with the overall downward trend in total industrial water use in the yrd after 2010 telling of a degree of improvement in the management of industrial water use in terms of spatial temporal heterogeneity see fig 8 there has been a significant reduction in the rebound effect of industrial water use in shanghai since 2011 however it maintained continuous growth from 2011 to 2018 suggesting that the rebound effect of industrial water use in shanghai has been exacerbated over the past few years and shanghai should be wary of a rebound in industrial water use in the future jiangsu s industrial water rebound effect almost exceeds the yrd s average during the study period it is very close to the full rebound implying that jiangsu should pay attention to controlling the amount of water input and avoid blindly pursuing rapid industrial economic growth at the expense of over consume water resources prior to 2014 the demand for industrial water from zhejiang s industrial economic development not only consumed the original industrial water saving amount but also added additional water consumption resulting in the industrial water rebound effect that was almost always greater than 100 except in 2005 and 2009 it was only after 2014 that zhejiang focused on building the water saving capacity of industrial enterprises the rebound effect in anhui shows an erratic temporal trend with a downward trend in recent years but it is still important to beware of an aggravation in the rebound effect of industrial water in the future 4 discussion among many factors affecting economic growth scholars have focused on the main input factors such as capital labour energy technological advance and development 60 61 the yangtze river delta as the economic plate with the most potential for development has witnessed rapid industrial development and a sharp increase in industrial water consumption coupled with the fact that industrial water is partly sourced from freshwater 62 industrial water supply requirements are highly increasing making the industrial water shortage in the yrd inevitable hence to develop the circular economy and advocate water recycling it is necessary to study the influence of industrial water use on the industrial economy in the yrd and compare the industrial water demand before and after the water use efficiency improvements additionally the rebound effect of industrial energy 63 65 and agricultural water 32 66 in china have been well discussed while few studies are focusing on rebound effect of industrial water consumption thus the contribution of this paper is to examine the question of whether industrial economic development stimulates additional inputs to industrial water use due to efficiency improvements while exploring the economic contribution of industrial water use inputs to industrial economic growth we hope that this study can enrich the existing research in the context of china s industrialization the empirical analysis illustrates that industrial water input has to some extent contributed to industrial economic growth the industrial economic growth has in turn brought out additional water input even though there are technological enhancements and industrial water use efficiency improvements this suggests that industrial water has a rebound effect similar to that of energy consumption in this study the industrial water rebound effect is generally high in the cities of the yrd but such results are expected the yrd region has seen rapid economic development in recent years and with its numerous rivers and lakes and dense water network its water resources are relatively abundant as a result the growth of industrial water use is less constrained resulting in a high rebound of industrial water use and a more severe rebound effect also people often fail to recognize the problems of high water consumption water scarcity water ecological degradation and serious water pollution in the region 67 to better maintain the further development of the industrial economy the demand for industrial water by producers rises repeatedly and then water consumption becomes even larger 68 in many cases the extra demand for industrial water to meet the needs of industrial economic growth and development often goes unnoticed and the quiet increase in industrial water consumption is not easily detected the pursuit of industrial economic growth at the expense of more water resources is a serious breach of the concept of sustainable development industrial development needs to meet the requirements of green development with water resources as an important factor of production providing security services for industrial economic production thus it is necessary to strictly restrict industrial water usage and promote the sustainable use of water resources there are some limitations to this paper that 1 we employed the c d production function to measure the rate of technological progress taking technological progress as an exogenous variable and neglecting the endogeneity of technological progress we then introduced the contribution rate of technological progress in the rebound effect measurement and such an approach could lead to questions about the validity of estimating the contribution of technological progress and the reasonableness of using technological progress to represent water productivity improvements future research should develop a more rational method to estimate the rebound effect of water 2 this paper only selected capital labour water consumption and technological progress as influencing factors of industrial economic growth without taking into account other factors that affect the industrial economic growth of the yrd such as fdi urbanization level and industrial structure etc 3 this study only focuses on the rebound effect of industrial water consumption but ignores the change and rebound effect of household water consumption the development of the industrial economy will drive residents toward a more affluent life by creating jobs and increasing incomes promoting an improvement in their quality of living the improved standard of living will lead to an increased demand for domestic water so the development of the industrial economy can not only expand the increase of industrial water consumption but could also stimulate the growth of domestic water usage 4 it has been pointed out that the c d production function is not suitable for measuring the benefits and value of water use because water as a production input reflects only a portion of its total contribution to economic output 69 future studies could notice those elements that reflect the value of water namely industrial water saving investment and adjustment of water structure 5 conclusions and suggestions this study has estimated the economic contribution to industrial economic growth and the rebound effect of industrial water in the yrd from 2001 to 2019 it is found that the production elasticity of industrial water in the yrd is 0 121 that is if the industrial water consumption increases by 1 the industrial output of the yrd will increase by 0 121 moreover total industrial water consumption control has been effective in the last decade the consumption of water resources has significantly contributed to the anhui s industrial economic development it is still necessary to control the total industrial water consumption avoiding over consume water resources for the industrial economic growth in shanghai the industrial economic development has not led to excessive consumption of water resources and has to some extent achieved the goal of industrial water saving moreover the industrial water rebound effect in the yrd is 55 11 it means 55 11 of the industrial water saving amount is offset due to technological advances and industrial economic growth the industrial water rebound effect has shown an increasing trend in recent years the overall rebound effect of industrial water is more severe in zhejiang anhui and jiangsu shanghai keeps tight control on the total amount of industrial water and achieves a low rebound effect shanghai is the most effective in the yrd in terms of industrial water saving while jiangsu zhejiang and anhui still need to strengthen their water saving measures based on the conclusions above this study argues that there is an urgent need to advocate the water economy water economy refers to taking water resources as an essential factor of production to prioritize water conservation and water protection the precondition for the construction of the water economy is to guarantee the sustainable utilization of water so as an important factor of production for industrial economic development water resources must be developed and utilized rationally following the principles of sustainable use regional equity inter generational equity and water conservation priority while maintaining good water and ecological environment the yrd should harvest as many economic benefits as possible with as little consumption of water resources achieving a win win goal between water protection and industrial development given these requirements the yrd needs to take total water consumption as an important basis for planning construction and assessment of industrial enterprises require the industrial sector to implement a strict water management system promote industrial water budgeting encourage water saving production and strive to reduce the amount of water use of industrial added value per ten thousand yuan in terms of water allocation policy the water resources carrying capacity is an important basis for the initial allocation of water right to strengthen the rigid constraints on water resources in accordance with the conditions of water endowment and the actual economic and social development while playing the role of the government in the initial allocation of water use rights and the regulation of transactions the market mechanism such as water right trading among users can be brought into full play to optimize the allocation of water resources and stimulate the endogenous impetus for water conservation for each province or municipality shanghai should adhere to long term water conservation improve the rate of industrial water reuse and strengthen rigid constraints on water use targets jiangsu should strengthen water conservation supervision of large water users comprehensively strengthen water conservation management of high water consuming industrial enterprises and key water using units and promote the improvement of water efficiency of enterprises

8639,we nudged households in torbat heydarieh a city in iran with social comparison and public environmental messages to decrease water consumption in the former treatment we provided subjects with their actual water consumption compared to their neighborhood s minimum and average consumption in the latter one we illustrated some facts about the water crisis in iran and each individual s potential role in dropping it we also incorporated perceptions and attitudes of our subjects on water consumption extracted from our survey to control for their possible impacts our results show that the social comparison nudge lessens the daily water usage of each family member by about 30 percent in contrast a nudge with public environmental messages does not have any effect jel classification c93 d12 h42 l95 q25 keywords nudge social norm conservative behavior field experiment iran data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction iran has an arid and semi arid climate is undergoing a severe water crisis is suffering from a terrible socioeconomic drought and facing water bankruptcy 1 it has been suffering from water shortage for decades while rapid urbanization has provoked this crisis the water crisis in iran illustrates itself in the significant sinking of groundwater levels overusing water supply sources and severely worsening water quality numerous droughts and the over extraction of surface and especially groundwater have adversely accelerated the country s water situation to a critical level this crisis is more than evidenced by drying lakes rivers and wetlands diminishing groundwater levels soil erosion desertification and dust storms to name just a few madani et al 1 argue that the country mainly suffers from a socioeconomic drought i e bad governance disintegrated planning and managerial myopia in water management climate change particularly drought has worsened in the last ten years in this period iran s precipitation has declined by about 11 percent surface water has diminished by about 44 percent renewable water has decreased by about 32 percent and the average temperature of main cities in iran has increased by about 0 6 degree centigrade all in comparison with their long run average moreover substantial probable changes in precipitation and temperature regimes are anticipated for the coming decades forecasts for the coming 15 years exhibit between 0 7 in the intermediate scenario to 1 in the worst case scenario degree increase in temperature the research center of islamic legislative assembly 2018 the global trends 2030 report of the us national intelligence council also predicts that average precipitation patterns will change such that wet areas will become wetter while arid areas will become more so especially in iran precipitation is forecasted to decline by 15 6 percent the decline in rainfall in 2017 has been unsurpassed in the last five years and almost 90 percent of the country is facing drought though to different extents since it is not possible in the short run to increase the water supply significantly the only way to tackle the water bankruptcy problem where water demand exceeds the natural water supply in principle is to implement aggressive water demand reduction plans the average daily water consumption per head is about 157 liters in iran 2 2 this includes 5 liters for drinking 10 liters for cooking 50 liters for taking a bath and shower 20 liters for laundry 15 liters for dishwasher 30 liters for sanitary consumption 10 liters for house cleaning and 17 liters of miscellaneous consumption therefore it is clear that in contrast to the western standard showers are the main component of water consumption in iranian households where individuals used to take very long showers at the same time it may exceed up to 400 liters in metropolises such as tehran according to data from the iran energy ministry 3 3 https financialtribune com articles energy 80967 tehran residents warned again about water consumption text according 20to 20data 20from 20the tehran 20may 20exceed 20400 20liters these figures make iran an exceptional case where over usage of water is happening where the water is scarce this paper assessed whether nudging households with social comparison and public environmental messages decreases water consumption the novelty of this paper comes from institutional as well as normative channels first of all non price policies to reduce demand for water in all countries disrespectful of their level of development and wealth are concentrated in cases where the price of water is already high or at least not subsidies therefore these countries only have a little room for a price policy that typically involves increasing prices what makes a country like iran a distinctive and exciting place to study the effect of non price policies is not the fact that the country is not wealthy e g in terms of gdp per capita but the fact that its economy is dependent on oil enabling the government to subsidize different commodities including water a multi part tariff for water prices in iran depends on the consumption level the water price increases nonlinearly as its consumption increases nevertheless water in iran is heavily subsidized and very cheap by any measure as its average price of a cubic meter is about 3 cents per liter is about 0 003 cents so far all typical behavioral interventions have been conducted in developed countries where drinkable water is not cheap therefore one could not reduce water demand by increasing its price as it is already expensive however based on official data from the iranian parliament s research center 4 4 https rc majlis ir fa news show 1097109 in persian the selling price of water in urban areas is less than 48 and in rural areas less than 25 of its marginal cost since the water price is subsidized and dramatically low people use drinkable water for other usages such as cleaning and showering while there is much room to increase water prices in iran socio political and security concerns hinder policymakers from adjusting its price to at least cover its production cost if not its opportunity cost moreover price policies could not be applicable to lessen water consumption especially given its low price elasticity of demand therefore we are left only with behavioral policies to lessen the demand of urban residents for water moreover people in iran as an islamic country face different islamic thoughts in their everyday lives particularly to consume in parsimony therefore one might not expect that another message on water consumption could have a marginal effect our paper explicitly demonstrates that even in extreme cases like iran where the water is very cheap by any measure and people are used to getting a lot of religious messages in their everyday lives on how to consume with frugality non price policies particularly nudge in the sense of social comparison could be still effective in other words a similar nudge with social comparisons works effectively in a very different institutional and normative setting the paper s main contribution is to assess the non price policy s effectiveness in reducing water usage outside of the americas europe setting where the very low price of water pushes the price policy at the same time the socio politic concerns make this policy irrelevant in practice few studies apply behavioral economics to water usage in a low or middle income country e g 2 3 we incorporated novel and unique information on the perceptions and attitudes of our subjects on water consumption as the randomization was adequately executed we used some control variables namely household size and average age for the precision of estimates moreover we included some subjective variables extracted from our survey to control for their possible impacts on water consumption changes over the experiment these combinations of objective and subjective variables give us an almost complete toolbox to assess the behavioral changes in water consumption by conducting a field experiment in iran we avoid the criticism of the experimental approach mainly being used in western educated industrialized rich and democratic weird societies 4 while non european less educated non industrialized poor and less democratic societies are mainly ignored we nudged households with social and public environmental messages in a field experiment in one treatment we notified subjects about the substance of their water consumption and the minimum and average water consumption in their neighborhood while in another treatment we provided subjects with some facts about the water crisis in iran and how they could reduce it the non effectiveness of traditional tools such as price policies to reduce water consumption leads to the development of different policy tools based on social motives and behavioral biases that better motivate desired behavior change in general other than climatic conditions water consumption is driven by the rational pursuit of self interests given financial status and behavioral factors such as lifestyle habits social norms and rising living standards frederiks et al 5 illuminate the fundamental cognitive biases that may explain why energy related behavior often fails to align with consumers values or pecuniary interests the usual way to behavior change in public policy has been to attempt to change minds by influencing how people think through information and incentives however there is increasing evidence to suggest that changing contexts by influencing the environments within which people act in mostly intuitive ways can significantly affect behavior 6 there is also often a sizeable disparity between peoples self reported values and intentions and their observable behavior therefore despite adequate water scarcity knowledge many consumers might fail to take significant water consumption efficiency and conservation steps we might break the knowledge action gap and improve consumption behavior with a simple nudge that reminds consumers of their core values and change the architecture of their choices without forcing them to adopt a new consumption pattern providing simple low cost information about social norms can help individuals overcome salience and status quo biases and improve efficiency in many choice settings strategies that provide information about overconsumption behavior have helped encourage conservation behavior social comparisons are a popular behavioral nudge to promote conservative behavior partially because raising prices is politically tricky our findings exhibit that the social comparison nudge lessens the daily water usage of each family member by about 6 even when it does not translate to saving money while a nudge with public environmental messages does not affect changing consumption behavior the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we reviewed the related literature section 3 describes the experimental design we reported the results and provided some discussion in section 4 section 5 concludes 2 related literature while some studies do not support the influence of non price water conservation policies on households decision making regarding water conservation practices e g 7 the literature generally provides much evidence that non price policies have been very successful in reducing residential water consumption policymakers generate and utilize behavioral innovations e g norm based messages which nudge consumers to make better choices and promote conservation efforts they make the implications of one s behavior salient in either absolute terms concerning damage to the environment and negative externalities e g 8 or comparison with oneself either real time e g gans alberini longo 2013 jessoe rapson 2014 9 or in offline mode 8 or with others e g 10 11 12 13 in a randomized control trial rct with real time appliance level energy metering asensio and delmas 8 pointed out that non price incentives such as tailored information about environmental and public health damages which imply the externalities of electricity production e g pollutant childhood asthma and cancer defeat monetary savings information to motivate energy conservation behavior in the residential electricity sector tiefenbeck et al 9 in a large scale field experiment gave participants real time feedback on the consumption of showering and found that it lessened resource consumption by 22 which is much larger than standard policy interventions that provide aggregate feedback on resource use instead by providing feedback to customers on their energy usage at their homes with a focus on peer comparisons utilities can reduce energy consumption at a low cost in particular several studies e g 12 showed that nudging highlighting social norms with peer comparisons decreases household water usage in a natural field experiment ferraro et al 10 exhibited that appeals to pro social preferences influence short run water use patterns while only norm based messages augmented with social comparisons permanently impact water demand ferraro and price 11 also found that social comparison messages significantly influenced residential water demand more than simple pro social messages or technical information alone moreover social comparison messages are most effective among high water users identified as the least price sensitive in a randomized field experiment where for one year delivered monthly reports of water consumption including normative messages torres marcela and carlsson 2016 found that social information and appeals to norm based behavior reduced residential water use by up to 6 8 in colombia the theoretical model of taylor et al 14 proved that social comparison messages that function principally by raising the psychic cost of consumption might improve welfare if the retail price of water is below its social marginal cost and lead to conservation for water use activities if consumers are below satiation czap et al 15 examined the effectiveness of complementing financial incentives with nudging for empathy in a framed experiment where an upstream farmer affects the downstream water quality by choosing the level of conservation they found that empathy nudging a message to the upstream farmer encouraging them to walk in the shoes of a downstream water user can counteract the exclusion of financial incentives moreover empathy nudging and financial incentives have a synergic higher effect especially in low conservation cases peth et al 16 showed that nudging decreases the water usage of german farmers however the deterrent effect of the nudge with a social comparison that the majority of farmers comply with the minimum distance to water rule is not more potent than that of the nudge with information and pictures showing environmental and health damages caused by breaching the rule moreover the nudge with social comparison increased the severity of non complying behavior in the deviant subpopulation andor and fels 17 presented a systematic review of the empirical evidence of non price nudge like interventions namely social comparison commitment devices goal setting and labeling on energy conservation behavior of households they find that all interventions could significantly decrease the energy consumption of households albeit with different effect sizes results of delmas et al 18 meta analysis of 156 published energy conservation field experiments between 1975 to 2012 showed that strategies providing individualized audits and consulting are comparatively more effective for conservation behavior than strategies that provide historical peer comparison energy feedback in a rct where information on individual and group water consumption was sent weekly to farmers equipped with smart meters chabe ferret et al 19 did not detect an effect of social comparison nudges on average water saving behavior among farmers however they find that the nudge decreases water consumption at the top of the distribution while it increases consumption at the bottom in two experiments brent and wichman 20 investigated the interaction of prices and nudges they find empirical support that consumers respond to behavioral nudges due to personal economic benefits however they do not find consistent evidence that social comparisons are more effective in inducing higher priced conservation or increasing consumers price sensitivity in a rct at 105 schools visser et al 3 demonstrated that detailed water usage data feedback from smart meters and an interschool competition encouraged responsible water usage and reduced water usage by 15 26 3 experimental design torbat heydarieh is considered one of the water critical cities in the khorasan razavi province due to drought over abstraction of surface and groundwater through illegal and over deep well digging and cultivation of crops that require abundant water such as beetroot watermelon melons and cotton located in a semi arid and dry area with a population of about 225 000 it is the agricultural hub of khorasan razavi province in iran and the capital of saffron of the world in torbat heydarieh there are 50 000 water subscriptions with per capita usage of 209 liters per day among the numerous areas of torbat heydarieh residents of the streets leading to the north of shahid modarres blvd in the north and northwest were considered for this study due to the densely populated and relatively cultural and social homogeneity with the middle class inhabitants the selected subscribers from over eight hundred households were randomly divided into a control treatment a social comparison treatment and a public environmental messages treatment we collected every 20 houses as a block and considered the first and the fourth blocks to be in the control group while the second and the third ones for the social comparison treatment and the public environmental messages treatment respectively houses in iran generally border each other but are not double sided in the sense that house fronts face roads while house backs face house fronts of the next street over houses in our sample were almost similar in size materials and architecture with an interior yard mainly with a small garden while households typically water their garden the municipality is in charge of exterior plants in the streets growing grass inside houses or even in the streets is not typical in iran we did not prohibit occupants from talking about the treatment with each other nevertheless as subjects in both treatments had the same opportunity to communicate with their neighbors this should have the same effect in both treatments however once we excluded those houses with zero water consumption in at least one period we ended up with 266 households in the social comparison treatment and 236 households in the environmental messages treatment where in each treatment half of these subjects were in the experimental group and the half in the control group we conducted our field experiment in a year between november 2017 and november 2018 as water bills are issued in iran every two months we intervened six times by sticking an attached paper to water bills in the experimental treatments a questionnaire presented in the appendix was also filled out once by the head of subscribers households in this questionnaire household characteristics age gender education level and occupation of each family member and their views on the water crisis their role and the government in this issue were revealed we asked all households in control and experimental treatments to participate in the survey though some did not contribute the survey was conducted after the experiment was over the reason was to prevent the priming effect and any possible contamination with the household behavior in water usage we followed the world value survey style of questions which is standard worldwide we did not expect all subjects to answer truthfully however as it was similarly likely not to falsify preference we expect to observe the same level of dishonesty in our randomized treatments for the sc treatment we follow the typical messages that have been used already in the literature on the piece of paper attached to the bill sent from the utility we informed subjects about the amount of their water consumption and the minimum and the average water consumption in their neighborhood and the whole region in the last two months all in liters the household knew that the paper was coming from the local utility as it is the only authority with access to such data and sends the official bill if the amount of water consumption of a subject was less than equal to the average of the neighbors this message was written in pink with the star sign on the paper attached to the bill fortunately your water consumption is less than equal to the average consumption of your neighbors however this message was written in green for high usage subjects with the cross sign unfortunately your water consumption is higher than the average consumption of your neighbors for the em treatment we used all available reliable figures about the city s water consumption and the extent of the water crises in the region we gave all subjects some stylized facts about the water crisis in iran and how they could reduce it after the final data collection some subscribers were excluded from the sample for various reasons e g vacancy or subsistence in both cases households in the control group received nothing except the bill 4 data to get the data on household water consumption we teamed up with the torbat heydarieh water and waste water utility which is responsible for collecting data on water usage and issuing and distributing bills once we cleaned our data on water consumption we ended up with 266 households in the social comparison treatment and its correspondent control group and 236 households in the environmental messages treatment and its correspondent control group we asked each household s head about the characteristics of each family such as age and household size the average age is the average of all household members ages we considered 1 for females and 2 for males the gender diversity is the average of these values for each household between 1 and 2 by construction and measures whether there are more males or females we also made some control variables out of the survey filled by each household the income variable is the households perception of their relative level of total income including salary retirement and pension compared with other households in the society on a scale between 1 the lowest to 10 the highest the social norm is a self reported level to which the family tries to follow social norms in its consumption decisions on a scale between 1 the lowest to 5 the highest the government variable indicates how much the household believes that the government is the entity that is responsible for providing drinking water independent of price or household consumption finally the religiosity is a self reported level to that extent the head of the family considers himself herself an adherent of islamic orders since we had many randomly selected observations over a year we could expect subjects in different treatments to be comparable regarding factors affecting their water consumption tables 1 and 2 show the mean of family characteristics in the social comparison treatment and the environmental messages treatment these characteristics include the level of water consumption per household in liters before the policy household size and gender diversity given the normal distribution of data the t test shows no significant difference in mean between the two groups in both treatments 5 results and discussion first we illustrate the distribution of year over year water consumption changes in two different treatments in two different graphs see figs 1 and 2 as it is clear from these figures compared to households in the control treatment more households in the sn treatment reduced their water consumption while a smaller number of them increased their water consumption however changes in water consumption in the em treatment are not substantially different we pooled our data to consider the household s overall water consumption in a year and compare the same period across treatments in order to control for meteorological factors and learning effects we subtract the pre intervention level of per capita water usage in november 2017 before starting our experiment from per capita water consumption in the last round november 2018 to calculate the dependent variable i e the difference in per capita water consumption eq 1 indicates how we identify the effect of a nudge on water consumption in two different treatments 1 d w c i β 0 β 1 t d i β 2 h s i β 3 a a i β 4 c o n t r l i β 5 t d i c o n t r l i ɛ i where d w c i indicates the difference in per capita water consumption of household i in terms of a liter after one year h s i is the size of household i a a i is the average of members age in household i and c o n t r l i is a vector of control variables including the income perception of household i i n i the social norms adherence i e how household i acts following the social norms in consumption decisions s n i the belief of household about the role of government i e how much household i considers the government is responsible for providing cheap water g v i and finally the level of household i s religiosity r l i moreover t d shows the treatment dummy which is 1 for households in the sc group and 0 for those in the control group in the nudge treatment on social norms it is also 1 for households in the em group and 0 for those in the control group in the nudge treatment with environmental messages table 3 compares the sc treatment with the control group to examine whether our social norm nudges significantly impacted water consumption in model i we only considered the treatment dummy our main variable of interest and the constant we also added control variables in model ii our main specification finally model iii clusters subjects by including the interaction of the treatment dummy with control variables the main reason for having different specifications is to check the robustness of the coefficients of different variables to the addition of other control variables since we assess how per capita water consumption has changed after a year of sending the message we should also not worry about seasonality therefore we used a dummy variable to assess the effect of the policy the treatment dummy is negative in all specifications in table 3 indicating that awareness about a higher level of water consumption compared to others has a dampening effect in model ii controlling for all other factors informing households about their relative water consumption reduces water usage of each of its members by about 3826 liters in each period two months which is about 63 liters per day or about 30 of daily per capita water usage moreover this result is almost robust between model i and model ii the treatment dummy variable is insignificant in model iii while the model suggests a correlation between the effectiveness of social norms treatment and greater adherence to norms in other words the more subjects score on the norm adherence question is associated with the more reaction to the norms message to decrease water consumption therefore the effect of a nudge with social norm comparison came mainly from those subjects who already care more about following social norms in consumption decisions this result does not mean that the treatment was not effective it just determines the source of effectiveness i e intrinsic motivation for adhering to social norms which only needs a nudge to be prominent table 4 compares the em treatment with the control group to show the effect of the environmental nudge on the difference in per capita water consumption the right hand side variables in different models of table 4 are the same as those in models of table 3 our results show that the treatment dummy is insignificant in all specifications in table 4 in other words providing households with public and general messages about the water crisis in iran and their significant role in reducing it would not affect them to change their consumption behavior this finding contrasts the practical policy that targets private consumption in the sc treatment moreover subjective survey variables do not influence the per capita water consumption change between treated and untreated households 5 5 we dropped 46 households in estimations of table 3 and 70 households in estimations of table 4 because of missing data as we had expected such missing data beforehand we collected enough data to be able to run different estimations in order to check the robustness of our result we also estimated a fixed effect panel regression which incorporates the five bimonthly treated observations in periods that were not included in previous regressions d w c i t β 0 β 1 t d i t β 2 h s i t β 3 a a i t α i ɛ i t the dependent variable is the difference in per capita water consumption in each bimonthly treated observation compared to the consumption before any treatment the new results in table 5 confirm that the treatment was significantly effective in the social norm treatment while it had no significant effect in the environmental message treatment we also included the results of the difference in differences estimations w c i β 0 β 1 t d i β 2 t i i β 3 t d i t i i β 4 h s i β 5 a a i β 6 c o n t r l i ɛ i for both treatments in table 6 where w c i indicates the per capita water consumption of household i in terms of a liter and the time trend dummy t i is 1 for water consumption in the last period after the series of nudges and 0 for water consumption in the period before the nudge while the water consumption in the very last period always significantly increases in both experiments the interaction of the time variable and the treatment dummy is only significant in the social norm experiment confirming our previous findings the non effectiveness of environmental messages could not be because people do not believe in iran s water crises or underestimate their role in mitigating water shortage households in the em treatment almost wholly disagree with the statement that the water crisis in iran is not a severe issue with an average of 1 27 on the scale between 1 completely disagree to 5 completely agree they also almost disagree with the statement that reducing household water consumption does not have a significant effect on reducing water scarcity with an average of 2 74 on the same scale as the government is the monopoly in providing water in iran that highly subsidizes its price the mistrust of people towards the government in iran makes them believe that the saved resources might not be used in their interest therefore since people in iran mostly do not trust the government to efficiently use the public resource for their benefit nudging to save water to give the government more chance to serve its people does not salient this fact in people s minds households might think the government does not use the resource they save for public welfare but rather for its ideological and political interests even against their will 6 6 on 12 november 2017 the earthquake in kermanshah was followed by a massive wave of empathy from fellow iranians and their support through volunteering and donating to various campaigns of celebrities on social networks however this civil movement s meaning was a deep distrust of the government and its affiliated organizations indeed public trust in the government has been damaged deeply by the waves of corruption cases lately see https en radiofarda com a why iranians trust celebrities more than ir 28940854 html therefore taking the results of the social comparison treatment at face value they should collaborate with ngos rather than local governments to successfully scale up social norm based nudges 6 conclusion iran suffers from water crises while its price has been kept very low due to socio political concerns therefore non price policies based on social motives and behavioral biases might help reduce urban residential water overconsumption we nudge households in a field experiment with social comparison i e the amount of their water consumption in contrast to the minimum and the average in their neighborhood as well as public environmental messages i e some facts about water crises in iran and their potential role in decreasing it our findings exhibit that informing households about their relative water consumption lessens the daily water usage of each family member by about 30 while providing them with facts about the water crises in iran and their significant role in decreasing it does not affect changing their consumption behavior despite the remarkable impacts of such social comparisons in promoting conservative consumption behavior experimental analyses have concentrated solely on short run effects however from a policy making viewpoint whether and how such nudges could change behaviors lastingly in the long

public environmental messages treatment received all messages below attached to their bi monthly water bills here is the translation of these messages according to the global standard countries that use more than 40 percent of their renewable water sources are at serious risk iran with 110 percent usage of these resources is in a critical condition and if this process continues there will not remain any water in the country in about 15 years by saving water in addition to preserving the country s water resources you will also reduce your household expenses rainfall in khorasan razavi province is about one quarter of the global average rainfall which makes this province among the world s less rainy areas torbat heydarieh with an average annual rainfall of 8 246 mm is in the semi arid region if you reduce your showering time by 1 minute the water saved will be 600 liters in 1 month if in torbat heydarieh with a population of about 224626 people each person only reduces 1 minute of shower use the amount of water saved during the one month will be 134775600 liters which is equal to 89850400 bottles of 1 5 liters of mineral water the iranian students polling agency ispa reported that 67 7 of the people agree with the statement that the country is in a water crisis and the main duty is on citizens to save 23 2 agree that iran is in a water crisis but the main responsibility is on the government and not the people 6 1 agree that the country s water level is appropriate and not a concern while the rest did not have an opinion on the water issue in iran by preventing tap water drain we could assuage 150 people per day by using a washing machine only when it is full we can save 50 trees annually by closing the tap while washing dishes we can water the 5 meters of grass by using a bucket 300 liters of water could be saved when washing a car by closing the tap when brushing we can save 5000 liters of water annually 
8639,we nudged households in torbat heydarieh a city in iran with social comparison and public environmental messages to decrease water consumption in the former treatment we provided subjects with their actual water consumption compared to their neighborhood s minimum and average consumption in the latter one we illustrated some facts about the water crisis in iran and each individual s potential role in dropping it we also incorporated perceptions and attitudes of our subjects on water consumption extracted from our survey to control for their possible impacts our results show that

water demand exceeds the natural water supply in principle is to implement aggressive water demand reduction plans the average daily water consumption per head is about 157 liters in iran 2 2 this includes 5 liters for drinking 10 liters for cooking 50 liters for taking a bath and shower 20 liters for laundry 15 liters for dishwasher 30 liters for sanitary consumption 10 liters for house cleaning and 17 liters of miscellaneous consumption therefore it is clear that in contrast to the western standard showers are the main component of water consumption in iranian households where individuals used to take very long showers at the same time it may exceed up to 400 liters in metropolises such as tehran according to data from the iran energy ministry 3 3 https financialtribune com articles energy 80967 tehran residents warned again about water consumption text according 20to 20data 20from 20the tehran 20may 20exceed 20400 20liters these figures make iran an exceptional case where over usage of water is happening where the water is scarce this paper assessed whether nudging households with social comparison and public environmental messages decreases water consumption the novelty of this paper comes from institutional as well as normative channels first of all non price policies to reduce demand for water in all countries disrespectful of their level of development and wealth are concentrated in cases where the price of water is already high or at least not subsidies therefore these countries only have a little room for a price policy that typically involves increasing prices what makes a country like iran a distinctive and exciting place to study the effect of non price policies is not the fact that the country is not wealthy e g in terms of gdp per capita but the fact that its economy is dependent on oil enabling the government to subsidize different commodities including water a multi part tariff for water prices in iran depends on the consumption level the water price increases nonlinearly as its consumption increases nevertheless water in iran is heavily subsidized and very cheap by any measure as its average price of a cubic meter is about 3 cents per liter is about 0 003 cents so far all typical behavioral interventions have been conducted in developed countries where drinkable water is not cheap therefore one could not reduce water demand by increasing its price as it is already expensive however based on official data from the iranian parliament s research center 4 4 https rc majlis ir fa news show 1097109 in persian the selling price of water in urban areas is less than 48 and in rural areas less than 25 of its marginal cost since the water price is subsidized and dramatically low people use drinkable water for other usages such as cleaning and showering while there is much room to increase water prices in iran socio political and security concerns hinder policymakers from adjusting its price to at least cover its production cost if not its opportunity cost moreover price policies could not be applicable to lessen water consumption especially given its low price elasticity of demand therefore we are left only with behavioral policies to lessen the demand of urban residents for water moreover people in iran as an islamic country face different islamic thoughts in their everyday lives particularly to consume in parsimony therefore one might not expect that another message on water consumption could have a marginal effect our paper explicitly demonstrates that even in extreme cases like iran where the water is very cheap by any measure and people are used to getting a lot of religious messages in their everyday lives on how to consume with frugality non price policies particularly nudge in the sense of social comparison could be still effective in other words a similar nudge with social comparisons works effectively in a very different institutional and normative setting the paper s main contribution is to assess the non price policy s effectiveness in reducing water usage outside of the americas europe setting where the very low price of water pushes the price policy at the same time the socio politic concerns make this policy irrelevant in practice few studies apply behavioral economics to water usage in a low or middle income country e g 2 3 we incorporated novel and unique information on the perceptions and attitudes of our subjects on water consumption as the randomization was adequately executed we used some control variables namely household size and average age for the precision of estimates moreover we included some subjective variables extracted from our survey to control for their possible impacts on water consumption changes over the experiment these combinations of objective and subjective variables give us an almost complete toolbox to assess the behavioral changes in water consumption by conducting a field experiment in iran we avoid the criticism of the experimental approach mainly being used in western educated industrialized rich and democratic weird societies 4 while non european less educated non industrialized poor and less democratic societies are mainly ignored we nudged households with social and public environmental messages in a field experiment in one treatment we notified subjects about the substance of their water consumption and the minimum and average water consumption in their neighborhood while in another treatment we provided subjects with some facts about the water crisis in iran and how they could reduce it the non effectiveness of traditional tools such as price policies to reduce water consumption leads to the development of different policy tools based on social motives and behavioral biases that better motivate desired behavior change in general other than climatic conditions water consumption is driven by the rational pursuit of self interests given financial status and behavioral factors such as lifestyle habits social norms and rising living standards frederiks et al 5 illuminate the fundamental cognitive biases that may explain why energy related behavior often fails to align with consumers values or pecuniary interests the usual way to behavior change in public policy has been to attempt to change minds by influencing how people think through information and incentives however there is increasing evidence to suggest that changing contexts by influencing the environments within which people act in mostly intuitive ways can significantly affect behavior 6 there is also often a sizeable disparity between peoples self reported values and intentions and their observable behavior therefore despite adequate water scarcity knowledge many consumers might fail to take significant water consumption efficiency and conservation steps we might break the knowledge action gap and improve consumption behavior with a simple nudge that reminds consumers of their core values and change the architecture of their choices without forcing them to adopt a new consumption pattern providing simple low cost information about social norms can help individuals overcome salience and status quo biases and improve efficiency in many choice settings strategies that provide information about overconsumption behavior have helped encourage conservation behavior social comparisons are a popular behavioral nudge to promote conservative behavior partially because raising prices is politically tricky our findings exhibit that the social comparison nudge lessens the daily water usage of each family member by about 6 even when it does not translate to saving money while a nudge with public environmental messages does not affect changing consumption behavior the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we reviewed the related literature section 3 describes the experimental design we reported the results and provided some discussion in section 4 section 5 concludes 2 related literature while some studies do not support the influence of non price water conservation policies on households decision making regarding water conservation practices e g 7 the literature generally provides much evidence that non price policies have been very successful in reducing residential water consumption policymakers generate and utilize behavioral innovations e g norm based messages which nudge consumers to make better choices and promote conservation efforts they make the implications of one s behavior salient in either absolute terms concerning damage to the environment and negative externalities e g 8 or comparison with oneself either real time e g gans alberini longo 2013 jessoe rapson 2014 9 or in offline mode 8 or with others e g 10 11 12 13 in a randomized control trial rct with real time appliance level energy metering asensio and delmas 8 pointed out that non price incentives such as tailored information about environmental and public health damages which imply the externalities of electricity production e g pollutant childhood asthma and cancer defeat monetary savings information to motivate energy conservation behavior in the residential electricity sector tiefenbeck et al 9 in a large scale field experiment gave participants real time feedback on the consumption of showering and found that it lessened resource consumption by 22 which is much larger than standard policy interventions that provide aggregate feedback on resource use instead by providing feedback to customers on their energy usage at their homes with a focus on peer comparisons utilities can reduce energy consumption at a low cost in particular several studies e g 12 showed that nudging highlighting social norms with peer comparisons decreases household water usage in a natural field experiment ferraro et al 10 exhibited that appeals to pro social preferences influence short run water use patterns while only norm based messages augmented with social comparisons permanently impact water demand ferraro and price 11 also found that social comparison messages significantly influenced residential water demand more than simple pro social messages or technical information alone moreover social comparison messages are most effective among high water users identified as the least price sensitive in a randomized field experiment where for one year delivered monthly reports of water consumption including normative messages torres marcela and carlsson 2016 found that social information and appeals to norm based behavior reduced residential water use by up to 6 8 in colombia the theoretical model of taylor et al 14 proved that social comparison messages that function principally by raising the psychic cost of consumption might improve welfare if the retail price of water is below its social marginal cost and lead to conservation for water use activities if consumers are below satiation czap et al 15 examined the effectiveness of complementing financial incentives with nudging for empathy in a framed experiment where an upstream farmer affects the downstream water quality by choosing the level of conservation they found that empathy nudging a message to the upstream farmer encouraging them to walk in the shoes of a downstream water user can counteract the exclusion of financial incentives moreover empathy nudging and financial incentives have a synergic higher effect especially in low conservation cases peth et al 16 showed that nudging decreases the water usage of german farmers however the deterrent effect of the nudge with a social comparison that the majority of farmers comply with the minimum distance to water rule is not more potent than that of the nudge with information and pictures showing environmental and health damages caused by breaching the rule moreover the nudge with social comparison increased the severity of non complying behavior in the deviant subpopulation andor and fels 17 presented a systematic review of the empirical evidence of non price nudge like interventions namely social comparison commitment devices goal setting and labeling on energy conservation behavior of households they find that all interventions could significantly decrease the energy consumption of households albeit with different effect sizes results of delmas et al 18 meta analysis of 156 published energy conservation field experiments between 1975 to 2012 showed that strategies providing individualized audits and consulting are comparatively more effective for conservation behavior than strategies that provide historical peer comparison energy feedback in a rct where information on individual and group water consumption was sent weekly to farmers equipped with smart meters chabe ferret et al 19 did not detect an effect of social comparison nudges on average water saving behavior among farmers however they find that the nudge decreases water consumption at the top of the distribution while it increases consumption at the bottom in two experiments brent and wichman 20 investigated the interaction of prices and nudges they find empirical support that consumers respond to behavioral nudges due to personal economic benefits however they do not find consistent evidence that social comparisons are more effective in inducing higher priced conservation or increasing consumers price sensitivity in a rct at 105 schools visser et al 3 demonstrated that detailed water usage data feedback from smart meters and an interschool competition encouraged responsible water usage and reduced water usage by 15 26 3 experimental design torbat heydarieh is considered one of the water critical cities in the khorasan razavi province due to drought over abstraction of surface and groundwater through illegal and over deep well digging and cultivation of crops that require abundant water such as beetroot watermelon melons and cotton located in a semi arid and dry area with a population of about 225 000 it is the agricultural hub of khorasan razavi province in iran and the capital of saffron of the world in torbat heydarieh there are 50 000 water subscriptions with per capita usage of 209 liters per day among the numerous areas of torbat heydarieh residents of the streets leading to the north of shahid modarres blvd in the north and northwest were considered for this study due to the densely populated and relatively cultural and social homogeneity with the middle class inhabitants the selected subscribers from over eight hundred households were randomly divided into a control treatment a social comparison treatment and a public environmental messages treatment we collected every 20 houses as a block and considered the first and the fourth blocks to be in the control group while the second and the third ones for the social comparison treatment and the public environmental messages treatment respectively houses in iran generally border each other but are not double sided in the sense that house fronts face roads while house backs face house fronts of the next street over houses in our sample were almost similar in size materials and architecture with an interior yard mainly with a small garden while households typically water their garden the municipality is in charge of exterior plants in the streets growing grass inside houses or even in the streets is not typical in iran we did not prohibit occupants from talking about the treatment with each other nevertheless as subjects in both treatments had the same opportunity to communicate with their neighbors this should have the same effect in both treatments however once we excluded those houses with zero water consumption in at least one period we ended up with 266 households in the social comparison treatment and 236 households in the environmental messages treatment where in each treatment half of these subjects were in the experimental group and the half in the control group we conducted our field experiment in a year between november 2017 and november 2018 as water bills are issued in iran every two months we intervened six times by sticking an attached paper to water bills in the experimental treatments a questionnaire presented in the appendix was also filled out once by the head of subscribers households in this questionnaire household characteristics age gender education level and occupation of each family member and their views on the water crisis their role and the government in this issue were revealed we asked all households in control and experimental treatments to participate in the survey though some did not contribute the survey was conducted after the experiment was over the reason was to prevent the priming effect and any possible contamination with the household behavior in water usage we followed the world value survey style of questions which is standard worldwide we did not expect all subjects to answer truthfully however as it was similarly likely not to falsify preference we expect to observe the same level of dishonesty in our randomized treatments for the sc treatment we follow the typical messages that have been used already in the literature on the piece of paper attached to the bill sent from the utility we informed subjects about the amount of their water consumption and the minimum and the average water consumption in their neighborhood and the whole region in the last two months all in liters the household knew that the paper was coming from the local utility as it is the only authority with access to such data and sends the official bill if the amount of water consumption of a subject was less than equal to the average of the neighbors this message was written in pink with the star sign on the paper attached to the bill fortunately your water consumption is less than equal to the average consumption of your neighbors however this message was written in green for high usage subjects with the cross sign unfortunately your water consumption is higher than the average consumption of your neighbors for the em treatment we used all available reliable figures about the city s water consumption and the extent of the water crises in the region we gave all subjects some stylized facts about the water crisis in iran and how they could reduce it after the final data collection some subscribers were excluded from the sample for various reasons e g vacancy or subsistence in both cases households in the control group received nothing except the bill 4 data to get the data on household water consumption we teamed up with the torbat heydarieh water and waste water utility which is responsible for collecting data on water usage and issuing and distributing bills once we cleaned our data on water consumption we ended up with 266 households in the social comparison treatment and its correspondent control group and 236 households in the environmental messages treatment and its correspondent control group we asked each household s head about the characteristics of each family such as age and household size the average age is the average of all household members ages we considered 1 for females and 2 for males the gender diversity is the average of these values for each household between 1 and 2 by construction and measures whether there are more males or females we also made some control variables out of the survey filled by each household the income variable is the households perception of their relative level of total income including salary retirement and pension compared with other households in the society on a scale between 1 the lowest to 10 the highest the social norm is a self reported level to which the family tries to follow social norms in its consumption decisions on a scale between 1 the lowest to 5 the highest the government variable indicates how much the household believes that the government is the entity that is responsible for providing drinking water independent of price or household consumption finally the religiosity is a self reported level to that extent the head of the family considers himself herself an adherent of islamic orders since we had many randomly selected observations over a year we could expect subjects in different treatments to be comparable regarding factors affecting their water consumption tables 1 and 2 show the mean of family characteristics in the social comparison treatment and the environmental messages treatment these characteristics include the level of water consumption per household in liters before the policy household size and gender diversity given the normal distribution of data the t test shows no significant difference in mean between the two groups in both treatments 5 results and discussion first we illustrate the distribution of year over year water consumption changes in two different treatments in two different graphs see figs 1 and 2 as it is clear from these figures compared to households in the control treatment more households in the sn treatment reduced their water consumption while a smaller number of them increased their water consumption however changes in water consumption in the em treatment are not substantially different we pooled our data to consider the household s overall water consumption in a year and compare the same period across treatments in order to control for meteorological factors and learning effects we subtract the pre intervention level of per capita water usage in november 2017 before starting our experiment from per capita water consumption in the last round november 2018 to calculate the dependent variable i e the difference in per capita water consumption eq 1 indicates how we identify the effect of a nudge on water consumption in two different treatments 1 d w c i β 0 β 1 t d i β 2 h s i β 3 a a i β 4 c o n t r l i β 5 t d i c o n t r l i ɛ i where d w c i indicates the difference in per capita water consumption of household i in terms of a liter after one year h s i is the size of household i a a i is the average of members age in household i and c o n t r l i is a vector of control variables including the income perception of household i i n i the social norms adherence i e how household i acts following the social norms in consumption decisions s n i the belief of household about the role of government i e how much household i considers the government is responsible for providing cheap water g v i and finally the level of household i s religiosity r l i moreover t d shows the treatment dummy which is 1 for households in the sc group and 0 for those in the control group in the nudge treatment on social norms it is also 1 for households in the em group and 0 for those in the control group in the nudge treatment with environmental messages table 3 compares the sc treatment with the control group to examine whether our social norm nudges significantly impacted water consumption in model i we only considered the treatment dummy our main variable of interest and the constant we also added control variables in model ii our main specification finally model iii clusters subjects by including the interaction of the treatment dummy with control variables the main reason for having different specifications is to check the robustness of the coefficients of different variables to the addition of other control variables since we assess how per capita water consumption has changed after a year of sending the message we should also not worry about seasonality therefore we used a dummy variable to assess the effect of the policy the treatment dummy is negative in all specifications in table 3 indicating that awareness about a higher level of water consumption compared to others has a dampening effect in model ii controlling for all other factors informing households about their relative water consumption reduces water usage of each of its members by about 3826 liters in each period two months which is about 63 liters per day or about 30 of daily per capita water usage moreover this result is almost robust between model i and model ii the treatment dummy variable is insignificant in model iii while the model suggests a correlation between the effectiveness of social norms treatment and greater adherence to norms in other words the more subjects score on the norm adherence question is associated with the more reaction to the norms message to decrease water consumption therefore the effect of a nudge with social norm comparison came mainly from those subjects who already care more about following social norms in consumption decisions this result does not mean that the treatment was not effective it just determines the source of effectiveness i e intrinsic motivation for adhering to social norms which only needs a nudge to be prominent table 4 compares the em treatment with the control group to show the effect of the environmental nudge on the difference in per capita water consumption the right hand side variables in different models of table 4 are the same as those in models of table 3 our results show that the treatment dummy is insignificant in all specifications in table 4 in other words providing households with public and general messages about the water crisis in iran and their significant role in reducing it would not affect them to change their consumption behavior this finding contrasts the practical policy that targets private consumption in the sc treatment moreover subjective survey variables do not influence the per capita water consumption change between treated and untreated households 5 5 we dropped 46 households in estimations of table 3 and 70 households in estimations of table 4 because of missing data as we had expected such missing data beforehand we collected enough data to be able to run different estimations in order to check the robustness of our result we also estimated a fixed effect panel regression which incorporates the five bimonthly treated observations in periods that were not included in previous regressions d w c i t β 0 β 1 t d i t β 2 h s i t β 3 a a i t α i ɛ i t the dependent variable is the difference in per capita water consumption in each bimonthly treated observation compared to the consumption before any treatment the new results in table 5 confirm that the treatment was significantly effective in the social norm treatment while it had no significant effect in the environmental message treatment we also included the results of the difference in differences estimations w c i β 0 β 1 t d i β 2 t i i β 3 t d i t i i β 4 h s i β 5 a a i β 6 c o n t r l i ɛ i for both treatments in table 6 where w c i indicates the per capita water consumption of household i in terms of a liter and the time trend dummy t i is 1 for water consumption in the last period after the series of nudges and 0 for water consumption in the period before the nudge while the water consumption in the very last period always significantly increases in both experiments the interaction of the time variable and the treatment dummy is only significant in the social norm experiment confirming our previous findings the non effectiveness of environmental messages could not be because people do not believe in iran s water crises or underestimate their role in mitigating water shortage households in the em treatment almost wholly disagree with the statement that the water crisis in iran is not a severe issue with an average of 1 27 on the scale between 1 completely disagree to 5 completely agree they also almost disagree with the statement that reducing household water consumption does not have a significant effect on reducing water scarcity with an average of 2 74 on the same scale as the government is the monopoly in providing water in iran that highly subsidizes its price the mistrust of people towards the government in iran makes them believe that the saved resources might not be used in their interest therefore since people in iran mostly do not trust the government to efficiently use the public resource for their benefit nudging to save water to give the government more chance to serve its people does not salient this fact in people s minds households might think the government does not use the resource they save for public welfare but rather for its ideological and political interests even against their will 6 6 on 12 november 2017 the earthquake in kermanshah was followed by a massive wave of empathy from fellow iranians and their support through volunteering and donating to various campaigns of celebrities on social networks however this civil movement s meaning was a deep distrust of the government and its affiliated organizations indeed public trust in the government has been damaged deeply by the waves of corruption cases lately see https en radiofarda com a why iranians trust celebrities more than ir 28940854 html therefore taking the results of the social comparison treatment at face value they should collaborate with ngos rather than local governments to successfully scale up social norm based nudges 6 conclusion iran suffers from water crises while its price has been kept very low due to socio political concerns therefore non price policies based on social motives and behavioral biases might help reduce urban residential water overconsumption we nudge households in a field experiment with social comparison i e the amount of their water consumption in contrast to the minimum and the average in their neighborhood as well as public environmental messages i e some facts about water crises in iran and their potential role in decreasing it our findings exhibit that informing households about their relative water consumption lessens the daily water usage of each family member by about 30 while providing them with facts about the water crises in iran and their significant role in decreasing it does not affect changing their consumption behavior despite the remarkable impacts of such social comparisons in promoting conservative consumption behavior experimental analyses have concentrated solely on short run effects however from a policy making viewpoint whether and how such nudges could change behaviors lastingly in the long run is of equal interest credit authorship contribution statement mehdi feizi conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing supervision navideh

public environmental messages treatment received all messages below attached to their bi monthly water bills here is the translation of these messages according to the global standard countries that use more than 40 percent of their renewable water sources are at serious risk iran with 110 percent usage of these resources is in a critical condition and if this process continues there will not remain any water in the country in about 15 years by saving water in addition to preserving the country s water resources you will also reduce your household expenses rainfall in khorasan razavi province is about one quarter of the global average rainfall which makes this province among the world s less rainy areas torbat heydarieh with an average annual rainfall of 8 246 mm is in the semi arid region if you reduce your showering time by 1 minute the water saved will be 600 liters in 1 month if in torbat heydarieh with a population of about 224626 people each person only reduces 1 minute of shower use the amount of water saved during the one month will be 134775600 liters which is equal to 89850400 bottles of 1 5 liters of mineral water the iranian students polling agency ispa reported that 67 7 of the people agree with the statement that the country is in a water crisis and the main duty is on citizens to save 23 2 agree that iran is in a water crisis but the main responsibility is on the government and not the people 6 1 agree that the country s water level is appropriate and not a concern while the rest did not have an opinion on the water issue in iran by preventing tap water drain we could assuage 150 people per day by using a washing machine only when it is full we can save 50 trees annually by closing the tap while washing dishes we can water the 5 meters of grass by using a bucket 300 liters of water could be saved when washing a car by closing the tap when brushing we can save 5000 liters of water annually
