domestic as well as industrial purposes although there are various promising techniques for the removal of pollutants from wastewater but adsorption technique is considered an ideal alternative to other expensive methods this review article focuses on the usage of modified plant based adsorbents for the efficient removal of heavy metals and dyes various methods of activation and modification like physical chemical and composite formation with components such as polymers carbon nanotube cnt graphene layered double hydroxides ldhs and metal oxides are discussed in depth generally these modifications of plant based adsorbents resulted in significant enhancement of adsorption capacity apart from this the effect of various parameters such as adsorbent dosage initial contaminant concentration ph temperature and contact time on the adsorption efficiency have also been reviewed the regeneration of used adsorbent prevented the generation of solid waste the reading of this review

creatures in its pure state because it constitutes the majority of living tissues and the concept of life is not viable without water it plays an indispensable role in the world economy the need for pure water is continuously increasing with growing population and industrialization water contamination is a recent issue of concern for the whole world as drinking water is not accessible in many regions of the world even though 70 of the earth is covered by water a large number of inorganic and organic contaminants discharged from anthropogenic as well as natural sources have degraded the quality of water resources at a very quick rate inadequate sewage treatment chemical wastes industrial effluents petroleum refining wastes metal plating mining fertilizers and pesticides used in agricultural activities radioactive waste material etc are the main source of discharge of heavy metals and dyes mainly responsible for water pollution 1 3 world health organization who has established waste water regulations to trim down human and environmental contact to dangerous chemicals the permissible limits for fe cu cd pb zn and cr ions are 3 1 5 0 005 0 05 0 05 5 0 05 mg l respectively 4 moving on same steps the central pollution control board cbcb india has set a range of standards for the discharge of wastewater effluents into the water bodies for example biological oxygen demand bod 30 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod 250 mg l ph 5 5 to 9 0 cr 0 05 mg l cu 2 0 mg l mn 1 0 mg l and fe 3 0 mg l 4 dyes are the colouring agents with annual production of about 7 105 t and usually employed in various industries like papers plastics processing of food cosmetics textiles pharmaceutical etc 1 dyes have been classified on the basis of method of application nature of chromophores origin and solubility in water as shown in fig 1 the processing of 1 kg textile most of indian textile industries requires more than 100 l of water thus they released a vast amount of coloured wastewater in the environment that causes surface and ground water resources pollution 5 inorganic pollutants majorly include heavy metal ions like as pb cd hg cr etc which are released into water bodies from various sources such as fertilizers municipal waste pesticides mines residues and smelting industries 6 1 1 toxic effects of dyes and heavy metals according to who and unicef 2000 report approximately 70 80 of total illnesses in developing countries are caused by different water contaminants predominantly affecting women and children the various toxic effects caused by dyes and heavy metals are shown in fig 2 the presence of coloured organic compounds in water cause the decrease in penetration of sun light that may affect the photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants 8 various components of dyes like aromatics amines are mainly responsible for their toxicity 2 most of dyes are mutagenic carcinogenic or teratogenic to all living beings and affects human body by dysfunction of kidney liver reproductive system and central nervous system 9 industrial wastewater contains various heavy metals among which pb cd hg and as shows carcinogenic effects 10 these may harm central nervous system the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems and may cause skin irritations vomiting sickness respiratory disorders parkinson s disease multiple sclerosis etc 11 according to an estimate by united nations three in ten people deficit ingress to clean drinking water 1 contaminated drinking water cause many diarrhoeal deaths per year 12 only 3 of ground water is present in pure form and can be used for drinking and domestic purpose 13 the amount of various new type contaminants ever increasing in hydrological environments and the availability of pure water is shrinking continuously that s why by 2025 half of the world population will be living in drinking water deficient areas so to avoid these difficulties and toxic effects the water remediation becomes more challenging 1 1 2 techniques for wastewater treatment there are several techniques for wastewater treatment which can be classified as i physical ii chemical iii biological as shown in fig 3 along with their advantages and disadvantages numerous microorganisms fungi algae bacteria etc and enzymes have been studied by researchers for biodegradation and bioaccumulation of dyes in algae dilapidation method algae consume dye particles for self growth in enzyme degradation method extracted enzyme are used to degrade dye molecules bacillus sp enterococcus sp pseudomonas sp are some aerobic bacteria used for dye degradation it has been reported that a number of triphenylmethane dyes like magenta pararosaniline malachite green brilliant green crystal violet and ethyl violet are effectively decolorized 92 100 by the strain kurthia sp 14 some of anaerobic bacteria utilized for dye separation are escherichia coli clostridium sp 15 16 chemical techniques such as ozonation fenton reaction electrochemical destruction photochemical irradiation advanced oxidation process etc are generally used for removal of various contaminants in ultraviolet irradiation method uv light is used to break down the contaminant particles in polluted water many oxidizing agents are used to treat wastewater which completely converts the dye particles into water and carbon dioxide and the rate of oxidation can be further increased by using catalysts fenton s reagent removes soluble and insoluble contaminants from effluents but disperse and vat dyes cannot be separated by this method as it takes long process time and produces high iron sludge electrochemical destruction method uses the non soluble anodes to treat the dye wastewater chemical contaminants separation methods are commercially less effective because these are expensive energy consuming and production of poisonous secondary pollutants creates an extra discarding problem 2 there are various traditional physical contaminant removal methods such as adsorption reverse osmosis coagulation or flocculation irradiation membrane filtration ion exchange nano filtration or ultra filtration etc all of these methods require less amount of chemicals than biological or chemical contaminants removal methods 17 reverse osmosis is the pressure determined system in which water is passed through a very thin membrane that separates the contaminants on one side and water on the other side irradiation method uses the radiation to remove contaminants from contaminated water and useful at laboratory level ion exchange technique produced high quality treated water but it is effective for selected contaminants 18 among the remediation methods adsorption technique is efficient eco friendly easy to operate and cost effective 19 it can remove a number of contaminants like organic inorganic and biological substances including soluble and non soluble compounds from wastewater without producing toxic by products 20 a good adsorbent should have some significant characteristics like availability low cost non hazardous high adsorption capacity high abrasion resistance and stability in different environmental conditions 21 in order to develop an ideal adsorbent which fulfils the above criteria researchers are focussing on various low costs adsorbents especially derived from waste plant residues and trying to find out their adsorption mechanism plant based adsorbents and their composites can adsorb organic compounds and heavy metals by h bonding ion exchange complexation n Ï€ interactions etc as shown in fig 4 2 22 the adsorption mechanism depends on the properties of adsorbent and adsorbate like nature of surface functional sites on the surface interaction behaviour of adsorbing molecule ions 23 although various review articles on low cost adsorbents have been reported in past for the elimination of contaminants 9 24 27 but most of them focuses either on single contaminant or lacks in depth analysis of various modifications and their effect on adsorbent surface in this review article our aim is to present recent advances on modified plant based adsorbents for sequestration of various dyes and heavy metals from water effluents various modifications by physical chemical and composite formation and their effects on the specific surface area and porosity of adsorbent have been critically evaluated 2 modified plant based adsorbents for wastewater treatment the use of the waste plant materials derived from agricultural origin by converting them into an ideal adsorbent is an actual task in the present scenario these agricultural waste materials can be used as adsorbents for water remediation because of their short regeneration cycle effectiveness availability chemical stability environmental friendliness and low cost 28 their porous structure and large specific surface area with various functional groups make it easy to adsorb dye and heavy metal ions activated carbon produced from plant based adsorbents contains high carbon content low inorganic content 26 29 30 although the use of these plant based adsorbents in raw form or activated carbon form helps to decrease the cost of disposal of waste and provide an alternative to solve environment problems but it needs to be modified in order to increase the adsorption efficiency stability recyclability so that it can be used practically 2 1 physical modification plant based adsorbents can be modified by using different physical processes such as autoclaving cutting grinding thermal drying milling boiling carbonization steaming and these methods change particle size and adsorbent surface area 31 utilization of physically modified plant based adsorbents for heavy metal ions and dye removal are discussed in table 1 cucumis sativa peel adsorbent after grinding modification was considered as nano biosorbent due to particles of spherical shape with variable sizes from 23 to 78 nm 32 zhang et al showed that milling of sugarcane bagasse increased the surface area from 0 58 to 0 66 m2g 1 which resulted in 5 6 rise in methylene blue mb dye removal efficiency 33 moringa oleifera pod husk after grinding showed good adsorption capacity for crystal violet cv dye because of increase in the surface area and average diameter of pore 34 grinding modification of fava bean peels resulted in production of macro porous adsorbent which had surface area and pore volume of 0 2108 0 0035 m2 g and 0 00067 cm3 g respectively 35 2 2 chemical modification chemical modification of plant based adsorbents involves use of different modifying reagents like base solutions sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide mineral and organic acid hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid nitric acid tartaric acid thioglycollic acid citric acid etc and oxidizing agents these chemical modifications usually result in functional groups oxidation that are present on the surface or bring in new functional groups on biosorbent surface as shown in fig 5 which enhances chelating efficiency surface area and porosity hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate tartaric acid epichlorohydrin etc are frequently used for the chemical modification of rice husk which remove hemicellulose lignin diminish cellulose crystallinity and raise the porosity or surface area and hence results in enhancement of adsorption capacity than the unmodified rice husk 50 esterification reaction between oh of cellulose present in agriculture waste materials and acids such as citric tartaric and propanoic acids increases the number of carboxylic functional groups which enhances adsorption efficiency but modification of rice husk by esterification with tartaric acid considerably decreased the uptake of copper and lead ions because of the chelators like nitrilotriacetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 51 esterification of papaya seed increased the uptake of mb dye from 200 mg g to 250 mg g and decreased the uptake of anionic congo red dye from 71 43 mg g to 58 8 mg g because the modification generated negative charge on the adsorbent surface which attracted the cationic dyes and repelled the anionic dye 52 modified orange peel adsorbent showed 4 2 4 6 and 16 5 time greater adsorption efficiency for lead cadmium and nickel ions respectively than the untreated orange peel 53 ortho phosphoric acid treated gmelina aborea leaf powder exhibited higher performance and showed an increase in adsorption capacity from 142 86 to 1000 mg g due to the creation of several pores on surface of the powder 54 ethylenediamine modified rice hull adsorbed basic blue and reactive orange dyes from single and binary solutions with good sorption capacity as compare to natural rice hull adsorbent the adsorption capacity for basic blue and reactive orange dyes in binary solution was increased by 4 2 and 2 4 times respectively than those in single dye solutions 55 chemical modifications also affect the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent and behaviour of adsorbent towards solution ph the phpzc of the sugarcane bagasse and citric acid modified sugarcane bagasse polyethyleneimine treated and immobilized sugarcane bagasse adsorbent were 4 8 3 4 5 8 and 5 3 respectively 5 biosorption of anionic dye was favoured at ph phpzc where the surface acquired positive charge whereas biosorption of cationic dyes was favoured at ph phpzc where the surface acquired negative charge 5 various characterisation techniques like fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscope sem brunauer emmett teller bet analysis can be used to demonstrate the effect of chemical modification on the surface functional groups volume specific surface area and size of pores the ftir spectra of natural rice hull and oxalic acid modified rice hull results showed that carboxyl groups increased and there was an increase in the adsorption band corresponding to the extend vibration of the carboxyl group at 1736 cm 1 with the position of some peaks being changed after modification 56 naoh activated prunus leaves showed more value of specific surface area 426 346 m2 g which was more than the unmodified prunus leaves 67 205 m2 g naoh treatment also increased the pore volume of prunus leaves due to dissolution of lignin 57 xrd technique can be used to analyse the influence of the treatment process on the crystallinity of the cellulose since most of the chemical treatment process removes the amorphous components lignin and hemicelluloses hence results in the increased crystallinity 58 the chemical modification of wheat straw with naoh and hcl removed the hemicelluloses lignin and pectin as a result the surface of treated wheat straw was relatively wrinkled and its average diameter decreased significantly 59 some of the chemically modified adsorbents of agriculture biowaste material are given in table 2 along with their maximum adsorption capacity under optimum experimental conditions 2 3 composites of plant based adsorbents in the current scenario more attention has been given to the composites of plant based material for wastewater treatment generally the composites are made of two or more constituents who have different properties to give a composite material with integrated property set these composites have gained popularity in various fields such as constructional aeronautical vehicular biomedical industrial etc 77 composite materials usually show a significant enhancement in surface active sites pore properties catalytic degradation ability easy separation and exhibit good adsorption efficiency for different contaminants on the basis of various kinds of components the plant based composites can be divided into different categories as shown in fig 6 2 3 1 plant based metal oxide hydroxide composites nanoparticles of metal oxides have attained a lot of attention because of their metallic or semi metallic behaviour high mechanical strength high surface area high number of vacant reactive surface sites giving rise to greater adsorption capacity 78 meanwhile these particles can be applied repeatedly without diminishing the efficiency of the adsorption these nano metal oxide particles have become more effective by introducing empty voids or pores on the surface of adsorbent which raise their surface area as a result these can be used for photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants in waste water 79 81 use of amino based ligands or long chain ammonium ions has been reported to functionalise these nano metal oxides and enhance the hydrophilicity and dispensability 78 plant based adsorbents have amino and carboxylic groups which interact with these nano metal oxides to form stable composites and favour multifunctional surface adsorption some of the metal oxides are toxic while some are non toxic depending on the atomic number of the metal production process interaction or co ordination effects mechanism of action exposure genotoxicity etc metal oxides like pbo fe2o3 mn2o3 tio2 cdo coo and v2o5 are very poisonous whereas zno fe3o4 ceo2 cro3 mno2 mn2o3 sno2 zro2 and sio2 are environment friendly 82 a number of methods for the synthesis of plant based metal oxide composites such as hydrothermal wet chemical wet spinning solvothermal sol gel microwave synthesis co precipitation methods etc have been reported 78 most of the metal oxides have an agglomeration tendency because of their nanoscale size but their stability can be enhanced by incorporating it into plant residues or their biochar matrix this modification of biomass with metal oxide nanoparticles resulted in enhancement of surface area pore volume and showed good adsorption capacity in comparison to untreated one 83 various plant based metal oxide composites are given in table 3 along with their maximum adsorption capacity and most favourable conditions 2 3 2 plant based magnetic composites in adsorption process there are difficulties in separation of powdered adsorbent from aqueous solutions which generally needs centrifugation and filtration steps which limits their large scale use for water purification so these adsorbents can be converted in to magnetic material by different synthesis methods the ferromagnetic properties of magnetic plant based adsorbents facilitate their easy departure by using a magnetic field following solid phase extraction emphasising its effectiveness for recycling and reuse mostly biochar derived from various plant based materials have utilized for the production of magnetic composites and gave good results as shown in table 4 magnetic biosorbent composite have more pore size specific surface area and surface functionality as compared to their raw form which contribute to greater adsorption efficiency and easy regeneration 20 they remove water contaminants by various mechanisms like interparticle diffusion hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding etc various methods have been employed for the synthesis of plant based magnetic composites like co precipitation impregnation pyrolysis reactions in microemulsions reductive co deposition hydrothermal carbonization microwave assisted pyrolysis 98 99 solvent free mechanical mixing cross linking 100 and molten salt method 101 among these impregnation pyrolysis and co precipitation are most commonly used the impregnation pyrolysis synthesis method involves dissolution of the biomass in transition metal salts solution followed by pyrolysis under inert atmosphere 102 103 in co precipitation synthesis method the biochar derived from agriculture waste material is mixed with solution containing magnetic precursors after the addition of naoh or nh4oh solutions this is more efficient method than impregnation method but the agglomeration of synthesized nanoparticles is the main problem with this technique that occurs during washing separation and drying stages the size and shape of the synthesized nanoparticles depends upon the precursor salts their quantity used and experimental conditions such as temperature ph rate of mixing type of solvent and so forth 104 various plant based magnetic composites used for removal of dyes and heavy metal ions are given in table 4 2 3 3 plant based ldhs composites ldh are the class of nanostructure interlayer anionic clays 127 have brucite like structures recently ldhs have been widely utilized as an adsorbents to efficiently remove contaminants by physical adsorption ion exchange hydroxide precipitation electrostatic interactions and chemical bonding 127 128 the adsorption capacity of ldhs can be enhanced by making composites with biowaste materials containing oxygenated functional groups direct preparation techniques like hydrothermal co precipitation solvothermal and in situ synthesis are mainly used for the preparation of ldh composites huan wang et al reported that nickel aluminum double hydroxide and magnetic biochar composite showed high surface area of value 552 62 m2g 1 which was much higher than that of magnetic biochar 26 83 m2g 1 and the adsorption capacity for acridine dye increased to 90 as compared to magnetic biochar the average pore diameter of ldh was relatively less 6 91 nm as compared to magnetic biochar 11 93 nm 129 various plant based ldh composites used for removal of dyes and heavy metals are given in table 5 along with the optimum experimental conditions 2 3 4 plant based polymer composites polymeric adsorbents are used for various contaminants removal from waste water due to their porous structures strong binding affinities high adsorption capacity and good mechano chemical and thermal stability so more attention has been given on the use of polymer based adsorbents for removal of contaminants as an alternative to commercial activated carbon however these adsorbents have major shortcomings like difficulty in separation and regeneration polyaniline chitosan polyvinyl alcohol polyacrylamide cyclodextrin polystyrene polyurethane alginate cellulose are majorly used polymeric materials in their pure and modified form 140 various composites of plants and polymers have been reported for effective removal of contaminants from wastewater via various interactions as shown in fig 7 chitosan biopolymers are widely used adsorbents for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants due to their beneficial features like high hydrophilicity abundance in nature flexibility of the polymer chain non toxic nature chelating ability low cost presence of a large number of functional groups and antibacterial property 141 the adsorption capacity of chitosan depends on crystallinity porosity affinity for water percentage of deacetylation and the amino group content of chitosan 142 apart from these advantages chitosan has some limitations such as solubility in acidic solutions 143 low surface area 144 colloid formation in water and degradation in presence of chemicals and microbes 141 so to overcome these limitations and enhance adsorption capacity natural chitosan has been modified in several shapes membranes microspheres gel beads and films either physically or chemically 145 fe2o3 chitosan cherry kernel shell charcoal composite beads were used for the removal of cr vi ions the adsorption capacity of the composite beads was higher 47 576 mg g as compared to cherry kernel shell charcoal 14 455 mg g 106 alginate is an anionic polysaccharide consisting of abundant free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which have been utilized for encapsulation of various contaminants produced from various sources such as agriculture paper pharmaceutical chemical food and textile industry the use of alginate gel is limited due to its poor elasticity and mechanical properties 146 so in order to enhance the swelling properties of pure alginate gels various alginate and agricultural waste composites have been synthesized which can be utilized for organic and inorganic contaminant removal as shown in table 6 alginate based composites are generally synthesized by methods like ionic cross linking emulsification electrostatic complexation and self assembly 147 plant based polypyrrole composites have been used for contaminants removal because of their low cost high conductivity good environmental stability biocompatibility redox properties and ease of synthesis 4 polypyrrole coated rice husks saw dust chitin coconut coir carbon etc are the inexpensive plant based adsorbents used for efficient removal of heavy metals 4 coffee grounds waste polypyrrole composite was prepared by polymerization of pyrrole using potassium persulfate as oxidant used for removal of rhodamine b dye sem studies showed homogeneous coating of spherical nanoparticles of polypyrrole on the surface of coffee fibers 148 polyaniline is a well known conductive polymers due to the presence of nh groups 149 the presence of amine and imine active functional groups in polyaniline helps in removal of various water contaminants by making interaction with them 150 this polymer is one of the most studied polymers because of its unique features such as ease of synthesis and doping mechanical flexibility good physicochemical characteristics environmental stability and easy availability pomegranate peel powder modified by polyaniline and polypyrrole was used to remove cr vi from aqueous media the effect of various solvents and stabilizers on pomegranate peel composite was also reported and synthesis in water butanol 50 50 vol vol showed the best performance with a removal efficiency of 47 59 the sem micrographs confirmed the impregnation of much finer and ordered polypyrrole particles synthesized in water butanol on the surface of pomegranate peel according to the bet analysis the composite synthesized in water butanol showed high specific surface area 8 026 g m2 than the composites which was synthesized in other solvents 151 2 3 5 cnt and graphene based composites during last decade the use of the cnts for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants has been reported because of their excellent properties like ultra light weight high mechanical strength thermochemical stability and high specific surface area 152 these are the cylindrical tubes of graphene material showing a special sidewall curvature and possessing a Ï€ conjugated structure with a highly hydrophobic surface these can be classified as single walled carbon nanotubes and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt morphology defects and active sites of carbon nanotubes are responsible for the adsorption of the organic and inorganic contaminants chemical functionalization of cnt with various functional groups like carboxyl hydroxyl amine etc enhance their adsorption affinity and active binding sites for contaminant removal for example oxidation of mwcnts generate oxygen containing functional groups onto the surface of cnts so these increase chemical functional groups enhance the potential complexation with contaminants and also make them hydrophilic combination of the cnts with plant biomass resulted in improved adsorption properties of biowaste generally the adsorption of contaminants on cnt composites take place by hydrophobic interaction Ï€ Ï€ bonding hydrogen bonding covalent and electrostatic interactions 153 hamza et al reported that the composite of sugarcane bagasse with mwcnts was an efficient adsorbent for lead ion removal the monolayer adsorption capacity of the composite was 56 6 mg g which was two fold greater than sugarcane bagasse 23 8 mg g the presence of mwcnts improved the metal binding properties of the adsorbent as well as enhanced its mechanical strength 154 bagasse biochar and cnt composite exhibited good adsorption capacity as compare to untreated hickory biochar bagasse biochar and cnt hickory biochar composites for mb the good adsorption capacity was due to the combination of cnts with bagasse biochar which enhanced thermal stability surface area and pore volume 155 in recent years graphene based composites have been widely used for wastewater remediation due to unique features such as large surface area stability superior flexibility electronic conductivity mechanical resistivity 156 but their low hydrophilicity limits their binding with pollutant present in waste water so to achieve further advancement in adsorption application they are treated with materials containing amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups which may increase their hydrophilicity plant based adsorbents are rich in amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and can be used to form composites with graphene or its derivatives for good removal efficiency for contaminants removal from wastewater graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 composite with biochar was reported for the removal of reactive red 120 through adsorption and photocatalytic degradation the composite was prepared by one pot pyrolysis of urea and hickory chips in different ratios at 520 c characterisation of composite confirmed that the synthesis of composite introduced g c3n4 structure n containing surface functional groups reduced surface area and enhanced the thermal stability of the biochar modified biochar showed the good adsorption capacity than unmodified biochar and adsorption of dye took place by strong electrostatic attraction between n containing functional groups of g c3n4 on biochar surface and anionic dye when the urea modification ratio was increased the rate of adsorption of dye on the composites became faster indicating the importance of g c3n4 and n containing functional groups on the biochar surface to the adsorption process 157 the plant based composites with polymers and cnt and graphene used for removal of contaminants are given in table 6 3 regeneration of used adsorbents the regeneration and reusability of adsorbents are key factors for the economic feasibility of the adsorption process and the large scale industrial waste water treatment in order to retrieve unloaded biomass for reuse several mineral acids of varying concentration were investigated for eluting the adsorbed contaminants like heavy metals and dyes cationic dyes like mb cv malachite green can be desorbed from the surface of adsorbent by treatment with hcl acetone or acetonitrile etc 130 179 at low ph the surface of the adsorbent gets protonated and the excess positive charge repels the cationic dyes resulting in its desorption from the surface anionic dyes like methyl orange acid green reactive yellow drimarine yellow congo red can be desorbed by using acetone methanol naoh ethanol mixture of hcl and ethanol in different ratios 130 131 190 191 anionic dyes desorbed at high ph because the adsorbent gets deprotonated and excess negative charge repel the anionic dyes resulting in its desorption heavy metal ions like pb zn cd cu ni cr etc can be desorbed by using hcl naoh edta etc 106 107 192 193 the agriculture waste based composites used for photodegradation of dyes were generally regenerated simultaneously during uv irradiation however some researchers washed the composite with ethanol after irradiation enhanced desorption of heavy metals and dyes has also been reported by using ultrasonication 194 for example activated carbon metal organic framework composite regenerated using 0 1 m hcl ethanol eluent by the aid of ultrasonication 191 4 conclusion this review article discussed the classification of dyes toxic effects and various treatment techniques for wastewater in which adsorption technique gained more emphasis adsorption techniques using the nonconventional modified plant based adsorbents especially replace the use of expensive commercial activated carbon for the removal of toxic contaminants from water bodies and provide a green sustainable solution for treatment of contaminated water these also contribute to an overall waste minimization strategy plant based adsorbents have many functional groups which make them promising adsorbents for contaminants removal in their raw and modified form the present review focussed on the synthesis and applications of modified plant based adsorbents for the sequestration of heavy metals and dyes compared to other adsorbents plant based composites are renewable biodegradable biocompatible and economically viable modifications like physical chemical and composite fabrication resulted in increase in the uptake of contaminants by increasing number of active binding sites on the adsorbent surface among these modifications plant based composites showed more adsorption capacity due to presence of nanosized components chemical modifications were found better than physical due to incorporation of more functional groups on the surface of adsorbent various composites of plant materials have been studied in which magnetic adsorbents are very helpful to recover adsorbents and control the adsorption process adsorption capacity and parameters such as temperature dosage initial concentration of contaminants equilibrium time and ph of the solution were also reviewed although enhancement of biosorption capacity has been reported by modified adsorbents still they need careful assessment for their application with real industrial effluents this can be achieved by studying the multicomponent pollutant removal recovery and regeneration methods also eco friendly chemicals must be used for modification to avoid secondary pollution in addition to this improvement is needed for recycling the post used adsorbent in order to get rid of solid wastes apart from this the overall safety of the synthesized adsorbent must also be evaluated for example the use of nanomaterials can increase potential environmental and health

effectively decolorized 92 100 by the strain kurthia sp 14 some of anaerobic bacteria utilized for dye separation are escherichia coli clostridium sp 15 16 chemical techniques such as ozonation fenton reaction electrochemical destruction photochemical irradiation advanced oxidation process etc are generally used for removal of various contaminants in ultraviolet irradiation method uv light is used to break down the contaminant particles in polluted water many oxidizing agents are used to treat wastewater which completely converts the dye particles into water and carbon dioxide and the rate of oxidation can be further increased by using catalysts fenton s reagent removes soluble and insoluble contaminants from effluents but disperse and vat dyes cannot be separated by this method as it takes long process time and produces high iron sludge electrochemical destruction method uses the non soluble anodes to treat the dye wastewater chemical contaminants separation methods are commercially less effective because these are expensive energy consuming and production of poisonous secondary pollutants creates an extra discarding problem 2 there are various traditional physical contaminant removal methods such as adsorption reverse osmosis coagulation or flocculation irradiation membrane filtration ion exchange nano filtration or ultra filtration etc all of these methods require less amount of chemicals than biological or chemical contaminants removal methods 17 reverse osmosis is the pressure determined system in which water is passed through a very thin membrane that separates the contaminants on one side and water on the other side irradiation method uses the radiation to remove contaminants from contaminated water and useful at laboratory level ion exchange technique produced high quality treated water but it is effective for selected contaminants 18 among the remediation methods adsorption technique is efficient eco friendly easy to operate and cost effective 19 it can remove a number of contaminants like organic inorganic and biological substances including soluble and non soluble compounds from wastewater without producing toxic by products 20 a good adsorbent should have some significant characteristics like availability low cost non hazardous high adsorption capacity high abrasion resistance and stability in different environmental conditions 21 in order to develop an ideal adsorbent which fulfils the above criteria researchers are focussing on various low costs adsorbents especially derived from waste plant residues and trying to find out their adsorption mechanism plant based adsorbents and their composites can adsorb organic compounds and heavy metals by h bonding ion exchange complexation n Ï€ interactions etc as shown in fig 4 2 22 the adsorption mechanism depends on the properties of adsorbent and adsorbate like nature of surface functional sites on the surface interaction behaviour of adsorbing molecule ions 23 although various review articles on low cost adsorbents have been reported in past for the elimination of contaminants 9 24 27 but most of them focuses either on single contaminant or lacks in depth analysis of various modifications and their effect on adsorbent surface in this review article our aim is to present recent advances on modified plant based adsorbents for sequestration of various dyes and heavy metals from water effluents various modifications by physical chemical and composite formation and their effects on the specific surface area and porosity of adsorbent have been critically evaluated 2 modified plant based adsorbents for wastewater treatment the use of the waste plant materials derived from agricultural origin by converting them into an ideal adsorbent is an actual task in the present scenario these agricultural waste materials can be used as adsorbents for water remediation because of their short regeneration cycle effectiveness availability chemical stability environmental friendliness and low cost 28 their porous structure and large specific surface area with various functional groups make it easy to adsorb dye and heavy metal ions activated carbon produced from plant based adsorbents contains high carbon content low inorganic content 26 29 30 although the use of these plant based adsorbents in raw form or activated carbon form helps to decrease the cost of disposal of waste and provide an alternative to solve environment problems but it needs to be modified in order to increase the adsorption efficiency stability recyclability so that it can be used practically 2 1 physical modification plant based adsorbents can be modified by using different physical processes such as autoclaving cutting grinding thermal drying milling boiling carbonization steaming and these methods change particle size and adsorbent surface area 31 utilization of physically modified plant based adsorbents for heavy metal ions and dye removal are discussed in table 1 cucumis sativa peel adsorbent after grinding modification was considered as nano biosorbent due to particles of spherical shape with variable sizes from 23 to 78 nm 32 zhang et al showed that milling of sugarcane bagasse increased the surface area from 0 58 to 0 66 m2g 1 which resulted in 5 6 rise in methylene blue mb dye removal efficiency 33 moringa oleifera pod husk after grinding showed good adsorption capacity for crystal violet cv dye because of increase in the surface area and average diameter of pore 34 grinding modification of fava bean peels resulted in production of macro porous adsorbent which had surface area and pore volume of 0 2108 0 0035 m2 g and 0 00067 cm3 g respectively 35 2 2 chemical modification chemical modification of plant based adsorbents involves use of different modifying reagents like base solutions sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate and calcium hydroxide mineral and organic acid hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid nitric acid tartaric acid thioglycollic acid citric acid etc and oxidizing agents these chemical modifications usually result in functional groups oxidation that are present on the surface or bring in new functional groups on biosorbent surface as shown in fig 5 which enhances chelating efficiency surface area and porosity hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide sodium carbonate tartaric acid epichlorohydrin etc are frequently used for the chemical modification of rice husk which remove hemicellulose lignin diminish cellulose crystallinity and raise the porosity or surface area and hence results in enhancement of adsorption capacity than the unmodified rice husk 50 esterification reaction between oh of cellulose present in agriculture waste materials and acids such as citric tartaric and propanoic acids increases the number of carboxylic functional groups which enhances adsorption efficiency but modification of rice husk by esterification with tartaric acid considerably decreased the uptake of copper and lead ions because of the chelators like nitrilotriacetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 51 esterification of papaya seed increased the uptake of mb dye from 200 mg g to 250 mg g and decreased the uptake of anionic congo red dye from 71 43 mg g to 58 8 mg g because the modification generated negative charge on the adsorbent surface which attracted the cationic dyes and repelled the anionic dye 52 modified orange peel adsorbent showed 4 2 4 6 and 16 5 time greater adsorption efficiency for lead cadmium and nickel ions respectively than the untreated orange peel 53 ortho phosphoric acid treated gmelina aborea leaf powder exhibited higher performance and showed an increase in adsorption capacity from 142 86 to 1000 mg g due to the creation of several pores on surface of the powder 54 ethylenediamine modified rice hull adsorbed basic blue and reactive orange dyes from single and binary solutions with good sorption capacity as compare to natural rice hull adsorbent the adsorption capacity for basic blue and reactive orange dyes in binary solution was increased by 4 2 and 2 4 times respectively than those in single dye solutions 55 chemical modifications also affect the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent and behaviour of adsorbent towards solution ph the phpzc of the sugarcane bagasse and citric acid modified sugarcane bagasse polyethyleneimine treated and immobilized sugarcane bagasse adsorbent were 4 8 3 4 5 8 and 5 3 respectively 5 biosorption of anionic dye was favoured at ph phpzc where the surface acquired positive charge whereas biosorption of cationic dyes was favoured at ph phpzc where the surface acquired negative charge 5 various characterisation techniques like fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscope sem brunauer emmett teller bet analysis can be used to demonstrate the effect of chemical modification on the surface functional groups volume specific surface area and size of pores the ftir spectra of natural rice hull and oxalic acid modified rice hull results showed that carboxyl groups increased and there was an increase in the adsorption band corresponding to the extend vibration of the carboxyl group at 1736 cm 1 with the position of some peaks being changed after modification 56 naoh activated prunus leaves showed more value of specific surface area 426 346 m2 g which was more than the unmodified prunus leaves 67 205 m2 g naoh treatment also increased the pore volume of prunus leaves due to dissolution of lignin 57 xrd technique can be used to analyse the influence of the treatment process on the crystallinity of the cellulose since most of the chemical treatment process removes the amorphous components lignin and hemicelluloses hence results in the increased crystallinity 58 the chemical modification of wheat straw with naoh and hcl removed the hemicelluloses lignin and pectin as a result the surface of treated wheat straw was relatively wrinkled and its average diameter decreased significantly 59 some of the chemically modified adsorbents of agriculture biowaste material are given in table 2 along with their maximum adsorption capacity under optimum experimental conditions 2 3 composites of plant based adsorbents in the current scenario more attention has been given to the composites of plant based material for wastewater treatment generally the composites are made of two or more constituents who have different properties to give a composite material with integrated property set these composites have gained popularity in various fields such as constructional aeronautical vehicular biomedical industrial etc 77 composite materials usually show a significant enhancement in surface active sites pore properties catalytic degradation ability easy separation and exhibit good adsorption efficiency for different contaminants on the basis of various kinds of components the plant based composites can be divided into different categories as shown in fig 6 2 3 1 plant based metal oxide hydroxide composites nanoparticles of metal oxides have attained a lot of attention because of their metallic or semi metallic behaviour high mechanical strength high surface area high number of vacant reactive surface sites giving rise to greater adsorption capacity 78 meanwhile these particles can be applied repeatedly without diminishing the efficiency of the adsorption these nano metal oxide particles have become more effective by introducing empty voids or pores on the surface of adsorbent which raise their surface area as a result these can be used for photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants in waste water 79 81 use of amino based ligands or long chain ammonium ions has been reported to functionalise these nano metal oxides and enhance the hydrophilicity and dispensability 78 plant based adsorbents have amino and carboxylic groups which interact with these nano metal oxides to form stable composites and favour multifunctional surface adsorption some of the metal oxides are toxic while some are non toxic depending on the atomic number of the metal production process interaction or co ordination effects mechanism of action exposure genotoxicity etc metal oxides like pbo fe2o3 mn2o3 tio2 cdo coo and v2o5 are very poisonous whereas zno fe3o4 ceo2 cro3 mno2 mn2o3 sno2 zro2 and sio2 are environment friendly 82 a number of methods for the synthesis of plant based metal oxide composites such as hydrothermal wet chemical wet spinning solvothermal sol gel microwave synthesis co precipitation methods etc have been reported 78 most of the metal oxides have an agglomeration tendency because of their nanoscale size but their stability can be enhanced by incorporating it into plant residues or their biochar matrix this modification of biomass with metal oxide nanoparticles resulted in enhancement of surface area pore volume and showed good adsorption capacity in comparison to untreated one 83 various plant based metal oxide composites are given in table 3 along with their maximum adsorption capacity and most favourable conditions 2 3 2 plant based magnetic composites in adsorption process there are difficulties in separation of powdered adsorbent from aqueous solutions which generally needs centrifugation and filtration steps which limits their large scale use for water purification so these adsorbents can be converted in to magnetic material by different synthesis methods the ferromagnetic properties of magnetic plant based adsorbents facilitate their easy departure by using a magnetic field following solid phase extraction emphasising its effectiveness for recycling and reuse mostly biochar derived from various plant based materials have utilized for the production of magnetic composites and gave good results as shown in table 4 magnetic biosorbent composite have more pore size specific surface area and surface functionality as compared to their raw form which contribute to greater adsorption efficiency and easy regeneration 20 they remove water contaminants by various mechanisms like interparticle diffusion hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding etc various methods have been employed for the synthesis of plant based magnetic composites like co precipitation impregnation pyrolysis reactions in microemulsions reductive co deposition hydrothermal carbonization microwave assisted pyrolysis 98 99 solvent free mechanical mixing cross linking 100 and molten salt method 101 among these impregnation pyrolysis and co precipitation are most commonly used the impregnation pyrolysis synthesis method involves dissolution of the biomass in transition metal salts solution followed by pyrolysis under inert atmosphere 102 103 in co precipitation synthesis method the biochar derived from agriculture waste material is mixed with solution containing magnetic precursors after the addition of naoh or nh4oh solutions this is more efficient method than impregnation method but the agglomeration of synthesized nanoparticles is the main problem with this technique that occurs during washing separation and drying stages the size and shape of the synthesized nanoparticles depends upon the precursor salts their quantity used and experimental conditions such as temperature ph rate of mixing type of solvent and so forth 104 various plant based magnetic composites used for removal of dyes and heavy metal ions are given in table 4 2 3 3 plant based ldhs composites ldh are the class of nanostructure interlayer anionic clays 127 have brucite like structures recently ldhs have been widely utilized as an adsorbents to efficiently remove contaminants by physical adsorption ion exchange hydroxide precipitation electrostatic interactions and chemical bonding 127 128 the adsorption capacity of ldhs can be enhanced by making composites with biowaste materials containing oxygenated functional groups direct preparation techniques like hydrothermal co precipitation solvothermal and in situ synthesis are mainly used for the preparation of ldh composites huan wang et al reported that nickel aluminum double hydroxide and magnetic biochar composite showed high surface area of value 552 62 m2g 1 which was much higher than that of magnetic biochar 26 83 m2g 1 and the adsorption capacity for acridine dye increased to 90 as compared to magnetic biochar the average pore diameter of ldh was relatively less 6 91 nm as compared to magnetic biochar 11 93 nm 129 various plant based ldh composites used for removal of dyes and heavy metals are given in table 5 along with the optimum experimental conditions 2 3 4 plant based polymer composites polymeric adsorbents are used for various contaminants removal from waste water due to their porous structures strong binding affinities high adsorption capacity and good mechano chemical and thermal stability so more attention has been given on the use of polymer based adsorbents for removal of contaminants as an alternative to commercial activated carbon however these adsorbents have major shortcomings like difficulty in separation and regeneration polyaniline chitosan polyvinyl alcohol polyacrylamide cyclodextrin polystyrene polyurethane alginate cellulose are majorly used polymeric materials in their pure and modified form 140 various composites of plants and polymers have been reported for effective removal of contaminants from wastewater via various interactions as shown in fig 7 chitosan biopolymers are widely used adsorbents for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants due to their beneficial features like high hydrophilicity abundance in nature flexibility of the polymer chain non toxic nature chelating ability low cost presence of a large number of functional groups and antibacterial property 141 the adsorption capacity of chitosan depends on crystallinity porosity affinity for water percentage of deacetylation and the amino group content of chitosan 142 apart from these advantages chitosan has some limitations such as solubility in acidic solutions 143 low surface area 144 colloid formation in water and degradation in presence of chemicals and microbes 141 so to overcome these limitations and enhance adsorption capacity natural chitosan has been modified in several shapes membranes microspheres gel beads and films either physically or chemically 145 fe2o3 chitosan cherry kernel shell charcoal composite beads were used for the removal of cr vi ions the adsorption capacity of the composite beads was higher 47 576 mg g as compared to cherry kernel shell charcoal 14 455 mg g 106 alginate is an anionic polysaccharide consisting of abundant free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups which have been utilized for encapsulation of various contaminants produced from various sources such as agriculture paper pharmaceutical chemical food and textile industry the use of alginate gel is limited due to its poor elasticity and mechanical properties 146 so in order to enhance the swelling properties of pure alginate gels various alginate and agricultural waste composites have been synthesized which can be utilized for organic and inorganic contaminant removal as shown in table 6 alginate based composites are generally synthesized by methods like ionic cross linking emulsification electrostatic complexation and self assembly 147 plant based polypyrrole composites have been used for contaminants removal because of their low cost high conductivity good environmental stability biocompatibility redox properties and ease of synthesis 4 polypyrrole coated rice husks saw dust chitin coconut coir carbon etc are the inexpensive plant based adsorbents used for efficient removal of heavy metals 4 coffee grounds waste polypyrrole composite was prepared by polymerization of pyrrole using potassium persulfate as oxidant used for removal of rhodamine b dye sem studies showed homogeneous coating of spherical nanoparticles of polypyrrole on the surface of coffee fibers 148 polyaniline is a well known conductive polymers due to the presence of nh groups 149 the presence of amine and imine active functional groups in polyaniline helps in removal of various water contaminants by making interaction with them 150 this polymer is one of the most studied polymers because of its unique features such as ease of synthesis and doping mechanical flexibility good physicochemical characteristics environmental stability and easy availability pomegranate peel powder modified by polyaniline and polypyrrole was used to remove cr vi from aqueous media the effect of various solvents and stabilizers on pomegranate peel composite was also reported and synthesis in water butanol 50 50 vol vol showed the best performance with a removal efficiency of 47 59 the sem micrographs confirmed the impregnation of much finer and ordered polypyrrole particles synthesized in water butanol on the surface of pomegranate peel according to the bet analysis the composite synthesized in water butanol showed high specific surface area 8 026 g m2 than the composites which was synthesized in other solvents 151 2 3 5 cnt and graphene based composites during last decade the use of the cnts for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants has been reported because of their excellent properties like ultra light weight high mechanical strength thermochemical stability and high specific surface area 152 these are the cylindrical tubes of graphene material showing a special sidewall curvature and possessing a Ï€ conjugated structure with a highly hydrophobic surface these can be classified as single walled carbon nanotubes and multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt morphology defects and active sites of carbon nanotubes are responsible for the adsorption of the organic and inorganic contaminants chemical functionalization of cnt with various functional groups like carboxyl hydroxyl amine etc enhance their adsorption affinity and active binding sites for contaminant removal for example oxidation of mwcnts generate oxygen containing functional groups onto the surface of cnts so these increase chemical functional groups enhance the potential complexation with contaminants and also make them hydrophilic combination of the cnts with plant biomass resulted in improved adsorption properties of biowaste generally the adsorption of contaminants on cnt composites take place by hydrophobic interaction Ï€ Ï€ bonding hydrogen bonding covalent and electrostatic interactions 153 hamza et al reported that the composite of sugarcane bagasse with mwcnts was an efficient adsorbent for lead ion removal the monolayer adsorption capacity of the composite was 56 6 mg g which was two fold greater than sugarcane bagasse 23 8 mg g the presence of mwcnts improved the metal binding properties of the adsorbent as well as enhanced its mechanical strength 154 bagasse biochar and cnt composite exhibited good adsorption capacity as compare to untreated hickory biochar bagasse biochar and cnt hickory biochar composites for mb the good adsorption capacity was due to the combination of cnts with bagasse biochar which enhanced thermal stability surface area and pore volume 155 in recent years graphene based composites have been widely used for wastewater remediation due to unique features such as large surface area stability superior flexibility electronic conductivity mechanical resistivity 156 but their low hydrophilicity limits their binding with pollutant present in waste water so to achieve further advancement in adsorption application they are treated with materials containing amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups which may increase their hydrophilicity plant based adsorbents are rich in amino carboxyl and hydroxyl groups and can be used to form composites with graphene or its derivatives for good removal efficiency for contaminants removal from wastewater graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 composite with biochar was reported for the removal of reactive red 120 through adsorption and photocatalytic degradation the composite was prepared by one pot pyrolysis of urea and hickory chips in different ratios at 520 c characterisation of composite confirmed that the synthesis of composite introduced g c3n4 structure n containing surface functional groups reduced surface area and enhanced the thermal stability of the biochar modified biochar showed the good adsorption capacity than unmodified biochar and adsorption of dye took place by strong electrostatic attraction between n containing functional groups of g c3n4 on biochar surface and anionic dye when the urea modification ratio was increased the rate of adsorption of dye on the composites became faster indicating the importance of g c3n4 and n containing functional groups on the biochar surface to the adsorption process 157 the plant based composites with polymers and cnt and graphene used for removal of contaminants are given in table 6 3 regeneration of used adsorbents the regeneration and reusability of adsorbents are key factors for the economic feasibility of the adsorption process and the large scale industrial waste water treatment in order to retrieve unloaded biomass for reuse several mineral acids of varying concentration were investigated for eluting the adsorbed contaminants like heavy metals and dyes cationic dyes like mb cv malachite green can be desorbed from the surface of adsorbent by treatment with hcl acetone or acetonitrile etc 130 179 at low ph the surface of the adsorbent gets protonated and the excess positive charge repels the cationic dyes resulting in its desorption from the surface anionic dyes like methyl orange acid green reactive yellow drimarine yellow congo red can be desorbed by using acetone methanol naoh ethanol mixture of hcl and ethanol in different ratios 130 131 190 191 anionic dyes desorbed at high ph because the adsorbent gets deprotonated and excess negative charge repel the anionic dyes resulting in its desorption heavy metal ions like pb zn cd cu ni cr etc can be desorbed by using hcl naoh edta etc 106 107 192 193 the agriculture waste based composites used for photodegradation of dyes were generally regenerated simultaneously during uv irradiation however some researchers washed the composite with ethanol after irradiation enhanced desorption of heavy metals and dyes has also been reported by using ultrasonication 194 for example activated carbon metal organic framework composite regenerated using 0 1 m hcl ethanol eluent by the aid of ultrasonication 191 4 conclusion this review article discussed the classification of dyes toxic effects and various treatment techniques for wastewater in which adsorption technique gained more emphasis adsorption techniques using the nonconventional modified plant based adsorbents especially replace the use of expensive commercial activated carbon for the removal of toxic contaminants from water bodies and provide a green sustainable solution for treatment of contaminated water these also contribute to an overall waste minimization strategy plant based adsorbents have many functional groups which make them promising adsorbents for contaminants removal in their raw and modified form the present review focussed on the synthesis and applications of modified plant based adsorbents for the sequestration of heavy metals and dyes compared to other adsorbents plant based composites are renewable biodegradable biocompatible and economically viable modifications like physical chemical and composite fabrication resulted in increase in the uptake of contaminants by increasing number of active binding sites on the adsorbent surface among these modifications plant based composites showed more adsorption capacity due to presence of nanosized components chemical modifications were found better than physical due to incorporation of more functional groups on the surface of adsorbent various composites of plant materials have been studied in which magnetic adsorbents are very helpful to recover adsorbents and control the adsorption process adsorption capacity and parameters such as temperature dosage initial concentration of contaminants equilibrium time and ph of the solution were also reviewed although enhancement of biosorption capacity has been reported by modified adsorbents still they need careful assessment for their application with real industrial effluents this can be achieved by studying the multicomponent pollutant removal recovery and regeneration methods also eco friendly chemicals must be used for modification to avoid secondary pollution in addition to this improvement is needed for recycling the post used adsorbent in order to get rid of solid wastes apart from this the overall safety of the synthesized adsorbent must also be evaluated for example the use of nanomaterials can increase potential environmental and health

13461,the rain garden is a low impact development design for stormwater management nitrate was difficult to be removed in conventional rapid filtration rain garden and sometimes even with net nitrogen release resulting in the potential nitrous oxide n2o emission this study aimed to compare the conventional rapid filtration rain garden con and modified rain garden with internal water storage iws in terms of the nitrogen removal n2o emission and the bacterial community composition two lab scale rain gardens con and iws were designed and studied in simulated rainfall experiments the iws design showed an advantage over con in nitrogen removal with the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency of 91 3 91 4 compared to 18 0 53 7 in con for n2o emission iws exhibited a lower emission potential of 0 2 0 3 of tn removed with emission rate of 0 41 0 74 mg n2o n m2 h compared to 0 2 0 7 of tn removed in con with emission rate of 0 24 0 29 mg n2o n m2 h phyla of actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria dominating in both iws and con a significant difference of microbial composition was found at the genus level especially the potential denitrifiers including candidatus solibacter haliangium hyphomicrobium lentimicrobium and terrimonas the different abundance of these functional denitrifiers in iws and con may contribute to their different nitrogen removal efficiency and n2o emission potential this study highlighted that rain garden with iws as an optimal option for enhancing nitrogen removal and mitigating n2o emission from stormwater systems graphical abstract two lab scale rain gardens one was conventional rapid filtration rain garden labelled as con the other was modified with internal water storage labelled as iws were studied on the nutrient management n2o emission and the bacterial community composition iws exhibited advantages over con in terms of n removal and n2o emission different functional denitrifiers enriched in iws and con contributed to different n removal unlabelled image keywords greenhouse gas low impact design microbial community nitrogen removal rain garden stormwater 1 introduction non point source pollution caused by urban stormwater runoff is receiving increasing attention with the acceleration of urbanization and the gradual control of point source pollution 1 a rain garden known as bioretention or biofilter is one of the typical low impact development lid designs to manage stormwater and improve water quality the first flush of stormwater runoff containing contaminants washed off impervious surfaces is collected and filtered through the rain garden 2 3 in a conventional rain garden most pollutants were effectively removed e g heavy metals oil grease organic carbon pathogens particulate matter and other contaminants 4 5 whereas the removal efficiencies of nitrite nitrate no2 no3 650 to 85 and total nitrogen tn 312 to 58 6 were limited sometimes even with net nitrogen release 3 7 8 urban stormwater runoff contains different forms of nutrients such as ammonium nh4 no2 no3 particulate or dissolved organic nitrogen pon or don orthophosphate po4 and total phosphorus tp 9 10 excess discharge of nutrients mainly flushed out from impermeable surfaces or fertilized greenbelts contributes to the eutrophication of receiving water bodies 10 11 nitrogen n can be removed through a series of microbial activities in the rain garden mineralization of organic n to nh4 nitrification of nh4 to no2 by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and then to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrification of no2 no3 to n2 nh4 can be adsorbed on negatively charged soil particles and separated from the rain garden effluent while no2 no3 tends to be released during discharge 12 13 n can only be completely removed from stormwater runoff through denitrified to n2 and released to the atmosphere 14 16 provision of a sustained anoxic environment in the rain garden achieved by elevating the outlet to produce internal water storage iws and adding a sustained release carbon source woodchips cane trash or other material enhanced the n removal efficiency via denitrification 17 19 a higher proportion of denitrification genes was observed in the soil dna metagenome of wet basins than that in dry basins the denitrifier community abundance was correlated with the soil moisture 14 studies on the contribution of denitrification to the n removal efficiency of rain gardens are limited 16 20 nitrous oxide n2o a typical greenhouse gas with a global warming potential around 300 times that of co2 21 22 can be released during the n removal process in rain gardens as a byproduct of nitrification and an intermediate of denitrification 9 16 norton et al 16 reported that denitrification was not the dominant process involved in n removal of a bioretention swale mesocosm in which oxygen remained near saturated and n2o emission was negligible 18 2 4 48 Î¼g n m2 day many studies found that denitrification occurred in rain gardens with iws resulting in relative higher n2o emission 9 14 23 however significant gaps exist in understanding the difference of n2o emission from conventional rain gardens and rain gardens with iws the quantification and investigation of n2o emission potential especially taking into consideration the microbial community composition is required to better understand the process of n removal in rain gardens the objective of this study is to compare the nutrient removal performance especially for n removal and n2o emission potential between rain gardens with or without internal water storage the microbial communities of soil microbe in each rain garden were investigated to better under the potential microorganism response for nitrogen removal and n2o emission 2 materials and methods 2 1 design and operation two parallel lab scale rain gardens were constructed in this study one was a conventional rapid filtration rain garden con and the other was modified with an internal water storage layer by elevating the outlet iws a schematic and picture of rain gardens were shown in fig 1 the columns

biochar v v and 5 10 cm crumb of pine bark on the surface to protect plants the different layers were separated by black permeable geotextiles to prevent mixing of different media the overflow was set 15 cm above the top of the pine crumb layer at the bottom of the gravel layer a perforated pipe with a diameter of 20 mm was settled for drainage and sampling the outlet of iws was elevated 30 cm higher than the perforated drain pipe to generate a water saturated zone before the experiment lawn grass zoysia matrella a kind of typical urban greening plant and commonly used in road greenbelt was seeded on the top layer of the soil and then irrigated every day until the establishment of turf and roots excess grass was trimmed and removed 2 2 simulated rainfall experiments synthetic stormwater

simulated rainfall event 2300 ml of synthetic stormwater equal to 60 min of 5 mm rainfall with runoff coefficient of 0 9 for concrete pavement was poured into the column effluent was sampled at increasing time intervals as the experiment proceeding 30 min for the first 2 h 60 min for the second 2 h and 120 min for the last 2 h resulting in 8 samples including influent sample for each

sulfone pes syringe driven filter 25 mm 0 22 Î¼m for detection all samples filtered and unfiltered were stored using centrifuge tubes at 4 c and detected in 24 h after water infiltration a plastic column with a diameter of 7 1 cm and a static chamber of 300 ml was pressed into the surface of the rain garden soil to avoid gas leakage gas emission from the rain garden was trapped in the chamber and sampled using syringe at increasing time intervals as above gas samples were stored in vacuum glass bottles immediately and analyzed as soon as possible tap water was used in the preparation of synthetic stormwater runoff in order to study the background value same experiments were carried out with tap water instead of synthetic stormwater runoff in order to check the nutrient removal

files were deposited to the ncbi databases with bioproject id prjna666491 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal rain gardens of iws and con both exhibited great nh4 n removal performance with removal efficiencies of 81 1 4 2 3 add and 86 4 1 7 7 add for iws and 87 4 1 0 3 add and 78 7 6 6 7dd for con table 1 respectively when compared with con fig 3d and f no2 n accumulation of iws was significantly lower no matter on 3 add p 0 01 or 7 add p 0 05 con achieved no2 n accumulation at 0 42 mg l 3 add and 0 73 mg l 7 add higher than that in iws 0 1 mg l this observation was consistent with morse et al 14 that the denitrification capacities via no2 n in conventional rapid filtration rain garden were relatively lower than that in a water saturated rain garden no2 n accumulation was likely caused by nob washed out for a short hydraulic retention time hrt or no2 n reductase inhibition under aerobic conditions 12 from figs 2 and 3 no3 n accumulation in iws 0 22 0 06 mg l and 0 41 0 03 mg l was significantly lower than that in con 11 37 0 61 mg l and 6 63 0 85 mg l on 3 add p 0 01 and 7 add p 0 01 respectively from results of control experiments the background of no3 n in the rain garden layer contents contributed greatly to the high concentration of no3 n in con with the proportion of 27 2 3 0 3 add and 77 8 4 9 7 add in contrast the concentrations of no3 n in the control experiments of iws were significantly lower than that in con p 0 01 which was consistent with the results of simulated rainfall experiments a previous study also reported that 58 of incoming dissolved inorganic n din was denitrified within a wet stormwater detention basin while only 1 was denitrified in a dry basin 14 in addition the iws design can reduce the stress that plants might undergo during the dry season and therefore promote greater plant growth and nutrient uptake 30 in the present study tn removal efficiencies in iws achieved at 91 4 1 2 3 add and 91 3 0 5 7 add compared with 18 0 2 3 3 add and 53 7 5 0 7 add in con accordingly which supported the advantage of iws in nitrogen removal for 3 and 7 add nutrient removal efficiencies of iws showed no significant difference table 1 p 0 05 as for con the removal efficiencies of nh4 n tp and cod showed no significant difference p 0 05 however serious net release of no3 n occurred in con under 3 add which resulted in lower tn removal efficiency of 18 0 2 3 than result of 53 7 5 0 under 7 add p 0 05 it was reported that the highest denitrification rates were obtained under storm frequency of 7 days relative to 1 or 13 days in a bioretention swale mesocosm 16 in this study the removal of nh4 n exhibited no significant relation with the length of add which was consistent with afrooz and boehm 17 however in hatt et al 13 positive correlation between nh4 n removal efficiency and the length of dry periods was observed which might be related to the suitable conditions for nitrification with longer dry periods from results of tests with real stormwater runoff table 2 the net release of no3 n in con resulted in significantly lower tn removal efficiency 149 2 41 5 than that in iws 81 0 3 0 p 0 01 results of real stormwater runoff tests were in accordance with the synthetic stormwater runoff which also showed the advantage of iws over con in terms of n removal figs s1 s2 it was found that tn removal efficiency increased with saturation time in a biofilter treating real stormwater runoff and the integration with a water saturated zone of at least 75 cm was favorable for tn removal 31 zhang et al 30 reported that nitrogen removal of stormwater biofilter with water saturated zone could be promoted by increased denitrification and plant growth from fig s3 real stormwater runoff collected in this study contained 0 53 0 02 g l ss while iws and con both exhibited great ss removal capacity with removal efficiencies of 97 9 0 2 and 99 6 0 1 table 2 respectively the filtration of ss could result in the decrease of drainage speed as for the blocking caused by ss both iws and con showed great capacity for tp removal with removal efficiencies of 94 9 4 6 3 add and 99 2 0 0 7 add in iws and 99 0 0 6 3 add and 99 1 0 8 7 add in con for removal of cod rain garden of con showed a slight advantage over iws table 1 with the corresponding removal efficiencies of 79 3 7 2 3 add and 68 2 1 9 7 add in iws compared to 85 5 3 8 3 add and 79 6 3 7 7 add in con 3 2 n2o emission n2o emissions in the simulated rainfall events of synthetic stormwater runoff were monitored and analyzed in fig 4 with the comparation of tap water accompany with the higher nitrogen removal efficiency of iws the lower n2o emission ratios were observed 0 34 0 16 and 0 19 0 02 of tn removed under 3 and 7 add respectively in comparison with con 0 72 0 27 and 0 19 0 02 of tn removed under add of 3 days and 7 days respectively even though the relative higher n2o emission rates were observed in iws 0 74 0 35 and 0 41 0 03 mg n2o n m2 h than that in con 0 29 0 07 and 0 24 0 01 mg n2o n m2 h under both 3 add fig 4a and 7 add fig 4b the n2o emission potential of iws was still reduced because of its higher nitrogen removal capacity these results were consistent with the previous study that a stormwater biofilter with saturated zone reduce the potential n2o release from the effluent 9 n2o emissions from both iws and con under 3 add were always higher than that under 7 add which was probably related to the high soil moisture under short add 14 the n2o emission rates 0 24 0 74 mg n2o n m2 h or 2 10 6 48 g n2o m2 yr presented in this study were comparable with values obtained from stormwater biofilters 0 09 and 0 23 mg n2o n m2 h 32 1 1 mg n2o n m2 h 23 a rain fed maize field 0 22 mg n2o n m2 h talmo 2019 and grazed pastures 0 024 3 33 mg n2o n m2 h 33 34 and were higher compare to known n2o data from stormwater detention basin 0 03 mg n2o n m2 h 14 4 4 12 0 Î¼g n2o n m2 h 35 and agricultural soils crops system 1 5 61 Î¼g of n2o n m2 h 36 n2o emission rates of tap water for iws blank iws were 0 04 0 01 mg n2o n m2 h 3 add and 0 12 0 06 mg n2o n m2 h 7 add which were both lower p 0 05 than that for synthetic stormwater runoff 0 74 0 35 and 0 41 0 03 mg n2o n m2 h under 3 and 7 add respectively fig 4 for con there was no significant difference p 0 05 for n2o emission rates of tap water blank con 0 22 0 04 and 0 15 0 04 mg n2o n m2 h under 3 and 7 add respectively when compared with results of synthetic stormwater runoff 0 29 0 07 and 0 24 0 01 mg n2o n m2 h indicating the important role of n released from the filter media to n2o emissions of con the n2o emission of real stormwater runoff under 3 add was shown in fig s4 n2o emission rates for iws and con were 4 70 1 30 and 0 90 0 09 mg n2o n m2 h respectively which were both higher than that of the synthetic stormwater runoff tests 0 74 0 35 and 0 29 0 07 mg n2o n m2 h for iws and con respectively the n2o emission ratio of iws was 1 85 0 86 compared with 0 34 0 16 for synthetic stormwater runoff respectively as for con substantial net release of n occurred which resulted in a great risk of n2o emission from the effluent the high n2o emission rate when treating real stormwater runoff was presumed to be related to the blocking caused by particulate matter 37 which caused slow filtering rate long hrt and more n2o emission from the enhanced denitrification therefore to extend the lifespan of rain gardens and mitigate the emission potential of n2o pretreatment to remove particulate matter is recommended 3 3 microbial communities to further investigate the impact of different designs on nitrogen management the microbial community composition in soil from iws and con treatments was analyzed composition of the microbial community at genus and phylum levels and principal coordinates analysis pcoa at genus level were shown in fig 5 with effective sequencing reads of 55 876 per sample shannon index values of iws were relatively lower than that of con with the values of 9 72 9 66 9 78 and 7 81 for samples iws 1 4 and 9 83 9 58 9 67 and 8 90 for samples con 1 4 respectively it is worth noting that the value of iws 4 sample from the water saturated layer of iws was the lowest these results indicated that the microbial diversity decreased with filling depth and the water saturated anoxic environment harbored the least species of microorganism there was substantial difference in the microbial community composition of iwa 4 and con 4 indicated by the analysis of heatmap based on the relative abundance at genus level fig 5a weighted unifrac distance at the phylum level fig 5b and pcoa on microbial composition at the genus level fig 5c specifically iws 4 and con 4 were clearly separated by pcoa where 44 19 pco1 and 20 39 pco2 of the variations could be explained between different samples fig 5c however for samples taken from the intermediate filling depths i e iws 2 iws 3 con 2 and con 3 the microbial community composition exhibited few differences heatmap revealed that relative abundance of genera among various samples could be clustered into three clusters fig 5a the dominant genera were bradyrihizobium haliangium hyphomicrobium etc in cluster 1 a clearly different microbial community was observed in iws 4 with the most abundant genera of lentimicrobium methanosarcina unidentified ruminococcacese etc in cluster 2 significant higher abundance of candidatus solibacter 1 5 p 0 05 haliangium 2 9 p 0 05 lentimicrobium 0 6 p 0 01 methanosarcina 1 1 p 0 01 and rhizomicrobium 0 9 p 0 01 was observed in iws by contrast hyphomicrobium 2 0 p 0 01 pedomicrobium 2 2 p 0 05 and terrimonas 1 4 p 0 01 showed significant higher abundance in con the different performance of nitrogen removal and n2o emission was probably caused by the potential different functions of these genera for example most of these genera including candidatus solibacter 38 hyphomicrobium 39 haliangium 40 lentimicrobium 41 and terrimonas 42 were identified as denitrifiers methanosarcina was found to perform simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis in the denitrifying reactor 43 their functions may vary under different circumstances hyphomicrobium has been characterized as complete denitrifiers capable of reducing both nitrate and nitrite to n2 especially using methanol 39 haliangium possesses partial denitrification activities only capable of reducing nitrite to n2o or n2 using amino acids under anaerobic conditions 40 from our previous result genus of terrimonas was found dominant in a wastewater treatment process treating synthetic domestic wastewater 42 terrimonas was identified as denitrifying microbe capable of producing n2o through partial denitrification in a simultaneous partial nitrification anammox and denitrification process 44 which was also found existed in rhizosphere soil 45 the significantly higher abundance of terrimonas in con 1 4 of taxa in con compared to 0 4 in iws p 0 01 might account for the higher n2o emission potential than iws additionally candidatus solibacter and rhizomicrobium were frequently detected in grasslands forests and soil plant systems 46 47 may response for nitrification 38 48 leading to different nh4 n removal performance and n2o emission during nitrification together these results suggest that the variation in bacterial community composition driven by a different design contribute to differences in key microbial community functions such as carbon and nitrogen management including nitrification and denitrification leading to different nutrient removal performance and n2o emission the predominant phyla were actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteri accounting for 78 3 and 85 2 of the total taxa in iws and con respectively fig 5b the main phyla distributed in iws and con were in accordance with a previous study of the microbial diversity of bioretention systems 49 actinobacterial nitrate reducers and nirs type and nosz harboring proteobacterial denitrifiers were recognized as important players regulating n2o emission in palsa peats 50 and also wastewater treatment process 51 presumably the lower abundance of actinobacteria and proteobacteria might probably be the cause of lower n2o emission potential of iws over con furthermore the abundance of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes was closely correlated with soil nutrients such as organic matter tn tp and available p 52 bacteroidetes was widely distributed in various environments and capable of degrading high molecular weight organic matter i e polysaccharides and proteins 53 54 this phylum had high abundance in iws 4 14 6 probably because of the degradation of sustained release organic matter 3 4 potential implication of this study according to n cycling in the nature and the research of payne et al 9 the probable n removal processes of iws and con were drawn in fig 6 a and b respectively for conventional rain garden of con the upper layer was of sufficient oxygen permeated from the atmosphere where nh4 n could be oxidized to hydroxylamine and nitrite in sequence by aob and then nitrite was nitrified to nitrate by nob in the process of hydroxylamine oxidation n2o may be generated as intermediate product and released under high do concentration and aob activities 55 56 under limited do concentration aob could denitrify nitrite to n2o accompanied with the oxidation of nh4 n 57 59 to improve n removal of con an internal water storage iws layer was introduced to the bottom layer and generated anoxic environment for denitrification where no3 n could be subsequently denitrified to nitrite n2o and n2 60 previous studies have demonstrated that biofilters with a water saturation zone performed better in terms of no3 n removal than those without a saturation zone 17 61 this study provided more detail on the microbial community supporting this conclusion the significant different composition of functional denitrifiers in iws compare to con e g microorganisms from genera haliangium methanosarcina lentimicrobium etc indicated that the introduction of water saturated layer in iws was beneficial to enrich denitrifiers however under inadequate anoxic conditions or carbon source insufficient denitrification would occur with n2o as the final product 56 from this study compared with the high net release of no3 in con iws exhibited an obvious advantage in terms of n removal and the n2o emission potential of iws was also lower than that of con furthermore iws design had comparable n2o emission rates with known n2o data in ecosystem suggesting its application would not bring the issue of n2o emission 4 conclusion the rain garden with internal water storage iws layer exhibited significantly higher nitrogen removal efficiency and lower n2o emission potential over the conventional rapid filtration rain garden con net release of n from con exerted great risk of n2o emission from the effluent the different distribution features of functional denitrifiers in iws and con such as candidatus solibacter hyphomicrobium haliangium lentimicrobium and terrimonas accounted for the different n removal efficiency and n2o emission potential in consideration of the enhancement of n removal and the mitigation of n2o emission potential the rain garden

13461,the rain garden is a low impact development design for stormwater management nitrate was difficult to be removed in conventional rapid filtration rain garden and sometimes even with net nitrogen release resulting in the potential nitrous oxide n2o emission this study aimed to compare the conventional rapid filtration rain garden con and modified rain garden with internal water storage iws in terms of the nitrogen removal n2o emission and the bacterial community composition two lab scale rain gardens con and iws were designed and studied in simulated rainfall experiments the iws design showed an advantage over con in nitrogen removal with the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency of 91 3 91 4 compared to 18 0 53 7 in con for n2o emission iws exhibited a lower emission potential of 0 2 0 3 of tn removed with emission rate of 0 41 0 74 mg n2o n m2 h compared to 0 2 0 7 of tn removed in con with emission rate of 0 24 0 29 mg n2o n m2 h phyla of actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria dominating in both iws and con a significant difference of microbial composition was found at the genus level especially the potential denitrifiers including candidatus solibacter haliangium hyphomicrobium lentimicrobium and terrimonas the different abundance of these functional denitrifiers in iws and con may contribute to their different nitrogen removal efficiency and n2o emission potential this study highlighted that rain garden with iws as an optimal option for enhancing nitrogen removal and mitigating n2o emission from stormwater systems graphical abstract two lab scale rain gardens one was conventional rapid filtration rain garden labelled as con the other was modified with internal water storage labelled as iws were studied on the nutrient management n2o emission and the bacterial community composition iws exhibited advantages over con in terms of n removal and n2o emission different functional denitrifiers enriched in iws and con contributed to different n removal unlabelled image keywords greenhouse gas low impact design microbial community nitrogen removal rain garden stormwater 1 introduction non point source pollution caused by urban stormwater runoff is receiving increasing attention with the acceleration of urbanization and the gradual control of point source pollution 1 a rain garden known as bioretention or biofilter is one of the typical low impact development lid designs to manage stormwater and improve water quality the first flush of stormwater runoff containing contaminants washed off impervious surfaces is collected and filtered through the rain garden 2 3 in a conventional rain garden most pollutants were effectively removed e g heavy metals oil grease organic carbon pathogens particulate matter and other contaminants 4 5 whereas the removal efficiencies of nitrite nitrate no2 no3 650 to 85 and total nitrogen tn 312 to 58 6 were limited sometimes even with net nitrogen release 3 7 8 urban stormwater runoff contains different forms of nutrients such as ammonium nh4 no2 no3 particulate or dissolved organic nitrogen pon or don orthophosphate po4 and total phosphorus tp 9 10 excess discharge of nutrients mainly flushed out from impermeable surfaces or fertilized greenbelts contributes to the eutrophication of receiving water bodies 10 11 nitrogen n can be removed through a series of microbial activities in the rain garden mineralization of organic n to nh4 nitrification of nh4 to no2 by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and then to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrification of no2 no3 to n2 nh4 can be adsorbed on negatively charged soil particles and separated from the rain garden effluent while no2 no3 tends to be released during discharge 12 13 n can only be completely removed from stormwater runoff through denitrified to n2 and released to the atmosphere 14 16 provision of a sustained anoxic environment in the rain garden achieved by elevating the outlet to produce internal water storage iws and adding a sustained release carbon source woodchips cane trash or other material enhanced the n removal efficiency via denitrification 17 19 a higher proportion of denitrification genes was observed in the soil dna metagenome of wet basins than that in dry basins the denitrifier community abundance was correlated with the soil moisture 14 studies on the contribution of denitrification to the n removal efficiency of rain gardens are limited 16 20 nitrous oxide n2o a typical greenhouse gas with a global warming potential around 300 times that of co2 21 22 can be released during the n removal process in rain gardens as a byproduct of nitrification and an intermediate of denitrification 9 16 norton et al 16 reported that denitrification was not the dominant process involved in n removal of a bioretention swale mesocosm in which oxygen remained near saturated and n2o emission was negligible 18 2 4 48 Î¼g n m2 day many studies found that denitrification occurred in rain gardens with iws resulting in relative higher n2o emission 9 14 23 however significant gaps exist in understanding the difference of n2o emission from conventional rain gardens and rain gardens with iws the quantification and investigation of n2o emission potential especially taking into consideration the microbial community composition is required to better understand the process of n removal in rain gardens the objective of this study is to compare the nutrient removal performance especially for n removal and n2o emission potential between rain gardens with or without internal water storage the microbial communities of soil microbe in each rain garden were investigated to better under the potential microorganism response for nitrogen removal and n2o emission 2 materials and methods 2 1 design and operation two parallel lab scale rain gardens were constructed in this study one was a conventional rapid filtration rain garden con and the other was modified with an internal water storage layer by elevating the outlet iws a schematic and picture of rain gardens were shown in fig 1 the columns used in this study were transparent perspex height radius 100 cm 18 cm both the con and iws rain gardens were filled with four layers of different filter media which were from bottom to top 10 cm

biochar v v and 5 10 cm crumb of pine bark on the surface to protect plants the different layers were separated by black permeable geotextiles to prevent mixing of different media the overflow was set 15 cm above the top of the pine crumb layer at the bottom of the gravel layer a perforated pipe with a diameter of 20 mm was settled for drainage and sampling the outlet of iws was elevated 30 cm higher than the perforated drain pipe to generate a water saturated zone before the experiment lawn grass zoysia matrella a kind of typical urban greening plant and commonly used in road greenbelt was seeded on the top layer of the soil and then irrigated every day until the establishment of turf and roots excess grass was trimmed and removed 2 2 simulated rainfall experiments synthetic stormwater

detailed composition of concentrated trace elements is presented in smolders et al 25 the antecedent dry days add between two simulated rainfall events were 3 or 7 days at the beginning of each simulated rainfall event 2300 ml of synthetic stormwater equal to 60 min of 5 mm rainfall with runoff coefficient of 0 9 for concrete pavement was poured into the column effluent was sampled at increasing time intervals as the experiment proceeding 30 min for the first 2 h 60 min for the second 2 h and 120 min for the last 2 h resulting in 8 samples including influent sample for each

with morse et al 14 that the denitrification capacities via no2 n in conventional rapid filtration rain garden were relatively lower than that in a water saturated rain garden no2 n accumulation was likely caused by nob washed out for a short hydraulic retention time hrt or no2 n reductase inhibition under aerobic conditions 12 from figs 2 and 3 no3 n accumulation in iws 0 22 0 06 mg l and 0 41 0

rain garden layer contents contributed greatly to the high concentration of no3 n in con with the proportion of 27 2 3 0 3 add and 77 8 4 9 7 add in contrast the concentrations of no3 n in the control experiments of iws were significantly lower than that in con p 0 01 which was consistent with the results of simulated rainfall experiments a previous study also reported that 58 of incoming dissolved inorganic n din was denitrified within a wet stormwater detention basin while only 1 was denitrified in a dry basin 14 in addition the iws design can reduce the stress that plants might undergo during the dry season and therefore promote greater plant growth and nutrient uptake 30 in the present study tn removal efficiencies in iws achieved at 91 4 1 2 3 add and 91 3 0 5 7 add compared with 18 0 2 3 3 add and 53 7 5 0 7 add in con accordingly which supported the advantage of iws in nitrogen removal for 3 and 7 add nutrient removal efficiencies of iws showed no significant difference table 1 p 0 05 as for con the removal efficiencies of nh4 n tp and cod showed no significant difference p 0 05 however serious net release of no3 n occurred in con under 3 add which resulted in lower tn removal efficiency of 18 0 2 3 than result of 53 7 5 0 under 7 add p 0 05 it was reported that the highest denitrification rates were obtained under storm frequency of 7 days relative to 1 or 13 days in a bioretention swale mesocosm 16 in this study the removal of nh4 n exhibited no significant relation with the length of add which was consistent with afrooz and boehm 17 however in hatt et al 13 positive correlation between nh4 n removal efficiency and the length of dry periods was observed which might be related to the suitable conditions for nitrification with longer dry periods from results of tests with real stormwater runoff table 2 the net release of no3 n in con resulted in significantly lower tn removal efficiency 149 2 41 5 than that in iws 81 0 3 0 p 0 01 results of real stormwater runoff tests were in accordance with the synthetic stormwater runoff which also showed the advantage of iws over con in terms of n removal figs s1 s2 it was found that tn removal efficiency increased with saturation time in a biofilter treating real stormwater runoff and the integration with a water saturated zone of at least 75 cm was favorable for tn removal 31 zhang et al 30 reported that nitrogen removal of stormwater biofilter with water saturated zone could be promoted by increased denitrification and plant growth from fig s3 real stormwater runoff collected in this study contained 0 53 0 02 g l ss while iws and con both exhibited great ss removal capacity with removal efficiencies of 97 9 0 2 and 99 6 0 1 table 2 respectively the filtration of ss could result in the decrease of drainage speed as for the blocking caused by ss both iws and con showed great capacity for tp removal with removal efficiencies of 94 9 4 6 3 add and 99 2 0 0 7 add in iws and 99 0 0 6 3 add and 99 1 0 8 7 add in con for removal of cod rain garden of con showed a slight advantage over iws table 1 with the corresponding removal efficiencies of 79 3 7 2 3 add and 68 2 1 9 7 add in iws compared to 85 5 3 8 3 add and 79 6 3 7 7 add in con 3 2 n2o emission n2o emissions in the simulated rainfall events of synthetic stormwater runoff were monitored and analyzed in fig 4 with the comparation of tap water accompany with the higher nitrogen removal efficiency of iws the lower n2o emission ratios were observed 0 34 0 16 and 0 19 0 02 of tn removed under 3 and 7 add respectively in comparison with con 0 72 0 27 and 0 19 0 02 of tn removed under add of 3 days and 7 days respectively even though the relative higher n2o emission rates were observed in iws 0 74 0 35 and 0 41 0 03 mg n2o n m2 h than that in con 0 29 0 07 and 0 24 0 01 mg n2o n m2 h under both 3 add fig 4a and 7 add fig 4b the n2o emission potential of iws was still reduced because of its higher nitrogen removal capacity these results were consistent with the previous study that a stormwater biofilter with saturated zone reduce the potential n2o release from the effluent 9 n2o emissions from both iws and con under 3 add were always higher than that under 7 add which was probably related to the high soil moisture under short add 14 the n2o emission rates 0 24 0 74 mg n2o n m2 h or 2 10 6 48 g n2o m2 yr presented in this study were comparable with values obtained from stormwater biofilters 0 09 and 0 23 mg n2o n m2 h 32 1 1 mg n2o n m2 h 23 a rain fed maize field 0 22 mg n2o n m2 h talmo 2019 and grazed pastures 0 024 3 33 mg n2o n m2 h 33 34 and were higher compare to known n2o data from stormwater detention basin 0 03 mg n2o n m2 h 14 4 4 12 0 Î¼g n2o n m2 h 35 and agricultural soils crops system 1 5 61 Î¼g of n2o n m2 h 36 n2o emission rates of tap water for iws blank iws were 0 04 0 01 mg n2o n m2 h 3 add and 0 12 0 06 mg n2o n m2 h 7 add which were both lower p 0 05 than that for synthetic stormwater runoff 0 74 0 35 and 0 41 0 03 mg n2o n m2 h under 3 and 7 add respectively fig 4 for con there was no significant difference p 0 05 for n2o emission rates of tap water blank con 0 22 0 04 and 0 15 0 04 mg n2o n m2 h under 3 and 7 add respectively when compared with results of synthetic stormwater runoff 0 29 0 07 and 0 24 0 01 mg n2o n m2 h indicating the important role of n released from the filter media to n2o emissions of con the n2o emission of real stormwater runoff under 3 add was shown in fig s4 n2o emission rates for iws and con were 4 70 1 30 and 0 90 0 09 mg n2o n m2 h respectively which were both higher than that of the synthetic stormwater runoff tests 0 74 0 35 and 0 29 0 07 mg n2o n m2 h for iws and con respectively the n2o emission ratio of iws was 1 85 0 86 compared with 0 34 0 16 for synthetic stormwater runoff respectively as for con substantial net release of n occurred which resulted in a great risk of n2o emission from the effluent the high n2o emission rate when treating real stormwater runoff was presumed to be related to the blocking caused by particulate matter 37 which caused slow filtering rate long hrt and more n2o emission from the enhanced denitrification therefore to extend the lifespan of rain gardens and mitigate the emission potential of n2o pretreatment to remove particulate matter is recommended 3 3 microbial communities to further investigate the impact of different designs on nitrogen management the microbial community composition in soil from iws and con treatments was analyzed composition of the microbial community at genus and phylum levels and principal coordinates analysis pcoa at genus level were shown in fig 5 with effective sequencing reads of 55 876 per sample shannon index values of iws were relatively lower than that of con with the values of 9 72 9 66 9 78 and 7 81 for samples iws 1 4 and 9 83 9 58 9 67 and 8 90 for samples con 1 4 respectively it is worth noting that the value of iws 4 sample from the water saturated layer of iws was the lowest these results indicated that the microbial diversity decreased with filling depth and the water saturated anoxic environment harbored the least species of microorganism there was substantial difference in the microbial community composition of iwa 4 and con 4 indicated by the analysis of heatmap based on the relative abundance at genus level fig 5a weighted unifrac distance at the phylum level fig 5b and pcoa on microbial composition at the genus level fig 5c specifically iws 4 and con 4 were clearly separated by pcoa where 44 19 pco1 and 20 39 pco2 of the variations could be explained between different samples fig 5c however for samples taken from the intermediate filling depths i e iws 2 iws 3 con 2 and con 3 the microbial community composition exhibited few differences heatmap revealed that relative abundance of genera among various samples could be clustered into three clusters fig 5a the dominant genera were bradyrihizobium haliangium hyphomicrobium etc in cluster 1 a clearly different microbial community was observed in iws 4 with the most abundant genera of lentimicrobium methanosarcina unidentified ruminococcacese etc in cluster 2 significant higher abundance of candidatus solibacter 1 5 p 0 05 haliangium 2 9 p 0 05 lentimicrobium 0 6 p 0 01 methanosarcina 1 1 p 0 01 and rhizomicrobium 0 9 p 0 01 was observed in iws by contrast hyphomicrobium 2 0 p 0 01 pedomicrobium 2 2 p 0 05 and terrimonas 1 4 p 0 01 showed significant higher abundance in con the different performance of nitrogen removal and n2o emission was probably caused by the potential different functions of these genera for example most of these genera including candidatus solibacter 38 hyphomicrobium 39 haliangium 40 lentimicrobium 41 and terrimonas 42 were identified as denitrifiers methanosarcina was found to perform simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis in the denitrifying reactor 43 their functions may vary under different circumstances hyphomicrobium has been characterized as complete denitrifiers capable of reducing both nitrate and nitrite to n2 especially using methanol 39 haliangium possesses partial denitrification activities only capable of reducing nitrite to n2o or n2 using amino acids under anaerobic conditions 40 from our previous result genus of terrimonas was found dominant in a wastewater treatment process treating synthetic domestic wastewater 42 terrimonas was identified as denitrifying microbe capable of producing n2o through partial denitrification in a simultaneous partial nitrification anammox and denitrification process 44 which was also found existed in rhizosphere soil 45 the significantly higher abundance of terrimonas in con 1 4 of taxa in con compared to 0 4 in iws p 0 01 might account for the higher n2o emission potential than iws additionally candidatus solibacter and rhizomicrobium were frequently detected in grasslands forests and soil plant systems 46 47 may response for nitrification 38 48 leading to different nh4 n removal performance and n2o emission during nitrification together these results suggest that the variation in bacterial community composition driven by a different design contribute to differences in key microbial community functions such as carbon and nitrogen management including nitrification and denitrification leading to different nutrient removal performance and n2o emission the predominant phyla were actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteri accounting for 78 3 and 85 2 of the total taxa in iws and con respectively fig 5b the main phyla distributed in iws and con were in accordance with a previous study of the microbial diversity of bioretention systems 49 actinobacterial nitrate reducers and nirs type and nosz harboring proteobacterial denitrifiers were recognized as important players regulating n2o emission in palsa peats 50 and also wastewater treatment process 51 presumably the lower abundance of actinobacteria and proteobacteria might probably be the cause of lower n2o emission potential of iws over con furthermore the abundance of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes was closely correlated with soil nutrients such as organic matter tn tp and available p 52 bacteroidetes was widely distributed in various environments and capable of degrading high molecular weight organic matter i e polysaccharides and proteins 53 54 this phylum had high abundance in iws 4 14 6 probably because of the degradation of sustained release organic matter 3 4 potential implication of this study according to n cycling in the nature and the research of payne et al 9 the probable n removal processes of iws and con were drawn in fig 6 a and b respectively for conventional rain garden of con the upper layer was of sufficient oxygen permeated from the atmosphere where nh4 n could be oxidized to hydroxylamine and nitrite in sequence by aob and then nitrite was nitrified to nitrate by nob in the process of hydroxylamine oxidation n2o may be generated as intermediate product and released under high do concentration and aob activities 55 56 under limited do concentration aob could denitrify nitrite to n2o accompanied with the oxidation of nh4 n 57 59 to improve n removal of con an internal water storage iws layer was introduced to the bottom layer and generated anoxic environment for denitrification where no3 n could be subsequently denitrified to nitrite n2o and n2 60 previous studies have demonstrated that biofilters with a water saturation zone performed better in terms of no3 n removal than those without a saturation zone 17 61 this study provided more detail on the microbial community supporting this conclusion the significant different composition of functional denitrifiers in iws compare to con e g microorganisms from genera haliangium methanosarcina lentimicrobium etc indicated that the introduction of water saturated layer in iws was beneficial to enrich denitrifiers however under inadequate anoxic conditions or carbon source insufficient denitrification would occur with n2o as the final product 56 from this study compared with the high net release of no3 in con iws exhibited an obvious advantage in terms of n removal and the n2o emission potential of iws was also lower than that of con furthermore iws design had comparable n2o emission rates with known n2o data in ecosystem suggesting its application would not bring the issue of n2o emission 4 conclusion the rain garden with internal water storage iws layer exhibited significantly higher nitrogen removal efficiency and lower n2o emission potential over the conventional rapid filtration rain garden con net release of n from con exerted great risk of n2o emission from the effluent the different distribution features of functional denitrifiers in iws and con such as candidatus solibacter hyphomicrobium haliangium lentimicrobium and terrimonas accounted for the different n removal efficiency and n2o emission potential in consideration of the enhancement of n removal and the mitigation of n2o emission potential the rain garden

13462,the present study assessed the phytoremediation efficiency of water fern azolla pinnata r br in the treatment of dairy wastewater dww batch mode experimentation was done using different dilutions 0 to 100 of dww transplanted with five healthy leaflets of a pinnata besides this the a pinnata growth was captured using camera vision based image recognition and further modeled using logistic and modified gompertz models the findings showed that after 14 days of phytoremediation experiments the maximum significant p 0 05 reduction efficiency of selected pollutant parameters of dww i e ph 9 41 electrical conductivity 61 42 total dissolved solids 71 56 total kjeldahl s nitrogen 73 25 and total phosphorus 65 37 observed using 75 dww dilution moreover the periodically taken surface images were useful to recognize the position and number of leaflets which further helped to simulate a pinnata growth patterns the maximum number of leaflets n 20 fresh biomass 16 18 0 42 g dry biomass 1 47 0 04 g and chlorophyll content 3 14 0 03 mg g fwt was also observed using 75 dww treatment respectively the logistic model was found more robust as compared to modified gompertz to predict leaflet production y as revealed from model validation results i e coefficient of determination r2 0 9533 and minimum difference between experimental and model predicted results thus the combined application of phytoremediation and image processing techniques can be used to monitor and maximize plant growth performance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords azolla pinnata dairy wastewater image recognition phytoremediation pollution 1 introduction environmental pollution caused by wastewater disposal has become a threatening issue globally 1 2 different industrial and non industrial sources of wastewater generation are depleting the quality of soil and water environments 3 4 globally it is estimated that nearly 80 of wastewater is disposed of without appropriate treatment 5 moreover developing countries are mostly affected by wastewater disposal as compared to developed countries due to a lack of proper treatment and disposal facilities 6 7 thus the development of an efficient method of wastewater treatment and disposal has been the primary necessity for both the scientific community and industrial units being an agricultural country dairy is the major industrial sector of india currently there are several operation dairy industries in india units producing 176 4 million ton liters of milk 8 a huge volume of wastewater containing a high load of nutrients is produced as a result of the production and processing of milk therefore dairy industries lacking treatment facilities directly dump these wastewaters into open land or water bodies 9 therefore there is an urgent need to stop open and unsafe disposal and efficiently manage wastewater pollution phytoremediation is a cost effective and environmentally friendly method of wastewater treatment using hyperaccumulating plants 10 11 40 these plants have the capability to remediate various pollutants from soil and water bodies and translocate them within their roots stem and leaf parts 12 13 recently phytoremediation technology has emerged significantly as studies on testing the efficiency of plants for pollutant removal are increasing based on the localization of aquatic plants they have been categorized as free floating emergent and submerged plants 14 15 water fern azolla pinnata r br is a free floating macrophyte having a distinct capacity to absorb various nutrients from water bodies previous studies on a pinnata showed its application in the biological treatment of different types of wastewater including composite effluent 10 palm oil wastewater 16 domestic municipal aquaculture and industrial 17 synthetic dyes 18 etc therefore the use of the a pinnata plant may give promising results in terms of removing major physicochemical and nutrient pollutants from dairy wastewater 19 however the growth patterns of aquatic plants depend on the availability of nutrients and also the genetic compatibility to toxicants 10 20 it is reported that the optimum load of supplied nutrients may give better plant growth performance which further could be adjusted to optimize the wastewater treatment process in this the growth of a plant can be determined by various direct and indirect methods recently with the advancement of information and technology image processing and deep learning have been evolved as efficient techniques to monitor and analyze real time objects 21 22 in this an actual photographic view of the object is obtained and systems are trained to identify count the same kind of objects this technique has been successfully applied in various studies such as fruit sorting 23 disease identification 24 mushroom growth measurement 25 26 vegetation index measurement 27 etc thus this technique combined with the phytoremediation process could possibly provide good insights into the growth measurement of plants besides this kinetic models are an efficient tool for studying the growth behavior of plants and microbes 28 29 there are several linear and non linear growth models widely used to study these growth patterns 30 31 out of them sigmoid models are s shaped functions which are normally followed by most plants and microbes these models provide the best fitting result for the system where two growth phases i e lag and stationary are distinct previous studies have reported the usability of sigmoid functions in the phytoremediation process 32 thus the use of such models may provide a better understanding of a pinnata growth patterns under dww treatment using the image processing technique more specifically phytoremediation is a well know sustainable technology that can help in restoring soil air and water components of our environment however the performance of plants used for phytoremediation purposes needs to be monitored in order to decide whether the plant is capable to grow in the given media or not thus manual monitoring of plant growth is a conventional method in this study we introduced the image processing technique to identify the status of selected test plant species i e a pinnata the data obtained from camera visuals was helpful to precisely identify the number and locations of a pinnata leaflets which represents a novel method of its growth monitoring moreover the model analysis showed that the plant growth patterns can be critically analyzed by using the data obtained from image processing technique which could help in further maximizing both growth and pollutant removal processes previously no attempt has been made to study the a pinnata plant growth performance under a batch mode phytoremediation of dairy wastewater thus this study adds new information which enables the integration of both phytoremediation and image recognition techniques for sustainable wastewater management believe this the present study has been designated to assess the efficiency of the a pinnata plant in the treatment of different dilutions of dww the influence of dww amended rates on growth and biochemical pigment of a pinnata has been reported moreover the growth of a pinnata was monitored with help of the image processing technique and further modeled using different growth models i e logistic and modified gompertz 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of azolla pinnata and dairy wastewater for the present study azolla pinnata biomass was collected from the ganga canal of dhanouri haridwar india 29 56 15 n and 77 57 04 e the juvenile leaflets of a pinnata were collected in polythene bags having an aeration facility besides this the treated dairy wastewater was collected from mohan milk processing plant located at bhagwanpur haridwar india 29 58 25 n and 77 46 39 e the wastewater samples were collected in 10 liter polyvinyl chloride pvc cans and immediately transported to the laboratory the samples were preserved at 4 c until final implementation in phytoremediation experiments and laboratory analyses 2 2 experimental setup the phytoremediation experiments were conducted in a 250 ml capacity circular pvc bin five different concentrations of dww including 0 borewell water as control 25 50 75 100 absolute were used to grow a pinnata under room condition the average temperature humidity and light intensity of the experimental room were 20 c 55 70 and 2000 lx respectively the loss of water content on bins was normalized by the addition of deionized water to become the initial volume a led bulb was used for continuous light exposure the light intensity was controlled using a potentiometer and calibrated using a digital lux meter mextech lx 1010b in the setup of phytoremediation experiments was shown in fig 1 the image recognition device includes a portable web camera logitech c270 ch connected to a raspberry pi 3 microprocessor the web camera wc was vertically fitted above the circular pvc bins with help of an adjustable plastic stand the microprocessor included a microsd card 16 gb sandisk usa which was used to save the captured images at a defined interval of 12 h for 14 days of phytoremediation experiments moreover the image capturing system was connected to an uninterrupted power supply unit ups the time series images captured by wc and stored of microsd card were further processed and used for image recognition studies 2 3 image processing and leaflet identification counting for the processing of captured images the image processing and computer vision ipcv package of matlab 2020b software was used matlab is widely used for image processing and objecting identification classification studies in this study the periodically captured images showing leaflet positions were firstly subjected to the imread imshow command of the ipcv package then the command line was adjusted to convert the image into grayscale followed by setting a defined level of threshold to convert the non leaflet pixels to black further the complementation of the image was done using the operator to eliminate the image noise and as a form of patches finally the boundaries were defined using the bwboundaries command and the number of viable a pinnata leaflets was counted fig 2 shows the flow chart of different steps adopted for image processing and recognition 2 4 measurement of leaflet number biomass and growth parameters as described above the number of leaflets was counted using the image processing technique besides this the fresh biomass of a pinnata was measured before and after phytoremediation experiments the fresh biomass g was measured with help of a digital weighing scale scientech se 391 in after the termination of the experiment the plant biomass was oven dried and expressed as dry biomass g the leaflet growth of a pinnata was modeled using two different sigmoid models i e logistic eq 1 and modified gompertz eq 2 1 y y 0 y t 1 x x 0 p y t 2 y p exp exp Î¼ m p Î» t 1 where y represented the predicted number of leaflets y and yt were the initial and final number of leaflets x and x0 were the interpolated and center points of the growth phase p was the maximum number of leaflets Î¼m was the maximum specific leaflet growth rate Î» was the lag phase while t was the time of phytoremediation experiments respectively for this the rank models tool of originpro software was used to fit the models the time series measured and image processed data of a pinnata leaflet number was imported as x and y columns the fitness was decided based on the coefficient of determination r2 standard error and variance criterion and the model having minimum prediction error with acceptable r2 values was chosen besides this the total chlorophyll content mg g fwt of a pinnata was determined using acetone 80 extraction and uv visible spectroscopic method the absorbance was recorded at specified wavelengths i e 645 and 663 nm respectively 10 2 5 borewell dairy wastewater analysis and pollution load reduction efficiency the borewell water bww and dairy wastewater dww used in this study were analyzed for selected physicochemical parameters including ph electrical conductivity ec ds m total dissolved solids tds mg l total kjeldahl s nitrogen tkn mg l and total phosphorus tp mg l for the water analysis official methodologies described by the association of applied chemists 41 and american public health association 42 were adopted in this regard ph ec and tds parameters were directly measured using a pre calibrated multi meter esico 1615 in tkn was determined using kjeldahl s acid digestion and distillation method while tp was measured following the uv vis spectroscopy method agilent 60 cary usa all of the laboratory grade reagents used in chemical instrumental analyses were procured from sigma aldrich in besides this to determine the percentage pollution load reduction efficiency of a pinnata during phytoremediation of dww a specific removal efficiency model was used the form of the model was given in eq 3 3 reduction efficiency initial load final load initial load 100 2 6 statistics and software all experiments were performed in triplicate under controlled room conditions the values were presented as mean followed by the standard deviation of triplicated analyses experiments the research data were analyzed using kruskal wallis post hoc anova and non linear regression tools the defined level of statistical significance was prob p f value of 0 05 i e 95 confidence interval for this microsoft office excel v2016 microsoft corp usa originpro v2021 student learning edition originlab inc usa and matlab v2020b mathworks usa packages were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 borewell water and dairy wastewater characteristics the bww and dww used in this study were analyzed for selected physicochemical and nutrient parameters as given in table 1 it was evidenced from the results that bww had a lesser pollution load as compared to dww the values of different physicochemical and nutrient parameters of dww i e ph 6 53 0 01 ec 6 030 0 362 ds m tds 1410 45 34 06 mg l tkn 165 89 9 13 mg l and tp 134 08 8 11 mg l were significantly p 0 05 higher than of bww i e ph 7 19 0 02 ec 0 396 0 010 ds m tds 114 08 4 08 mg l tkn 4 13 0 25 mg l and tp 2 55 0 05 mg l respectively the different sources of pollutants in dww are the processing of milk based products and animal excreta cattle dung urine fodder waste washings however the dww released from the selected study area was openly released in water bodies which may further create various environmental problems therefore dww should be treated using efficient and eco friendly methods before discharging an open environment previously several studies have assessed the physicochemical and nutrient characteristics of dww out of which lu et al 33 reported a higher load of tn 283 00 mg l and tp 115 90 mg l nutrients used for cultivation of microalga i e chlorella sp besides this bortoluzzi and co workers also assessed the pollution load of dww and reported higher loads of various physicochemical nutrients and heavy metal pollutants 34 3 2 pollution load reduction efficiency of a pinnata after the 14 days of phytoremediation experiments using a pinnata the pollution load of dww was significantly p 0 05 reduced as compared to bww treatment as given in table 1 and fig 3 the maximum reduction efficiency of selected physicochemical and nutrients parameters i e ph 9 41 ec 61 42 tds 71 56 tkn 73 25 and tp 65 37 was achieved using 75 dww dilution respectively however the reduction efficiency of selected pollutant parameters gradually increased up to 75 dww treatment which again decreased for absolute 100 treatment in this the anova analysis that the initial values means separated by least significant difference method lsd of pollutant parameters were significantly p 0 05 different from the finally obtained values which indicated their effective removal based on the kruskal wallis post hoc test a significant difference between the computed mean ranks of selected treatment groups i e bww to 100 dww from these observations a strong effect of dww concentration on their removal by a pinnata was noted moreover the reduction of pollutants was more dependent on the supplied dww concentration a pinnata is recognized as a prime candidate of wastewater treatment as previously reported by numerous studies in this study a pinnata was capable to reduce the pollution load of dww significantly the utilization of different nutrients might be associated with their sequential uptake to assist a pinnata growth a slowdown in the pollution reduction efficiency using 100 dww may be due to nutrient stress which did not support a pinnata growth as efficiently as in the case of 75 treatment n and p as nutrient pollutants in wastewater may act as essential elements which support plant growth and proper cell functioning 10 35 the level of pollutants present in wastewater strongly determines the performance of plants used for their phytoremediation however the adaptability of particular plant species in toxic wastewaters also depends on genetic compatibility which affects the rate of pollutant migration from wastewater to plant 10 dairy wastewater is a mixture of various ingredients such as micro macro and trace nutrients the dependency of removal of each parameter depends on the selectivity of the plant to assimilate and uptake them from media as described earlier the most common mechanisms of nutrient utilization by plants are passive absorption and active absorption the transportation of nutrients takes place in the form of ions through root hairs and then translocating within vegetative parts in both mechanisms the pollutant as the form of nutrient travels to the plant root cells where their concentrations are lesser than the media itself in this water acts as the most important medium to help ionic dissociation of nutrients through plant enzymes and then making them available to plant roots 35 several researchers have investigated the phytoremediation potential of a pinnata using different types of wastewaters out of which kumar et al 10 investigated the pollution load reduction efficiency of a pinnata using integrated industrial wastewater they reported that among different selected concentrations the maximum reduction of pollution load in terms of physicochemical heavy metals and microbiological parameters was achieved using 60 wastewater concentration another study by akinbile and coworkers investigated the treatment of domestic wastewater using a pinnata they observed that a pinnata was capable to reduce significant loads of physicochemical and nutrient parameters of domestic wastewater 39 these reports are in line with the findings of the present study therefore it was recommended that a pinnata might be a promising candidate to eliminate pollutants from dww 3 3 effects on a pinnata growth and chlorophyll contents table 2 showed changes in the a pinnata growth and biochemical constituent after 14 days of phytoremediation experiments in this the number of a pinnata leaflets was significantly p 0 05 increased in the case of all dww treatments more specifically the initial number n 5 of the leaflet was increased to 11 13 16 20 and 16 in the case of bww 25 50 75 and 100 dww treatments respectively besides this the same pattern was observed for the harvested fresh weight of a pinnata i e 8 01 0 51 10 40 0 30 12 82 0 20 16 18 0 42 and 12 91 0 12 g for bww 25 50 75 and 100 dww treatments correspondingly the dry biomass of a pinnata was also influenced in the same way as in the case of fresh biomass moreover the maximum total chlorophyll content 3 14 0 03 mg g fwt was encountered in the same 75 dww treatment the growth performance of a pinnata showed that dww was a suitable medium for both biomass production and pollutant reduction the maximum growth performance of a pinnata in 75 dww concentration might be associated with the presence of optimum levels of different nutrients however an absolute 100 dww dose was not feasible for a pinnata growth since it showed some toxic effects in terms of a reduced number of leaflets fresh dry biomass and chlorophyll production the large variation in growth performance of a pinnata under different dww dilutions might be associated with the assimilation efficiency of the plant which altered its growth and biochemical responses a report by prasad and singh 36 revealed that the a pinnata may exhibit decreased biochemical response under cd stressed environments abd kadir et al 16 also studied the phytoremediation potential of a pinnata and leman minor plants in the treatment of palm oil mill wastewater they reported that maximum protein carbohydrate and pigment contents were observed using 2 5 dilutions whereas higher dilution caused a rapid decline in plant growth parameters also kÃ¶sesakal and yÄ±ldÄ±z 37 studied biochemical profiles of two azolla sp under controlled environments they observed that the a pinnata grew at faster rates as compared to a caroliniana with maximum assimilation of biochemical compounds under controlled environments hence it can be concluded the dww dilutions significantly affected the growth and biochemical parameters of a pinnata in the present study 3 4 feasibility of image recognition and prediction models techniques in leaflet growth simulation this study integrated the image processing technique to recognize a pinnata leaflets under laboratory scale phytoremediation experiments in this the frequently taken images of a pinnata were analyzed using matlab software to identify and count the leaflet boundaries fig 4 showed the initial and final views of a pinnata leaflets grown in different treatments of dww the first image was unprocessed while the second image was threshold processed similarly the third image showed the defined boundary levels of leaflets used to count their numbers as given in fig 4 and table 2 it was observed that the technique was helpful to count the actual number of leaflets from the captured images based on the obtained data the growth pattern of a pinnata was simulated using two different prediction models i e logistic and modified gompertz separately the results showed that the time series number of leaflet production as a function of the sigmoid model gave identical results out of the two models the logistic function was more appropriate to precisely predict the time series leaflet growth as compared to modified gompertz data provided in table 3 showed that the logistic model performed better in terms of predicting the total number of leaflets y coefficient of determination cod and maximum specific leaflet production potentials the prediction errors were also lesser in the case of the logistic model moreover fig 5 showed the time series trend fitness of leaflet growth using two selected models it can be seen from the trend analysis that the logistic model had robust trend simulation i e near to the values obtained experimentally logistic and modified gompertz models are a form of sigmoid function which enables understanding the exponential growth patterns of plants and microbes 29 in this logistic and modified gompertz models are used to predict the time series response of plant microbe growth processes which may include their biomass or specific constituent formation and reduction however the performance of both models varies according to the processes both models are well applied to avoid the additive errors while adjusting the variance criterion and the model having minimum error could be considered to model the processes on the other hand image processing and deep learning techniques have received great attention from the scientific community in different areas numerous researchers have been successfully implemented these techniques in agriculture and environment related aspects recently kharuf gutierrez et al 27 used multispectral aerial images and processed them using image processing and deep learning techniques to obtain important crop vegetation indices in their study fu et al 23 developed an image processing based kiwi fruit sorting system the algorithm developed by the was helpful to work in both day and night visions with 97 accuracy recently mullins et al 38 developed an image processing based wastewater treatment system and evaluated turbidity removal previously no study has been done for the identification of a pinnata leaflets using image processing techniques therefore the results of this study showed the comprehensive application of this technique in plant growth monitoring in phytoremediation systems 4 conclusion the findings of this study concluded that a pinnata maximally reduced the pollution load of dww using 75 concentration the maximum plant growth and biochemical parameters of a pinnata were observed using the same treatment besides this the image processing technique was helpful to precisely count the number of leaflets accurately out of the two tested sigmoid functions the logistic model gave more precise results to predict the time series leaflet production in a 14 days of phytoremediation experiment the findings of this study present an effective method of dww treatment using abundantly available a pinnata while using image processing techniques to monitor their growth further studies on the treatment of dww using other aquatic plants along with the development of plant specific image recognition algorithms are highly recommended

13462,the present study assessed the phytoremediation efficiency of water fern azolla pinnata r br in the treatment of dairy wastewater dww batch mode experimentation was done using different dilutions 0 to 100 of dww transplanted with five healthy leaflets of a pinnata besides this the a pinnata growth was captured using camera vision based image recognition and further modeled using logistic and modified gompertz models the findings showed that after 14 days of phytoremediation experiments the maximum significant p 0 05 reduction efficiency of selected pollutant parameters of dww i e ph 9 41 electrical conductivity 61 42 total dissolved solids 71 56 total kjeldahl s nitrogen 73 25 and total phosphorus 65 37 observed using 75 dww dilution moreover the periodically taken surface images were useful to recognize the position and number of leaflets which further helped to simulate a pinnata growth patterns the maximum number of leaflets n 20 fresh biomass 16 18 0 42 g dry biomass 1 47 0 04 g and chlorophyll content 3 14 0 03 mg g fwt was also observed using 75 dww treatment respectively the logistic model was found more robust as compared to modified gompertz to predict leaflet production y as revealed from model validation results i e coefficient of determination r2 0 9533 and minimum difference between experimental and model predicted results thus the combined application of phytoremediation and image processing techniques can be used to monitor and maximize plant growth performance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords azolla pinnata dairy wastewater image recognition phytoremediation pollution 1 introduction environmental pollution caused by wastewater disposal has become a threatening issue globally 1 2 different industrial and non industrial sources of wastewater generation are depleting the quality of soil and water environments 3 4 globally it is estimated that nearly 80 of wastewater is disposed of without appropriate treatment 5 moreover developing countries are mostly affected by wastewater disposal as compared to developed countries due to a lack of proper treatment and disposal facilities 6 7 thus the development of an efficient method of wastewater treatment and disposal has been the primary necessity for both the scientific community and industrial units being an agricultural country dairy is the major industrial sector of india currently there are several operation dairy industries in india units producing 176 4 million ton liters of milk 8 a huge volume of wastewater containing a high load of nutrients is produced as a result of the production and processing of milk therefore dairy industries lacking treatment facilities directly dump these wastewaters into open land or water bodies 9 therefore there is an urgent need to stop open and unsafe disposal and efficiently manage wastewater pollution phytoremediation is a cost effective and environmentally friendly method of wastewater treatment using hyperaccumulating plants 10 11 40 these plants have the capability to remediate various pollutants from soil and water bodies and translocate them within their roots stem and leaf parts 12 13 recently phytoremediation technology has emerged significantly as studies on testing the efficiency of plants for pollutant removal are increasing based on the localization of aquatic plants they have been categorized as free floating emergent and submerged plants 14 15 water fern azolla pinnata r br is a free floating macrophyte having a distinct capacity to absorb various nutrients from water bodies previous studies on a pinnata showed its application in the biological treatment of different types of wastewater including composite effluent 10 palm oil wastewater 16 domestic municipal aquaculture and industrial 17 synthetic dyes 18 etc therefore the use of the a pinnata plant may give promising results in terms of removing major physicochemical and nutrient pollutants from dairy wastewater 19 however the growth patterns of aquatic plants depend on the availability of nutrients and also the genetic compatibility to toxicants 10 20 it is reported that the optimum load of supplied nutrients may give better plant growth performance which further could be adjusted to optimize the wastewater treatment process in this the growth of a plant can be determined by various direct and indirect methods recently with the advancement of information and technology image processing and deep learning have been evolved as efficient techniques to monitor and analyze real time objects 21 22 in this an actual photographic view of the object is obtained and systems are trained to identify count the same kind of objects this technique has been successfully applied in various studies such as fruit sorting 23 disease identification 24 mushroom growth measurement 25 26 vegetation index measurement 27 etc thus this technique combined with the phytoremediation process could possibly provide good insights into the growth measurement of plants besides this kinetic models are an efficient tool for studying the growth behavior of plants and microbes 28 29 there are several linear and non linear growth models widely used to study these growth patterns 30 31 out of them sigmoid models are s shaped functions which are normally followed by most plants and microbes these models provide the best fitting result for the system where two growth phases i e lag and stationary are distinct previous studies have reported the usability of sigmoid functions in the phytoremediation process 32 thus the use of such models may provide a better understanding of a pinnata growth patterns under dww treatment using the image processing technique more specifically phytoremediation is a well know sustainable technology that can help in restoring soil air and water components of our environment however the performance of plants used for phytoremediation purposes needs to be monitored in order to decide whether the plant is capable to grow in the given media or not thus manual monitoring of plant growth is a conventional method in this study we introduced the image processing technique to identify the status of selected test plant species i e a pinnata the data obtained from camera visuals was helpful to precisely identify the number and locations of a pinnata leaflets which represents a novel method of its growth monitoring moreover the model analysis showed that the plant growth patterns can be critically analyzed by using the data obtained from image processing technique which could help in further maximizing both growth and pollutant removal processes previously no attempt has been made to study the a pinnata plant growth performance under a batch mode phytoremediation of dairy wastewater thus this study adds new information which enables the integration of both phytoremediation and image recognition techniques for sustainable wastewater management believe this the present study has been designated to assess the efficiency of the a pinnata plant in the treatment of different dilutions of dww the influence of dww amended rates on growth and biochemical pigment of a pinnata has been reported moreover the growth of a pinnata was monitored with help of the image processing technique and further modeled using different growth models i e logistic and modified gompertz 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of azolla pinnata and dairy wastewater for the present study azolla pinnata biomass was collected from the ganga canal of dhanouri haridwar india 29 56 15 n and 77 57 04 e the juvenile leaflets of a pinnata were collected in polythene bags having an aeration facility besides this the treated dairy wastewater was collected from mohan milk processing plant located at bhagwanpur haridwar india 29 58 25 n and 77 46 39 e the wastewater samples were collected in 10 liter polyvinyl chloride pvc cans and immediately transported to the laboratory the samples were preserved at 4 c until final implementation in phytoremediation experiments and laboratory analyses 2 2 experimental setup the phytoremediation experiments were conducted in a 250 ml capacity circular pvc bin five different concentrations of dww including 0 borewell water as control 25 50 75 100 absolute were used to grow a pinnata under room condition the average temperature humidity and light intensity of the experimental room were 20 c 55 70 and 2000 lx respectively the loss of water content on bins was normalized by the addition of deionized water to become the initial volume a led bulb was used for continuous light exposure the light intensity was controlled using a potentiometer and calibrated using a digital lux meter mextech lx 1010b in the setup of phytoremediation experiments was shown in fig 1 the image recognition device includes a portable web camera logitech c270 ch connected to a raspberry pi 3 microprocessor the web camera wc was vertically fitted above the circular pvc bins with help of an adjustable plastic stand the microprocessor included a microsd card 16 gb sandisk usa which was used to save the captured images at a defined interval of 12 h for 14 days of phytoremediation experiments moreover the image capturing system was connected to an uninterrupted power supply unit ups the time series images captured by wc and stored of microsd card were further processed and used for image recognition studies 2 3 image processing and leaflet identification counting for the processing of captured images the image processing and computer vision ipcv package of matlab 2020b software was used matlab is widely used for image processing and objecting identification classification studies in this study the periodically captured images showing leaflet positions were firstly subjected to the imread imshow command of the ipcv package then the command line was adjusted to convert the image into grayscale followed by setting a defined level of threshold to convert the non leaflet pixels to black further the complementation of the image was done using the operator to eliminate the image noise and as a form of patches finally the boundaries were defined using the bwboundaries command and the number of viable a pinnata leaflets was counted fig 2 shows the flow chart of different steps adopted for image processing and recognition 2 4 measurement of leaflet number biomass and growth parameters as described above the number of leaflets was counted using the image processing technique besides this the fresh biomass of a pinnata was measured before and after phytoremediation experiments the fresh biomass g was measured with help of a digital weighing scale scientech se 391 in after the termination of the experiment the plant biomass was oven dried and expressed as dry biomass g the leaflet growth of a pinnata was modeled using two different sigmoid models i e logistic eq 1 and modified gompertz eq 2 1 y y 0 y t 1 x x 0 p y t 2 y p exp exp Î¼ m p Î» t 1 where y represented the predicted number of leaflets y and yt were the initial and final number of leaflets x and x0 were the interpolated and center points of the growth phase p was the maximum number of leaflets Î¼m was the maximum specific leaflet growth rate Î» was the lag phase while t was the time of phytoremediation experiments respectively for this the rank models tool of originpro software was used to fit the models the time series measured and image processed data of a pinnata leaflet number was imported as x and y columns the fitness was decided based on the coefficient of determination r2 standard error and variance criterion and the model having minimum prediction error with acceptable r2 values was chosen besides this the total chlorophyll content mg g fwt of a pinnata was determined using acetone 80 extraction and uv visible spectroscopic method the absorbance was recorded at specified wavelengths i e 645 and 663 nm respectively 10 2 5 borewell dairy wastewater analysis and pollution load reduction efficiency the borewell water bww and dairy wastewater dww used in this study were analyzed for selected physicochemical parameters including ph electrical conductivity ec ds m total dissolved solids tds mg l total kjeldahl s nitrogen tkn mg l and total phosphorus tp mg l for the water analysis official methodologies described by the association of applied chemists 41 and american public health association 42 were adopted in this regard ph ec and tds parameters were directly measured using a pre calibrated multi meter esico 1615 in tkn was determined using kjeldahl s acid digestion and distillation method while tp was measured following the uv vis spectroscopy method agilent 60 cary usa all of the laboratory grade reagents used in chemical instrumental analyses were procured from sigma aldrich in besides this to determine the percentage pollution load reduction efficiency of a pinnata during phytoremediation of dww a specific removal efficiency model was used the form of the model was given in eq 3 3 reduction efficiency initial load final load initial load 100 2 6 statistics and software all experiments were performed in triplicate under controlled room conditions the values were presented as mean followed by the standard deviation of triplicated analyses experiments the research data were analyzed using kruskal wallis post hoc anova and non linear regression tools the defined level of statistical significance was prob p f value of 0 05 i e 95 confidence interval for this microsoft office excel v2016 microsoft corp usa originpro v2021 student learning edition originlab inc usa and matlab v2020b mathworks usa packages were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 borewell water and dairy wastewater characteristics the bww and dww used in this study were analyzed for selected physicochemical and nutrient parameters as given in table 1 it was evidenced from the results that bww had a lesser pollution load as compared to dww the values of different physicochemical and nutrient parameters of dww i e ph 6 53 0 01 ec 6 030 0 362 ds m tds 1410 45 34 06 mg l tkn 165 89 9 13 mg l and tp 134 08 8 11 mg l were significantly p 0 05 higher than of bww i e ph 7 19 0 02 ec 0 396 0 010 ds m tds 114 08 4 08 mg l tkn 4 13 0 25 mg l and tp 2 55 0 05 mg l respectively the different sources of pollutants in dww are the processing of milk based products and animal excreta cattle dung urine fodder waste washings however the dww released from the selected study area was openly released in water bodies which may further create various environmental problems therefore dww should be treated using efficient and eco friendly methods before discharging an open environment previously several studies have assessed the physicochemical and nutrient characteristics of dww out of which lu et al 33 reported a higher load of tn 283 00 mg l and tp 115 90 mg l nutrients used for cultivation of microalga i e chlorella sp besides this bortoluzzi and co workers also assessed the pollution load of dww and reported higher loads of various physicochemical nutrients and heavy metal pollutants 34 3 2 pollution load reduction efficiency of a pinnata after the 14 days of phytoremediation experiments using a pinnata the pollution load of dww was significantly p 0 05 reduced as compared to bww treatment as given in table 1 and fig 3 the maximum reduction efficiency of selected physicochemical and nutrients parameters i e ph 9 41 ec 61 42 tds 71 56 tkn 73 25 and tp 65 37 was achieved using 75 dww dilution respectively however the reduction efficiency of selected pollutant parameters gradually increased up to 75 dww treatment which again decreased for absolute 100 treatment in this the anova analysis that the initial values means separated by least significant difference method lsd of pollutant parameters were significantly p 0 05 different from the finally obtained values which indicated their effective removal based on the kruskal wallis post hoc test a significant difference between the computed mean ranks of selected treatment groups i e bww to 100 dww from these observations a strong effect of dww concentration on their removal by a pinnata was noted moreover the reduction of pollutants was more dependent on the supplied dww concentration a pinnata is recognized as a prime candidate of wastewater treatment as previously reported by numerous studies in this study a pinnata was capable to reduce the pollution load of dww significantly the utilization of different nutrients might be associated with their sequential uptake to assist a pinnata growth a slowdown in the pollution reduction efficiency using 100 dww may be due to nutrient stress which did not support a pinnata growth as efficiently as in the case of 75 treatment n and p as nutrient pollutants in wastewater may act as essential elements which support plant growth and proper cell functioning 10 35 the level of pollutants present in wastewater strongly determines the performance of plants used for their phytoremediation however the adaptability of particular plant species in toxic wastewaters also depends on genetic compatibility which affects the rate of pollutant migration from wastewater to plant 10 dairy wastewater is a mixture of various ingredients such as micro macro and trace nutrients the dependency of removal of each parameter depends on the selectivity of the plant to assimilate and uptake them from media as described earlier the most common mechanisms of nutrient utilization by plants are passive absorption and active absorption the transportation of nutrients takes place in the form of ions through root hairs and then translocating within vegetative parts in both mechanisms the pollutant as the form of nutrient travels to the plant root cells where their concentrations are lesser than the media itself in this water acts as the most important medium to help ionic dissociation of nutrients through plant enzymes and then making them available to plant roots 35 several researchers have investigated the phytoremediation potential of a pinnata using different types of wastewaters out of which kumar et al 10 investigated the pollution load reduction efficiency of a pinnata using integrated industrial wastewater they reported that among different selected concentrations the maximum reduction of pollution load in terms of physicochemical heavy metals and microbiological parameters was achieved using 60 wastewater concentration another study by akinbile and coworkers investigated the treatment of domestic wastewater using a pinnata they observed that a pinnata was capable to reduce significant loads of physicochemical and nutrient parameters of domestic wastewater 39 these reports are in line with the findings of the present study therefore it was recommended that a pinnata might be a promising candidate to eliminate pollutants from dww 3 3 effects on a pinnata growth and chlorophyll contents table 2 showed changes in the a pinnata growth and biochemical constituent after 14 days of phytoremediation experiments in this the number of a pinnata leaflets was significantly p 0 05 increased in the case of all dww treatments more specifically the initial number n 5 of the leaflet was increased to 11 13 16 20 and 16 in the case of bww 25 50 75 and 100 dww treatments respectively besides this the same pattern was observed for the harvested fresh weight of a pinnata i e 8 01 0 51 10 40 0 30 12 82 0 20 16 18 0 42 and 12 91 0 12 g for bww 25 50 75 and 100 dww treatments correspondingly the dry biomass of a pinnata was also influenced in the same way as in the case of fresh biomass moreover the maximum total chlorophyll content 3 14 0 03 mg g fwt was encountered in the same 75 dww treatment the growth performance of a pinnata showed that dww was a suitable medium for both biomass production and pollutant reduction the maximum growth performance of a pinnata in 75 dww concentration might be associated with the presence of optimum levels of different nutrients however an absolute 100 dww dose was not feasible for a pinnata growth since it showed some toxic effects in terms of a reduced number of leaflets fresh dry biomass and chlorophyll production the large variation in growth performance of a pinnata under different dww dilutions might be associated with the assimilation efficiency of the plant which altered its growth and

13463,clay minerals are the main reason why coal slime water is difficult to settle for the exploration of the influence of ca2 on the sedimentation effect of illite the adsorption characteristics of illite were investigated under different ca2 concentrations after adsorption equilibrium the sedimentation test was carried out and the changes in the surface properties of illite particles were analyzed by measuring zeta potential and contact angle the theory of edlvo was adopted to calculate the interaction energy between illite particles the results showed that with the increase of ca2 concentration the equilibrium adsorption capacity of illite increased and the adsorption equilibrium was basically achieved at 60 min the adsorption process was in accordance with the quasi second order kinetic model and langmuir isothermal adsorption model the sedimentation effect of illite was obviously improved after adsorption of ca2 when the concentration of ca2 was 10 mmol l and ph 8 the sedimentation rate was 92 5 with the increase of ca2 concentration the absolute value of the zeta potential of illite after adsorption equilibrium decreased continuously and the contact angle increased continuously according to the theory of edlvo the polar force is the dominant force affecting the interaction between particles as the concentration of ca2 increases the van der waals attraction force between illite particles increases the electrostatic and polar repulsive forces weaken and the total interaction energy gradually decreases indicating that ca2 can promote the agglomeration of illite particles which is of benefit to the clarification of coal slime water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords illite calcium ion adsorption sedimentation edlvo theory 1 introduction coal slime water treatment is a significant link during the production of the coal preparation plant and its treatment effect is related to the operation of washing water closed circulation system clay minerals in coal slime water are the main reason why it is difficult to clarify 1 at present most of the studies achieves condensation of fine particles by adding polyaluminum chloride polyacrylamide and other chemicals in coal slime water so that the clarification of coal slime water can be realized its mechanism of action is of adopting the bridging effect of organic polymers and relying on electrostatic bonds hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds to agglomerate fine particles to form large and fluffy flocs so as to achieve the effect of accelerating particles sedimentation 2 3 however this method has some shortcomings such as high production cost caused by large consumption of reagents and poor universality of reagents the literature 4 7 shows that when the content of metal cations in coal slime water is high it is conducive to the settlement of coal slime water mainly promoting the coagulation and sedimentation of clay particles according to the electroneutrality principle metal cations are bound to adsorb on the surface of negatively charged minerals to achieve electrical balance which compresses the electric double layer on the particle surface resulting in the decrease of repulsive force between particles which promotes the agglomeration of particles and finally the clarification effect of coal slime water is improved 8 9 regarding the study on the adsorption capacity of metal cations on clay minerals zhang et al 10 investigated the adsorption characteristics of kaolinite for different metal cations and the results showed that its adsorption capacity was ca2 mg2 k and na in turn which is also the reason why cacl2 and caso4 are commonly used in actual production liu et al 11 researched the sedimentation behavior of kaolinite montmorillonite and illite in brine environment the results showed that the sedimental effect of brine environment on the three clay minerals was improved sem analysis showed that the surfaces of the three clay minerals were smoother and the cracks gradually closed under the action of brine environment yu et al 12 studied the effects of ca2 and mg2 on the surface properties of coal and montmorillonite particles and concluded that both ca2 and mg2 can reduce the zeta potential of coal and montmorillonite especially ca2 and the influence of ca2 on the zeta potential of montmorillonite is obviously stronger than mg2 in order to investigate the sedimentation behavior of clay minerals after adsorbing metal cations bai et al 13 added na k and other cations into coal slime water and observed the movement behavior of clay particles with sem eds it was found that after na k and other cations were adsorbed on the surface of clay minerals the agglomeration between clay particles was strengthened and flocs were gradually formed effectively improving the clarification effect of coal slime water to sum up the adsorption of metal cations in water by clay minerals changes the surface properties of particles which changes the interaction energy between particles and affects the sedimentation effect in view of the change of interaction energy between clay particles after adsorption of metal cations jean marie 14 investigated the influence of ca2 concentration on the stability behavior of colloidal particles and concluded that cacl2 concentration in the range of 0 5 3 mm can intensify particle aggregation with the increase of ca2 concentration the interaction potential energy between clay particles calculated by dlvo theory gradually decreases the above research verifies microscopically that metal cations contribute to the sedimentation of clay mineral particles under certain conditions the interaction force between particles in colloidal systems is usually calculated by dlvo theory including van der waals force and electrostatic force between particles but there is still interfacial polar interaction force in actual colloidal systems the order of magnitude of which is tens of times that of electrostatic force 15 the theory of edlvo includes van der waals force electrostatic force and interfacial polar interaction force so it is more accurate to use the theory of edlvo to calculate the force between particles in coal slime water illite is one of the typical clay minerals in coal slime water which is easy to slime in coal slime water to form fine and ultra fine particles the isomorphic phenomenon makes its surface negative charge more which makes it difficult to clarify coal slime water 16 in this paper illite was taken as the research object the adsorption effect of illite on ca2 was investigated the adsorption kinetics was analyzed the best adsorption model was determined and the adsorption characteristics of illite to ca2 are obtained sedimentation test was carried out after adsorption equilibrium contact angle tester and micro electrophoresis instrument were used to measure the changes of particle surface properties before and after adsorption combined with the theory of edlvo the curves of different interaction energies between illite particles and particle spacing were calculated the influence of different ca2 concentrations on the interaction energy between illite particles was analyzed and the mechanism of ca2 interaction between illite particles was revealed which is of great significance to improve the

the adsorption process 18 21 the process of adsorption of metal ions by clay minerals is often described by quasi first order kinetic model and quasi second order kinetic model 22 23 the quasi first order kinetic model mainly assumes that the adsorption rate is in direct proportion to the number of effective free active sites on the surface of the adsorbent as shown in eq 2 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 where q e is the adsorption capacity of the solution at equilibrium mg g q t is the adsorption capacity at time t mg g k 1 is the adsorption rate constant k 1 and q e can be obtained from

cumulative adsorption amount on the surface of adsorbent at a certain temperature for the adsorption of metal ions in solution the most commonly used models are langmuir and freundlich isotherms 24 26

is measured 3 times under the same conditions and values were averaged 2 2 4 calculation of interaction energy on the basis of the theory of edlvo the theory of dlvo and edlvo are common tools to study the interaction between particles in the colloidal system the coal slime water system does not belong to the colloidal system completely at present researchers have applied these theories to study the interaction between particles in the field of coal preparation since the theory of dlvo only considers the van der waals interaction energy and electrostatic interaction energy between particles it cannot fully explain the agglomeration and dispersion behavior of particles in the slurry water system however the theory of edlvo also investigates the polarity interaction energy between particles which makes the calculation results more accurate interaction energy between particles in the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek edlvo system includes van der waals interaction energy electrostatic interaction energy and interface polarity interaction energy 27 generally it is assumed that the mineral particles smaller than 20 Î¼m are spherical particles 28 29 therefore the illite particles used in the test can be approximately regarded as spheres with the radii of r the interaction energies between two spheres can be obtained based on eqs 7 8 and 9 van der

3 results and discussions 3 1 adsorption characteristics of illite for ca2 the adsorption effect of illite on ca2 was investigated by adding cacl2 solutions with different concentrations and the results can be seen in fig 3 as it is shown in fig 3 as adsorption time increases the whole process is divided into three stages rapid adsorption â‘  uniform adsorption â‘¡ and equilibrium adsorption â‘¢ illite adsorbed ca2 rapidly in the first 10 min and the adsorption rate was relatively uniform in 10 60 min when the adsorption time was greater than 60 min the adsorption amount was basically unchanged literature shows that 31 32 in the initial adsorption stage there are enough active sites and a large number of exchangeable ions on the illite surface at this time the adsorption curve showed a rapid rise and the adsorption amount increased sharply electricity neutralization reaction cation exchange reaction and secondary adsorption process gradually fix ca2 on the illite surface with the progress of adsorption reaction the active sites gradually reach saturation the concentration of exchangeable ions decreases and the adsorption capacity increases evenly till adsorption equilibrium is achieved it is consistent with the variation trend of stage â‘¡ and â‘¢ in the adsorption curve with the increase of ca2 concentration the exchange reaction between ca2 and illite interlayer ions in solution and the probability of characteristic adsorption between layers increase which makes the adsorption capacity of ca2 increase in addition according to the xps analysis thermo scientific k alpha spectrometer america alkÎ±x ray source the vacuum of the analysis chamber is approximately 5 10 9 mbar and the scanning mode of the analyzer is cae results of illite fig 4 before the adsorption of ca2 by illite the intensity of ca2p3 2 and ca2p3 1 peaks was relatively weak and the noise was relatively strong indicating that the calcium content in illite samples was low after the adsorption of ca2 the intensity of the two peaks increased significantly obviously ca2 adsorbed on illite resulted in the increase of calcium ions content meanwhile studies 33 34 have shown that ca2 chemisorbed on illite surface as the concentration of ca2 increases ca2 will gradually exist in the form of hydrophilic hydroxyl complexes and ca oh 2 precipitates in order to determine the best kinetic model for illite to adsorb ca2 adsorption test results were fitted and analyzed through quasi first order kinetic formula and quasi second order kinetic formula the adsorption kinetic fitting curve can be seen in fig 5 and the kinetic model fitting parameters in table 2 as it is shown in fig 5 and table 2 the correlation r 2 of the fitting curves of the quasi first order kinetic model and the quasi second order kinetic model are 0 945 and 0 994 respectively moreover the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e obtained via the quasi second order kinetic model is 4 34 mg g it is relatively similar to the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e obtained by the experiment demonstrating the adsorption process of illite to ca2 is more in accordance with the quasi second order kinetic model it is verified that the adsorption process of illite under different concentrations of ca2 can be described by the quasi second order kinetic model the quasi second order kinetic model is on the basis of the assumption that the adsorption rate is controlled by the chemisorption mechanism 35 so the control step of illite adsorption process for ca2 is mainly chemisorption in order to further study the adsorption behavior of illite on ca2 langmuir isothermal adsorption model and freundlich isothermal adsorption model were respectively used to fit the initial ca2 mass concentration of solution with the adsorption capacity of illite on ca2 the fitting curves were shown in fig 6 and the fitting parameters were shown in table 3 according to table 3 rl 2 rf 2 indicates that the adsorption process of illite on calcium ions is more consistent with langmuir isothermal adsorption model and the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity is 4 19 mg g which is not much different from the experimental value of 3 68 mg g since langmuir model describes single layer tiled surface adsorption while freundlich model describes multi layer physical adsorption it can be seen that the adsorption of calcium ions by illite in this study is mainly on the surface of monomolecular adsorption 3 2 sedimentation test of illite suspension the influence of ca2 concentration and ph on the sedimentation effect of illite suspension were investigated and the results can be found in fig 7 fig 7 clearly shows that as ca2 concentration increases the sedimentation rate of illite suspension under different ph conditions gradually increases with the increase of ca2 concentration indicating that ca2 can indeed effectively improve the sedimental effect of illite suspension at the same time ph will affect the sedimentation of illite suspension when ph 8 the sedimentation effect of illite suspension is the most significant and the highest sedimentation rate can reach 92 5 according to the hydrolysis logarithm diagram of ca2 36 ca2 exist in the form of ca2 under acidic conditions a large amount of h in the solution will form competitive adsorption with ca2 h occupies the surface sites of illite particles resulting in the weakening of the effect of ca2 compressing the electric double layer when ph 9 ca oh began to appear in the solution and the amount of free ca2 decreased which also reduced the compression effect of electric double layer therefore in the actual coal preparation process the ph of circulating water is usually in the range of 7 9 3 3 influence of ca2 on the surface properties of illite particles the adsorption of ca2 on illite will affect its surface properties such as charge distribution and pore structure characteristics which are macroscopically reflected by the change of zeta potential and contact angle the zeta potential and contact angle of illite adsorbed with different concentrations of ca2 were measured to study the influence of ca2 adsorption on surface properties of illite particles the results shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that under different ca2 concentration conditions the surface zeta potential of illite after adsorption equilibrium is negative indicating that the particle surface is always negatively charged as ca2 concentration increases the absolute value of zeta potential on illite surface first decreases and then tends to be flat when the concentration of ca2 is 10 mmol l the zeta potential is 6 8 mv according to the theory of diffusion electric double layer the surface of illite is negatively charged ca2 adsorbs on the surface of illite to maintain electrical neutrality therefore with the progress of adsorption reaction the number of negative charges in the surface charge of illite decreases continuously and the available adsorption sites on the illite surface decrease 37 at this time the solution state gradually tends to be stable and zeta potential remains basically unchanged as can be seen from fig 8 with the increase of ca2 concentration the contact angle first increases and then decreases and tends to be flat when the concentration was 10 mmol l the maximum contact angle was 39 the bet specific surface area of illite adsorbed calcium ions of different concentrations was measured by the bet method micromeritics asap 2460 3 01 american specific surface area analyzer adsorbent is nitrogen temperature is 198 85 c the results is shown in fig 9 the bet specific surface area of illite decreases with the increase of ca2 concentration that is as the adsorption reaction continues the specific surface area decreases and the contact angle increases 3 4 the influence of ca2 on the interaction energy between illite particles change of particle surface properties will directly affect the interaction between particles based on the test results of 3 3 interface interaction energy between illite particles under the condition of different concentrations of ca2 can be obtained based on the theory of edlvo and the change of interaction energy between particles after illite adsorbs and equilibrates ca2 with different concentrations is investigated the results can be found in fig 10 fig 10 a indicates that the van der waals interaction energy v f of illite particles adsorbing ca2 of different concentrations is less than 0 at different particle spacing h showing attraction energy with the increase of h v f decreases continuously and gradually tends to 0 when the cacl2 solution is not added the v f between illite particles is small which indicates the van der waals interaction energy is weakened as ca2 concentration increases the v f increases significantly indicating that the increase of ca2 adsorption capacity of illite increases the van der waals interaction energy between its particles as it is shown in fig 10 b at different particle spacing h the electrostatic interaction energy v e of illite particles adsorbed with different concentrations of ca 2 is greater than 0 showing repulsive energy with the increase of h v f decreases continuously and gradually tends to 0 when the particle spacing is less than 15 nm the v e between illite particles without adding cacl2 solution is obviously larger than that after adsorbing ca2 and the v e is tens of times of v f in order of magnitude with the increase of ca2 concentration v e decreases continuously which indicates that illite can effectively reduce the electrostatic interaction energy between particles after adsorbing ca2 as can be seen from fig 10 c at different particle spacing h the change rule of polar interaction energy v h after illite particles adsorb ca2 of different concentrations is basically consistent with electrostatic interaction energy the increase of ca2 concentration can significantly reduce the hydrophilic repulsion energy between particles and v h is dozens of times that of v e in order of magnitude which is the dominant interaction energy between particles therefore the repulsion between particles is significantly weakened after illite adsorbs ca2 fig 10 d indicates that the total action energy v t of illite particles at different particle spacing is greater than 0 showing repulsion with the increase of ca2 concentration the total interaction energy between illite particles decreases continuously based on the results of fig 10 a b and c only van der waals interaction energy is negative among the three interaction energies between illite particles and its value is far smaller than those of electrostatic interaction energy and polar interaction energy so the interaction between illite particles shows repulsive force the adsorption reaction of illite to ca2 can obviously reduce the total interaction energy between particles and promote the agglomeration of illite particles to sum up the calculation results of the theory of edlvo are basically consistent with the influence of ca2 on the interaction between illite particles obtained from the sedimentation test results it proves that the adsorption of illite ca2 can weaken the repulsive force between particles and polarity effect for main contribution although the total effect between particles can always negative in different spacing but it s true that calcium is advantageous to the illite particles deposition and further improves the treatment effect of coal slime water 4 conclusions equilibrium adsorption capacity of illite for ca2 is positively correlated with the concentration of ca2 when the concentration of ca2 is 2 10 mmol l and the adsorption process can be divided into three stages rapid adsorption uniform adsorption and adsorption equilibrium the adsorption process of illite for ca2 can be expressed by a quasi second order kinetic model and langmuir isothermal adsorption model ca2 can effectively improve the sedimental effect of illite suspension and the sedimental effect is the best when ph 8 the surface zeta potential of illite adsorbed with different concentrations of ca2 is always negative after reaching equilibrium the increase of ca2 concentration can reduce the absolute value of zeta potential and increase the contact angle under the conditions of different ca2 concentrations the van der waals interaction energy between illite particles is less than 0 while both the electrostatic interaction energy and the polar interaction energy are larger than 0 and the polar interaction energy is the dominant effect between particles which is expressed as particles mutually exclusive with the increase of ca2 concentration the van der waals attraction between illite particles increases the electrostatic and polar repulsion weakens the total energy decreases gradually therefore the repulsion between particles weakens which promotes the agglomeration of illite particles credit authorship contribution statement xiaohui yan conceptualization methodology software validation investigation writing original draft writing review editing

13463,clay minerals are the main reason why coal slime water is difficult to settle for the exploration of the influence of ca2 on the sedimentation effect of illite the adsorption characteristics of illite were investigated under different ca2 concentrations after adsorption equilibrium the sedimentation test was carried out and the changes in the surface properties of illite particles were analyzed by measuring zeta potential and contact angle the theory of edlvo was adopted to calculate the interaction energy between illite particles the results showed that with the increase of ca2 concentration the equilibrium adsorption capacity of illite increased and the adsorption equilibrium was basically achieved at 60 min the adsorption process was in accordance with the quasi second order kinetic model and langmuir isothermal adsorption model the sedimentation effect of illite was obviously improved after adsorption of ca2 when the concentration of ca2 was 10 mmol l and ph 8 the sedimentation rate was 92 5 with the increase of ca2 concentration the absolute value of the zeta potential of illite after adsorption equilibrium decreased continuously and the contact angle increased continuously according to the theory of edlvo the polar force is the dominant force affecting the interaction between particles as the concentration of ca2 increases the van der waals attraction force between illite particles increases the electrostatic and polar repulsive forces weaken and the total interaction energy gradually decreases indicating that ca2 can promote the agglomeration of illite particles which is of benefit to the clarification of coal slime water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords illite calcium ion adsorption sedimentation edlvo theory 1 introduction coal slime water treatment is a significant link during the production of the coal preparation plant and its treatment effect is related to the operation of washing water closed circulation system clay minerals in coal slime water are the main reason why it is difficult to clarify 1 at present most of the studies achieves condensation of fine particles by adding polyaluminum chloride polyacrylamide and other chemicals in coal slime water so that the clarification of coal slime water can be realized its mechanism of action is of adopting the bridging effect of organic polymers and relying on electrostatic bonds hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds to agglomerate fine particles to form large and fluffy flocs so as to achieve the effect of accelerating particles sedimentation 2 3 however this method has some shortcomings such as high production cost caused by large consumption of reagents and poor universality of reagents the literature 4 7 shows that when the content of metal cations in coal slime water is high it is conducive to the settlement of coal slime water mainly promoting the coagulation and sedimentation of clay particles according to the electroneutrality principle metal cations are bound to adsorb on the surface of negatively charged minerals to achieve electrical balance which compresses the electric double layer on the particle surface resulting in the decrease of repulsive force between particles which promotes the agglomeration of particles and finally the clarification effect of coal slime water is improved 8 9 regarding the study on the adsorption capacity of metal cations on clay minerals zhang et al 10 investigated the adsorption characteristics of kaolinite for different metal cations and the results showed that its adsorption capacity was ca2 mg2 k and na in turn which is also the reason why cacl2 and caso4 are commonly used in actual production liu et al 11 researched the sedimentation behavior of kaolinite montmorillonite and illite in brine environment the results showed that the sedimental effect of brine environment on the three clay minerals was improved sem analysis showed that the surfaces of the three clay minerals were smoother and the cracks gradually closed under the action of brine environment yu et al 12 studied the effects of ca2 and mg2 on the surface properties of coal and montmorillonite particles and concluded that both ca2 and mg2 can reduce the zeta potential of coal and montmorillonite especially ca2 and the influence of ca2 on the zeta potential of montmorillonite is obviously stronger than mg2 in order to investigate the sedimentation behavior of clay minerals after adsorbing metal cations bai et al 13 added na k and other cations into coal slime water and observed the movement behavior of clay particles with sem eds it was found that after na k and other cations were adsorbed on the surface of clay minerals the agglomeration between clay particles was strengthened and flocs were gradually formed effectively improving the clarification effect of coal slime water to sum up the adsorption of metal cations in water by clay minerals changes the surface properties of particles which changes the interaction energy between particles and affects the sedimentation effect in view of the change of interaction energy between clay particles after adsorption of metal cations jean marie 14 investigated the influence of ca2 concentration on the stability behavior of colloidal particles and concluded that cacl2 concentration in the range of 0 5 3 mm can intensify particle aggregation with the increase of ca2 concentration the interaction potential energy between clay particles calculated by dlvo theory gradually decreases the above research verifies microscopically that metal cations contribute to the sedimentation of clay mineral particles under certain conditions the interaction force between particles in colloidal systems is usually calculated by dlvo theory including van der waals force and electrostatic force between particles but there is still interfacial polar interaction force in actual colloidal systems the order of magnitude of which is tens of times that of electrostatic force 15 the theory of edlvo includes van der waals force electrostatic force and interfacial polar interaction force so it is more accurate to use the theory of edlvo to calculate the force between particles in coal slime water illite is one of the typical clay minerals in coal slime water which is easy to slime in coal slime water to form fine and ultra fine particles the isomorphic phenomenon makes its surface negative charge more which makes it difficult to clarify coal slime water 16 in this paper illite was taken as the research object the adsorption effect of illite on ca2 was investigated the adsorption kinetics was analyzed the best adsorption model was determined and the adsorption characteristics of illite to ca2 are obtained sedimentation test was carried out after adsorption equilibrium contact angle tester and micro electrophoresis instrument were used to measure the changes of particle surface properties before and after adsorption combined with the theory of edlvo the curves of different interaction energies between illite particles and particle spacing were calculated the influence of different ca2 concentrations on the interaction energy between illite particles was analyzed and the mechanism of ca2 interaction between illite particles was revealed which is of great significance to improve the

interaction energy electrostatic interaction energy and interface polarity interaction energy 27 generally it is assumed that the mineral particles smaller than 20 Î¼m are spherical particles 28 29 therefore the illite particles used in the test can be approximately regarded as spheres with the radii of r the interaction energies between two spheres can be obtained based on eqs 7 8 and 9 van der

3 results and discussions 3 1 adsorption characteristics of illite for ca2 the adsorption effect of illite on ca2 was investigated by adding cacl2 solutions with different concentrations and the results can be seen in fig 3 as it is shown in fig 3 as adsorption time increases the whole process is divided into three stages rapid adsorption â‘  uniform adsorption â‘¡ and equilibrium adsorption â‘¢ illite adsorbed ca2 rapidly in the first 10 min and the adsorption rate was relatively uniform in 10 60 min when the adsorption time was greater than 60 min the adsorption amount was basically unchanged literature shows that 31 32 in the initial adsorption stage there are enough active sites and a large number of exchangeable ions on the illite surface at this time the adsorption curve showed a rapid rise and the adsorption amount increased sharply electricity neutralization reaction cation exchange reaction and secondary adsorption process gradually fix ca2 on the illite surface with the progress of adsorption reaction the active sites gradually reach saturation the concentration of exchangeable ions decreases and the adsorption capacity increases evenly till adsorption equilibrium is achieved it is consistent with the variation trend of stage â‘¡ and â‘¢ in the adsorption curve with the increase of ca2 concentration the exchange reaction between ca2 and illite interlayer ions in solution and the probability of characteristic adsorption between layers increase which makes the adsorption capacity of ca2 increase in addition according to the xps analysis thermo scientific k alpha spectrometer america alkÎ±x ray source the vacuum of the analysis chamber is approximately 5 10 9 mbar and the scanning mode of the analyzer is cae results of illite fig 4 before the adsorption of ca2 by illite the intensity of ca2p3 2 and ca2p3 1 peaks was relatively weak and the noise was relatively strong indicating that the calcium content in illite samples was low after the adsorption of ca2 the intensity of the two peaks increased significantly obviously ca2 adsorbed on illite resulted in the increase of calcium ions content meanwhile studies 33 34 have shown that ca2 chemisorbed on illite surface as the concentration of ca2 increases ca2 will gradually exist in the form of hydrophilic hydroxyl complexes and ca oh 2 precipitates in order to determine the best kinetic model for illite to adsorb ca2 adsorption test results were fitted and analyzed through quasi first order kinetic formula and quasi second order kinetic formula the adsorption kinetic fitting curve can be seen in fig 5 and the kinetic model fitting parameters in table 2 as it is shown in fig 5 and table 2 the correlation r 2 of the fitting curves of the quasi first order kinetic model and the quasi second order kinetic model are 0 945 and 0 994 respectively moreover the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e obtained via the quasi second order kinetic model is 4 34 mg g it is relatively similar to the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e obtained by the experiment demonstrating the adsorption process of illite to ca2 is more in accordance with the quasi second order kinetic model it is verified that the adsorption process of illite under different concentrations of ca2 can be described by the quasi second order kinetic model the quasi second order kinetic model is on the basis of the assumption that the adsorption rate is controlled by the chemisorption mechanism 35 so the control step of illite adsorption process for ca2 is mainly chemisorption in order to further study the adsorption behavior of illite on ca2 langmuir isothermal adsorption model and freundlich isothermal adsorption model were respectively used to fit the initial ca2 mass concentration of solution with the adsorption capacity of illite on ca2 the fitting curves were shown in fig 6 and the fitting parameters were shown in table 3 according to table 3 rl 2 rf 2 indicates that the adsorption process of illite on calcium ions is more consistent with langmuir isothermal adsorption model and the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity is 4 19 mg g which is not much different from the experimental value of 3 68 mg g since langmuir model describes single layer tiled surface adsorption while freundlich model describes multi layer physical adsorption it can be seen that the adsorption of calcium ions by illite in this study is mainly on the surface of monomolecular adsorption 3 2 sedimentation test of illite suspension the influence of ca2 concentration and ph on the sedimentation effect of illite suspension were investigated and the results can be found in fig 7 fig 7 clearly shows that as ca2 concentration increases the sedimentation rate of illite suspension under different ph conditions gradually increases with the increase of ca2 concentration indicating that ca2 can indeed effectively improve the sedimental effect of illite suspension at the same time ph will affect the sedimentation of illite suspension when ph 8 the sedimentation effect of illite suspension is the most significant and the highest sedimentation rate can reach 92 5 according to the hydrolysis logarithm diagram of ca2 36 ca2 exist in the form of ca2 under acidic conditions a large amount of h in the solution will form competitive adsorption with ca2 h occupies the surface sites of illite particles resulting in the weakening of the effect of ca2 compressing the electric double layer when ph 9 ca oh began to appear in the solution and the amount of free ca2 decreased which also reduced the compression effect of electric double layer therefore in the actual coal preparation process the ph of circulating water is usually in the range of 7 9 3 3 influence of ca2 on the surface properties of illite particles the adsorption of ca2 on illite will affect its surface properties such as charge distribution and pore structure characteristics which are macroscopically reflected by the change of zeta potential and contact angle the zeta potential and contact angle of illite adsorbed with different concentrations of ca2 were measured to study the influence of ca2 adsorption on surface properties of illite particles the results shown in fig 8 fig 8 shows that under different ca2 concentration conditions the surface zeta potential of illite after adsorption equilibrium is negative indicating that the particle surface is always negatively charged as ca2 concentration increases the absolute value of zeta potential on illite surface first decreases and then tends to be flat when the concentration of ca2 is 10 mmol l the zeta potential is 6 8 mv according to the theory of diffusion electric double layer the surface of illite is negatively charged ca2 adsorbs on the surface of illite to maintain electrical neutrality therefore with the progress of adsorption reaction the number of negative charges in the surface charge of illite decreases continuously and the available adsorption sites on the illite surface decrease 37 at this time the solution state gradually tends to be stable and zeta potential remains basically unchanged as can be seen from fig 8 with the increase of ca2 concentration the contact angle first increases and then decreases and tends to be flat when the concentration was 10 mmol l the maximum contact angle was 39 the bet specific surface area of illite adsorbed calcium ions of different concentrations was measured by the bet method micromeritics asap 2460 3 01 american specific surface area analyzer adsorbent is nitrogen temperature is 198 85 c the results is shown in fig 9 the bet specific surface area of illite decreases with the increase of ca2 concentration that is as the adsorption reaction continues the specific surface area decreases and the contact angle increases 3 4 the influence of ca2 on the interaction energy between illite particles change of particle surface properties will directly affect the interaction between particles based on the test results of 3 3 interface interaction energy between illite particles under the condition of different concentrations of ca2 can be obtained based on the theory of edlvo and the change of interaction energy between particles after illite adsorbs and equilibrates ca2 with different concentrations is investigated the results can be found in fig 10 fig 10 a indicates that the van der waals interaction energy v f of illite particles adsorbing ca2 of different concentrations is less than 0 at different particle spacing h showing attraction energy with the increase of h v f decreases continuously and gradually tends to 0 when the cacl2 solution is not added the v f between illite particles is small which indicates the van der waals interaction energy is weakened as ca2 concentration increases the v f increases significantly indicating that the increase of ca2 adsorption capacity of illite increases the van der waals interaction energy between its particles as it is shown in fig 10 b at different particle spacing h the electrostatic interaction energy v e of illite particles adsorbed with different concentrations of ca 2 is greater than 0 showing repulsive energy with the increase of h v f decreases continuously and gradually tends to 0 when the particle spacing is less than 15 nm the v e between illite particles without adding cacl2 solution is obviously larger than that after adsorbing ca2 and the v e is tens of times of v f in order of magnitude with the increase of ca2 concentration v e decreases continuously which indicates that illite can effectively reduce the electrostatic interaction energy between particles after adsorbing ca2 as can be seen from fig 10 c at different particle spacing h the change rule of polar interaction energy v h after illite particles adsorb ca2 of different concentrations is basically consistent with electrostatic interaction energy the increase of ca2 concentration can significantly reduce the hydrophilic repulsion energy between particles and v h is dozens of times that of v e in order of magnitude which is the dominant interaction energy between particles therefore the repulsion between particles is significantly weakened after illite adsorbs ca2 fig 10 d indicates that the total action energy v t of illite particles at different particle spacing is greater than 0 showing repulsion with the increase of ca2 concentration the total interaction energy between illite particles decreases continuously based on the results of fig 10 a b and c only van der waals interaction energy is negative among the three interaction energies between illite particles and its value is far smaller than those of electrostatic interaction energy and polar interaction energy so the interaction between illite particles shows repulsive force the adsorption reaction of illite to ca2 can obviously reduce the total interaction energy between particles and promote the agglomeration of illite particles to sum up the calculation results of the theory of edlvo are basically consistent with the influence of ca2 on the interaction between illite particles obtained from the sedimentation test results it proves that the adsorption of illite ca2 can weaken the repulsive force between particles and polarity effect for main contribution although the total effect between particles can always negative in different spacing but it s true that calcium is advantageous to the illite particles deposition and further improves the treatment effect of coal slime water 4 conclusions equilibrium adsorption capacity of illite for ca2 is positively correlated with the concentration of ca2 when the concentration of ca2 is 2 10 mmol l and the adsorption process can be divided into three stages rapid adsorption uniform adsorption and adsorption equilibrium the adsorption process of illite for ca2 can be expressed by a quasi second order kinetic model and langmuir isothermal adsorption model ca2 can effectively improve the sedimental effect of illite suspension and the sedimental effect is the best when ph 8 the surface zeta potential of illite adsorbed with different concentrations of ca2 is always negative after reaching equilibrium the increase of ca2 concentration can reduce the absolute value of zeta potential and increase the contact angle under the conditions of different ca2 concentrations the van der waals interaction energy between illite particles is less than 0 while both the electrostatic interaction energy and the polar interaction energy are larger than 0 and the polar interaction energy is the dominant effect between particles which is expressed as particles mutually exclusive with the increase of ca2 concentration the van der waals attraction between illite particles increases the electrostatic and polar repulsion weakens the total energy decreases gradually therefore the repulsion between particles weakens which promotes the agglomeration of illite particles credit authorship contribution statement xiaohui yan conceptualization methodology software validation investigation writing original draft writing review editing

13464,the feasibility of enhancing anammox enrichment in sewage treatment through fixed biofilm was investigated in this study two reactors were used to treat real domestic sewage and operated in an identical mode one is a sequencing biofilm batch reactor sbbr with blank carriers and the other is a sequencing batch reactor sbr without carriers after anammox sludge inoculation and 160 days operation the abundance of the anammox bacteria increased to 2 58 109 gene copies g dry sludge in the biofilm of sbbr but decreased to 8 18 107 gene copies g dry sludge in the activated sludge of sbr the nitrogen removal efficiency nre of sbbr and sbr was 79 3 and 57 9 respectively further analysis suggests that the partial nitrification was stabilized in sbbr due to the addition of carriers and the dominating nitrogen removal pathway was the anammox reaction in general the fixed biofilm effectively maintained and enriched the anammox bacteria which benefitted the start up and steady operation of the sewage partial nitrification anammox pna process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords enrichment of anammox bacteria fixed biofilm real domestic sewage sbbr partial nitrification anammox 1 introduction as a novel wastewater treatment methodology the anammox process can simultaneously convert ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen in sewage into nitrogen completing an autotrophic denitrification process 1 partial nitrification pn coupled with an anammox process has many advantages compared with traditional nitrification denitrification process including a 60 decrease in aeration energy consumption a 100 decrease in the organic carbon source and a 90 decrease in sludge production 2 3 thus the partial nitrification anammox pna process has become a cost and energy efficient methodology 4 5 furthermore excess organic matter in wastewater can be transformed and utilized to produce energy gas 6 7 the pna process has been numerously practiced in treat high ammonium nitrogen wastewater 8 which includes a suspended sludge process 9 10 and a biofilm process 11 12 when applying anammox to treat low ammonium nitrogen wastewater start up and stable operations are difficult because anammox bacteria grow slowly 13 15 several approaches have been proposed to enrich anammox bacteria in sewage treatment and direct bioaugmentation of anammox sludge is one of the reasonable approaches in which biomass from a side stream anammox system could be retained and bio enhanced into the mainstream system 16 but continuously obtaining anammox sludge is necessary but remains difficult since a loss of anammox sludge from conventional sewage treatment seems inevitable 14 17 as another approach biofilm has been used to effectively retain anammox bacteria since it provides various favorable conditions 18 20 biofilm 10 mm carrier usually has high biomass retention capabilities and provides sufficient anaerobic conditions to support anaerobic bacteria 21 further strong oxygen limitations substrate gradients and sludge segregation of the biofilm effectively restrain nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activity 22 24 favoring a stable operation of pna different biofilm reactors have been adopted to apply the sewage anammox process including the sbbr or integrated fixed biofilm activated sludge reactor 25 27 lv et al 28 used self designed carriers a polypropylene spherical shell filled with zeolites and floating foam and successfully realized a stable operation of pna in the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr treating low strength wastewater the addition of the carrier has been confirmed to promote the enrichment of anammox bacteria and improve autotrophic nitrogen removal performance 29 33 nevertheless the mechanism involved in biofilm enhancing sewage pna remains unclear since sewage anammox is favored by both bioaugmentation and biofilm involvement simultaneous adding carriers and limited anammox sludge is expected to support the rapid start up of sewage pna system however few studies have been conducted especially direct experiments using real sewage in this study anammox sludge and partial nitrification denitrification sludge were inoculated into two reactors to start up pna with domestic sewage sponge carriers were added to one reactor named sbbr to enhance the formation of the anammox biofilm the other reactor named sbr was operated under identical conditions but no carriers were added nitrogen removal performance of both reactors were investigated besides microbial activity and abundance of functional bacteria were measured and compared to explore the significance of the carriers on the mainstream pna system this study provides insights and recommendations for applying the pna process to treat low ammonium nitrogen sewage 2 materials and methods 2 1 establishment and operation of two reactors two reactors the sbbr and the sbr were operated in parallel and both were made of plexiglass with an effective volume of 10 l a height of 45 cm and an inner diameter of 19 cm light shielding tape on the outside of the reactors was used to protect light sensitive anammox bacteria the volumetric exchange ratio was 50 probes were fixed inside the reactors for real time monitoring of dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph fig s1 shows the detailed structures of two reactors the reactors were operated through anaerobic aerobic anoxic modes wastewater was injected for 10 min anaerobic stirring was conducted for 120 min aeration was conducted for 240 360 min anoxic stirring was conducted for 120 min sedimentation time was 10 min and discharge period was 2 min the two reactors were operated under the same conditions however only the sbbr was filled with blank polyurethane sponge carriers with a volume of 2 l the density specific surface area and porosity of the polyurethane sponge carriers are 0 0271 g cm3 159 cm2 g 27 8 respectively the long term operation of the two reactors was performed in two phases phase i was 40 days long the operating conditions of the two reactors were same and an aeration rate of 60 ml min was adopted at the beginning of phase ii day 41 160 blank carriers were added into the sbbr the aeration rates in the two reactors gradually increased at the same speed 90 ml min day 41 100 120 ml min day101 130 150 ml min day 131 160 throughout the experiment the temperatures of two reactors were maintained at 25 3 c without being controlled no activated sludge was intentionally discharged from the two reactors except the sbr from day 131 160 during the specific period 100 ml mixed sludge were separated using a screen 200 Î¼m every day two cycles and only flocs were discharged according to previous studies 34 35 discharging flocculent sludge could suppress and washout nob and anammox bacteria was not affected since inoculated sludge was granular in this study therefore discharging flocs might relieve the deterioration of partial nitrification 2 2 inoculated sludges and influent wastewater two types of sludge were used to start up both reactors one was the anammox granule sludge domesticated with low concentration substrate synthetic wastewater in a uasb for more than 3 years the other was the partial nitrification denitrification floc sludge from a pilot reactor treating real sewage the nitrite accumulation ratio in the pilot reactor has been maintained above 70 for more than 2 years the two kinds of sludges were mingled at a volumetric ratio of 3 1 based on measured activity the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of the inoculated sludge were approximately 3500 mg l and 2100 mg l respectively the influent wastewater was domestic sewage which outflowing from the septic tank the characteristics of the real domestic sewage were as follows the ph was 7 2 7 6 the average c n was 2 7 the average cod concentration was 130 9 mg l the nh4 n concentration was 40 4 55 7 mg n l and the no2 n and no3 n concentrations were lower than 1 0 mg n l 2 3 analytical methods all samples were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m filter paper and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before analysis the mlss mlvss and nh4 n no2 n no3 n concentrations were determined using normative methods 36 the cod concentration was determined using a cod tester lianhua tech co china the temperature ph and do concentration were determined in real time using a wtw 3420 wtw company germany 2 4 dna extraction and real time qpcr a qpcr analysis was performed on the samples from the two reactors on days

3500 real time pcr apparatus agilent technologies usa table s1 shows the oligonucleotide sequence of primer and annealing temperatures 2 5 batch tests for bacterial activity determination batch tests at each phase were used to assess the variation in the potential activity of the functional microorganisms to conduct the batch tests 1 l sludge was collected from each reactor and placed in a separate 1 l reactor after being washed three times with distilled water the temperature was controlled at the same temperature of the main reactor to acquire the activity of the anammox bacteria the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were initially set at approximately 20 mg n l other essential trace elements were simultaneously added the reactors were stirred with a magnetic stirrer ika reo germany for 3 h under anaerobic conditions samples were collected every 20 min to measure cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations and mlvss a similar process was implemented to acquire the activity of aob and nob the nh4 and no2 concentrations were initially set around 20 mg n l and 10 mg n l and other essential trace elements were simultaneously added the sbr was aerated for 3 h with a do concentration of 4 5 mg o2 l samples were collected every 15 min to measure nitrogen compounds concentration 2 6 in situ activity test the implementation of the in situ activity test was to explore the main nitrogen removal pathway during the aerobic stage in the two reactors the influent wastewater was the pre treated domestic sewage with a cod concentration blow 30 mg n l but unchanged ammonium concentration the two reactors were aerated for 3 h after feeding and samples were collected every 30 min to analyze 2 7 calculation method the calculation method of total inorganic nitrogen

results and discussion 3 1 system operation performance during the preliminary days of the pna process start up stage the effluent nh4 n concentration of the two reactors changed inconsistently and the nre remained at a low level the average nre of the two reactors in phase i were 26 9 fig 1 and 24 4 fig s2 respectively the nitrate generation ratio of the two reactors increased under the identical operating conditions and exceeded the theoretical value of 11 38 this indicated that the partial nitrification was likely to deteriorate at the beginning of phase ii blank polyurethane sponge carriers were placed into one reactor the sbbr the aeration rate was increased and the nitrate generation ratio quickly dropped to 15 within 10 days as shown in fig 1 the effluent nh4 n concentration continuously decreased in the sbrr and the nitrate generation ratio eventually stabilized at approximately 26 the nre of the sbbr increased from 26 9 to 79 3 table 1 the nrr during the aerobic stage increased from 0 17 to 0 53 mg n gvss h fig s3 the sbbr achieved a steady nitrogen removal performance fig s4 shows that the sludge gradually adhered to the blank carriers the sludge layer gradually thickened and the color of the carriers gradually deepened suggesting successful formation of biofilm on the blank carriers although a stepwise decrease in the mass percentage of suspended sludge was observed the total biomass concentration increased significantly due to the biofilm formation the total biomass concentration of sbrr was higher than that in the sbr since sludge washout was avoided table s2 the positive effect of adding carrier for biomass retention is consistent to previous studies 33 39 for the sbr the average effluent nh4 n concentration decreased but effluent no3 n concentration increased to more than 10 mg n l with the nitrate generation ratio reaching almost 100 the average nre and the average nrr during the aerobic stage of the sbr in phase ii was 49 6 and 0 11 mg n gvss h which were much lower when compared to the sbbr due to the absence of biofilm 40 41 although the influent cod concentration fluctuated the average effluent cod concentration of the sbbr and sbr remained at approximately 29 8 and 30 1 mg l respectively the average cod removal efficiencies of the sbbr and sbr were 76 7 and 77 0 table 1 respectively suggesting both reactors achieved good organics removal performance 3 2 analysis and comparison of microbial abundance and activity 3 2 1 variations in microbial abundance after a long term operation the abundance of anammox bacteria in sbbr was 2 58 109 gene copies g dry sludge which was significantly higher than that of the sbr 8 18 107 gene copies g dry sludge fig 2 a for nitrifiers variations the abundance of aob in sbbr and sbr were 9 61 108 and 7 97 107 gene copies g dry sludge respectively fig 3 b but nob nitrobacter nitrospira abundance in the two reactors were similar fig 3c and d as revealed by the microbial abundance variations the anammox bacteria were enriched in sbbr while gradually lost from the sbr adding the carriers presented a positive enrichment effect on anammox bacteria and aob especially anammox bacteria sufficient biomass of anammox bacteria was very important for the stable operation of pna process 31 33 42 3 2 2 activity changes of anammox bacteria aob and nob in phase i of days 1 to 40 the changes in activity levels of the anammox bacteria aob and nob were similar in the two reactors fig 3 in phase ii the total anammox bacteria activity successively improved in the sbbr which was consistent to the variations of anammox bacteria abundance the differences between aob and nob activity became larger which was consistent with the stable partial nitrification and good autotrophic nitrogen removal performance of sbbr in contrast in the sbr anammox decreased and the dominance of aob over nitrifiers became insignificant inducing the deterioration of the partial nitrification as well as anammox reaction finally the maximum anammox activity of the sbbr and sbr reactors were 12 1 and 5 6 mg n l h respectively adding the carriers was favorable to maintain stable anammox and aob activity besides the activity of nob was suppressed in biofilm despite of a high abundance of nob 43 3 2 3 nitrogen removal mechanism in the two reactors typical cyclic tests were performed and nitrogen removal mainly occurred at the aerobic stage fig 4 in the sbbr the nh4 n concentration decreased by 21 1 mg n l with a specific ammonium removal rate of 0 86 mg n gvss h although a higher ammonium removal rate of 1 3 mg n gvss h was observed in the sbr a low nre in the sbr was obtained since the amount of no3 n generated was larger the nrr during the aerobic stage in the sbbr and sbr reactors were 0 67 and 0 28 mg n gvss h respectively in addition in the anoxic stage of the two reactors both nh4 n and no3 n decreased at the same time but the decrease of total nitrogen was relatively weaker when compared to aerobic phase results of in situ activity tests fig 5 showed that variations of the nitrogen levels in the reactors were consistent with the aerobic stage of the typical cycle when influent organics were pre removed a similar level nitrate generation ratio fig 5 was obtained as day 160 24 78 suggesting nitrogen removal was mainly through autotrophic nitrogen removal pathway the nrr during the in situ activity test in the sbbr and sbr were 0 54 and 0 21 mg n gvss h respectively which were slightly lower than the typical cycle thus the anammox was the primary nitrogen removal pathway in the sbbr and denitrifiers contributed to part nitrogen removal through complete denitrification or anammox cooperation 44 the maximum ratio of the nitrogen removed by the anammox to the nitrogen removed throughout one cycle was 90 2 the maximum ratio of the nitrogen removed by the anammox throughout the aerobic stage achieved a level of 85 2 the specific nitrogen removal pathway needs to be further researched and analyzed 3 3 the mechanism of anammox bacteria enrichment and practical application feasibility after the blank carriers were put into the sbbr and biofilm was formed the total activity and abundance of anammox bacteria gradually increased and maintained at higher levels compared to the sbr without carrier addition this outcome was directly related to the positive nitrogen removal performance in the sbbr first the competitiveness of anammox bacteria became stronger because of the adhesion force generated by specific substances such as extracellular polymeric substances 45 besides increased aeration rate facilitated aob activity as well as the nitrogen removal rate 46 it was also noticed that the activity of nob was suppressed although the abundance of nob was high which might due to the special construction of biofilm 41 47 second the anaerobic aerobic anoxic operational mode may important to maintaining the stable nitrogen removal performance since it could combine autotrophic nitrogen removal with endogenous denitrification 48 lastly although the activated sludge was not intentionally discharged suspended flocs sludge was washed out from the sbbr the decrease of flocs sludge might favor the washout of heterotrophic bacteria reducing the competition for nitrite with anammox bacteria 34 35 37 49 the successful start up of the pna process generally begins with inoculation with sludge from the pna system or combination of both nitrification sludge and anammox sludge 2 50 but the start up of the pna system usually takes a long time and the stable operation is difficult 51 in this study we started up the sewage pna system by inoculating the appropriate sludge and blank carriers the method of adding carriers is simple and convenient supporting a practical engineering practice for sewage pn a process anammox sludge can be obtained from a side stream treatment and stable operation is expected when carriers are added and aoa operational mode is adopted 52 in future studies continuous research on the parameters and operational optimization of the biofilm pna processes is still required which is useful for the efficient and energy saving treatment of low ammonia nitrogen wastewater 4 conclusions in this study two different reactors were inoculated with both partial nitrification sludge and anammox sludge before treating domestic sewage the nitrogen removal performance of the two sbrs were investigated and compared the sbbr with blank carriers was successfully started up in 70 days and maintained a stable and efficient treatment effect adding blank carriers benefitted the anammox bacteria enrichment this resulted in higher abundance and activity of the anammox bacteria in the sbbr than in the sbr partial nitrification was stable and the anammox was the dominating nitrogen removal pathway in the sbbr the adding carriers facilitated the optimization

completing an autotrophic denitrification process 1 partial nitrification pn coupled with an anammox process has many advantages compared with traditional nitrification denitrification process including a 60 decrease in aeration energy consumption a 100 decrease in the organic carbon source and a 90 decrease in sludge production 2 3 thus the partial nitrification anammox pna process has become a cost and energy efficient methodology 4 5 furthermore excess organic matter in wastewater can be transformed and utilized to produce energy gas 6 7 the pna process has been numerously practiced in treat high ammonium nitrogen wastewater 8 which includes a suspended sludge process 9 10 and a biofilm process 11 12 when applying anammox to treat low ammonium nitrogen wastewater start up and stable operations are difficult because anammox bacteria grow slowly 13 15 several approaches have been proposed to enrich anammox bacteria in sewage treatment and direct bioaugmentation of anammox sludge is one of the reasonable approaches in which biomass from a side stream anammox system could be retained and bio enhanced into the mainstream system 16 but continuously obtaining anammox sludge is necessary but remains difficult since a loss of anammox sludge from conventional sewage treatment seems inevitable 14 17 as another approach biofilm has been used to effectively retain anammox bacteria since it provides various favorable conditions 18 20 biofilm 10 mm carrier usually has high biomass retention capabilities and provides sufficient anaerobic conditions to support anaerobic bacteria 21 further strong oxygen limitations substrate gradients and sludge segregation of the biofilm effectively restrain nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activity 22 24 favoring a stable operation of pna different biofilm reactors have been adopted to apply the sewage anammox process including the sbbr or integrated fixed biofilm activated sludge reactor 25 27 lv et al 28 used self designed carriers a polypropylene spherical shell filled with zeolites and floating foam and successfully realized a stable operation of pna in the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr treating low strength wastewater the addition of the carrier has been confirmed to promote the enrichment of anammox bacteria and improve autotrophic nitrogen removal performance 29 33 nevertheless the mechanism involved in biofilm enhancing sewage pna remains unclear since sewage anammox is favored by both bioaugmentation and biofilm involvement simultaneous adding carriers and limited anammox sludge is expected to support the rapid start up of sewage pna system however few studies have been conducted especially direct experiments using real sewage in this study anammox sludge and partial nitrification denitrification sludge were inoculated into two reactors to start up pna with domestic sewage sponge carriers were added to one reactor named sbbr to enhance the formation of the anammox biofilm the other reactor named sbr was operated under identical conditions but no carriers were added nitrogen removal performance of both reactors were investigated besides microbial activity and abundance of functional bacteria were measured and compared to explore the significance of the carriers on the mainstream pna system this study provides insights and recommendations for applying the pna process to treat low ammonium nitrogen sewage 2 materials and methods 2 1 establishment and operation of two reactors two reactors the sbbr and the sbr were operated in parallel and both were made of plexiglass with an effective volume of 10 l a height of 45 cm and an inner diameter of 19 cm light shielding tape on the outside of the reactors was used to protect light sensitive anammox bacteria the volumetric exchange ratio was 50 probes were fixed inside the reactors for real time monitoring of dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph fig s1 shows the detailed structures of two reactors the reactors were operated through anaerobic aerobic anoxic modes wastewater was injected for 10 min anaerobic stirring was conducted for 120 min aeration was conducted for 240 360 min anoxic stirring was conducted for 120 min sedimentation time was 10 min and discharge period was 2 min the two reactors were operated under the same conditions however only the sbbr was filled with blank polyurethane sponge carriers with a volume of 2 l the density specific surface area and porosity of the polyurethane sponge carriers are 0 0271 g cm3 159 cm2 g 27 8 respectively the long term operation of the two reactors was performed in two phases phase i was 40 days long the operating conditions of the two reactors were same and an aeration rate of 60 ml min was adopted at the beginning of phase ii day 41 160 blank carriers were added into the sbbr the aeration rates in the two reactors gradually increased at the same speed 90 ml min day 41 100 120 ml min day101 130 150 ml min day 131 160 throughout the experiment the temperatures of two reactors were maintained at 25 3 c without being controlled no activated sludge was intentionally discharged from the two reactors except the sbr from day 131 160 during the specific period 100 ml mixed sludge were separated using a screen 200 Î¼m every day two cycles and only flocs were discharged according to previous studies 34 35 discharging flocculent sludge could suppress and washout nob and anammox bacteria was not affected since inoculated sludge was granular in this study therefore discharging flocs might relieve the deterioration of partial nitrification 2 2 inoculated sludges and influent wastewater two types of sludge were used to start up both reactors one was the anammox granule sludge domesticated with low concentration substrate synthetic wastewater in a uasb for more than 3 years the other was the partial nitrification denitrification floc sludge from a pilot reactor treating real sewage the nitrite accumulation ratio in the pilot reactor has been maintained above 70 for more than 2 years the two kinds of sludges were mingled at a volumetric ratio of 3 1 based on measured activity the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of the inoculated sludge were approximately 3500 mg l and 2100 mg l respectively the influent wastewater was domestic sewage which outflowing from the septic tank the characteristics of the real domestic sewage were as follows the ph was 7 2 7 6 the average c n was 2 7 the average cod concentration was 130 9 mg l the nh4 n concentration was 40 4 55 7 mg n l and the no2 n and no3 n concentrations were lower than 1 0 mg n l 2 3 analytical methods all samples were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m filter paper and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before analysis the mlss mlvss and nh4 n no2 n no3 n concentrations were determined using normative methods 36 the cod concentration was determined using a cod tester lianhua tech co china the temperature ph and do concentration were determined in real time using a wtw 3420 wtw company germany 2 4 dna extraction and real time qpcr a qpcr analysis was performed on the samples from the two reactors on days 0 40 70 100 130 and 160 to assess the changes in the abundance of functional microorganisms sludge samples were freeze dried labconco co usa and dna was extracted using a fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa genomic dna was obtained using dissociation homogenization purification and elution the dna concentration in each extracted sample was measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa to assess whether the extraction purity met the requirements of real time qpcr with sybr green dyeing the mixed liquid system included sterile water 7 Î¼l sybr green extaq 10 Î¼l rox reference dye50 0 4 Î¼l and primer 0 3 Î¼l each 10 Î¼mol l plasmid or samples were added into the mixed liquid system then the levels of different bacteria were measured using an agilent mx 3500 real time pcr apparatus agilent technologies usa table s1 shows the oligonucleotide sequence of primer and annealing temperatures 2 5 batch tests for bacterial activity determination batch tests at each phase were used to assess the variation in the potential activity of the functional microorganisms to conduct the batch tests 1 l sludge was collected from each reactor and placed in a separate 1 l reactor after being washed three times with distilled water the temperature was controlled at the same temperature of the main reactor to acquire the activity of the anammox bacteria the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were initially set at approximately 20 mg n l other essential trace elements were simultaneously added the reactors were stirred with a magnetic stirrer ika reo germany for 3 h under anaerobic conditions samples were collected every 20 min to measure cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations and mlvss a similar process was implemented to acquire the activity of aob and nob the nh4 and no2 concentrations were initially set around 20 mg n l and 10 mg n l and other essential trace elements were simultaneously added the sbr was aerated for 3 h with a do concentration of 4 5 mg o2 l samples were collected every 15 min to measure nitrogen compounds concentration 2 6 in situ activity test the implementation of the in situ activity test was to explore the main nitrogen removal pathway during the aerobic stage in the two reactors the influent wastewater was the pre treated domestic sewage with a cod concentration blow 30 mg n l but unchanged ammonium concentration the two reactors were aerated for 3 h after feeding and samples were collected every 30 min to analyze 2 7 calculation method the calculation method of total inorganic nitrogen

results and discussion 3 1 system operation performance during the preliminary days of the pna process start up stage the effluent nh4 n concentration of the two reactors changed inconsistently and the nre remained at a low level the average nre of the two reactors in phase i were 26 9 fig 1 and 24 4 fig s2 respectively the nitrate generation ratio of the two reactors increased under the identical operating conditions and exceeded the theoretical value of 11 38 this indicated that the partial nitrification was likely to deteriorate at the beginning of phase ii blank polyurethane sponge carriers were placed into one reactor the sbbr the aeration rate was increased and the nitrate generation ratio quickly dropped to 15 within 10 days as shown in fig 1 the effluent nh4 n concentration continuously decreased in the sbrr and the nitrate generation ratio eventually stabilized at approximately 26 the nre of the sbbr increased from 26 9 to 79 3 table 1 the nrr during the aerobic stage increased from 0 17 to 0 53 mg n gvss h fig s3 the sbbr achieved a steady nitrogen removal performance fig s4 shows that the sludge gradually adhered to the blank carriers the sludge layer gradually thickened and the color of the carriers gradually deepened suggesting successful formation of biofilm on the blank carriers although a stepwise decrease in the mass percentage of suspended sludge was observed the total biomass concentration increased significantly due to the biofilm formation the total biomass concentration of sbrr was higher than that in the sbr since sludge washout was avoided table s2 the positive effect of adding carrier for biomass retention is consistent to previous studies 33 39 for the sbr the average effluent nh4 n concentration decreased but effluent no3 n concentration increased to more than 10 mg n l with the nitrate generation ratio reaching almost 100 the average nre and the average nrr during the aerobic stage of the sbr in phase ii was 49 6 and 0 11 mg n gvss h which were much lower when compared to the sbbr due to the absence of biofilm 40 41 although the influent cod concentration fluctuated the average effluent cod concentration of the sbbr and sbr remained at approximately 29 8 and 30 1 mg l respectively the average cod removal efficiencies of the sbbr and sbr were 76 7 and 77 0 table 1 respectively suggesting both reactors achieved good organics removal performance 3 2 analysis and comparison of microbial abundance and activity 3 2 1 variations in microbial abundance after a long term operation the abundance of anammox bacteria in sbbr was 2 58 109 gene copies g dry sludge which was significantly higher than that of the sbr 8 18 107 gene copies g dry sludge fig 2 a for nitrifiers variations the abundance of aob in sbbr and sbr were 9 61 108 and 7 97 107 gene copies g dry sludge respectively fig 3 b but nob nitrobacter nitrospira abundance in the two reactors were similar fig 3c and d as revealed by the microbial abundance variations the anammox bacteria were enriched in sbbr while gradually lost from the sbr adding the carriers presented a positive enrichment effect on anammox bacteria and aob especially anammox bacteria sufficient biomass of anammox bacteria was very important for the stable operation of pna process 31 33 42 3 2 2 activity changes of anammox bacteria aob and nob in phase i of days 1 to 40 the changes in activity levels of the anammox bacteria aob and nob were similar in the two reactors fig 3 in phase ii the total anammox bacteria activity successively improved in the sbbr which was consistent to the variations of anammox bacteria abundance the differences between aob and nob activity became larger which was consistent with the stable partial nitrification and good autotrophic nitrogen removal performance of sbbr in contrast in the sbr anammox decreased and the dominance of aob over nitrifiers became insignificant inducing the deterioration of the partial nitrification as well as anammox reaction finally the maximum anammox activity of the sbbr and sbr reactors were 12 1 and 5 6 mg n l h respectively adding the carriers was favorable to maintain stable anammox and aob activity besides the activity of nob was suppressed in biofilm despite of a high abundance of nob 43 3 2 3 nitrogen removal mechanism in the two reactors typical cyclic tests were performed and nitrogen removal mainly occurred at the aerobic stage fig 4 in the sbbr the nh4 n concentration decreased by 21 1 mg n l with a specific ammonium removal rate of 0 86 mg n gvss h although a higher ammonium removal rate of 1 3 mg n gvss h was observed in the sbr a low nre in the sbr was obtained since the amount of no3 n generated was larger the nrr during the aerobic stage in the sbbr and sbr reactors were 0 67 and 0 28 mg n gvss h respectively in addition in the anoxic stage of the two reactors both nh4 n and no3 n decreased at the same time but the decrease of total nitrogen was relatively weaker when compared to aerobic phase results of in situ activity tests fig 5 showed that variations of the nitrogen levels in the reactors were consistent with the aerobic stage of the typical cycle when influent organics were pre removed a similar level nitrate generation ratio fig 5 was obtained as day 160 24 78 suggesting nitrogen removal was mainly through autotrophic nitrogen removal pathway the nrr during the in situ activity test in the sbbr and sbr were 0 54 and 0 21 mg n gvss h respectively which were slightly lower than the typical cycle thus the anammox was the primary nitrogen removal pathway in the sbbr and denitrifiers contributed to part nitrogen removal through complete denitrification or anammox cooperation 44 the maximum ratio of the nitrogen removed by the anammox to the nitrogen removed throughout one cycle was 90 2 the maximum ratio of the nitrogen removed by the anammox throughout the aerobic stage achieved a level of 85 2 the specific nitrogen removal pathway needs to be further researched and analyzed 3 3 the mechanism of anammox bacteria enrichment and practical application feasibility after the blank carriers were put into the sbbr and biofilm was formed the total activity and abundance of anammox bacteria gradually increased and maintained at higher levels compared to the sbr without carrier addition this outcome was directly related to the positive nitrogen removal performance in the sbbr first the competitiveness of anammox bacteria became stronger because of the adhesion force generated by specific substances such as extracellular polymeric substances 45 besides increased aeration rate facilitated aob activity as well as the nitrogen removal rate 46 it was also noticed that the activity of nob was suppressed although the abundance of nob was high which might due to the special construction of biofilm 41 47 second the anaerobic aerobic anoxic operational mode may important to maintaining the stable nitrogen removal performance since it could combine autotrophic nitrogen removal with endogenous denitrification 48 lastly although the activated sludge was not intentionally discharged suspended flocs sludge was washed out from the sbbr the decrease of flocs sludge might favor the washout of heterotrophic bacteria reducing the competition for nitrite with anammox bacteria 34 35 37 49 the successful start up of the pna process generally begins with inoculation with sludge from the pna system or combination of both nitrification sludge and anammox sludge 2 50 but the start up of the pna system usually takes a long time and the stable operation is difficult 51 in this study we started up the sewage pna system by inoculating the appropriate sludge and blank carriers the method of adding carriers is simple and convenient supporting a practical engineering practice for sewage pn a process anammox sludge can be obtained from a side stream treatment and stable operation is expected when carriers are added and aoa operational mode is adopted 52 in future studies continuous research on the parameters and operational optimization of the biofilm pna processes is still required which is useful for the efficient and energy saving treatment of low ammonia nitrogen wastewater 4 conclusions in this study two different reactors were inoculated with both partial nitrification sludge and anammox sludge before treating domestic sewage the nitrogen removal performance of the two sbrs were investigated and compared the sbbr with blank carriers was successfully started up in 70 days and maintained a stable and efficient treatment effect adding blank carriers benefitted the anammox bacteria enrichment this resulted in higher abundance and activity of the anammox bacteria in the sbbr than in the sbr partial nitrification was stable and the anammox was the dominating nitrogen removal pathway in the sbbr the adding carriers facilitated the optimization and operation of the pna process to treat actual domestic sewage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
