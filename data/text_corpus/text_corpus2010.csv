psc and pss psc while psc had the greater soil erosion than psa and pss psc in 2020 for the total amount of soil erosion during 2017 2020 csa had the least and psc had the most fig 15 4 discussion 4 1 planting patterns affect runoff and soil erosion the psa had different effects on runoff and soil erosion between 2017 and 2018 2020 this result might be explained by the weak alfalfa plants during the first year after sowing and by the rotary tillage conducted in 2017 the conditions changed remarkably during 2018 2020 relative to 2017 resulting in more pronounced soil and water conservation vegetation plays a key role in soil and water conservation through its canopy and root systems wu et al 2020 the characteristics of runoff and soil erosion are influenced by crop type and planting pattern lin et al 2019 zhao et al 2020b as alfalfa is a perennial crop the plants could protect the farmland continuously however in the first year this protection is almost negligible the alfalfa field had a better canopy density and root system compared to corn and soybean fields most likely because of the higher plant density the alfalfa canopy could intercept the rainfall decrease the speed of rain drops and prevent direct contact between the rain and land surface in a previous study the root system of alfalfa was showed to fix soils and increase resistance to soil erosion li et al 2017 the protective effect of alfalfa plants increased with the growth of alfalfa and was stronger than that of corn and soybean corn in the second year of this study the total runoff loss and amount of soil erosion under the psc treatment were higher than that of psa and pss psc during 2017 2020 corn has a higher single leaf area and the leaves are closer to the stem meaning that rainfall could be concentrated by the canopy and flow down along the stem zheng et al 2018 stemflow of corn may aggravate soil erosion and runoff loss on slope farmland previous studies have shown that crop rotation plays an active role in soil erosion prevention on sloped farmland kinderiene and karcauskiene 2012 sharma et al 2017 most likely because of the improvement of the soil physical chemical and biological properties under particular crop rotation zhao et al 2020a alfalfa cultivation could be a better choice to improve soil and water conservation on sloped farmland in the cbnc over the long term however the relationship between planting pattern and soil erosion or runoff loss needs to be elucidated in further studies on the mechanism of the effect of crop rotation on soil erodibility the quantitative effect of different crop canopies on rainfall redistribution and the interactions between the root system and soil 4 2 effects of row direction on runoff and soil erosion soil surface roughness could affect the hydraulic characteristics of surface runoff thereby affecting soil erosion ding and huang 2017 zhao et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 row direction can change the surface roughness perpendicular to the runoff flow direction basic et al 2004 and had a significant influence on soil erosion and runoff loss on slope farmland in this study on average cross slope csa csc and css csc decreased runoff loss by 7 8 23 3 and soil erosion by 15 9 73 7 compared to parallel slope cropping psa psc and pss psc the csa treatment reduced runoff by 23 3 and soil erosion by 73 7 relative to psa similar to the results found when using contour hedgerow treatments the csa treatment could spread around the surface runoff thereby reducing flow velocity increasing water infiltration and intercepting sediment hunt et al 2019 the row direction significantly affected soil erosion and runoff loss on slope farmland cross slope cropping should be selected to prevent soil and water loss on slope farmland in the cbnc alfalfa is a forage crop with high yield and quality as well as a green manure plant hunt et al 2019 in the study region csa is a better choice with regard to both agricultural production and soil and water conservation and future studies need to investigate the effects of crop plants on the hydraulic characteristic parameters of surface runoff and to determine a suitable planting density 4 3 effects of straw mulching on runoff and soil erosion soil surface mulching can protect the surface soil from being impacted directly by raindrops dai et al 2018 increase surface roughness mao et al 2020 promote soil infiltration klik and rosner 2020 improve soil organic matter xu et al 2017 and decrease runoff loss and soil erosion niziolomski et al 2020 in our study straw mulching could reduce runoff and sediment loss significantly which is consistent with the findings of chen et al 2020 therefore straw mulching could be applied as an effective measure for soil and water conversation on slope farmland in cbnc 5 conclusions runoff loss and soil erosion on sloped farmland are significantly affected by planting pattern row direction and straw mulching the csa treatment generated the least runoff and amount of soil erosion among the treatments in this study straw mulching reduced more than 80 of runoff loss and soil erosion for the psc and pss psc treatments the pss psc treatment reduced by 11 5 of runoff loss and 30 7 of soil erosion amount compared to psc the psa treatment decreased runoff loss by 15 9 and soil erosion by 29 9 relative to psc planting in cross slope significantly reduced runoff depth on sloped farmland runoff loss was reduced by 23 3 11 8 and 7 8 when the row direction in the psa psc and pss psc treatments was changed to cross slope from parallel slope respectively planting in cross slope csa csc and css csc reduced soil erosion by 15 9 73 7 on sloped farmland relative to parallel slope planting psa psc and pss psc therefore csa and straw mulching treatments were recommended to more effectively conserve soil and water on slopes farmlands of the cbnc future research is needed to obtain the

found under pss psc under the cross slope planting condition soybean corn rotation css csc decreased runoff depth by 9 8 relative to continuous corn cultivation csc from 2017 to 2018 the csc and css csc treatments were changed to pscsm and psssm pscsm to analyze the impact of straw mulching on runoff depth and soil erosion while the remaining treatments remained the same during 2019 2020 during

significant difference existed among the amount of soil erosion amount from psa pscsm and psssm pscsm treatments the amount of soil erosion under csa pscsm and psssm pscsm was below to that of the psa psc and pss psc while psc had the greater soil erosion than psa and pss psc in 2020 for the total amount of soil erosion during 2017 2020 csa had the least and psc had the most fig 15 4 discussion 4 1 planting patterns affect runoff and soil erosion the psa had different effects on runoff and soil erosion between 2017 and 2018 2020 this result might be explained by the weak alfalfa plants during the first year after sowing and by the rotary tillage conducted in 2017 the conditions changed remarkably during 2018 2020 relative to 2017 resulting in more pronounced soil and water conservation vegetation plays a key role in soil and water conservation through its canopy and root systems wu et al 2020 the characteristics of runoff and soil erosion are influenced by crop type and planting pattern lin et al 2019 zhao et al 2020b as alfalfa is a perennial crop the plants could protect the farmland continuously however in the first year this protection is almost negligible the alfalfa field had a better canopy density and root system compared to corn and soybean fields most likely because of the higher plant density the alfalfa canopy could intercept the rainfall decrease the speed of rain drops and prevent direct contact between the rain and land surface in a previous study the root system of alfalfa was showed to fix soils and increase resistance to soil erosion li et al 2017 the protective effect of alfalfa plants increased with the growth of alfalfa and was stronger than that of corn and soybean corn in the second year of this study the total runoff loss and amount of soil erosion under the psc treatment were higher than that of psa and pss psc during 2017 2020 corn has a higher single leaf area and the leaves are closer to the stem meaning that rainfall could be concentrated by the canopy and flow down along the stem zheng et al 2018 stemflow of corn may aggravate soil erosion and runoff loss on slope farmland previous studies have shown that crop rotation plays an active role in soil erosion prevention on sloped farmland kinderiene and karcauskiene 2012 sharma et al 2017 most likely because of the improvement of the soil physical chemical and biological properties under particular crop rotation zhao et al 2020a alfalfa cultivation could be a better choice to improve soil and water conservation on sloped farmland in the cbnc over the long term however the relationship between planting pattern and soil erosion or runoff loss needs to be elucidated in further studies on the mechanism of the effect of crop rotation on soil erodibility the quantitative effect of different crop canopies on rainfall redistribution and the interactions between the root system and soil 4 2 effects of row direction on runoff and soil erosion soil surface roughness could affect the hydraulic characteristics of surface runoff thereby affecting soil erosion ding and huang 2017 zhao et al 2013 zheng et al 2013 row direction can change the surface roughness perpendicular to the runoff flow direction basic et al 2004 and had a significant influence on soil erosion and runoff loss on slope farmland in this study on average cross slope csa csc and css csc decreased runoff loss by 7 8 23 3 and soil erosion by 15 9 73 7 compared to parallel slope cropping psa psc and pss psc the csa treatment reduced runoff by 23 3 and soil erosion by 73 7 relative to psa similar to the results found when using contour hedgerow treatments the csa treatment could spread around the surface runoff thereby reducing flow velocity increasing water infiltration and intercepting sediment hunt et al 2019 the row direction significantly affected soil erosion and runoff loss on slope farmland cross slope cropping should be selected to prevent soil and water loss on slope farmland in the cbnc alfalfa is a forage crop with high yield and quality as well as a green manure plant hunt et al 2019 in the study region csa is a better choice with regard to both agricultural production and soil and water conservation and future studies need to investigate the effects of crop plants on the hydraulic characteristic parameters of surface runoff and to determine a suitable planting density 4 3 effects of straw mulching on runoff and soil erosion soil surface mulching can protect the surface soil from being impacted directly by raindrops dai et al 2018 increase surface roughness mao et al 2020 promote soil infiltration klik and rosner 2020 improve soil organic matter xu et al 2017 and decrease runoff loss and soil erosion niziolomski et al 2020 in our study straw mulching could reduce runoff and sediment loss significantly which is consistent with the findings of chen et al 2020 therefore straw mulching could be applied as an effective measure for soil and water conversation on slope farmland in cbnc 5 conclusions runoff loss and soil erosion on sloped farmland are significantly affected by planting pattern row direction and straw mulching the csa treatment generated the least runoff and amount of soil erosion among the treatments in this study straw mulching reduced more than 80 of runoff loss and soil erosion for the psc and pss psc treatments the pss psc treatment reduced by 11 5 of runoff loss and 30 7 of soil erosion amount compared to psc the psa treatment decreased runoff loss by 15 9 and soil erosion by 29 9 relative to psc planting in cross slope significantly reduced runoff depth on sloped farmland runoff loss was reduced by 23 3 11 8 and 7 8 when the row direction in the psa psc and pss psc treatments was changed to cross slope from parallel slope respectively planting in cross slope csa csc and css csc reduced soil erosion by 15 9 73 7 on sloped farmland relative to parallel slope planting psa psc and pss psc therefore csa and straw mulching treatments were recommended to more effectively conserve soil and water on slopes farmlands of the cbnc future research is needed to obtain the characteristics of redistribution about rainfall kinetic energy and hydraulic characteristic parameters of surface runoff and soil reinforcement by roots under different planting patterns row

10051,widespread tree mortality induced by drought events causes significant damage to the local ecosystem and society populus simonii carr in zhangbei bashang region china which was the dominant species of local shelter forest experienced a wide and heterogeneous dieback calling for an urgent need for research revealing the mechanism of this mortality event we conducted a field survey across the county examining 443 poplar individuals with different degrees of degradation basic morphological tree data and tree ring samples were obtained and analysed the stable water isotope technique was also applied to predict the water use pattern and rooting depth long term climate data were analysed and the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi was calculated the main results were as follows 1 the growth rate of diameter at breast height dbh and tree height began to decrease after the year 2000 however this drawback effect tended to be stronger for poplars with a higher degradation degree the results also showed that the poplars that survived were inherently larger in size 2 following the increase in the degree of degradation poplars gradually lost their ability to absorb deep soil water putting them into a more stressful water condition we concluded that ageing and stand density were not the major effects but drought accounted for the mortality event larger poplars with deeper root systems tended to be more resistant to drought local water resource management is also vital for shelterbelt forests to survive and grow keywords poplar plantation mortality tree age tree size root 1 introduction forests are one of the most important terrestrial ecosystems on earth and play a fundamentally important role in regulating water cycles carbon sequestration cui et al 2020 biodiversity protection newbold et al 2015 desalinisation minhas et al 2020 soil and water conservation hou et al 2020 and as a shelter for agricultural land sun et al 2018b deng et al 2021 however as global climate change proceeds 10 million ha of forest have been lost for each year since 2015 https www fao org forestry fra2020 which has drawn considerable attention studies on tree die offs mainly focus on tree physiological mcdowell et al 2011a or morphological traits rais et al 2014 in the literature hydraulic failure carbon starvation and biotic attack are widely considered as the three main causes of tree mortality but all these causes originate from water stress mcdowell 2011b choat et al 2018 trees exposed to low water availability may form cavitation in xylem tissues blocking the water path from the root to the canopy nardini et al 2013 trees might lower the transpiration rate and canopy conductance by closing the leaf stomata to reduce water loss while lowering the photosynthesis rate as well jia et al 2017 this could lead to unavoidable damage to trees due to carbon starvation behaviour in a prolonged drought period causing trees to be more vulnerable to pests ji et al 2020 although drought seems fatal for trees not all trees die in a certain drought event mcdowell et al 2008 intra or inter species morphological differences may explain this pattern it is widely recognised that the vulnerability of trees to drought increases with the tree size bennett et al 2015 koch et al 2004 stephenson and das 2020 height growth results in larger hydraulic resistance because higher trees consistently have wider conduit diameters reducing the friction against the conduit wall for water molecules petit and anfodillo 2009 taller trees need to overcome more gravity when transporting water to the canopy mcdowell and allen 2015 meanwhile trees with larger canopies usually demand more transpiration but this could lead to issues when the water supply is in shortage wullschleger et al 1998 in addition larger trees have to face a more challenging hydraulic environment such as higher solar radiation or greater vapour pressure deficit however a study carried out in the mediterranean region of southern italy showed that local hungarian oak quercus frainetto ten trees with a larger size survived from a drought induced mortality event in the 2000s but the reason remained unexplained sánchez salguero et al 2020 subedi et al 2020 found that relatively small trees in east texas were more susceptible to drought which was attributed to higher stand density and lower stem water storage yang et al 2020 showed a similar result from the daxing an mountains of northeast china the limitation of radiation resource was considered as the main factor thus smaller trees exposed to less sunlight had lower growth rates in addition trees in the dry or alpine regions generally grew to a lower tree height and smaller canopy resulting in a much lower water usage and were more adapted to the local environment colangelo et al 2017 pandey et al 2021 globally plantation comprise a considerable percentage of forests for example planted forests in china account for over a third of forests nationwide planted forests provide as many ecological services as other forests trivino et al 2017 while also experiencing mortality or degradation plantations are artificially designed which suggests that there could be a mismatch between the vegetation resource demand and local natural resource supply song et al 2021 on the other hand they are directly related to the livelihood of human beings by protecting farmland and residents from sandstorms or other kinds of natural disasters zheng et al 2012 therefore it is of great importance to understand how would this type of vegetation responds to drought the three north shelter forest program tnsf is an important man made ecological barrier for northern china covering an area of 406 9 104 km2 shelter forests of zhangbei county heibei province were a typical part of the tnsf and formed an ecological barrier protecting beijing and its surrounding area from sandstorms it was also the ecotone between woodland and grassland which makes it particularly vulnerable to climate change the plantation programme in zhangbei was started in year 1977 with the selection of populus simonii carr as the pioneer tree species wide spread mortality of the poplars has been observed since 2000 with a sharp decline in the regional fractional vegetation coverage fvc wang et al 2020 approximately 80 of the poplars in zhangbei county suffered from degradation while one third of them died off or near died off sun et al 2018b researchers are still debating the main causes of tree death one reason for the degradation could be the decline in physiological functions as a natural result of ageing ji et al 2020 another reason could be drought according to the tree ring study lu et al 2020 sun et al 2018b or the water use pattern studies liu et al 2020 sun et al 2018a however the reason why some of the poplars died while others survived the drought in this particular region remains unclear in this study we conducted a field survey measuring tree height diameter at breast height dbh and canopy width of the poplars experiencing different degrees of degradation tree ring data was obtained from the survey the water use pattern of the poplars was also studied to reveal the water use strategies of the poplars the aims of this study were as follows 1 to reveal the relationship between tree morphological traits and degradation degree in this region 2 to predict the rooting depth of the poplars by revealing their water use patterns and 3 to explain why some trees survived while others succumbed to drought from a morphological perspective tree size and root depth our goal was to provide scientific information for the future development of plantation practices and vegetation management in the

value of soil is around 5 52 7 37 populus simonii carr is the primarily planted tree species distributed all around the county and covered 85 13 of the county s green area limited by the local environmental conditions the poplar growing period was different from the regions with a warmer and wetter climate according to the non commercial forest construction guide principle gb t 18337 1 2001 published by the chinese government in north china poplars sapling period was defined as age from 0 to 10 years half mature period was the age from 11 to 20 years mature period was the age from 21 to 30years and overmature period was the age beyond 30 years similar definition was also stated by fu et al 2016 larix gmelinii and ulmus pumila were also found in this area 2 2 field study a field survey was conducted in the year 2017 all poplar individuals were divided into four degradation degrees according to the spike top rate the undegraded group with no spike top abbreviated as n d the slightly degraded group with a spike top rate 0 20 abbreviated as l d the moderately degraded group with a spike top rate 20 60 abbreviated as m d and the severely degraded group with a spike top rate 60 abbreviated as s d random sampling plots 40 40 m 13 plots in total were set up prior to tree measurement tree height dbh and canopy width in two directions north to south and east to west were measured for each individual in each plot stand density was calculated by dividing the tree counts by the plot area in each plot a total of 443 trees were included in the random plots tree ring cores were also sampled in each random plot during the field survey with a 5 mm increment borer lu et al 2020 stable water isotope samples were collected in the middle of the month from may to october 2019 in four fixed plots dominated by four different degradation degrees a soil water moisture content sensor system 5te decagon usa was planted into a 4 m soil profile with an interval of 20 cm in the middle of each plot rainfall events were avoided to eliminate the effect of poplars likely responding to rain pulses three neighbouring trees were selected in each degradation group during sampling and three branch samples were collected from the live crown of each tree soil samples were collected with a soil auger near the sampled trees at 20 cm depth intervals until a depth of 4 m all samples were placed into 50 ml polyethylene bottles and sealed with parafilm m membrane after field sampling all samples were quickly transferred to the laboratory and frozen at 20 c to avoid further fractionation 2 3 indoor sample analysis tree ring cores were analysed to determine tree age and tree ring width w lu et al 2020 sun et al 2018b stable water isotope samples were subjected to cryogenic vacuum distillation using an automatic water extraction system li 2100 lica china the extraction rate was over 98 the water samples were then filtered through a 0 22 µm filter membrane before the sample was analysed using a liquid water isotope analyser dlt 100 lgr inc usa the accuracy was 0 3 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o the δ value of the stable water isotope is defined as follows 1 δ x r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δx represents the stable isotope of xylem water 2h and 18o in this study and r is the isotope ratio of a certain isotope 2h 1h for h and 18o 16o for o standard refers to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 climate data analysis the climate data of the study area from 1970 to 2019 were obtained from the national meteorological data service centre of china http data cma cn annual temperature and precipitation were linearly fitted to years to reveal the climate trend the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the penman monteith formulation allen et al 1994 the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi was then calculated to define the drought event van der schrier et al 2011 all the analysis calculation was done in the r statistical software r core team 2020 in which pet was calculated by spei package beguería and vicente serrano 2017 and scpdsi was calculated by scpdsi zhong et al 2018 package 2 4 2 morphology data analysis to overcome the lack of data on tree height and dbh in the study area the dbh time series was represented by summing the tree ring width w ignoring the bark thickness 2 dbh n 2 i 1 n w n n 1 2 3 where n is the year step n 1 represents the first year of tree ring growth then a height dbh model established by clutter and allison considering tree age and tree density was adopted sánchez et al 2003 the formulation is as follows 3 h 1 3 10 b 0 b 1 1 dbh b 2 1 t b 3 1 dbh t b 4 lg n t where h is the tree height m dbh is the diameter at the breast height cm t is the age of the tree in years n is the number of trees per ha b o b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 are undefined parameters the model was fitted via bayesian parameter estimation as follows 4 h n μ σ 2 5 μ 1 3 10 b 0 b 1 1 dbh b 2 1 t b 3 1 dbh t b 4 lg n t 6 b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 n 0 1 7 σ 2 exp 1 the mean value was used as the estimation result this was done in r using rethinking package mcelreath 2020 data from 383 trees were randomly selected for the model parameterisation and the remaining 60 trees were used to check the accuracy of the model after the model was established we used the dbh and age time series of different degradation groups to simulate the tree height time series the kruskal wallis test and dunn s test were undertaken to evaluate the significance of differences among the groups 2 4 3 water use pattern of the poplars the mixsiar package in r stock and semmens 2016 was used to calculate the contribution ratios of water from different soil depths for poplars wang et al 2017 the model accepts isotope tracers as inputs and generates results using a bayesian mixing model stock et al 2018 because the effect of evaporation and precipitation on the soil water was limited when the soil depth decreased we divided the whole soil profile with intervals of 40 cm for 0 240 cm and the remaining depth 240 400 cm was considered as one layer the mean value of the model output was taken as the result 2 4 4 root depth judgement the root system is a vital part of a plant it determines the root ability of the root obtain water and nutrient sources fromm 2019 although the relative contributions of water sources to plants may vary under different water conditions ellsworth and sternberg 2015 the range of plant water use is restricted by the distribution of the root system fan et al 2017 however models for calculating water source partitioning usually ignore the problem of whether the potential water sources selected by the researchers are indeed actual water sources phillips et al 2014 the output results of the models depended only on the tracer values input by the researchers we set several principles to judge whether the root of a poplar at a certain depth with a certain degree of degradation was still active 1 if the root was still active it should be able to absorb a relatively large amount of water from the soil when the soil water was sufficient zhao et al 2020 2 if the root was still active it should be able to respond to soil water condition change which would suggest that the water contribution ratio of this depth should vary along with the soil volumetric water content vwc liu et al 2019 and 3 if the soil water condition was good but the contribution ratio was relatively low the root was less likely to be active wu et al 2016 the maximum contribution ratio of each depth was selected to demonstrate the ability of the root to absorb water for principle 1 the coefficient of variation cv value of the contribution ratio was calculated for different soil depths and degradation degrees to evaluate principle 2 the vwc characteristics were analysed to test principle 3 3 result 3 1 climate characteristics of the recent 50 years the annual precipitation varied significantly cv 0 17 during the 1970 2019 period with a mean value of 385 8 mm while the minimum value was 249 mm in the year 1997 fig 2 the annual maximum average and minimum temperature increased by 0 46 0 41 and 0 39 c every ten years respectively showing a significant trend of climate warming except for annual minimum temperature fig 3 precipitation in 2019 was 420 5 mm and was mainly concentrated in the period from may to october the rainfall in these six months was 56 4 61 4 97 2 41 3 61 and 14 mm respectively and the monthly average temperatures were 13 2 18 2 19 5 17 4 15 1 and 5 9 c respectively fig 4 the scpdsi varied greatly but increased significantly in the last 50 years fig 5 fifteen years of drought were observed in total according to the standard classification of scpdsi drought events from 1972 to1973 were severely dry events in 1971 1974 1975 1981 1984 1986 1987 and 1999 2001 were moderately dry the event in 2009 was close to moderately dry with a value of 1 98 among the 15 drought events the one that occurred in 1999 2001 was regarded as the starting point of the degradation process in previous studies sun et al 2018a 2018b as a result we selected the year 2000 as the point dividing the pre and the post degradation period table 1 3 2 morphological data of the poplars a total of 443 poplar individuals were sampled and a t test was performed to evaluate the differences among groups the dbh exhibited a clear downward trend with increasing degradation degree but tree height did not show similar patterns tree heights of the four groups were all significantly different from each other all p 0 05 but the ascending order was l d s d m d n d the crown width showed no significant difference in the two directions p 0 1 but the inter group variation was clear p 0 05 the order was l d m d s d n d the maximum and minimum tree ages were 37 and 13 years respectively which made it possible for the model to simulate the tree height from its half mature period to the overmature period stand density was significantly p 0 05 different among the four groups and negatively correlated with the degree of degradation while the order was s d n d m d l d 3 3 time series of tree size of poplars the dbh of the different degradation groups showed the following order n d l d m d s d reduced growth rates appeared after 2000 and the radial growth rates became even lower as the degradation degree increased fig 6 the average radial growth rates after 2000 for the four groups were 0 192 0 146 0 123 and 0 096 cm yr respectively according to dunn s test result table 2 before the slowdown began there were no significant differences in dbh among the four groups the results suggested that the inherent dbh variations among poplar individuals were not statistically obvious although the trend was easy to distinguish from the raw data after the slowdown point the dbh differed significantly among the different groups except for the relationship between the l d and m d groups this indicates that the growth drawback broadened the gaps among the four groups the parameterised model was h 1 3 10 1 35 4 96 1 dbh 2 21 1 t 0 90 1 d t 0 75 lg n t r 2 0 54 p 0 05 8 because the age of the sampled tree had all passed the sapling period the simulation results started in 1987 fig 7 the tree height of the different degradation groups were in the order of n d l d m d s d the growth rate slowed after 2000 the growth rate decreased even further when the degree of degradation increased the average growth rates after 2000 for the four groups were 0 169 0 142 0 124 and 0 101 m yr respectively the results of dunn s test for the tree height were similar to those for dbh table 3 the height variation between the four groups was insignificant before the year 2000 in the post degradation period the drawback effect had a greater influence on groups with higher degradation degree resulting in a significant difference in tree height among the four groups 3 4 soil water content characteristics vwc varied with the degradation degrees and seasons fig 8 the vwc of soil from 0 to 120 cm was influenced significantly by the season with a much higher value in may june and october and dried out in july august and september for the 120 240 cm and 240 cm layers the seasonal influence was indistinct but vwc tended to be higher in the dry season and lower in the wet season in general the vwc in different degradation plots showed a trend of l d m d n d s d but the difference between m d and n d was not significant table 4 this was probably due to the climate warming effect resulting in a higher soil evaporation rate in summer while rainfall may be unchanged or less than usual this would lead to a much more serious water deficit for poplars to survive 3 5 water use pattern and root depth of poplars for trees in the n d group soil water from the 0 120 cm layer contributed the most in may 45 1 june 51 4 and september 40 8 fig 9 the poplars in the n d group tended to use more water from 120 to 240 cm and 240 cm layers in july 63 8 august 66 2 and october 67 1 trees in the l d group had a similar trend as the n d group which mainly depended on water from 0 to 120 cm layer in may 44 0 and june 48 5 and then absorbed more water from the 120 240 cm and 240 cm layers during july 67 3 august 59 8 and october 66 3 trees in the l d group relied more on the 120 240 cm soil water in september 44 2 trees of the m d group predominantly relied on soil water from 0 to 120 cm in the 6 months while the contribution ratios were 53 5 49 1 45 5 50 2 50 3 and 51 9 respectively trees of the s d group showed relatively stable water use patterns which mainly took up water from the 0 120 cm soil layer the contribution ratios of the 6 months from 0 to 120 cm layer were 48 8 50 5 51 7 52 7 53 1 and 52 0 respectively for the n d group the cvs of the contribution ratios for 0 40 cm 40 80 cm 200 240 cm and 240 cm layers were 0 277 0 203 0 154 and 0 208 respectively fig 10 the l d group had a similar trend as the n d group while the cv for the 0 40 cm 40 80 cm 200 240 cm and 240 cm layers were 0 387 0 167 0 180 and 0 204 respectively for the m d groups only the contribution ratios from 0 to 40 cm and 40 80 cm varied greatly this phenomenon became more intense in the s d group while no soil layer showed a significant variation in water contribution ratios in the poplars in the s d group the cv for 0 40 cm was the greatest but only reached 0 104 these results indicated that the poplars in the n d and l d groups were still able access the deep or shallow soil water while the poplars in the m d and s d groups lost their ability to switch their water use patterns in response to the changing soil water conditions according to the three principles we set previously the dots indicating inactive roots were circled in fig 11 a depth of 120 160 cm for the n d group and a depth of 160 200 cm for the l d group were included considering that the vwc of the 120 160 cm layer for the n d group was relatively low fig 8 the root activeness could not be identified the vwc of the 160 200 cm layer for the l d group was relatively high compared to the other groups which suggested low activity of the roots roots below 120 cm for the m d group were all included but the vwc at these depths was in a relatively good condition table 4 this suggested that roots below the depth of 120 cm for the m d group had lost their activity for the s d group all depths were circled except for the 0 40 cm depth layer however the vwc of this plot was relatively similar to that of the n d group indicating that the roots below the depth of 40 cm could lose their activity 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of tree ageing and stand density on the growth drawback of poplars the tree height time series fig 6 of the poplars exhibited a decrease in growth rate after the year 2000 which was the transition period of the poplars from half maturity to maturity this is a natural phenomenon in which the growth rate of trees will decreases because of the larger tree size and higher hydraulic resistance linares et al 2013 according to the scpdsi values fig 5 the drought that occurred in 1999 2001 was not the most intensive in the entire growing period of the poplars yet the decrease in growth rate only occurred after 2000 this suggests that younger poplars were less vulnerable to drought similar results have been reported in other studies carnwath and nelson 2017 martínez vilalta et al 2012 however ageing of trees did not result in their mortality so drought is probably a trigger for the mortality of the poplars the field survey results also indicated that the ageing effect was not the main factor it was found that tree ageing did not necessarily cause dieback because the age varied significantly in the four degradation degrees table 1 which indicates that some younger poplars died simultaneously in the widespread mortality event ji et al 2020 reported similar findings in this study area in addition stand density was not a decisive factor either because the highest density occurred in the l d group and the lowest was in the s d group this was contradictory to what was expected because increasing stand density would intensify the resource shortage of the trees tsamir et al 2019 as a result it is not the ageing effect and stand density but the drought that is responsible for the mortality of the poplars nevertheless none of the factors mentioned above could explain why some of the poplars survived while others succumbed to drought 4 2 the relation between tree size and drought induced mortality in our field study dbh decreased when the degree of degradation increased table 1 this variation existed inherently before degradation began fig 6 although dunn s test results might indicate the opposite trend table 2 this minor morphological trait distinction might be a potential factor causing the heterogeneous dieback of poplars the tree heights of the l d group were smaller than those of the other groups which was contrary to what was expected this might have been caused by interference from some younger poplar individuals table 1 despite this the three remaining groups still showed a decreasing trend following the deterioration of the poplars the height time series also showed an inherent difference between the four groups fig 7 this result contradicts to the common findings bennett et al 2015 concluded that larger trees with greater tree heights and canopies tended to be more vulnerable to water stress this result should be obvious because greater tree height requires a longer water transport pathway from the root to the leaf and a larger canopy results in more water demand to maintain transpiration ryan et al 2006 meakem et al 2018 found that even though mid to large sized trees were more adapted to drought the exposure due to their canopy position affected them most under drought in contrast understory formed by smaller sized trees experienced less stressful hydraulic conditions and the mortality rate was usually lower grote et al 2016 a study in the mediterranean climate region found the similar results as ours the results showed that tree size was limited therefore it is likely that there is an inverse relationship between tree morphological traits and drought stress colangelo et al 2017 unlike the trees in moist conditions trees in dry or seasonally dry regions have developed particular functions to survive under drought conditions phillips et al 2003 found that the water storage capacity or capacitance of the tree trunk was critical for transpiration during the dry period this effect would be insignificant for smaller trees because water storage would be insufficient compared to its transpiration demand pratt and jacobsen 2017 in addition carbohydrate storage was higher in larger trees which played an important role against carbon starvation in long term water stress mitchell et al 2013 in our study dbh of the n d group was generally larger which correspondingly formed a larger water and carbohydrate pool compared to smaller and more degraded poplars from the aspect of vessels the correlations between conduit diameter and tree height of angiosperm species are different among tropical temperate and cold regions olson and rosell 2013 although height was the main factor driving the conduit diameter rosell et al 2017 the vessels of trees in the cold region were narrower in absolute terms olson et al 2018 this acclimation eased the disadvantage of a larger height as a result larger poplars in this region were more resistant to drought 4 3 the relation between roots system and drought induced mortality depths with active roots were much shallower for trees in the m d group and the s d groups while the n d and l d groups were still able to absorb water from the deep soil layer 240 cm deep roots are essential for trees in the arid region to survive under drought conditions padilla and pugnaire 2007 zheng et al 2019 trees in the dry region commonly invest more resources in root growth to acquire deep soil water ledo et al 2018 the root system also provides a protected reservoir for the storage of carbohydrates ryan et al 2011 in our study the rising temperature drove higher evapotranspiration strengthened the summer drought and caused the soil water at a shallow depth to dry out fig 8 and increased the water stress for poplars in response poplars in the n d and l d groups chose to rely more on deeper soil water which was more abundant and stable but the m d and s d groups had to face the soil water deficit the inability to absorb deeper soil water could cause poplars to die during extreme drought events in addition according to the findings of sun et al 2018b groundwater depth decreased significantly due to human activities in this region the original groundwater depth in 1995 was 2 76 m but decreased to 5 69 m in 2001 this indicates that poplars of the n d and l d groups may still be able to access the water from the capillary rise of groundwater fan et al 2017 during the 1999 2001 drought event but the rest of the poplars might not thus human activities could be a fatal factor for the death of some poplars 5 conclusions plantations are a crucial forest resource for the human society in zhangbei county china populus simonii carr plantation was the shelterbelt for local agriculture and residents however extreme drought caused heterogeneous dieback in the poplars to reveal the mechanism of their mortality a field survey including tree morphological data tree ring analysis and water use pattern study using stable water isotopes was conducted in 2017 and 2019 we found that tree growth began to slow down after 2000 but this drawback effect tended to be stronger for poplars with higher degrees of degradation it also showed that the survived poplars were inherently larger in size following the increase of degradation degree poplars gradually lost their ability to absorb water from the deep soil layer putting them into a more stressful water condition we conclude that the ageing effect and stand density were not the determining factors for the mortality of the poplars and that water stress was the primary cause of the mortality event moreover size and root system are determining factors for poplars to survive in drought that is larger poplars with deeper root systems were more resistant to drought in cold semi arid regions this result suggests that the local government should pay more attention to shelter forest management and be sure that water resources are sufficient for poplar growth and survival declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

10051,widespread tree mortality induced by drought events causes significant damage to the local ecosystem and society populus simonii carr in zhangbei bashang region china which was the dominant species of local shelter forest experienced a wide and heterogeneous dieback calling for an urgent need for research revealing the mechanism of this mortality event we conducted a field survey across the county examining 443 poplar individuals with different degrees of degradation basic morphological tree data and tree ring samples were obtained and analysed the stable water isotope technique was also applied to predict the water use pattern and rooting depth long term climate data were analysed and the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi was calculated the main results were as follows 1 the growth rate of diameter at breast height dbh and tree height began to decrease after the year 2000 however this drawback effect tended to be stronger for poplars with a higher degradation degree the results also showed that the poplars that survived were inherently larger in size 2 following the increase in the degree of degradation poplars gradually lost their ability to absorb deep soil water putting them into a more stressful water condition we concluded that ageing and stand density were not the major effects but drought accounted for the mortality event larger poplars with deeper root systems tended to be more resistant to drought local water resource management is also vital for shelterbelt forests to survive and grow keywords poplar plantation mortality

however as global climate change proceeds 10 million ha of forest have been lost for each year since 2015 https www fao org forestry fra2020 which has drawn considerable attention studies on tree die

the three main causes of tree mortality but all these causes originate from water stress mcdowell 2011b choat et al 2018 trees exposed to low water availability may form cavitation in xylem tissues blocking the water path from the root to the canopy nardini et al 2013 trees might lower the transpiration rate and canopy conductance by closing the leaf stomata to reduce water loss while lowering the photosynthesis rate as well jia et al 2017 this could lead to unavoidable damage to trees due to carbon starvation behaviour in a prolonged drought period causing trees to be more vulnerable to pests ji et al 2020 although drought seems fatal for trees not all trees die in a certain drought event mcdowell et al 2008 intra or inter species morphological differences may explain this pattern it is widely recognised that the vulnerability of trees to drought increases with the tree size bennett et al 2015 koch et al 2004 stephenson and das 2020 height growth results in larger hydraulic resistance because higher trees consistently have wider conduit diameters reducing the friction against the conduit wall for water molecules petit and anfodillo 2009 taller trees need to overcome more gravity when transporting water to the canopy mcdowell and allen 2015 meanwhile trees with larger canopies usually demand more transpiration but this could lead to issues when the water supply is in shortage wullschleger et al 1998 in addition larger trees have to face a more challenging hydraulic environment such as higher solar radiation or greater vapour pressure deficit however a study carried out in the mediterranean region of southern italy showed that local hungarian oak quercus frainetto ten trees with a larger size survived from a drought induced mortality event in the 2000s but the reason remained unexplained sánchez salguero et al 2020 subedi et al 2020 found that relatively small trees in east texas were more susceptible to drought which was attributed to higher stand density and lower stem water storage yang et al 2020 showed a similar result from the daxing an mountains of northeast china the limitation of radiation resource was considered as the main factor thus smaller trees exposed to less sunlight had lower growth rates in addition trees in the dry or alpine regions generally grew to a lower tree height and smaller canopy resulting in a much lower water usage and were more adapted to the local environment colangelo et al 2017 pandey et al 2021 globally plantation comprise a considerable percentage of forests for example planted forests in china account for over a third of forests nationwide planted forests provide as many ecological services as other forests trivino et al 2017 while also experiencing mortality or degradation plantations are artificially designed which suggests that there could be a mismatch between the vegetation resource demand and local natural resource supply song et al 2021 on the other hand they are directly related to the livelihood of human beings by protecting farmland and residents from sandstorms or other kinds of natural disasters zheng et al 2012 therefore it is of great importance to understand how would this type of vegetation responds to drought the three north shelter forest program tnsf is an important man made ecological barrier for northern china covering an area of 406 9 104 km2 shelter forests of zhangbei county heibei province were a typical part of the tnsf and formed an ecological barrier protecting beijing and its surrounding area from sandstorms it was also the ecotone between woodland and grassland which makes it particularly vulnerable to climate change the plantation programme in zhangbei was started in year 1977 with the selection of populus simonii carr as the pioneer tree species wide spread mortality of the poplars has been observed since 2000 with a sharp decline in the regional fractional vegetation coverage fvc wang et al 2020 approximately 80 of the poplars in zhangbei county suffered from degradation while one third of them died off or near died off sun et al 2018b researchers are still debating the main causes of tree death one reason for the degradation could be the decline in physiological functions as a natural result of ageing ji et al 2020 another reason could be drought according to the tree ring study lu et al 2020 sun et al 2018b or the water use pattern studies liu et al 2020 sun et al 2018a however the reason why some of the poplars died while others survived the drought in this particular region remains unclear in this study we conducted a field survey measuring tree height diameter at breast height dbh and canopy width of the poplars experiencing different degrees of degradation tree ring data was obtained from the survey the water use pattern of the poplars was also studied to reveal the water use strategies of the poplars the aims of this study were as follows 1 to reveal the relationship between tree morphological traits and degradation degree in this region 2 to predict the rooting depth of the poplars by revealing their water use patterns and 3 to explain why some trees survived while others succumbed to drought from a morphological perspective tree size and root depth our goal was to provide scientific information for the future development of plantation practices and vegetation management in the

by a temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 400 mm of which 64 69 is concentrated between june and september the annual average temperature was approximately 3 4 c while the maximum and minimum daily average temperature were 33 4 c and 34 8 c respectively the soil texture is mainly chestnut soil and the parent material is basalt granite and wind sediment the ph value of soil is around 5 52 7 37 populus simonii carr is the primarily planted tree species distributed all around the county and covered 85 13 of the county s green area limited by the local environmental conditions the poplar growing period was different from the regions with a warmer and wetter climate according to the non commercial forest construction guide principle gb t 18337 1 2001 published by the chinese government in north china poplars sapling period was defined as age from 0 to 10 years half mature period was the age from 11 to 20 years mature period was the age from 21 to 30years and overmature period was the age beyond 30 years similar definition was also stated by fu et al 2016 larix gmelinii and ulmus pumila were also found in this area 2 2 field study a field survey was conducted in the year 2017 all poplar individuals were divided into four degradation degrees according to the spike top rate the undegraded group with no spike top abbreviated as n d the slightly degraded group with a spike top rate 0 20 abbreviated as l d the moderately degraded group with a spike top rate 20 60 abbreviated as m d and the severely degraded group with a spike top rate 60 abbreviated as s d random sampling plots 40 40 m 13 plots in total were set up prior to tree measurement tree height dbh and canopy width in two directions north to south and east to west were measured for each individual in each plot stand density was calculated by dividing the tree counts by the plot area in each plot a total of 443 trees were included in the random plots tree ring cores were also sampled in each random plot during the field survey with a 5 mm increment borer lu et al 2020 stable water isotope samples were collected in the middle of the month from may to october 2019 in four fixed plots dominated by four different degradation degrees a soil water moisture content sensor system 5te decagon usa was planted into a 4 m soil profile with an interval of 20 cm in the middle of each plot rainfall events were avoided to eliminate the effect of poplars likely responding to rain pulses three neighbouring trees were selected in each degradation group during sampling and three branch samples were collected from the live crown of each tree soil samples were collected with a soil auger near the sampled trees at 20 cm depth intervals until a depth of 4 m all samples were placed into 50 ml polyethylene bottles and sealed with parafilm m membrane after field sampling all samples were quickly transferred to the laboratory and frozen at 20 c to avoid further fractionation 2 3 indoor sample analysis tree ring cores were analysed to determine tree age and tree ring width w lu et al 2020 sun et al 2018b stable water isotope samples were subjected to cryogenic vacuum distillation using an automatic water extraction system li 2100 lica china the extraction rate was over 98 the water samples were then filtered through a 0 22 µm filter membrane before the sample was analysed using a liquid water isotope analyser dlt 100 lgr inc usa the accuracy was 0 3 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o the δ value of the stable water isotope is defined as follows 1 δ x r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δx represents the stable isotope of xylem water 2h and 18o in this study and r is the isotope ratio of a certain isotope 2h 1h for h and 18o 16o for o standard refers to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 climate data analysis the climate data of the study area from 1970 to 2019 were obtained from the national meteorological data service centre of china http data cma cn annual temperature and precipitation were linearly fitted to years to reveal the climate trend the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the penman monteith formulation allen et al 1994 the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi was then calculated to define the drought event van der schrier et al 2011 all the analysis calculation was done in the r statistical software r core team 2020 in which pet was calculated by spei package beguería and vicente serrano 2017 and scpdsi was calculated by scpdsi zhong et al 2018 package 2 4 2 morphology data analysis to overcome the lack of data on tree height and dbh in the study area the dbh time series was represented by summing the tree ring width w ignoring the bark thickness 2 dbh n 2 i 1 n w n n 1 2 3 where n is the year step n 1 represents the first year of tree ring growth then a height dbh model established by clutter and allison considering tree age and tree density was adopted sánchez et al 2003 the formulation is as follows 3 h 1 3 10 b 0 b 1 1 dbh b 2 1 t b 3 1 dbh t b 4 lg n t where h is the tree height m dbh is the diameter at the breast height cm t is the age of the tree in years n is the number of trees per ha b o b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 are undefined parameters the model was fitted via bayesian parameter estimation as follows 4 h n μ σ 2 5 μ 1 3 10 b 0 b 1 1 dbh b 2 1 t b 3 1 dbh t b 4 lg n t 6 b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 n 0 1 7 σ 2 exp 1 the mean value was used as the estimation result this was done in r using rethinking package mcelreath 2020 data from 383 trees were randomly selected for the model parameterisation and the remaining 60 trees were used to check the accuracy of the model after the model was established we used the dbh and age time series of different degradation groups to simulate the tree height time series the kruskal wallis test and dunn s test were undertaken to evaluate the significance of differences among the groups 2 4 3 water use pattern of the poplars the mixsiar package in r stock and semmens 2016 was used to calculate the contribution ratios of water from different soil depths for poplars wang et al 2017 the model accepts isotope tracers as inputs and generates results using a bayesian mixing model stock et al 2018 because the effect of evaporation and precipitation on the soil water was limited when the soil depth decreased we divided the whole soil profile with intervals of 40 cm for 0 240 cm and the remaining depth 240 400 cm was considered as one layer the mean value of the model output was taken as the result 2 4 4 root depth judgement the root system is a vital part of a plant it determines the root ability of the root obtain water and nutrient sources fromm 2019 although the relative contributions of water sources to plants may vary under different water conditions ellsworth and sternberg 2015 the range of plant water use is restricted by the distribution of the root system fan et al 2017 however models for calculating water source partitioning usually ignore the problem of whether the potential water sources selected by the researchers are indeed actual water sources phillips et al 2014 the output results of the models depended only on the tracer values input by the researchers we set several principles to judge whether the root of a poplar at a certain depth with a certain degree of degradation was still active 1 if the root was still active it should be able to absorb a relatively large amount of water from the soil when the soil water was sufficient zhao et al 2020 2 if the root was still active it should be able to respond to soil water condition change which would suggest that the water contribution ratio of this depth should vary along with the soil volumetric water content vwc liu et al 2019 and 3 if the soil water condition was good but the contribution ratio was relatively low the root was less likely to be active wu et al 2016 the maximum contribution ratio of each depth was selected to demonstrate the ability of the root to absorb water for principle 1 the coefficient of variation cv value of the contribution ratio was calculated for different soil depths and degradation degrees to evaluate principle 2 the vwc characteristics were analysed to test principle 3 3 result 3 1 climate characteristics of the recent 50 years the annual precipitation varied significantly cv 0 17 during the 1970 2019 period with a mean value of 385 8 mm while the minimum value was 249 mm in the year 1997 fig 2 the annual maximum average and minimum temperature increased by 0 46 0 41 and 0 39 c every ten years respectively showing a significant trend of climate warming except for annual minimum temperature fig 3 precipitation in 2019 was 420 5 mm and was mainly concentrated in the period from may to october the rainfall in these six months was 56 4 61 4 97 2 41 3 61 and 14 mm respectively and the monthly average temperatures were 13 2 18 2 19 5 17 4 15 1 and 5 9 c respectively fig 4 the scpdsi varied greatly but increased significantly in the last 50 years fig 5 fifteen years of drought were observed in total according to the standard classification of scpdsi drought events from 1972 to1973 were severely dry events in 1971 1974 1975 1981 1984 1986 1987 and 1999 2001 were moderately dry the event in 2009 was close to moderately dry with a value of 1 98 among the 15 drought events the one that occurred in 1999 2001 was regarded as the starting point of the degradation process in previous studies sun et al 2018a 2018b as a result we selected the year 2000 as the point dividing the pre and the post degradation period table 1 3 2 morphological data of the poplars a total of 443 poplar individuals were sampled and a t test was performed to evaluate the differences among groups the dbh exhibited a clear downward trend with increasing degradation degree but tree height did not show similar patterns tree heights of the four groups were all significantly different from each other all p 0 05 but the ascending order was l d s d m d n d the crown width showed no significant difference in the two directions p 0 1 but the inter group variation was clear p 0 05 the order was l d m d s d n d the maximum and minimum tree ages were 37 and 13 years respectively which made it possible for the model to simulate the tree height from its half mature period to the overmature period stand density was significantly p 0 05 different among the four groups and negatively correlated with the degree of degradation while the order was s d n d m d l d 3 3 time series of tree size of poplars the dbh of the different degradation groups showed the following order n d l d m d s d reduced growth rates appeared after 2000 and the radial growth rates became even lower as the degradation degree increased fig 6 the average radial growth rates after 2000 for the four groups were 0 192 0 146 0 123 and 0 096 cm yr respectively according to dunn s test result table 2 before the slowdown began there were no significant differences in dbh among the four groups the results suggested that the inherent dbh variations among poplar individuals were not statistically obvious although the trend was easy to distinguish from the raw data after the slowdown point the dbh differed significantly among the different groups except for the relationship between the l d and m d groups this indicates that the growth drawback broadened the gaps among the four groups the parameterised model was h 1 3 10 1 35 4 96 1 dbh 2 21 1 t 0 90 1 d t 0 75 lg n t r 2 0 54 p 0 05 8 because the age of the sampled tree had all passed the sapling period the simulation results started in 1987 fig 7 the tree height of the different degradation groups were in the order of n d l d m d s d the growth rate slowed after 2000 the growth rate decreased even further when the degree of degradation increased the average growth rates after 2000 for the four groups were 0 169 0 142 0 124 and 0 101 m yr respectively the results of dunn s test for the tree height were similar to those for dbh table 3 the height variation between the four groups was insignificant before the year 2000 in the post degradation period the drawback effect had a greater influence on groups with higher degradation degree resulting in a significant difference in tree height among the four groups 3 4 soil water content characteristics vwc varied with the degradation degrees and seasons fig 8 the vwc of soil from 0 to 120 cm was influenced significantly by the season with a much higher value in may june and october and dried out in july august and september for the 120 240 cm and 240 cm layers the seasonal influence was indistinct but vwc tended to be higher in the dry season and lower in the wet season in general the vwc in different degradation plots showed a trend of l d m d n d s d but the difference between m d and n d was not significant table 4 this was probably due to the climate warming effect resulting in a higher soil evaporation rate in summer while rainfall may be unchanged or less than usual this would lead to a much more serious water deficit for poplars to survive 3 5 water use pattern and root depth of poplars for trees in the n d group soil water from the 0 120 cm layer contributed the most in may 45 1 june 51 4 and september 40 8 fig 9 the poplars in the n d group tended to use more water from 120 to 240 cm and 240 cm layers in july 63 8 august 66 2 and october 67 1 trees in the l d group had a similar trend as the n d group which mainly depended on water from 0 to 120 cm layer in may 44 0 and june 48 5 and then absorbed more water from the 120 240 cm and 240 cm layers during july 67 3 august 59 8 and october 66 3 trees in the l d group relied more on the 120 240 cm soil water in september 44 2 trees of the m d group predominantly relied on soil water from 0 to 120 cm in the 6 months while the contribution ratios were 53 5 49 1 45 5 50 2 50 3 and 51 9 respectively trees of the s d group showed relatively stable water use patterns which mainly took up water from the 0 120 cm soil layer the contribution ratios of the 6 months from 0 to 120 cm layer were 48 8 50 5 51 7 52 7 53 1 and 52 0 respectively for the n d group the cvs of the contribution ratios for 0 40 cm 40 80 cm 200 240 cm and 240 cm layers were 0 277 0 203 0 154 and 0 208 respectively fig 10 the l d group had a similar trend as the n d group while the cv for the 0 40 cm 40 80 cm 200 240 cm and 240 cm layers were 0 387 0 167 0 180 and 0 204 respectively for the m d groups only the contribution ratios from 0 to 40 cm and 40 80 cm varied greatly this phenomenon became more intense in the s d group while no soil layer showed a significant variation in water contribution ratios in the poplars in the s d group the cv for 0 40 cm was the greatest but only reached 0 104 these results indicated that the poplars in the n d and l d groups were still able access the deep or shallow soil water while the poplars in the m d and s d groups lost their ability to switch their water use patterns in response to the changing soil water conditions according to the three principles we set previously the dots indicating inactive roots were circled in fig 11 a depth of 120 160 cm for the n d group and a depth of 160 200 cm for the l d group were included considering that the vwc of the 120 160 cm layer for the n d group was relatively low fig 8 the root activeness could not be identified the vwc of the 160 200 cm layer for the l d group was relatively high compared to the other groups which suggested low activity of the roots roots below 120 cm for the m d group were all included but the vwc at these depths was in a relatively good condition table 4 this suggested that roots below the depth of 120 cm for the m d group had lost their activity for the s d group all depths were circled except for the 0 40 cm depth layer however the vwc of this plot was relatively similar to that of the n d group indicating that the roots below the depth of 40 cm could lose their activity 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of tree ageing and stand density on the growth drawback of poplars the tree height time series fig 6 of the poplars exhibited a decrease in growth rate after the year 2000 which was the transition period of the poplars from half maturity to maturity this is a natural phenomenon in which the growth rate of trees will decreases because of the larger tree size and higher hydraulic resistance linares et al 2013 according to the scpdsi values fig 5 the drought that occurred in 1999 2001 was not the most intensive in the entire growing period of the poplars yet the decrease in growth rate only occurred after 2000 this suggests that younger poplars were less vulnerable to drought similar results have been reported in other studies carnwath and nelson 2017 martínez vilalta et al 2012 however ageing of trees did not result in their mortality so drought is probably a trigger for the mortality of the poplars the field survey results also indicated that the ageing effect was not the main factor it was found that tree ageing did not necessarily cause dieback because the age varied significantly in the four degradation degrees table 1 which indicates that some younger poplars died simultaneously in the widespread mortality event ji et al 2020 reported similar findings in this study area in addition stand density was not a decisive factor either because the highest density occurred in the l d group and the lowest was in the s d group this was contradictory to what was expected because increasing stand density would intensify the resource shortage of the trees tsamir et al 2019 as a result it is not the ageing effect and stand density but the drought that is responsible for the mortality of the poplars nevertheless none of the factors mentioned above could explain why some of the poplars survived while others succumbed to drought 4 2 the relation between tree size and drought induced mortality in our field study dbh decreased when the degree of degradation increased table 1 this variation existed inherently before degradation began fig 6 although dunn s test results might indicate the opposite trend table 2 this minor morphological trait distinction might be a potential factor causing the heterogeneous dieback of poplars the tree heights of the l d group were smaller than those of the other groups which was contrary to what was expected this might have been caused by interference from some younger poplar individuals table 1 despite this the three remaining groups still showed a decreasing trend following the deterioration of the poplars the height time series also showed an inherent difference between the four groups fig 7 this result contradicts to the common findings bennett et al 2015 concluded that larger trees with greater tree heights and canopies tended to be more vulnerable to water stress this result should be obvious because greater tree height requires a longer water transport pathway from the root to the leaf and a larger canopy results in more water demand to maintain transpiration ryan et al 2006 meakem et al 2018 found that even though mid to large sized trees were more adapted to drought the exposure due to their canopy position affected them most under drought in contrast understory formed by smaller sized trees experienced less stressful hydraulic conditions and the mortality rate was usually lower grote et al 2016 a study in the mediterranean climate region found the similar results as ours the results showed that tree size was limited therefore it is likely that there is an inverse relationship between tree morphological traits and drought stress colangelo et al 2017 unlike the trees in moist conditions trees in dry or seasonally dry regions have developed particular functions to survive under drought conditions phillips et al 2003 found that the water storage capacity or capacitance of the tree trunk was critical for transpiration during the dry period this effect would be insignificant for smaller trees because water storage would be insufficient compared to its transpiration demand pratt and jacobsen 2017 in addition carbohydrate storage was higher in larger trees which played an important role against carbon starvation in long term water stress mitchell et al 2013 in our study dbh of the n d group was generally larger which correspondingly formed a larger water and carbohydrate pool compared to smaller and more degraded poplars from the aspect of vessels the correlations between conduit diameter and tree height of angiosperm species are different among tropical temperate and cold regions olson and rosell 2013 although height was the main factor driving the conduit diameter rosell et al 2017 the vessels of trees in the cold region were narrower in absolute terms olson et al 2018 this acclimation eased the disadvantage of a larger height as a result larger poplars in this region were more resistant to drought 4 3 the relation between roots system and drought induced mortality depths with active roots were much shallower for trees in the m d group and the s d groups while the n d and l d groups were still able to absorb water from the deep soil layer 240 cm deep roots are essential for trees in the arid region to survive under drought conditions padilla and pugnaire 2007 zheng et al 2019 trees in the dry region commonly invest more resources in root growth to acquire deep soil water ledo et al 2018 the root system also provides a protected reservoir for the storage of carbohydrates ryan et al 2011 in our study the rising temperature drove higher evapotranspiration strengthened the summer drought and caused the soil water at a shallow depth to dry out fig 8 and increased the water stress for poplars in response poplars in the n d and l d groups chose to rely more on deeper soil water which was more abundant and stable but the m d and s d groups had to face the soil water deficit the inability to absorb deeper soil water could cause poplars to die during extreme drought events in addition according to the findings of sun et al 2018b groundwater depth decreased significantly due to human activities in this region the original groundwater depth in 1995 was 2 76 m but decreased to 5 69 m in 2001 this indicates that poplars of the n d and l d groups may still be able to access the water from the capillary rise of groundwater fan et al 2017 during the 1999 2001 drought event but the rest of the poplars might not thus human activities could be a fatal factor for the death of some poplars 5 conclusions plantations are a crucial forest resource for the human society in zhangbei county china populus simonii carr plantation was the shelterbelt for local agriculture and residents however extreme drought caused heterogeneous dieback in the poplars to reveal the mechanism of their mortality a field survey including tree morphological data tree ring analysis and water use pattern study using stable water isotopes was conducted in 2017 and 2019 we found that tree growth began to slow down after 2000 but this drawback effect tended to be stronger for poplars with higher degrees of degradation it also showed that the survived poplars were inherently larger in size following the increase of degradation degree poplars gradually lost their ability to absorb water from the deep soil layer putting them into a more stressful water condition we conclude that the ageing effect and stand density were not the determining factors for the mortality of the poplars and that water stress was the primary cause of the mortality event moreover size and root system are determining factors for poplars to survive in drought that is larger poplars with deeper root systems were more resistant to drought in cold semi arid regions this result suggests that the local government should pay more attention to shelter forest management and be sure that water resources are sufficient for poplar growth and survival declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

10052,developing rapid technologies that improve the food production industry with no harmful influence on the environment is a prime priority today agriculture is one of the most important sectors but it consume large amount of water agriculture soil especially arid and semi arid soils have large pores due to this plants have to face low water and fertilizer retention problem smart polymeric materials and their high water and mineral retention capacity helped the agricultural industry hydrogels also termed as smart and or hungry networks are current subject of considerable scientific research due to their potential in hi tech applications in modern agriculture system this review mainly focuses on how we can increase the efficiency of already available hydrogels and their processing regarding crops this review also discusses the literature about some novel and advanced hydrogels with their applications in agri food based industries keywords agriculture hydrogels polymeric irrigation mineral retention 1 introduction several technologies have been developed and many agronomic practices are recommended for improving water productivity of crops there are many geographical areas which have less water availability and it affects the agricultural productivity of that particular area enormously many pre developed technologies have proven to be effective in solving these water scarcity problems one of the successful techniques is the use of hydrogels hydrogels 3 d networks of natural or synthetic material made polymers have higher flexibility due to the presence of higher water content they are reported to have great potential in areas with lesser irrigation opportunities and also increase the water availability during crop establishment ramli 2019 from the structural point of view hydrogels are divided as cationic anionic and ampholytic the uniqueness of hydrogel has made them useful in wide range applications such as drug delivery sensors dye adsorption agriculture tissue engineering etc sood et al 2016 hydrogels are lightly crosslinked polymers which can absorb significant amount of up to 2000 gg 1 water or an aqueous medium buchholz and graham 1998 zohourian and kabiri 2008 on the basis of applications hydrogels can be synthesized in different forms such as film rod sheet cubic and hollow tube haraguchi 2007 different properties of hydrogels such as mechanical budhlall et al 2008 thermal optical electrical zhao et al 2005 responsiveness liang et al 2000 and frictional haraguchi and takada 2005 can be improvised with the application of composite or a nanocomposite hydrogel form table 1 in the end of 60s hydrogels were reported for the first time by wichterle and lim 1960 after which hydrogels have been used as powerful tools in different technological sectors because of their incredible properties the hydrophilicity of the network is due to the presence of hydrophilic groups such nh2 cooh oh conh2 conh and so3h capillary effect and osmotic pressure dergunov and mun 2009 table 2 generally polymeric materials forming a hydrophilic structure which renders them to hold large amounts of water in their 3 d structure together form hydrogel products the hydrogels can also capable of modifying various physical properties of soil like infiltration rates density soil structure and compaction etc el hady and abo sedera 2006 various reports have suggested valuable positive impacts of hydrogel in crop growth and soil properties hydrogel when applied at the rate of 5 kg ha 1 along with farm yard manure fym in an alluvial sandy loam soil significantly crashed hydrological properties of soil like the field capacity water content ability relative field capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity narjary and aggarwal 2014 however a comprehensive strategy is still unspecific to obtain solutions for several problems in agricultural sector ladha 2009 in this situation hydrogel appeared to show relatively higher crop yielding potential in limited water availability a remarkable improvement was seen in crop yield and water use efficiency in most crops when hydrogels were used anupama and parmar 2012 it also supported and enhanced seed germination root growth and density and helped plants withstand extended moisture the analysis of review provides a comprehensive overview of the advanced applications and expected developments in currently available hydrogel 2 hydrogels in agriculture soil water plays an important role for vegetation and various plants development of hydrogels is one of the most efficient solutions for agricultural water shortage problems hydrogels tend to increase the productivity of soil and water ensuring the safety of natural environment abobatta 2018 in the areas with limited water availability use of amendments like hydrogel polymers have been a promising option because of their excellent water holding and nutrient using efficiency water management has emerged as one of the major issues in semi arid and arid regions all over the world by 2030 global water demand is expected to increase by almost 50 thereby increasing water scarcity where agricultural water already uses 70 of fresh water all over the world kashyap et al 2015 since hydrogel polymers reduce land erosion and have amazingly high water holding capacity they are valuable in agricultural sector in many ways shown in fig 1 rising demand for food is a serious concern in degrading environment and increasing economic problems in the field of agriculture growth of plants and crops gets reduced and sometimes permanent damages occur in soil biota when there is lower water retention leaching of moisture and high evapotranspiration in soil to address this need plant bioengineering has provided effective pathways for breeding new crop varieties with higher yields and better qualities such as improved resistance towards herbicides insects disease and drought conditions via use of hydrogel yoo et al 2007 beyene et al 2016 2 1 water reservoir a lot of attention is given to hydrogels because of their excellent capability for absorbing and retaining high amount of water in their structure up to hundreds of times their weight without dissolving there is an additional advantage in hydrogels as they are capable of releasing almost 95 of adsorbed water into their surroundings once they are dried out they can be hydrated again via water exposure they are capable of controlling soil moisture content as they are primarily used as soil conditioners in agricultural segment and are also responsible for supplying water to plants as well as serving for encapsulation and sustained release of agrochemicals song et al 2020 with the increasing water resource crisis water saving agriculture is much important for sustainable development hydrogel polymers enhance water penetration rate and have been used for retaining water in the arid and semiarid regions where irrigations resources are limited or under saline conditions which reduce the growth and productivity of crops they are also used to improve the water reservoir near roots increase field capacity of different types of soils and also increase both water content and its period of availability montesano et al 2015 previous studies have mentioned excellent ability of hydrogel polymer for improving water retention uptake of water and efficient of water use which in turn reduce water stress in plants and improve its performance thereby increasing growth hinojosa et al 2004 2 2 plant growth the most important phases initially in any kind of plant growth are seed germination and seedling establishment for the successful establishment availability of water is highly important and it is restricted by low soil moisture content in arid and semi arid regions moustafa and mansour 2003 for the better plant growth hydrogel polymers swell and increase the soil s water holding capacity and also increase the time to reach wilting stage thereby increasing survival rate of plants under water stress orikiriza et al 2009 under various severe conditions it also decreases fruit drop ratio increase total yield and weight of fruits barakat et al 2015 furthermore when hydrogels are added to soil they also tend to increase plant s circumference due to increasing available water in root zone which provide long irrigation intervals johnson 1984 hydrogels are also used for constructing a water reservoir near plant root zone which decrease soil s osmotic pressure improve plant s water availability increase plant growth whole yield and reduce cost of crop productions with the use of hydrogels plant s viability is also improved seed germination ventilation and root development is also enhanced in arid conditions helalia and letey 1989 additionally it has also been noticed that there is a remarkable growth in plants with the implementation of hydrogels yazdani et al 2007 2 3 controlled micronutrient delivery system hydrogels show potential in agriculture for overcoming issues associated with conventional fertilizers and irrigation a combination of hydrogels and fertilizers would limit the loss of fertilizer and curb environmental impact especially for nitrogen based compounds in addition to diminishing the frequency of irrigation they are also responsible for reducing the leaching of fertilizers which generally occurs through polymer fertilizer interaction polymer can also be taken as a potential career for protected agents like pesticides and herbicides el hady et al 1981 particularly in dry and semi dry regions where there is limited irrigation hydrogels are immensely used bakass et al 2002 fertilizers herbicides pesticides and other such agrochemicals are highly essential in the field of agriculture but these chemicals are also responsible for unwanted environmental impacts along with food chain bioaccumulation and ecosystem contamination an innovative controlled release technique combining agrochemicals with functional polymers has been used for delivering these agrochemicals at their active field rate for a long period of time without undesirable leaching in environment a suitable delivery system for sustainable agriculture should control agrochemical release at their lowest concentration protect the environmental conditions like ph light from being degraded by agrochemicals have lesser toxic effects than conventional pesticides and have long lasting validity of nanocarriers which reduces the use of pesticides and treatment with extended lasting validity period sikder et al 2021 2 4 soil remediation agent heavy metal contamination in soil is a serious global problem although numerous remediation techniques have been developed improved fertility of soil including the soil organic matter content cation exchange capacity nitrogen and phosphorus content various pot experiments were performed for studying the biological toxicity resulted in weakening of heavy metal toxic effects on cotton seeds and with increase hydrogel dosage the action effect was visibly increasing zhou et al 2021 chitosan is a widely used matrix for the purpose of antibacterial nanoparticles incorporation like zno cuo ag and au nanoparticles qu and luo 2020 chitosan possess cationic nature and is highly affected by ph surface area and bacterial concentration thus it also inherits antimicrobial features along with its unique physicochemical properties xu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c developed a chitosan poly vinyl alcohol zno 544 beads cs pva zno for the removal of cu ii ions from wastewater simultaneously antibacterial behavior was also represented against beads also escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus by beads on the basis of disk diffusion tests xu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2 5 stimuli responsive smart delivery system in nanotechnology continuously emerging developments has led to the increased use of stimuli responsive polymeric smart materials these materials have gained much attention for their excellent agrochemicals delivering ability under specific micro environmental conditions in a self regulated manner such materials contain pendant groups for example coo and nh which are responsible for accepting or donating proton as a response to environmental ph change thus ionization degree pka of the hydrogel depends on ph of the medium change in external ph is followed by the net change in degree of dissociation of ionizable groups which also causes external and internal ion concentration fluctuation this perturbation is accompanied by a sudden change in volume because of osmotic pressure and modified hydration properties which are driven by repulsive electrostatic forces between ionized groups ultimately the hydrogen bonded 3d structure of the gel collapses liang et al 2018 sun et al 2014 performed an experiment to control armyworm larvae where a ph responsive insecticide was released through light stimulated synthesis from methomyl loaded chitosan nano capsules sun et al 2014 a photo responsive system was developed for the controlling the delivery of herbicides by conjugation of 2 4 d with peg peg 4000 peg 10000 with the help of photo responsive spacer arm 3 nitro 4 bromomethylbenzoic acid ding et al 2016 a light responsive smart delivery system known as coumarin based polymers also represented a great deal of interest in field applications extended herbicidal activity along with the controlled release of 2 4 d under uv light was shown by these polymers ding et al 2016 2 6 nanocarriers for agrochemicals in aqueous media physical encapsulation i e nanocarriers of an active agent within amphiphilic polymers forms self assembled nanoparticles releasing rate of agrochemicals is highly dependent on polymer nature i e its hydrophilic or hydrophobic ratio linear or branched nature crosslinking degree and various types of non covalent interactions like h bonding ionic interaction etc with the modification in any of these parameters this ratio can be tuned effectively fluorescently labeled nanocarriers were introduced by liu et al 2015 for delivering and releasing agrochemicals that enables facile food chain tracing through simple fluorescence detection mode liu et al 2015 a unique pesticide nanocarrier has been also developed by them using a water soluble cationic dendrimer containing fluorescent perylene diimide pdi core attached to dendritic hydrophobic polyesters and peripheral amino groups with the application of synergistic electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions a hydrophobic insecticide thiamethoxam was loaded and immobilized the efficient delivery of drugs into the live cells was done by dendrimer based nanocarriers which increases the drug cytotoxicity and larval mortality 2 7 gene transfection due to the lack of efficient vectors for transporting genetic materials into plant cells crossing their rigid and multilayered cell wall genetic transformation of plant species is still a major challenging task van kooten and snel 1990 silva et al showed that sirna was effectively delivered in cellulose biosynthesis pathway to the target specific genes tobacco by 2 protoplast was used as a cell model for performing this study although further investigations are required with intact plant cell walls silva et al 2010 jiang et al 2014 studied the first polymeric gene carrier activity in plants jiang et al 2014 different generations of polycationic dendrimers were prepared which contained a central hydrophobic chromophore and they were responsible for evaluating the delivering efficiency in vivo and exploited the fluorescent chromophore for tracking the nanoparticles inside the plant two different double stranded rnas dsrna shoot meristemless dsstm and werewolf dswer were selected these dsrna can be expressed in shoot apical meristem and are needed for formation of meristem and maintaining it throughout the plant lifespan dendrimer polyplexes and dsrna penetrated the root wall and entered into the plant cell which led to a significant reduction in shoot apical meristem size and increased lateral roots jiang et al 2014 in gene silencing polymeric nanoparticles are capable of successfully reducing the pests and disease risks as they deliver silencing agents to these organisms thereby reducing hazardous risks due to agrochemicals another additional advantage associated with this technique is its high specificity for target species thus sparing rest nontarget organisms some promising results on this research for example liu et al showed the macromolecular nanocarrier synthesis and showed its capability for the transfection of helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrosis virus dna hanpv to specifically target the insect pest cotton bollworms liu et al 2016 2 8 augmented photosynthesis bioprocess augmentation or nanobionics is a different approach and a unique example in research to improvise the plant s photosynthetic efficiency for enhancing its crop productivity absorption of light by chloroplasts is restricted to visible spectrum and it s highly reduces solar energy potential efficiency uv light is absorbed by some of the light harvesting materials which are then emitted in the visible spectrum region thereby augmenting photosynthesis hedley et al 2017 candidates are compelled for performing this process because of the involvement of conjugated polymeric materials zhu et al 2012 ooms et al 2016 conjugated polymeric nanoparticles were developed cpns containing two different fluorene blocks poly 2 7 9 9 dihexyfluorene co alt p phenylene pfp and poly 9 9 dioctylfluorenyl 2 7 diyl co 1 4 benzo 2 1 3 thiadiazole wang et al 2017 photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplast cpn was found higher than the natural chloroplast in their experiment as it covered broader range of light including ultraviolet rays thereby accelerating electron transport rates in photosystem ii wang et al 2017 3 action mechanism of hydrogels water availability is an important input for agricultural production and plays a great role in food security permeability of soil its density structure texture and rates of evaporation and percolation of water are modified by hydrogel ekebafe et al 2011 hydrogel releases water and nutrient to the plants when surrounding soil around root zone of plants starts to dry up plant growth is mainly a utility of fertilizer and water for prolonging the survival of plants under drought conditions therefore there has been a prolonged need to develop new techniques for high concentration of nutrient release to the plants although there is a method of slow release fertilizers which is actually capable of decreasing the fertilizer loss either by rain or irrigation water for long time nutrition supply and reducing the use of granulated nutrients with high fertilizers was achieved with the help of encapsulated hydrogels tomaszewska and jarosiewicz 2002 3 1 water and mineral retention in hydrogel hydrogels deducts the micronutrients release into the water and also enhances the efficiency for consuming water it is also responsible for reducing the fertilization as decreased runoff prohibits the leaching of nutrients alternatively hydrogels ensure that there is no excess water release providing controlled and adjustable dose of fertilizer with respect to time nutrients are available to plants for a much longer period of time as compared to ammonium nitrate ammonium phosphate or potassium chloride which are otherwise available for short term ni et al 2009 around the root zones hydrogels act as reservoirs they tend to expand to around 200 800 times to that of original volume in the presence of water several measures have been taken to trap rain and irrigation water and to collect and store them for the gradual release according to the requirements of crops for long durations when hydrogels are mixed with soil they increase the soil s permeability and improvise their permeation rate they are compatible with a wide range of soils and regularly increase the performance and yield of the plant they have a tendency to avert the storm caused soil erosion in sloped terrains and prohibit rainwater retention neethu et al 2018 3 2 release of water in soil hydrogels are used as an essential water retaining material under limited irrigation resources or in saline conditions which negatively impacts the productivity of plants they also improve the rate of water penetration they increase the time period for which water is available for the plants in the root system its quantity as well as the field capacity of different types of soil montesano et al 2015 water enter into hydrogel polymer system by osmosis phenomena and release the water content whenever needed by the plant via account of root capillary suction and the complete action mechanism is described in fig 2 in approximation until a free volume of soil pores is attained the capacity of hydrogel to hold water in soil is represented as linear i e up to 35 45 consequently an instant increase in the soil water content can be written as δw wd where d is the dose w is the swelling degree gg 1 which allows making some estimates thus hydrogels with a swelling of 200 and 500 gg t will give a 10 moisture increase kazanskii and dubrovskii 1992 as per now according to studies hydrogels possess high ability to enhance water retention uptake of water and efficiency of water usage but studies have also shown that hydrogels also help in reducing the leaching of fertilizers when fertilizers interact with polymers where polymers are actually the potential careers for pesticides and herbicides protective agents particularly in semi arid and dry regions where water availability is limited hydrogels are often useful el hady et al 1981 3 3 release of minerals in soil there are different types of hydrogels defined on the basis of charge i e positive cationic negative anionic or neutral both linear and cross linked polyacrylamide hydrogels comprise of these charge based classes and on the basis of these charges the hydrogels react in soil and other solutes in soil heavy metals are positively charged components of clay negative charge and water tends to possess either a positive or a negative charge therefore positively charged cationic hydrogels binds with the negatively charged anionic components of clay and act like dispersants as depicted in fig 3 however presence of ionic bridges like calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 clay components and many other negatively charged substituents can bind with the anionic hydrogels because the complex chemical interactions between gels soil components and in occur in high frequency it is hard to determine or predict that how will a hydrogel react in a particular situation affinity of a hydrogel with other compounds depends on the presence of electrical charges levels of hydration van der walls forces and hydrogen bonding polyacrylamide polymers comprise of a complex array of negative positive and neutral segments to bind with other molecules the capability of a gel to adsorb water depends directly on the interactions between the gel with other solute and soil particles i e stronger the attraction of gel and soil particles stronger is the adsorption ability thereby stabilizing structure of the soil narjary et al 2013 4 how can we increase the efficiency of already available hydrogels 4 1 regeneration of hydrogels to evaluate the impact of an adsorbent regeneration and recyclable ability is the one of the most important part for economical and useful factors in effective hydrogels in adsorption capacity no significant change occurs even after reused for multiple cycles in regeneration and recyclable ability several factors like wide practical assessment of the applicability of a material low cost recycling uncomplicated separation are crucial in practical application of nanocomposite based hydrogels notably the hydrogel can be effectively regenerated through simple procedure via cost effective chemicals and reagents and even after multiple cycles of adsorption and desorption cycles can attain a high adsorption capacity in case of organic pollutants adsorption ethanol is used instead of hcl as desorption to maintain the high adsorption capacity of hydrogel mohammadi and co workers has introduced a hydrogel possessing a high adsorption capacity for metal ions cd pb and as and excellent reusability via chelator mimetic multi functionalized hydrogel mohammadi et al 2017 hydrogel can be eluted with low concentration of hcl acid and can be regenerated in its functionality and also can adsorb ions although self healing hydrogel using in situ polymerization of aa and acrylamide brief the regeneration and reusability process vivek and prasad 2015 4 2 reusability of hydrogels reusability in term of hydrogels is an essential property for various applications even though in case of conventional hydrogels reusability and recycling is a tough task due to their poor strength and lost mechanical strength in water after swelling kamata et al 2014 to enhance the reusability in practical aspects hydrogels should possess the good mechanical strength properties gong et al 2016 the active chelating functional groups present on the outer layer of hydrogels such as amine group carboxylic acid sulfonic acid etc determined the effective reusability and selectivity of the effective hydrogels the interaction of absorbent with active functional groups adsorbs and traps the adsorbent and also determines the development of effective adsorbent hydrogels karadağ et al 1995 these waste adsorbents can be i recycled for again adsorption process by regenerating them in acidic basic elution medium for next cycle kara et al 2004 ii disposed or cremated wang and co workers via in situ graft polymerization has synthesized novel carboxymethyl chitosan palygorskite cmcs g paa pgs nanocomposite hydrogel the effective nh4 can be reclaiming and adsorbed from ammonium wastewater via developed novel nanocomposite hydrogel cmcs g paa pgs however soil fertility can be improved via recovered nitrogen enriched adsorbent as slow release nitrogen fertilizer wang et al 2014 4 3 increase the absorbance capacity of hydrogels for water purification and waste water treatment removal of pollutants from water hydrogels have proven to be one of the most potential adsorbents from past few years to improvise the adsorption efficiency of hydrogels they can be modified encapsulated with several different particles studies were conducted to understand contaminant s mechanism on hydrogel adsorption kinetic models and adsorption isotherm models adsorption capacity depends on several factors like ph adsorbate concentration degree of swelling in adsorbent and various other metal ions for recovery of the used hydrogels recycling methods are used and factors affecting reusability of hydrogels were studied to maintain their stability and original properties van tran et al 2018 nanocellulose is applied for promoting adsorption capacity and their biodegradability they also allow inputs to release out slowly because of obstruction effect and the inputs are locked in the percolation network locking effect lin and dufresne 2013 carboxymethylcellulose and cnc hydrogels were prepared by araki and yamanaka with 150 time s higher capacity of adsorption to their dry weight araki and yamanaka 2014 carboxy methyl cellulose hydrogel grafted with poly acrylate co acrylamide containing cnfs oxidized via tempo have a swelling degree higher than the nanocellulose free hydrogel zhou et al 2013 these hydrogels are also confirmed to be used for the treatment of toxic metal effluents agricultural waste besides nourishing the soil zhou et al 2014 thus the nanocellulose price may decrease with their large scale production making it to be an exceptional characteristic for low cost adsorbent 4 4 addition of novel nanoparticles in hydrogels nanotechnology has great potential in agriculture and improved application in agriculture by controlled release better penetration slow and sustained release of active substances nanocomposites act as magic bullets loaded with herbicides fungicides fertilizers nutrients and target specific plant site to achieve desired results but these nanocomposites need to be tested very carefully because they may cause health hazard environmental pollution and could threat to the ecosystem they have potential to deliver nutrients to specific target sites in plants nutrients delivered to the plants through nanoparticles are done by 1 adsorption on nanoparticle 2 immobilization of nanocomposites 3 microencapsulation in nanoparticle polymeric shell and 4 synthesis of nanoparticles composed of nutrients itself gupta 2018 the interaction of nanocomposite silver carbon titanium and zinc with piriformospora indica shows the effect on plant growth varma and khanuja 2017 a report stated that silver nanocomposites using stenotrophomonas sp bhu s7 inhibited the germination of sclerotium rolfsii that causes collar rot of chickpea mishra et al 2017 similarly mishra et al 2014 used the silver nanocomposites with serratia sp that effectively shows antifungal activity against bipolaris sorokiniana spot blotch disease in wheat plants mishra et al 2014 the antibacterial activity of soda lime glass powder containing copper nanocomposites against e coli gram negative bacteria and micrococcus luteus gram positive bacteria esteban tejeda et al 2009 the copper nanoparticles cu nps when incorporated in chitosan hydrogels can improve yield and quality of horticulture crop fruits because of physicochemical properties of the nps hernández et al 2017 4 5 increase cross linking properties for different minerals in hydrogels insolubility mechanical strength stiffness and microbeads rigidity are effectively improved by crosslinking external stimuli such as ph temperature ionic strength light electric and magnetic field and composition of solvent make hydrogels to exert responsive behavior ahmed 2015 hydrogels developed by the dissolution of cnfs which were crosslinked with epichlorohydrin were reported to regulate seed growth effectively zhang et al 2017 polyacrylamide pam is formed from acrylamide a well known neurotoxin similarly an experiment was performed by puspasari and co workers for synthesizing a cross link polymer with the incorporation of an engineered material with high stability quite similar to the one without crosslinking puspasari et al 2015 with the polymerization of concentrated neutralized acrylic acid a superabsorbent hydrogel was produced with the help of an organic crosslinker agent compared to inorganic free hydrogels the swelling decreased with the addition of sio2 spheres while the strength of hydrogels increased by 10 20 chen et al 2013 samples which were thermally crosslinked were less stable during farming period and also showed lesser plant growth as compared to the samples crosslinked by radiation which were tremendously better in stability and growth sojka et al 1998 the hydrogels produced via crosslinking shows better water retaining capacity for agricultural and horticultural applications nasef and hegazy 2004 4 6 make them completely biodegradable nanocellulose based hydrogels have been a promising technique in several fields like food and agriculture as they are the major fresh water consuming resources in the world kenny et al 2009 but still these resources are deteriorating at much higher rates than natural restoration in general climatic changes may affect the use of water and its availability fig 4 a drought condition in particular occurs in many regions exerting the need to develop more irrigation resources for agriculture hydrogels successfully improve water holding soil capacity nutrient retention in sandy soils reduced the need for frequent irrigation and water runoff el rehim et al 2004 many patents have been filed based on this technique of using hydrogels in agriculture rudzinski et al 2002 traditional hydrogels being used in market are mostly non biodegradable and pollute soil to a large extent these environmental concerns create an immense need to promote the use of biodegradable hydrogels in agriculture cannazza et al 2014 montesano et al 2015 developed a novel class of cellulose based superabsorbent hydrogels which were completely biodegradable and biocompatible for application in agriculture hydrophilic polymers of nanocellulose having high moisture absorption ability and wettability have been implied to form hydrogels with better mechanical properties high biocompatibility and biodegradable nature effective use of biodegradable hydrogel as corn seed coating in early stage was studied by pathak and ambrose pathak and ambrose 2020 4 7 make them nanoscale size reduction empathy of hydrogels for absorbing water depends on the existing chemical groups like amine group hydroxyl group amide group carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid groups zheng et al 2010 permeability for selective solute or solvent can be improved by proper arrangement of porous polymeric matrix salerno et al 2011 topological features of porous network like void pore size etc affects the swelling ability of hydrogels furthermore the porosity pore architecture and pore size distribution are strongly needed to allow the three dimensional cell and tissue infiltration in tissue engineering applications annabi et al 2010 different sized cellulose particles have been studied for their effects on properties of gelatin cellulose hydrogels by ishak and co workers both cellulose micro and cnc nano were used in hydrogels formulation with gelatin in ratio 25 cellulose dispersion to 75 gelatin gelatin was then subjected to chemical cross linking using glutaraldehyde as crosslinking agent with cnc entrapped in gelatin to produce hydrogels ishak et al 2016 the swelling percentage regularly decreased with increasing the amounts of polymer and crosslinker in contrast with gel content results nacmc hydrogels were found to be sensitive to ph variations the average granule and pore sizes of the least swollen nacmc 12 hydrogel were found to be 13 1 0 3 nm and 82 1 3 2 nm akalin and pulat 2018 5 advanced hydrogels hydrogels are being used all over the world to reduce the water scarcity problems for agricultural crops production various types of hydrogels have been developed according to their applications some of them are transparent soil hydrogels encapsulated hydrogels nanocomposites hydrogels fabricated soil hydrogels shape changing hydrogels sensor based hydrogels and green hydrogels given below is the fig 5 which depicts the different types of hydrogels with their applications 5 1 transparent soil with the compound arrangement of organic particles and minerals transparent soil is formed which is capable of hosting a wide range of organisms downie et al 2012 transparent soil is specifically developed for promoting root growth under defined air water and nutrients conditions and allows in vivo time dependent root phenotyping both photographically and with the help of microscope in transparent soil root growth is analysed by measuring primary root length total root length and diameter of the root system of grown plants it is capable of phenotyping maximum volume of medium because of good mechanical strength and transparency root growing and imaging of various plants like alfalfa barley maize tobacco lettuce and arabidopsis have been done via transparent soil montesano et al 2015 with the incorporation of nafion particles which have low refractive index a new kind of transparent soil has been developed downie et al 2014 montesano et al 2015 studied a different kind of completely biocompatible and biodegradable superabsorbent cellulose based hydrogels mainly used in agricultural industries it was highly capable of enhancing the water retention ability of soil when plants were grown using this type of hydrogels better leaf tissue hydration was observed 5 2 encapsulated hydrogels another technology that has gained much attention from the researchers and immensely provides immune protection to transplanted cells is cell encapsulation a semi permeable membrane provides flow of nutrients and secreted proteins isolate cells from immune hostile reactions thereby protecting those park et al 2015 encapsulated hydrogels are widely used as transplantation devices cha et al 2010 hydrogel beads of hyaluronic acid ha by photo polymerization of methacrylate ha and n vinylpyrrolidone were developed using alginate as a spherical mold bae et al 2006 bae et al 2006 prepared the same ha hydrogel beads by photopolymerization of methacrylate ha and n vinylpyrrolidone but with the use of calcium alginate beads as spherical molds cha et al 2010 prepared a technique for the decoupling of inversely dependent permeability on hydrogel s stiffness via crosslinking of methacrylic alginate with poly ethylene glycol di methacrylate pegda park et al 2015 studied methods to improve chemical and mechanical strength and stability of alginate hydrogels using tempo mediated oxidized bacterial cellulose tobc although some non specific sideways reactions that occur in hydrogels used in cell encapsulation like chemical crosslinking with cells and various immersed biological entities in the gel is a major limitation of this method madl et al 2016 karoubi et al 2009 demonstrated and experiment with single cell hydrogel agarose capsules they supplemented these capsules with provisional matrix proteins re introduced the interaction of cell and matrix thereby supplying mandatory pro survival signaling for saving the cells from apoptosis 5 3 nano composites hydrogels hydrogels are actually 3 d hydrophilic structure of biopolymers reinforced with nanocellulose nanocellulose is derived from sustainable resources which are capable of improving the quality and working of products these products are referred as green nanocomposite materials because they are biodegradable and imperishable in nature nascimento et al 2018 nascimento and co workers used nanocellulose nanocomposites for healing of wounds and found very efficient results nascimento et al 2018 tanpichai and oksman 2016 5 4 fabricated hydrogels for the replacement of damaged organs with viable tissues in body for growth tissue engineering has been used for decades with the use of hydrogels it has provided much better results hydrogels have collagen hyaluronic acid ha fibrin and elastin like polypeptides elps etc which make them an efficient material for maintaining an excellent biological performance inheriting better abilities for cellular connections annabi et al 2009 using supercritical co2 water emulsion templated technique and dense gas co2 as a crosslinking medium many porous hydrogels have been fabricated annabi et al 2009 studied the production of porous a elastin hydrogels by implying high pressure co2 mellott et al 2001 developed poly ethylene glycol diacrylate peg da and pentaerythritol tri acrylate peta based hydrogels using 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone dmpa as a photo initiator in the process of uv photo polymerization fabrication of spheres was done using the three comonomers acrylic acid acrylamide or allylamine as well as without them mandal et al 2009 synthesized semi interpenetrating network hydrogels using silk fibroin polyacrylamide with a very high strength network of polyacrylamide and a soft silk fibroin segment therefore they maintained the properties of these hydrogels by manipulating the ratios of both the components highly stable and cyto compatible matrices were found in result due to the presence of intensive bonding and 3d networking between polyacrylamide although weak swelling properties and less mechanical strength still remained and turned out to be the major drawbacks of silk hydrogels this hinders the use of silk hydrogels in biomedical applications mandal et al 2009 5 5 shape changing hydrogels the functional and well defined 3 d structure formed by thin sheets buckling is inflicted to structural nonuniform stresses synthetic systems like programmable shape morphing materials have gained much attention in biological morphogenesis in the field of drug delivery biomedical devices and biomimetic systems they gave promising results jeon et al 2017 shape deformations can be isotropic expansion contraction evenly in all directions and anisotropic expansion contraction uneven in different directions moreover inhomogeneous structured hydrogels change the shapes on swelling deswelling or external stimuli and because of this reason they are considered as soft actuators ionov 2015 hu et al 1995 combined single layers of polyacrylamide paam hydrogel and of poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam hydrogel through interpenetrating polymer network to develop a bilayer hydrogel gracias et al 2013 also reported complex and multistate shape changes in several bilayer hydrogels xie and hsieh 2003 merged two hydrogel layers of β cyclodextrin and ferrocene in a host guest interaction jeon and co workers studied hybrid systems that combine stimuli responsive hydrogels jeon et al 2017 aida et al 2012 presented l shaped hydrogel with an oblique titanate nanosheet configuration and which was thermo responsive in nature 5 6 sensor based hydrogels nowadays humanity is facing one of the biggest threats in the form of environmental pollution and energy source nuclear power plants however has been an effective solution to energy source issues many functional hydrogels have been developed for detecting and reducing these problems for example beryllium is a durable light material with several industrial and defense applications however an immune system response known as beryllium sensitization is caused with its direct exposure and its harmful ashley et al 2007 for investigating smallest beryllium metal ion be2 in water systems responsive photonic hydrogels crosslinked with crown ether molecules have been created with small cavities an innovative polymerization method has been created for the fabrication of intelligent hydrogel sensing materials qin et al 2018 uranium is an essential nuclear element but its exposure is very destructive because of its chemical toxicity and radioactivity a super protein hydrogel system has been developed for enrichment of uranyl from seawater xiao et al 2017 a new approach to develop a colorimetric glucose sensor which can monitor the glucose levels with naked eye was used successfully nakayama et al 2003 potential utility of hydrogels for throughput screening can be implied by enabling hydrogels preparation in multiplex format it is also possible because of the presence of less exogenous fluorescent reagents or labels macconaghy et al 2014 5 7 green hydrogels to synthesize inexpensive hydrogels rapidly without any hazardous environmental impacts the green and sustainable technology is the most prominent option franklin and guhanathan 2015 nanocomposite hydrogels developed with green technology are said to possess maximum deformability amazingly high stretching capability which was tested and confirmed using qualitative images and tensile and compression tests wu et al 2015 in lignocellulosic polymers lignin is the major constituent which is biodegradable possesses antioxidant antimicrobial activity and is available as an industrial by product mohammadinejad et al 2019 thakur and thakur 2015 focusing on green technology 3d scaffolds and silk fibroin protein based hydrogels were designed by amalgamation of chitosan samal et al 2014 using alkaline or kraft lignin green polymer hydrogels were synthesized the ph sensitive hydrogels are used in agriculture biotechnology adsorption and for the nourishment of some species franklin and guhanathan 2015 garcía astrain et al 2013 synthesis and characterization of thermo responsive poly n vinyl caprolactam nanocomposite hydrogels containing nanocrystalline cellulose cnc with the help of frontal polymerization technique was performed as it is an easy conventional and low energy consuming method of macromolecular synthesis sanna et al 2013 6 drawbacks of hydrogel bioengineering technology can provide a great potential to enrich the developments of controlled release of nutrients soil conditioners enhancement of plant growth from hydrogels based on biopolymers there are still several challenges drawbacks regarding these kinds of hydrogels that needs to be gets addressed in future the respective drawbacks are as following 1 the natural polymer hydrogels are attractive due to several properties e g bioavailability biodegradability biocompatibility non toxicity and immunogenicity but such materials suffer from their poor mechanical strength 2 some properties of natural hydrogels such as ph and temperature variations may limit their use in applications such as packaging and in the biomedical fields 3 natural polymers are generally insoluble in water due to their complex hierarchical structures thus presenting a challenge in the fabrication of homogenous bio based hydrogel materials 4 poor mechanical strength of natural polymer based hydrogels various approaches has been described to address this shortcoming i the introduction of crosslinking agents and ii the use of double network systems 5 the incorporation of nano sized polymer scaffolds in hydrogel systems inhibits the generation of defects and cracks resulting in improved toughening and reinforcement effects 6 the factor of high cost of hydrogels really needs to be address the biggest limiting factor is always likely to be cost although advanced polymeric materials show great promise for smart agriculture the increased complexity of materials will naturally raise production prices and hamper their usage in field applications this has led to significant research in the development of hybrid polymeric materials which have the desirable chemical properties associated with synthetic polymers while the inclusion of natural polymers lowers costs of production it is also possible that new nanobased products do not reach the market as large companies are accumulating patents and waiting for opportunities for future exploitation following the development of more promising trading conditions 7 hydrogel posses the major issue of incipient toxicity 8 detrimental effects on the environment due to no solubility in water and non biodegradable nature of most of the chemical derived hydrogels 7 economical prospect of hydrogel hydrogels are a boost in agriculture as a soil conditioner and have proven to be most attractive and efficient material this is because of their 3 d cross linked network which has the capacity to swell up and hold large quantities of water in the field of agricultural applications hydrogels are being used for improving soil texture quality and has two main advantages first is they are an excellent water reservoir for roots of plants in drought conditions and second is they can also provide protection to plants against water logging they possess an extraordinary capacity of retaining water in large quantities and facilitate the utilization of nutrients by plants during water soil deficiency and also improve the texture stability and other physical properties of soil therefore most research regarding hydrogels and their application as a soil conditioner was done in areas facing water scarcity problems and where the irrigation facilities are less or not appropriate abedi koupai et al 2008 increasing amount of water is continuously consumed in agriculture for the safety of the environment and from economical perspective as well hydrogels retain water under the soil surface and thus reduce the need for frequent irrigation and water consumption and simultaneously causes less wastewater production with unwanted chemicals from industries the usefulness of hydrogels as a reservoir of water available for plants in the root zone has been already described in the review 8 conclusion and future prospects hydrogels three dimensional networks of polymers chains result from the hydrophilic polymer being held together by cross links however hydrogels made of natural or synthetic materials possessing high degree of flexibility due to large water content this review demonstrates the literature in the field of hydrogels in the past few years which describe the advancement in hydrogels way to increase their efficiency and make them useable in different ways and its environmental and agricultural applications widely they are reported to have great potential in improvising areas with lesser irrigation opportunities and also increase the water availability during crop establishment the path of the research in this review indicates that the combination of polymers cross linking which responds to different stimuli reusability biodegradability adsorption capacity cost effective advancement properties different varieties of hydrogels and their respective applications with benefits of their implementation and future generations of hydrogel that undergo spontaneous swelling in respect to regeneration and cost effective should be investigated further in the future thus we shed light on the current trends and future prospect with a special emphasis on environmental issues and agricultural sector it is expected that this review will forge new directions for the design synthesis and wider application of biodegradable nanosize high adsorption capacity regeneration reusability hydrogels and functional materials

polymeric irrigation mineral retention 1 introduction several technologies have been developed and many agronomic practices are recommended for improving water productivity of crops there are many geographical areas which have less water availability and it affects the agricultural productivity of that particular area enormously many pre developed technologies have proven to be effective in solving these water scarcity problems one of the successful techniques is the use of hydrogels hydrogels 3 d networks of natural or synthetic material made polymers have higher flexibility due to the presence of higher water content they are reported to have great potential in areas with lesser irrigation opportunities and also increase the water availability during crop establishment ramli 2019 from the structural point of view hydrogels are divided as cationic anionic and ampholytic the uniqueness of hydrogel has made them useful in wide range applications such as drug delivery sensors dye adsorption agriculture tissue engineering etc sood et al 2016 hydrogels are lightly crosslinked polymers which can absorb significant amount of up to 2000 gg 1 water or an aqueous medium buchholz and graham 1998 zohourian and kabiri 2008 on the basis of applications hydrogels can be synthesized in different forms such as film rod sheet cubic and hollow tube haraguchi 2007 different properties of hydrogels such as mechanical budhlall et al 2008 thermal optical electrical zhao et al 2005 responsiveness liang et al 2000 and frictional haraguchi and takada 2005 can be improvised with the application of composite or a nanocomposite hydrogel form table 1 in the end of 60s hydrogels were reported for the first time by wichterle and lim 1960 after which hydrogels have been used as powerful tools in different technological sectors because of their incredible properties the hydrophilicity of the network is due to the presence of hydrophilic groups such nh2 cooh oh conh2 conh and so3h capillary effect and osmotic pressure dergunov and mun 2009 table 2 generally polymeric materials forming a hydrophilic structure which renders them to hold large amounts of water in their 3 d structure together form hydrogel products the hydrogels can also capable of modifying various physical properties of soil like infiltration rates density soil structure and compaction etc el hady and abo sedera 2006 various reports have suggested valuable positive impacts of hydrogel in crop growth and soil properties hydrogel when applied at the rate of 5 kg ha 1 along with farm yard manure fym in an alluvial sandy loam soil significantly crashed hydrological properties of soil like the field capacity water content ability relative field capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity narjary and aggarwal 2014 however a comprehensive strategy is still unspecific to obtain solutions for several problems in agricultural sector ladha 2009 in this situation hydrogel appeared to show relatively higher crop yielding potential in limited water availability a remarkable improvement was seen in crop yield and water use efficiency in most crops when hydrogels were used anupama and parmar 2012 it also supported and enhanced seed germination root growth and density and helped plants withstand extended moisture the analysis of review provides a comprehensive overview of the advanced applications and expected developments in currently available hydrogel 2 hydrogels in agriculture soil water plays an important role for vegetation and various plants development of hydrogels is one of the most efficient solutions for agricultural water shortage problems hydrogels tend to increase the productivity of soil and water ensuring the safety of natural environment abobatta 2018 in the areas with limited water availability use of amendments like hydrogel polymers have been a promising option because of their excellent water holding and nutrient using efficiency water management has emerged as one of the major issues in semi arid and arid regions all over the world by 2030 global water demand is expected to increase by almost 50 thereby increasing water scarcity where agricultural water already uses 70 of fresh water all over the world kashyap et al 2015 since hydrogel polymers reduce land erosion and have amazingly high water holding capacity they are valuable in agricultural sector in many ways shown in fig 1 rising demand for food is a serious concern in degrading environment and increasing economic problems in the field of agriculture growth of plants and crops gets reduced and sometimes permanent damages occur in soil biota when there is lower water retention leaching of moisture and high evapotranspiration in soil to address this need plant bioengineering has provided effective pathways for breeding new crop varieties with higher yields and better qualities such as improved resistance towards herbicides insects disease and drought conditions via use of hydrogel yoo et al 2007 beyene et al 2016 2 1 water reservoir a lot of attention is given to hydrogels because of their excellent capability for absorbing and retaining high amount of water in their structure up to hundreds of times their weight without dissolving there is an additional advantage in hydrogels as they are capable of releasing almost 95 of adsorbed water into their surroundings once they are dried out they can be hydrated again via water exposure they are capable of controlling soil moisture content as they are primarily used as soil conditioners in agricultural segment and are also responsible for supplying water to plants as well as serving for encapsulation and sustained release of agrochemicals song et al 2020 with the increasing water resource crisis water saving agriculture is much important for sustainable development hydrogel polymers enhance water penetration rate and have been used for retaining water in the arid and semiarid regions where irrigations resources are limited or under saline conditions which reduce the growth and productivity of crops they are also used to improve the water reservoir near roots increase field capacity of different types of soils and also increase both water content and its period of availability montesano et al 2015 previous studies have mentioned excellent ability of hydrogel polymer for improving water retention uptake of water and efficient of water use which in turn reduce water stress in plants and improve its performance thereby increasing growth hinojosa et al 2004 2 2 plant growth the most important phases initially in any kind of plant growth are seed germination and seedling establishment for the successful establishment availability of water is highly important and it is restricted by low soil moisture content in arid and semi arid regions moustafa and mansour 2003 for the better plant growth hydrogel polymers swell and increase the soil s water holding capacity and also increase the time to reach wilting stage thereby increasing survival rate of plants under water stress orikiriza et al 2009 under various severe conditions it also decreases fruit drop ratio increase total yield and weight of fruits barakat et al 2015 furthermore when hydrogels are added to soil they also tend to increase plant s circumference due to increasing available water in root zone which provide long irrigation intervals johnson 1984 hydrogels are also used for constructing a water reservoir near plant root zone which decrease soil s osmotic pressure improve plant s water availability increase plant growth whole yield and reduce cost of crop productions with the use of hydrogels plant s viability is also improved seed germination ventilation and root development is also enhanced in arid conditions helalia and letey 1989 additionally it has also been noticed that there is a remarkable growth in plants with the implementation of hydrogels yazdani et al 2007 2 3 controlled micronutrient delivery system hydrogels show potential in agriculture for overcoming issues associated with conventional fertilizers and irrigation a combination of hydrogels and fertilizers would limit the loss of fertilizer and curb environmental impact especially for nitrogen based compounds in addition to diminishing the frequency of irrigation they are also responsible for reducing the leaching of fertilizers which generally occurs through polymer fertilizer interaction polymer can also be taken as a potential career for protected agents like pesticides and herbicides el hady et al 1981 particularly in dry and semi dry regions where there is limited irrigation hydrogels are immensely used bakass et al 2002 fertilizers herbicides pesticides and other such agrochemicals are highly essential in the field of agriculture but these chemicals are also responsible for unwanted environmental impacts along with food chain bioaccumulation and ecosystem contamination an innovative controlled release technique combining agrochemicals with functional polymers has been used for delivering these agrochemicals at their active field rate for a long period of time without undesirable leaching in environment a suitable delivery system for sustainable agriculture should control agrochemical release at their lowest concentration protect the environmental conditions like ph light from being degraded by agrochemicals have lesser toxic effects than conventional pesticides and have long lasting validity of nanocarriers which reduces the use of pesticides and treatment with extended lasting validity period sikder et al 2021 2 4 soil remediation agent heavy metal contamination in soil is a serious global problem although numerous remediation techniques have been developed improved fertility of soil including the soil organic matter content cation exchange capacity nitrogen and phosphorus content various pot experiments were performed for studying the biological toxicity resulted in weakening of heavy metal toxic effects on cotton seeds and with increase hydrogel dosage the action effect was visibly increasing zhou et al 2021 chitosan is a widely used matrix for the purpose of antibacterial nanoparticles incorporation like zno cuo ag and au nanoparticles qu and luo 2020 chitosan possess cationic nature and is highly affected by ph surface area and bacterial concentration thus it also inherits antimicrobial features along with its unique physicochemical properties xu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c developed a chitosan poly vinyl alcohol zno 544 beads cs pva zno for the removal of cu ii ions from wastewater simultaneously antibacterial behavior was also represented against beads also escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus by beads on the basis of disk diffusion tests xu et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2 5 stimuli responsive smart delivery system in nanotechnology continuously emerging developments has led to the increased use of stimuli responsive polymeric smart materials these materials have gained much attention for their excellent agrochemicals delivering ability under specific micro environmental conditions in a self regulated manner such materials contain pendant groups for example coo and nh which are responsible for accepting or donating proton as a response to environmental ph change thus ionization degree pka of the hydrogel depends on ph of the medium change in external ph is followed by the net change in degree of dissociation of ionizable groups which also causes external and internal ion concentration fluctuation this perturbation is accompanied by a sudden change in volume because of osmotic pressure and modified hydration properties which are driven by repulsive electrostatic forces between ionized groups ultimately the hydrogen bonded 3d structure of the gel collapses liang et al 2018 sun et al 2014 performed an experiment to control armyworm larvae where a ph responsive insecticide was released through light stimulated synthesis from methomyl loaded chitosan nano capsules sun et al 2014 a photo responsive system was developed for the controlling the delivery of herbicides by conjugation of 2 4 d with peg peg 4000 peg 10000 with the help of photo responsive spacer arm 3 nitro 4 bromomethylbenzoic acid ding et al 2016 a light responsive smart delivery system known as coumarin based polymers also represented a great deal of interest in field applications extended herbicidal activity along with the controlled release of 2 4 d under uv light was shown by these polymers ding et al 2016 2 6 nanocarriers for agrochemicals in aqueous media physical encapsulation i e nanocarriers of an active agent within amphiphilic polymers forms self assembled nanoparticles releasing rate of agrochemicals is highly dependent on polymer nature i e its hydrophilic or hydrophobic ratio linear or branched nature crosslinking degree and various types of non covalent interactions like h bonding ionic interaction etc with the modification in any of these parameters this ratio can be tuned effectively fluorescently labeled nanocarriers were introduced by liu et al 2015 for delivering and releasing agrochemicals that enables facile food chain tracing through simple fluorescence detection mode liu et al 2015 a unique pesticide nanocarrier has been also developed by them using a water soluble cationic dendrimer containing fluorescent perylene diimide pdi core attached to dendritic hydrophobic polyesters and peripheral amino groups with the application of synergistic electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions a hydrophobic insecticide thiamethoxam was loaded and immobilized the efficient delivery of drugs into the live cells was done by dendrimer based nanocarriers which increases the drug cytotoxicity and larval mortality 2 7 gene transfection due to the lack of efficient vectors for transporting genetic materials into plant cells crossing their rigid and multilayered cell wall genetic transformation of plant species is still a major challenging task van kooten and snel 1990 silva et al showed that sirna was effectively delivered in cellulose biosynthesis pathway to the target specific genes tobacco by 2 protoplast was used as a cell model for performing this study although further investigations are required with intact plant cell walls silva et al 2010 jiang et al 2014 studied the first polymeric gene carrier activity in plants jiang et al 2014 different generations of polycationic dendrimers were prepared which contained a central hydrophobic chromophore and they were responsible for evaluating the delivering efficiency in vivo and exploited the fluorescent chromophore for tracking the nanoparticles inside the plant two different double stranded rnas dsrna shoot meristemless dsstm and werewolf dswer were selected these dsrna can be expressed in shoot apical meristem and are needed for formation of meristem and maintaining it throughout the plant lifespan dendrimer polyplexes and dsrna penetrated the root wall and entered into the plant cell which led to a significant reduction in shoot apical meristem size and increased lateral roots jiang et al 2014 in gene silencing polymeric nanoparticles are capable of successfully reducing the pests and disease risks as they deliver silencing agents to these organisms thereby reducing hazardous risks due to agrochemicals another additional advantage associated with this technique is its high specificity for target species thus sparing rest nontarget organisms some promising results on this research for example liu et al showed the macromolecular nanocarrier synthesis and showed its capability for the transfection of helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrosis virus dna hanpv to specifically target the insect pest cotton bollworms liu et al 2016 2 8 augmented photosynthesis bioprocess augmentation or nanobionics is a different approach and a unique example in research to improvise the plant s photosynthetic efficiency for enhancing its crop productivity absorption of light by chloroplasts is restricted to visible spectrum and it s highly reduces solar energy potential efficiency uv light is absorbed by some of the light harvesting materials which are then emitted in the visible spectrum region thereby augmenting photosynthesis hedley et al 2017 candidates are compelled for performing this process because of the involvement of conjugated polymeric materials zhu et al 2012 ooms et al 2016 conjugated polymeric nanoparticles were developed cpns containing two different fluorene blocks poly 2 7 9 9 dihexyfluorene co alt p phenylene pfp and poly 9 9 dioctylfluorenyl 2 7 diyl co 1 4 benzo 2 1 3 thiadiazole wang et al 2017 photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplast cpn was found higher than the natural chloroplast in their experiment as it covered broader range of light including ultraviolet rays thereby accelerating electron transport rates in photosystem ii wang et al 2017 3 action mechanism of hydrogels water availability is an important input for agricultural production and plays a great role in food security permeability of soil its density structure texture and rates of evaporation and percolation of water are modified by hydrogel ekebafe et al 2011 hydrogel releases water and nutrient to the plants when surrounding soil around root zone of plants starts to dry up plant growth is mainly a utility of fertilizer and water for prolonging the survival of plants under drought conditions therefore there has been a prolonged need to develop new techniques for high concentration of nutrient release to the plants although there is a method of slow release fertilizers which is actually capable of decreasing the fertilizer loss either by rain or irrigation water for long time nutrition supply and reducing the use of granulated nutrients with high fertilizers was achieved with the help of encapsulated hydrogels tomaszewska and jarosiewicz 2002 3 1 water and mineral retention in hydrogel hydrogels deducts the micronutrients release into the water and also enhances the efficiency for consuming water it is also responsible for reducing the fertilization as decreased runoff prohibits the leaching of nutrients alternatively hydrogels ensure that there is no excess water release providing controlled and adjustable dose of fertilizer with respect to time nutrients are available to plants for a much longer period of time as compared to ammonium nitrate ammonium phosphate or potassium chloride which are otherwise available for short term ni et al 2009 around the root zones hydrogels act as reservoirs they tend to expand to around 200 800 times to that of original volume in the presence of water several measures have been taken to trap rain and irrigation water and to collect and store them for the gradual release according to the requirements of crops for long durations when hydrogels are mixed with soil they increase the soil s permeability and improvise their permeation rate they are compatible with a wide range of soils and regularly increase the performance and yield of the plant they have a tendency to avert the storm caused soil erosion in sloped terrains and prohibit rainwater retention neethu et al 2018 3 2 release of water in soil hydrogels are used as an essential water retaining material under limited irrigation resources or in saline conditions which negatively impacts the productivity of plants they also improve the rate of water penetration they increase the time period for which water is available for the plants in the root system its quantity as well as the field capacity of different types of soil montesano et al 2015 water enter into hydrogel polymer system by osmosis phenomena and release the water content whenever needed by the plant via account of root capillary suction and the complete action mechanism is described in fig 2 in approximation until a free volume of soil pores is attained the capacity of hydrogel to hold water in soil is represented as linear i e up to 35 45 consequently an instant increase in the soil water content can be written as δw wd where d is the dose w is the swelling degree gg 1 which allows making some estimates thus hydrogels with a swelling of 200 and 500 gg t will give a 10 moisture increase kazanskii and dubrovskii 1992 as per now according to studies hydrogels possess high ability to enhance water retention uptake of water and efficiency of water usage but studies have also shown that hydrogels also help in reducing the leaching of fertilizers when fertilizers interact with polymers where polymers are actually the potential careers for pesticides and herbicides protective agents particularly in semi arid and dry regions where water availability is limited hydrogels are often useful el hady et al 1981 3 3 release of minerals in soil there are different types of hydrogels defined on the basis of charge i e positive cationic negative anionic or neutral both linear and cross linked polyacrylamide hydrogels comprise of these charge based classes and on the basis of these charges the hydrogels react in soil and other solutes in soil heavy metals are positively charged components of clay negative charge and water tends to possess either a positive or a negative charge therefore positively charged cationic hydrogels binds with the negatively charged anionic components of clay and act like dispersants as depicted in fig 3 however presence of ionic bridges like calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 clay components and many other negatively charged substituents can bind with the anionic hydrogels because the complex chemical interactions between gels soil components and in occur in high frequency it is hard to determine or predict that how will a hydrogel react in a particular situation affinity of a hydrogel with other compounds depends on the presence of electrical charges levels of hydration van der walls forces and hydrogen bonding polyacrylamide polymers comprise of a complex array of negative positive and neutral segments to bind with other molecules the capability of a gel to adsorb water depends directly on the interactions between the gel with other solute and soil particles i e stronger the attraction of gel and soil particles stronger is the adsorption ability thereby stabilizing structure of the soil narjary et al 2013 4 how can we increase the efficiency of already available hydrogels 4 1 regeneration of hydrogels to evaluate the impact of an adsorbent regeneration and recyclable ability is the one of the most important part for economical and useful factors in effective hydrogels in adsorption capacity no significant change occurs even after reused for multiple cycles in regeneration and recyclable ability several factors like wide practical assessment of the applicability of a material low cost recycling uncomplicated separation are crucial in practical application of nanocomposite based hydrogels notably the hydrogel can be effectively regenerated through simple procedure via cost effective chemicals and reagents and even after multiple cycles of adsorption and desorption cycles can attain a high adsorption capacity in case of organic pollutants adsorption ethanol is used instead of hcl as desorption to maintain the high adsorption capacity of hydrogel mohammadi and co workers has introduced a hydrogel possessing a high adsorption capacity for metal ions cd pb and as and excellent reusability via chelator mimetic multi functionalized hydrogel mohammadi et al 2017 hydrogel can be eluted with low concentration of hcl acid and can be regenerated in its functionality and also can adsorb ions although self healing hydrogel using in situ polymerization of aa and acrylamide brief the regeneration and reusability process vivek and prasad 2015 4 2 reusability of hydrogels reusability in term of hydrogels is an essential property for various applications even though in case of conventional hydrogels reusability and recycling is a tough task due to their poor strength and lost mechanical strength in water after swelling kamata et al 2014 to enhance the reusability in practical aspects hydrogels should possess the good mechanical strength properties gong et al 2016 the active chelating functional groups present on the outer layer of hydrogels such as amine group carboxylic acid sulfonic acid etc determined the effective reusability and selectivity of the effective hydrogels the interaction of absorbent with active functional groups adsorbs and traps the adsorbent and also determines the development of effective adsorbent hydrogels karadağ et al 1995 these waste adsorbents can be i recycled for again adsorption process by regenerating them in acidic basic elution medium for next cycle kara et al 2004 ii disposed or cremated wang and co workers via in situ graft polymerization has synthesized novel carboxymethyl chitosan palygorskite cmcs g paa pgs nanocomposite hydrogel the effective nh4 can be reclaiming and adsorbed from ammonium wastewater via developed novel nanocomposite hydrogel cmcs g paa pgs however soil fertility can be improved via recovered nitrogen enriched adsorbent as slow release nitrogen fertilizer wang et al 2014 4 3 increase the absorbance capacity of hydrogels for water purification and waste water treatment removal of pollutants from water hydrogels have proven to be one of the most potential adsorbents from past few years to improvise the adsorption efficiency of hydrogels they can be modified encapsulated with several different particles studies were conducted to understand contaminant s mechanism on hydrogel adsorption kinetic models and adsorption isotherm models adsorption capacity depends on several factors like ph adsorbate concentration degree of swelling in adsorbent and various other metal ions for recovery of the used hydrogels recycling methods are used and factors affecting reusability of hydrogels were studied to maintain their stability and original properties van tran et al 2018 nanocellulose is applied for promoting adsorption capacity and their biodegradability they also allow inputs to release out slowly because of obstruction effect and the inputs are locked in the percolation network locking effect lin and dufresne 2013 carboxymethylcellulose and cnc hydrogels were prepared by araki and yamanaka with 150 time s higher capacity of adsorption to their dry weight araki and yamanaka 2014 carboxy methyl cellulose hydrogel grafted with poly acrylate co acrylamide containing cnfs oxidized via tempo have a swelling degree higher than the nanocellulose free hydrogel zhou et al 2013 these hydrogels are also confirmed to be used for the treatment of toxic metal effluents agricultural waste besides nourishing the soil zhou et al 2014 thus the nanocellulose price may decrease with their large scale production making it to be an exceptional characteristic for low cost adsorbent 4 4 addition of novel nanoparticles in hydrogels nanotechnology has great potential in agriculture and improved application in agriculture by controlled release better penetration slow and sustained release of active substances nanocomposites act as magic bullets loaded with herbicides fungicides fertilizers nutrients and target specific plant site to achieve desired results but these nanocomposites need to be tested very carefully because they may cause health hazard environmental pollution and could threat to the ecosystem they have potential to deliver nutrients to specific target sites in plants nutrients delivered to the plants through nanoparticles are done by 1 adsorption on nanoparticle 2 immobilization of nanocomposites 3 microencapsulation in nanoparticle polymeric shell and 4 synthesis of nanoparticles composed of nutrients itself gupta 2018 the interaction of nanocomposite silver carbon titanium and zinc with piriformospora indica shows the effect on plant growth varma and khanuja 2017 a report stated that silver nanocomposites using stenotrophomonas sp bhu s7 inhibited the germination of sclerotium rolfsii that causes collar rot of chickpea mishra et al 2017 similarly mishra et al 2014 used the silver nanocomposites with serratia sp that effectively shows antifungal activity against bipolaris sorokiniana spot blotch disease in wheat plants mishra et al 2014 the antibacterial activity of soda lime glass powder containing copper nanocomposites against e coli gram negative bacteria and micrococcus luteus gram positive bacteria esteban tejeda et al 2009 the copper nanoparticles cu nps when incorporated in chitosan hydrogels can improve yield and quality of horticulture crop fruits because of physicochemical properties of the nps hernández et al 2017 4 5 increase cross linking properties for different minerals in hydrogels insolubility mechanical strength stiffness and microbeads rigidity are effectively improved by crosslinking external stimuli such as ph temperature ionic strength light electric and magnetic field and composition of solvent make hydrogels to exert responsive behavior ahmed 2015 hydrogels developed by the dissolution of cnfs which were crosslinked with epichlorohydrin were reported to regulate seed growth effectively zhang et al 2017 polyacrylamide pam is formed from acrylamide a well known neurotoxin similarly an experiment was performed by puspasari and co workers for synthesizing a cross link polymer with the incorporation of an engineered material with high stability quite similar to the one without crosslinking puspasari et al 2015 with the polymerization of concentrated neutralized acrylic acid a superabsorbent hydrogel was produced with the help of an organic crosslinker agent compared to inorganic free hydrogels the swelling decreased with the addition of sio2 spheres while the strength of hydrogels increased by 10 20 chen et al 2013 samples which were thermally crosslinked were less stable during farming period and also showed lesser plant growth as compared to the samples crosslinked by radiation which were tremendously better in stability and growth sojka et al 1998 the hydrogels produced via crosslinking shows better water retaining capacity for agricultural and horticultural applications nasef and hegazy 2004 4 6 make them completely biodegradable nanocellulose based hydrogels have been a promising technique in several fields like food and agriculture as they are the major fresh water consuming resources in the world kenny et al 2009 but still these resources are deteriorating at much higher rates than natural restoration in general climatic changes may affect the use of water and its availability fig 4 a drought condition in particular occurs in many regions exerting the need to develop more irrigation resources for agriculture hydrogels successfully improve water holding soil capacity nutrient retention in sandy soils reduced the need for frequent irrigation and water runoff el rehim et al 2004 many patents have been filed based on this technique of using hydrogels in agriculture rudzinski et al 2002 traditional hydrogels being used in market are mostly non biodegradable and pollute soil to a large extent these environmental concerns create an immense need to promote the use of biodegradable hydrogels in agriculture cannazza et al 2014 montesano et al 2015 developed a novel class of cellulose based superabsorbent hydrogels which were completely biodegradable and biocompatible for application in agriculture hydrophilic polymers of nanocellulose having high moisture absorption ability and wettability have been implied to form hydrogels with better mechanical properties high biocompatibility and biodegradable nature effective use of biodegradable hydrogel as corn seed coating in early stage was studied by pathak and ambrose pathak and ambrose 2020 4 7 make them nanoscale size reduction empathy of hydrogels for absorbing water depends on the existing chemical groups like amine group hydroxyl group amide group carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid groups zheng et al 2010 permeability for selective solute or solvent can be improved by proper arrangement of porous polymeric matrix salerno et al 2011 topological features of porous network like void pore size etc affects the swelling ability of hydrogels furthermore the porosity pore architecture and pore size distribution are strongly needed to allow the three dimensional cell and tissue infiltration in tissue engineering applications annabi et al 2010 different sized cellulose particles have been studied for their effects on properties of gelatin cellulose hydrogels by ishak and co workers both cellulose micro and cnc nano were used in hydrogels formulation with gelatin in ratio 25 cellulose dispersion to 75 gelatin gelatin was then subjected to chemical cross linking using glutaraldehyde as crosslinking agent with cnc entrapped in gelatin to produce hydrogels ishak et al 2016 the swelling percentage regularly decreased with increasing the amounts of polymer and crosslinker in contrast with gel content results nacmc hydrogels were found to be sensitive to ph variations the average granule and pore sizes of the least swollen nacmc 12 hydrogel were found to be 13 1 0 3 nm and 82 1 3 2 nm akalin and pulat 2018 5 advanced hydrogels hydrogels are being used all over the world to reduce the water scarcity problems for agricultural crops production various types of hydrogels have been developed according to their applications some of them are transparent soil hydrogels encapsulated hydrogels nanocomposites hydrogels fabricated soil hydrogels shape changing hydrogels sensor based hydrogels and green hydrogels given below is the fig 5 which depicts the different types of hydrogels with their applications 5 1 transparent soil with the compound arrangement of organic particles and minerals transparent soil is formed which is capable of hosting a wide range of organisms downie et al 2012 transparent soil is specifically developed for promoting root growth under defined air water and nutrients conditions and allows in vivo time dependent root phenotyping both photographically and with the help of microscope in transparent soil root growth is analysed by measuring primary root length total root length and diameter of the root system of grown plants it is capable of phenotyping maximum volume of medium because of good mechanical strength and transparency root growing and imaging of various plants like alfalfa barley maize tobacco lettuce and arabidopsis have been done via transparent soil montesano et al 2015 with the incorporation of nafion particles which have low refractive index a new kind of transparent soil has been developed downie et al 2014 montesano et al 2015 studied a different kind of completely biocompatible and biodegradable superabsorbent cellulose based hydrogels mainly used in agricultural industries it was highly capable of enhancing the water retention ability of soil when plants were grown using this type of hydrogels better leaf tissue hydration was observed 5 2 encapsulated hydrogels another technology that has gained much attention from the researchers and immensely provides immune protection to transplanted cells is cell encapsulation a semi permeable membrane provides flow of nutrients and secreted proteins isolate cells from immune hostile reactions thereby protecting those park et al 2015 encapsulated hydrogels are widely used as transplantation devices cha et al 2010 hydrogel beads of hyaluronic acid ha by photo polymerization of methacrylate ha and n vinylpyrrolidone were developed using alginate as a spherical mold bae et al 2006 bae et al 2006 prepared the same ha hydrogel beads by photopolymerization of methacrylate ha and n vinylpyrrolidone but with the use of calcium alginate beads as spherical molds cha et al 2010 prepared a technique for the decoupling of inversely dependent permeability on hydrogel s stiffness via crosslinking of methacrylic alginate with poly ethylene glycol di methacrylate pegda park et al 2015 studied methods to improve chemical and mechanical strength and stability of alginate hydrogels using tempo mediated oxidized bacterial cellulose tobc although some non specific sideways reactions that occur in hydrogels used in cell encapsulation like chemical crosslinking with cells and various immersed biological entities in the gel is a major limitation of this method madl et al 2016 karoubi et al 2009 demonstrated and experiment with single cell hydrogel agarose capsules they supplemented these capsules with provisional matrix proteins re introduced the interaction of cell and matrix thereby supplying mandatory pro survival signaling for saving the cells from apoptosis 5 3 nano composites hydrogels hydrogels are actually 3 d hydrophilic structure of biopolymers reinforced with nanocellulose nanocellulose is derived from sustainable resources which are capable of improving the quality and working of products these products are referred as green nanocomposite materials because they are biodegradable and imperishable in nature nascimento et al 2018 nascimento and co workers used nanocellulose nanocomposites for healing of wounds and found very efficient results nascimento et al 2018 tanpichai and oksman 2016 5 4 fabricated hydrogels for the replacement of damaged organs with viable tissues in body for growth tissue engineering has been used for decades with the use of hydrogels it has provided much better results hydrogels have collagen hyaluronic acid ha fibrin and elastin like polypeptides elps etc which make them an efficient material for maintaining an excellent biological performance inheriting better abilities for cellular connections annabi et al 2009 using supercritical co2 water emulsion templated technique and dense gas co2 as a crosslinking medium many porous hydrogels have been fabricated annabi et al 2009 studied the production of porous a elastin hydrogels by implying high pressure co2 mellott et al 2001 developed poly ethylene glycol diacrylate peg da and pentaerythritol tri acrylate peta based hydrogels using 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone dmpa as a photo initiator in the process of uv photo polymerization fabrication of spheres was done using the three comonomers acrylic acid acrylamide or allylamine as well as without them mandal et al 2009 synthesized semi interpenetrating network hydrogels using silk fibroin polyacrylamide with a very high strength network of polyacrylamide and a soft silk fibroin segment therefore they maintained the properties of these hydrogels by manipulating the ratios of both the components highly stable and cyto compatible matrices were found in result due to the presence of intensive bonding and 3d networking between polyacrylamide although weak swelling properties and less mechanical strength still remained and turned out to be the major drawbacks of silk hydrogels this hinders the use of silk hydrogels in biomedical applications mandal et al 2009 5 5 shape changing hydrogels the functional and well defined 3 d structure formed by thin sheets buckling is inflicted to structural nonuniform stresses synthetic systems like programmable shape morphing materials have gained much attention in biological morphogenesis in the field of drug delivery biomedical devices and biomimetic systems they gave promising results jeon et al 2017 shape deformations can be isotropic expansion contraction evenly in all directions and anisotropic expansion contraction uneven in different directions moreover inhomogeneous structured hydrogels change the shapes on swelling deswelling or external stimuli and because of this reason they are considered as soft actuators ionov 2015 hu et al 1995 combined single layers of polyacrylamide paam hydrogel and of poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam hydrogel through interpenetrating polymer network to develop a bilayer hydrogel gracias et al 2013 also reported complex and multistate shape changes in several bilayer hydrogels xie and hsieh 2003 merged two hydrogel layers of β cyclodextrin and ferrocene in a host guest interaction jeon and co workers studied hybrid systems that combine stimuli responsive hydrogels jeon et al 2017 aida et al 2012 presented l shaped hydrogel with an oblique titanate nanosheet configuration and which was thermo responsive in nature 5 6 sensor based hydrogels nowadays humanity is facing one of the biggest threats in the form of environmental pollution and energy source nuclear power plants however has been an effective solution to energy source issues many functional hydrogels have been developed for detecting and reducing these problems for example beryllium is a durable light material with several industrial and defense applications however an immune system response known as beryllium sensitization is caused with its direct exposure and its harmful ashley et al 2007 for investigating smallest beryllium metal ion be2 in water systems responsive photonic hydrogels crosslinked with crown ether molecules have been created with small cavities an innovative polymerization method has been created for the fabrication of intelligent hydrogel sensing materials qin et al 2018 uranium is an essential nuclear element but its exposure is very destructive because of its chemical toxicity and radioactivity a super protein hydrogel system has been developed for enrichment of uranyl from seawater xiao et al 2017 a new approach to develop a colorimetric glucose sensor which can monitor the glucose levels with naked eye was used successfully nakayama et al 2003 potential utility of hydrogels for throughput screening can be implied by enabling hydrogels preparation in multiplex format it is also possible because of the presence of less exogenous fluorescent reagents or labels macconaghy et al 2014 5 7 green hydrogels to synthesize inexpensive hydrogels rapidly without any hazardous environmental impacts the green and sustainable technology is the most prominent option franklin and guhanathan 2015 nanocomposite hydrogels developed with green technology are said to possess maximum deformability amazingly high stretching capability which was tested and confirmed using qualitative images and tensile and compression tests wu et al 2015 in lignocellulosic polymers lignin is the major constituent which is biodegradable possesses antioxidant antimicrobial activity and is available as an industrial by product mohammadinejad et al 2019 thakur and thakur 2015 focusing on green technology 3d scaffolds and silk fibroin protein based hydrogels were designed by amalgamation of chitosan samal et al 2014 using alkaline or kraft lignin green polymer hydrogels were synthesized the ph sensitive hydrogels are used in agriculture biotechnology adsorption and for the nourishment of some species franklin and guhanathan 2015 garcía astrain et al 2013 synthesis and characterization of thermo responsive poly n vinyl caprolactam nanocomposite hydrogels containing nanocrystalline cellulose cnc with the help of frontal polymerization technique was performed as it is an easy conventional and low energy consuming method of macromolecular synthesis sanna et al 2013 6 drawbacks of hydrogel bioengineering technology can provide a great potential to enrich the developments of controlled release of nutrients soil conditioners enhancement of plant growth from hydrogels based on biopolymers there are still several challenges drawbacks regarding these kinds of hydrogels that needs to be gets addressed in future the respective drawbacks are as following 1 the natural polymer hydrogels are attractive due to several properties e g bioavailability biodegradability biocompatibility non toxicity and immunogenicity but such materials suffer from their poor mechanical strength 2 some properties of natural hydrogels such as ph and temperature variations may limit their use in applications such as packaging and in the biomedical fields 3 natural polymers are generally insoluble in water due to their complex hierarchical structures thus presenting a challenge in the fabrication of homogenous bio based hydrogel materials 4 poor mechanical strength of natural polymer based hydrogels various approaches has been described to address this shortcoming i the introduction of crosslinking agents and ii the use of double network systems 5 the incorporation of nano sized polymer scaffolds in hydrogel systems inhibits the generation of defects and cracks resulting in improved toughening and reinforcement effects 6 the factor of high cost of hydrogels really needs to be address the biggest limiting factor is always likely to be cost although advanced polymeric materials show great promise for smart agriculture the increased complexity of materials will naturally raise production prices and hamper their usage in field applications this has led to significant research in the development of hybrid polymeric materials which have the desirable chemical properties associated with synthetic polymers while the inclusion of natural polymers lowers costs of production it is also possible that new nanobased products do not reach the market as large companies are accumulating patents and waiting for opportunities for future exploitation following the development of more promising trading conditions 7 hydrogel posses the major issue of incipient toxicity 8 detrimental effects on the environment due to no solubility in water and non biodegradable nature of most of the chemical derived hydrogels 7 economical prospect of hydrogel hydrogels are a boost in agriculture as a soil conditioner and have proven to be most attractive and efficient material this is because of their 3 d cross linked network which has the capacity to swell up and hold large quantities of water in the field of agricultural applications hydrogels are being used for improving soil texture quality and has two main advantages first is they are an excellent water reservoir for roots of plants in drought conditions and second is they can also provide protection to plants against water logging they possess an extraordinary capacity of retaining water in large quantities and facilitate the utilization of nutrients by plants during water soil deficiency and also improve the texture stability and other physical properties of soil therefore most research regarding hydrogels and their application as a soil conditioner was done in areas facing water scarcity problems and where the irrigation facilities are less or not appropriate abedi koupai et al 2008 increasing amount of water is continuously consumed in agriculture for the safety of the environment and from economical perspective as well hydrogels retain water under the soil surface and thus reduce the need for frequent irrigation and water consumption and simultaneously causes less wastewater production with unwanted chemicals from industries the usefulness of hydrogels as a reservoir of water available for plants in the root zone has been already described in the review 8 conclusion and future prospects hydrogels three dimensional networks of polymers chains result from the hydrophilic polymer being held together by cross links however hydrogels made of natural or synthetic materials possessing high degree of flexibility due to large water content this review demonstrates the literature in the field of hydrogels in the past few years which describe the advancement in hydrogels way to increase their efficiency and make them useable in different ways and its environmental and agricultural applications widely they are reported to have great potential in improvising areas with lesser irrigation opportunities and also increase the water availability during crop establishment the path of the research in this review indicates that the combination of polymers cross linking which responds to different stimuli reusability biodegradability adsorption capacity cost effective advancement properties different varieties of hydrogels and their respective applications with benefits of their implementation and future generations of hydrogel that undergo spontaneous swelling in respect to regeneration and cost effective should be investigated further in the future thus we shed light on the current trends and future prospect with a special emphasis on environmental issues and agricultural sector it is expected that this review will forge new directions for the design synthesis and wider application of biodegradable nanosize high adsorption capacity regeneration reusability hydrogels and functional materials

10053,biochar a form of porous pyrogenic carbon has been shown to influence soil physicochemical properties and increase crop yield however it is unclear whether biochar application at different rates will improve crop performance in a clay soil under drought conditions through increasing plant water uptake here we examined performance of soybean after amendment with biochar pyrolysed at 400 c for 5 h at four application rates 0 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 and grown under three moisture regimes 40 60 and 80 of field capacity the instantaneous plant water content was determined periodically by recording relative water content water retention capacity and water uptake capacity in leaves while the cumulative water stress and water use efficiency wue were determined from aboveground δ13c

growth rate and increased total biomass production with a doubling in yield in the 100 t ha 1 biochar application however the seed yield did not increase with biochar application although biochar application improved wue biomass produced per unit of water applied it most likely did not improve plant water uptake since none of the measured plant water status indicators were affected by biochar instead the enhanced biomass production may have been caused by an improvement in plant nutrition possibly biochar application increased n acquisition through biological nitrogen fixation as there was a significant relationship between nitrogen n concentration in aboveground biomass and total biomass production moreover application of biochar increased soil available potassium k and enhanced k uptake may have increased stress tolerance in soybean therefore our findings show that biochar could improve plant performance in a clay soil by improving nutrient supply rather than by increasing

soil one of the potential benefits of biochar application is an increase in water use efficiency wue and plant performance under water limited conditions ali et al 2017 bis et al 2018 gavili et al 2019 biochar is a high aromatic carbon containing porous material with variable pores macro to micro pores while it contains different surface functional groups cha et al 2016 biochar pores could potentially retain more water but some of this water may not be available to plants because of a relatively high water potential omondi et al 2016 the functional groups of biochar may also affect soil water retention and plant water uptake through their chemical interactions e g polar attractions with soil water ma et al 2016 moragues saitua et al 2017 omondi et al 2016 moreover application of biochar with high ash content can increase soil osmotic potential which can reduce plant water uptake particularly when applied at higher rates gavili et al 2019 when applied to soil biochar also influences plant water uptake and its use efficiency by changing soil physical properties omondi et al 2016 ouyang et al 2013 for instance biochar reduces soil bulk density that could further increase water retention in soils additionally the interactions among soil particles and surfaces of biochar can change soil aggregate formation which could then also alter soil water plant relationships ajayi et al 2016 herath et al 2013 ouyang et al 2013 because of these interactions with soil biochar effects on soil water plant relationships may be soil type specific for instance biochar application has

2017 biochar produced from organic waste e g poultry litter can provide a sustainable solution to waste management freshly prepared biochar from biowaste e g from animal manure and poultry litter

k content of biochar may improve plant performance under stress tanure et al 2019 zahoor et al 2017 therefore it is expected that manure based biochars could alleviate drought stress additionally biochar application has shown to change biological nitrogen fixation that could also affect legume performance mia et al 2018 2014 van zwieten et al 2015 while several studies have been published on biochar mediated changes in volumetric water content of soils alotaibi and schoenau 2019 poormansour and razzaghi 2018 svoboda et al 2017 many of these studies were conducted in coarse textured soils abel et al 2013 bohara et al 2019 haider et al 2015 herath et al 2013 tanure et al 2019 only a few biochar studies examined how biochar application affects soil water availability to plants and whether a potential increase in water availability contributes to an improved wue particularly under limited water content aller et al 2017 therefore there is a need to understand how a biochar produced with slow pyrolysis at relatively low temperature possibly with large macro pores but with low micro pores interacts with a clay soil under water deficit conditions here we examined the performance of a legume soybean grown at different moisture levels 40 60 and 80 field capacity fc after the amendment of different levels of biochar 0 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 we hypothesised that a poultry litter biochar would improve water uptake in soybean with a more pronounced effect at higher biochar application rates particular when soybean is grown under relatively severe drought conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar and soil biochar was produced with 15 kg of fresh poultry litter using a slow pyrolysis kiln mia et al 2015 the average pyrolysis temperature was 400 c while the residence time was 5 h the selected biochar properties are listed in table 1 the soil was collected from field sites of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman agricultural university bsmrau gazipur bangladesh 24 0379 n 90 3996 e the soil contained 40 4 29 2 and 30 4 sand silt and clay respectively while the ph was neutral table 1 2 2 pot experiment a factorial pot experiment was carried in a makeshift net house at bsmrau gazipur bangladesh soybean was grown in pots after amendment of biochar at different application rates 0 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 while soil moisture was maintained at 80 60 and 40 fc for determining the field capacity of the soil biochar mixtures the entire pot was submerged and drained for 48 h the amount of water retained after 48 h of drainage was considered as 100 fc for soil and soil biochar mixtures the amount of water required for achieving 40 60 and 80 fc was then calculated based on weight pots inner diameter 24 cm height 30 cm were prepared with polyethylene pipe with three draining holes at the bottom each of the 24 pots was filled with air dried soil 11 kg pot 1 or soil and biochar mixture depending on the treatments each pot received 0 122 244 and 488 g dry biochar equivalent to 25 50 and 100 t biochar ha 1 respectively the treatments were replicated three times while individual treatments were assigned following a randomized complete block design seeds of soybean variety bari 6 were inoculated with rhizobium biofertilizer 70 g kg 1 seed next plants in each pot were sown with ten seeds out of the ten seedlings six seedlings were maintained in each pot under natural sunlight but under a polyethylene cover to avoid natural rainfall the water regimes drought treatment were maintained by regular watering based on weight loss due to evapotranspiration average temperature and relative humidity rh were 23 1 c and 78 6 respectively during the experimental period all pots received fertilizers at recommended rates bari 2016 specifically pots received fertilizers at a rate of 25 kg n 35 kg p 55 kg k and 18 kg s ha 1 pots were harvested after 110 days 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 growth and physiological parameters plant height was recorded at 30 45 60 days after sowing das and at harvest the relative water content rwc in leaves was measured using the fully expanded uppermost leaf from all 6 plants in each pot the collected leaves were dried at 70 c in an oven for 4 h water retention capacity wrc and water uptake capacity were determined as suggested by schonfeld et al 1988 1 rwc fw dw tw dw 100 2 water retention capacity tw dw 100 3 water uptake capacity tw fw dw 100 where fw dw and tw respectively are the fresh weight dry weight and turgid weight of the leaf the latter measured as the leaf weight after floating leaves in water for 8 h and blotting with tissue paper plant water use efficiency pwue was determined as 4 pwue mg ml 1 total biomass production total amount of water applied proline is a stress responsive protein and usually measured as an index of stress by the plants the proline concentration was determined at flowering 55 das from the fully expanded upper most leaf samples as outlined by bates et al 1973 while the chlorophyll content was measured following witham et al 1986 for details see si single photon avalanche diodes spad values are often used as a measure of leaf chlorophyll content at 15 45 and 60 d after sowing spad values were recorded on the top most fully expanded leaves using a spad 502 chlorophyll fluorimeter spectrum technologies aurora usa 2 3 2 plant growth rate plant growth rates were determined after harvesting one plant from each pot at 30 45 and 60 d as suggested by radford 1967 while the leaf area index lai was measured using all the leaves collected from the plant harvested on 60 das li ccor 3100 c usa the lai was then converted to land area based on the area of the pot moreover the leaf area ratio lar and leaf weight ratio lwr were

mixing of soils next soil ph and electric conductivity ec were determined 1 5 w v using a ph ec meter while available p was determined with a colorimetric method bray and kurtz 1945 total soil n was determined by a modified wet oxidation method parkinson and allen 1975 an amount of 4 g air dried soil was weighed into digestion flask where 20 ml of 30 h2o2 and concentrated h2so4 was added the flask was then digested at 360 c for 2 hr after digestion the solution was distillated with excess naoh and liberated nh3 was trapped into 0 5 m h2so4 the amount of nh3 was then determined using titration of the excess 0 5 m h2so4 then the amount of n was calculated from the acid consumption by nh3 soil was additionally extracted with 1 m ammonium acetate and analysed for k concentration

1984 while the 15n signature can provide some insights about biological nitrogen fixation to assess indices of cumulative plant water stress and biological nitrogen fixation aboveground biomass samples were ground next 13c and 15n were determined on an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo fisher scientific bremen germany 2 4 statistical analysis a two way anova was performed to test for main and interactive effects of biochar application 0 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 and drought 80 60 and 40 fc on plant and soil parameters using jmp pro 11 sas usa repeated measured anova is usually used for analysing effect of treatments across different time of observations we performed repeated measures anova for plant height and spad value tukey s hsd α 5 was applied to separate the means 3 results 3 1 soil properties soil ec varied among biochar application and drought treatment p 0 01 while soil ph did not vary for either of the treatments the largest ec was recorded in the pots receiving the highest amount of biochar 100 t ha 1 under the highest drought stress causing a significant biochar drought interactive effect table 2 soil total n was similar in all pots however across all other treatments available soil p was higher in the control treatment but reduced with increased level of biochar application p 0 01 while drought stress increased available p p 0 01 the pots without biochar and the highest moisture regime lowest drought stress had the highest available soil p causing a significant biochar drought interactive effect biochar application increased soil available k while effects of all other treatments were not significant 3 2 crop growth and biomass production biochar application significantly increased plant height while the drought treatment significantly reduced it compared to the control treatment repeated measures anova p 0 01 the interactive effect of the biochar and drought treatment was not significant the biochar treatment did not affect plant height at harvest while the drought treatment significantly reduced it table 3 however the interactive effect of the biochar and drought treatment on the plant height was not significant on the other hand the relative growth rate increased with biochar application but was not affected by the drought treatment additionally the lar and lwr were not affected by the biochar and drought treatments at the end of the experiment averaged across all drought treatment root and aboveground biomass production were significantly higher with biochar application than in the control treatment fig 1 the interactive effect of biochar and drought treatment was not significant for both root and aboveground biomass dry weight when root and aboveground biomass were combined the total biomass production doubled with the largest biochar application rate compared to the control while the highest drought stress 40 fc reduced it by 40 p 0 05 however the interactive effect was not significant 3 3 plant water use efficiency biochar application and drought treatment did not affect the rwc water retention and uptake capacity in leaves table s1 however biochar application increased plant wue compared to the control treatment with the largest effect at the highest biochar application rate 100 t ha 1 while it was lower in the drought treatments than in the control treatment fig 2 the δ13c of the aboveground biomass a measure of plant water status was significantly less negative for the drought treatment where less depleted δ13c values indicate higher drought stress on the other hand the biochar application had no effect on δ13c fig 3 the proline concentration a measure of stress induced protein synthesis increased with biochar application fig 4 while the drought treatment did not affect proline concentration the proline concentration was positively correlated with biomass production r2 0 28 p 0 01 while the δ13c was negatively associated with total biomass production r2 0 15 p 0 02 fig 6 the chlorophyll content in leaves did not vary significantly among biochar and drought treatments fig s2 3 4 aboveground biomass δ15n atmospheric n fixation and assimilation depletes the 15n signature in plants and therefore the 15n signature in aboveground biomass provides some insights into biological n fixation averaged across the drought treatment the δ15n signature increased with biochar application p 0 01 while the drought treatment did not affect the 15n signature in the aboveground biomass however the δ 15n signature in the plants grown under 80 fc was lower than in plants grown under deficit moisture condition 60 and 40 fc with biochar application rates up to 25 t ha 1 this pattern was reversed at higher application rates causing a significant biochar drought interaction p 0 02 fig 5 the δ15n in the aboveground biomass was positively correlated with total biomass production r2 0 11 p 0 05 fig 6 compared to the control no biochar the n concentration in the aboveground biomass almost doubled in the largest biochar application rate while the drought treatment increased it from 1 19 to 1 66 fig s3 there was also a positive correlation between aboveground biomass n concentration and biomass production r2 0 11 p 0 05 fig 6 however the interactive effect was not significant similarly the spad value increased with increased biochar application rate fig s1 3 5 yield and yield contributing parameters biochar application did not affect yield and yield contributing parameters table 4 across biochar treatments drought treatment reduced the number of pods number of seeds per pod and thus seed yield compared to the control 80 fc the seed yield was reduced by 37 and 56 in pots with 60 and 40 fc across the biochar treatment 4 discussion biochar application has shown to affect plant performance under drought conditions paneque et al 2016 romdhane et al 2019 in our experiment we observed a significant increase in crop growth rate and biomass production in comparison to the control treatment the biomass production was doubled when biochar was applied at 100 t ha 1 table 3 fig 1 however this increase in biomass production did not translate to a greater seed yield table 4 an increase in biomass production has been presented in previous studies paneque et al 2016 romdhane et al 2019 although non significant and negative results have also been reported haider et al 2015 romdhane et al 2019 for instance gavili et al 2019 reported an increase in soybean biomass production and seed yield with increasing biochar application rate up to 15 t ha 1 but at higher biochar application rates 25 t ha 1 the response is often negative gavili et al 2019 li and shangguan 2018 poormansour and razzaghi 2018 ramlow et al 2019 these results suggest that biochar application rates need to be considered for getting a desired response sandhu and kumar 2017 biochar application has shown to improve available soil water and plant water uptake aller et al 2017 atkinson 2018 baronti et al 2014 bohara et al 2019 haider et al 2015 while neutral and negative effects have also been reported herath et al 2013 moragues saitua et al 2017 ramlow et al 2019 in our case biochar amendment increased plant wue suggesting that biochar application can produce more biomass with less water however we did not observe a significant increase in plant water acquisition since biochar application did not affect rwc water retention and uptake capacity in leaves we also measured the aboveground biomass δ13c signature which provides a cumulative measure of plant water stress and co2 exchange between leaves and the atmosphere during the growing period in contrast to our expectation the aboveground δ13c signature was similar for all biochar application rates inferring that biochar application might not reduce overall plant water stress the potential mechanisms through which biochar might enhance plant water uptake is by increasing soil water retention either through storing water in biochar pores or by improving soil structure verheijen et al 2010 possibly water held in biochar pores 10 nm is not available for plants since the water potential in these pores tends to be much higher than in the soil pores while part of the biochar pores might not be well connected cha et al 2016 although it was not measured in this study biochar can also change soil aggregation ouyang et al 2013 shaheen and bukhari 2018 and thus an improvement in plant available water by this process may not have occurred in our short term pot study additionally plants may have been exposed to increased water stress by a biochar associated increase in salt and low molecular weight organic compound concentrations in the soil abel et al 2013 tanure et al 2019 this was supported by the significantly higher soil ec in soils with biochar application table 2 while leaf proline concentration a stress induced protein was also higher in pots with biochar application fig 4 moreover the chemical interactions between biochar and soil water including polar bonding could have impeded water uptake aller et al 2017 mia et al 2018 2017a 2017b the cec of the added biochar was 35 4 cmolc kg 1 biochar which may have formed polar bonding with the functional groups at the surfaces of biochar our results suggest that freshly prepared biochar at low temperature might not be effective in improving plant available water when applied to a clay soil biochar can enhance biomass production by improving nutrient supply atkinson 2018 oram et al 2014 in our experiment biochar application increased plant n concentration while a positive correlation was observed between aboveground biomass n concentration and total biomass production fig 6 and fig s3 suggesting that biochar application improved n acquisition although it is not clear how biochar improved n supply we believe that biochar application could have increased biological n fixation mia et al 2014 rondon et al 2007 given that the δ15n signature in the aboveground biomass was significantly lower in pots with biochar application fig 5 it is also possible that intrinsic nutrient supplied with biochar specifically k could have improved plant biomass production faloye et al 2019 mia et al 2014 rondon et al 2007 tanure et al 2019 van zwieten et al 2015 since our biochar carried a large amount of k 1400 mg kg biochar 1 that increased soil available k tables 1 and 2 additionally a biochar induced increase in k supply could have improved drought tolerance in soybean plants since k nutrition has shown to increase osmotic potential in leaves tanure et al 2019 zahoor et al 2017 therefore it is likely that an increase in nutritional supply associated with biochar application could have resulted in enhanced biomass production however this enhanced performance may be short lived since most of intrinsic nutrients will exhaust with time similar to the previous reports bohara et al 2019 farooq et al 2009 tanure et al 2019 we observed a significant reduction in biomass production by half with drought stress i e in the 40 fc treatment moreover we also observed a less depleted δ13c signature under drought stress indicating that plants may have suffered from water shortage under lower water supply 5 conclusions previous studies have claimed that biochar amendment can improve plant performance under stress conditions including drought in our study biochar amendment enhanced crop growth and biomass production compared to the control treatment the biomass production was doubled when biochar was applied at 100 t ha 1 this increased biomass production was manifested without a change in plant water use since our instantaneous and cumulative plant water uptake indicators such as rwc and δ13c signature in the aboveground biomass did not change with biochar application instead the increment in biomass production might have occurred due to improved nutritional conditions specifically n from biological fixation and k from biochar s ash however the initial nutritional benefit may disappear in subsequent seasons altogether our results suggest that biochar application may increase biomass production in a clay rich soil under drought conditions through enhancing nutrient acquisition but without changing the plant water uptake declaration of competing interest the

mixing of soils next soil ph and electric conductivity ec were determined 1 5 w v using a ph ec meter while available p was determined with a colorimetric method bray and kurtz 1945 total soil n was determined by a modified wet oxidation method parkinson and allen 1975 an amount of 4 g air dried soil was weighed into digestion flask where 20 ml of 30 h2o2 and concentrated h2so4 was added the flask was then digested at 360 c for 2 hr after digestion the solution was distillated with excess naoh and liberated nh3 was trapped into 0 5 m h2so4 the amount of nh3 was then determined using titration of the excess 0 5 m h2so4 then the amount of n was calculated from the acid consumption by nh3 soil was additionally extracted with 1 m ammonium acetate and analysed for k concentration

samples were ground next 13c and 15n were determined on an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo fisher scientific bremen germany 2 4 statistical analysis a two way anova was performed to test for main and interactive effects of biochar application 0 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 and drought 80 60 and 40 fc on plant and soil parameters using jmp pro 11 sas usa repeated measured anova is usually used for analysing effect of treatments across different time of observations we performed repeated measures anova for plant height and spad value tukey s hsd α 5 was applied to separate the means 3 results 3 1 soil properties soil ec varied among biochar application and drought treatment p 0 01 while soil ph did not vary for either of the treatments the largest ec was recorded in the pots receiving the highest amount of biochar 100 t ha 1 under the highest drought stress causing a significant biochar drought interactive effect table 2 soil total n was similar in all pots however across all other treatments available soil p was higher in the control treatment but reduced with increased level of biochar application p 0 01 while drought stress increased available p p 0 01 the pots without biochar and the highest moisture regime lowest drought stress had the highest available soil p causing a significant biochar drought interactive effect biochar application increased soil available k while effects of all other treatments were not significant 3 2 crop growth and biomass production biochar application significantly increased plant height while the drought treatment significantly reduced it compared to the control treatment repeated measures anova p 0 01 the interactive effect of the biochar and drought treatment was not significant the biochar treatment did not affect plant height at harvest while the drought treatment significantly reduced it table 3 however the interactive effect of the biochar and drought treatment on the plant height was not significant on the other hand the relative growth rate increased with biochar application but was not affected by the drought treatment additionally the lar and lwr were not affected by the biochar and drought treatments at the end of the experiment averaged across all drought treatment root and aboveground biomass production were significantly higher with biochar application than in the control treatment fig 1 the interactive effect of biochar and drought treatment was not significant for both root and aboveground biomass dry weight when root and aboveground biomass were combined the total biomass production doubled with the largest biochar application rate compared to the control while the highest drought stress 40 fc reduced it by 40 p 0 05 however the interactive effect was not significant 3 3 plant water use efficiency biochar application and drought treatment did not affect the rwc water retention and uptake capacity in leaves table s1 however biochar application increased plant wue compared to the control treatment with the largest effect at the highest biochar application rate 100 t ha 1 while it was lower in the drought treatments than in the control treatment fig 2 the δ13c of the aboveground biomass a measure of plant water status was significantly less negative for the drought treatment where less depleted δ13c values indicate higher drought stress on the other hand the biochar application had no effect on δ13c fig 3 the proline concentration a measure of stress induced protein synthesis increased with biochar application fig 4 while the drought treatment did not affect proline concentration the proline concentration was positively correlated with biomass production r2 0 28 p 0 01 while the δ13c was negatively associated with total biomass production r2 0 15 p 0 02 fig 6 the chlorophyll content in leaves did not vary significantly among biochar and drought treatments fig s2 3 4 aboveground biomass δ15n atmospheric n fixation and assimilation depletes the 15n signature in plants and therefore the 15n signature in aboveground biomass provides some insights into biological n fixation averaged across the drought treatment the δ15n signature increased with biochar application p 0 01 while the drought treatment did not affect the 15n signature in the aboveground biomass however the δ 15n signature in the plants grown under 80 fc was lower than in plants grown under deficit moisture condition 60 and 40 fc with biochar application rates up to 25 t ha 1 this pattern was reversed at higher application rates causing a significant biochar drought interaction p 0 02 fig 5 the δ15n in the aboveground biomass was positively correlated with total biomass production r2 0 11 p 0 05 fig 6 compared to the control no biochar the n concentration in the aboveground biomass almost doubled in the largest biochar application rate while the drought treatment increased it from 1 19 to 1 66 fig s3 there was also a positive correlation between aboveground biomass n concentration and biomass production r2 0 11 p 0 05 fig 6 however the interactive effect was not significant similarly the spad value increased with increased biochar application rate fig s1 3 5 yield and yield contributing parameters biochar application did not affect yield and yield contributing parameters table 4 across biochar treatments drought treatment reduced the number of pods number of seeds per pod and thus seed yield compared to the control 80 fc the seed yield was reduced by 37 and 56 in pots with 60 and 40 fc across the biochar treatment 4 discussion biochar application has shown to affect plant performance under drought conditions paneque et al 2016 romdhane et al 2019 in our experiment we observed a significant increase in crop growth rate and biomass production in comparison to the control treatment the biomass production was doubled when biochar was applied at 100 t ha 1 table 3 fig 1 however this increase in biomass production did not translate to a greater seed yield table 4 an increase in biomass production has been presented in previous studies paneque et al 2016 romdhane et al 2019 although non significant and negative results have also been reported haider et al 2015 romdhane et al 2019 for instance gavili et al 2019 reported an increase in soybean biomass production and seed yield with increasing biochar application rate up to 15 t ha 1 but at higher biochar application rates 25 t ha 1 the response is often negative gavili et al 2019 li and shangguan 2018 poormansour and razzaghi 2018 ramlow et al 2019 these results suggest that biochar application rates need to be considered for getting a desired response sandhu and kumar 2017 biochar application has shown to improve available soil water and plant water uptake aller et al 2017 atkinson 2018 baronti et al 2014 bohara et al 2019 haider et al 2015 while neutral and negative effects have also been reported herath et al 2013 moragues saitua et al 2017 ramlow et al 2019 in our case biochar amendment increased plant wue suggesting that biochar application can produce more biomass with less water however we did not observe a significant increase in plant water acquisition since biochar application did not affect rwc water retention and uptake capacity in leaves we also measured the aboveground biomass δ13c signature which provides a cumulative measure of plant water stress and co2 exchange between leaves and the atmosphere during the growing period in contrast to our expectation the aboveground δ13c signature was similar for all biochar application rates inferring that biochar application might not reduce overall plant water stress the potential mechanisms through which biochar might enhance plant water uptake is by increasing soil water retention either through storing water in biochar pores or by improving soil structure verheijen et al 2010 possibly water held in biochar pores 10 nm is not available for plants since the water potential in these pores tends to be much higher than in the soil pores while part of the biochar pores might not be well connected cha et al 2016 although it was not measured in this study biochar can also change soil aggregation ouyang et al 2013 shaheen and bukhari 2018 and thus an improvement in plant available water by this process may not have occurred in our short term pot study additionally plants may have been exposed to increased water stress by a biochar associated increase in salt and low molecular weight organic compound concentrations in the soil abel et al 2013 tanure et al 2019 this was supported by the significantly higher soil ec in soils with biochar application table 2 while leaf proline concentration a stress induced protein was also higher in pots with biochar application fig 4 moreover the chemical interactions between biochar and soil water including polar bonding could have impeded water uptake aller et al 2017 mia et al 2018 2017a 2017b the cec of the added biochar was 35 4 cmolc kg 1 biochar which may have formed polar bonding with the functional groups at the surfaces of biochar our results suggest that freshly prepared biochar at low temperature might not be effective in improving plant available water when applied to a clay soil biochar can enhance biomass production by improving nutrient supply atkinson 2018 oram et al 2014 in our experiment biochar application increased plant n concentration while a positive correlation was observed between aboveground biomass n concentration and total biomass production fig 6 and fig s3 suggesting that biochar application improved n acquisition although it is not clear how biochar improved n supply we believe that biochar application could have increased biological n fixation mia et al 2014 rondon et al 2007 given that the δ15n signature in the aboveground biomass was significantly lower in pots with biochar application fig 5 it is also possible that intrinsic nutrient supplied with biochar specifically k could have improved plant biomass production faloye et al 2019 mia et al 2014 rondon et al 2007 tanure et al 2019 van zwieten et al 2015 since our biochar carried a large amount of k 1400 mg kg biochar 1 that increased soil available k tables 1 and 2 additionally a biochar induced increase in k supply could have improved drought tolerance in soybean plants since k nutrition has shown to increase osmotic potential in leaves tanure et al 2019 zahoor et al 2017 therefore it is likely that an increase in nutritional supply associated with biochar application could have resulted in enhanced biomass production however this enhanced performance may be short lived since most of intrinsic nutrients will exhaust with time similar to the previous reports bohara et al 2019 farooq et al 2009 tanure et al 2019 we observed a significant reduction in biomass production by half with drought stress i e in the 40 fc treatment moreover we also observed a less depleted δ13c signature under drought stress indicating that plants may have suffered from water shortage under lower water supply 5 conclusions previous studies have claimed that biochar amendment can improve plant performance under stress conditions including drought in our study biochar amendment enhanced crop growth and biomass production compared to the control treatment the biomass production was doubled when biochar was applied at 100 t ha 1 this increased biomass production was manifested without a change in plant water use since our instantaneous and cumulative plant water uptake indicators such as rwc and δ13c signature in the aboveground biomass did not change with biochar application instead the increment in biomass production might have occurred due to improved nutritional conditions specifically n from biological fixation and k from biochar s ash however the initial nutritional benefit may disappear in subsequent seasons altogether our results suggest that biochar application may increase biomass production in a clay rich soil under drought conditions through enhancing nutrient acquisition but without changing the plant water uptake declaration of competing interest the

10054,due to existing problems related to drip irrigation under the conditions of mulching and the vigorous promotion of soil covered drip irrigation without film drip irrigation experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 in order to explore the mechanism of water conservation three different irrigation treatments were adopted in this study high middle and low irrigation quotas in addition two different experiment areas were selected taking mulching as an example zone i film covered area and zone ⅱ bare soil area for comparison the division of zone with soil covered drip irrigation without film was the same as that with the mulching film the two zones were designed to analyze soil evaporation regularity based on a calibrated simdualkc model under the conditions of both mulched drip irrigation and soil covered drip irrigation without film respectively the results showed that the simdualkc model could potentially be applied to simulate the soil water content and evaporation rates with a higher accuracy the soil evaporation in high water treatment was 13 higher than that in medium water treatment and that in low water treatment was 5 lower than that in medium water treatment under the soil covered drip irrigation without film conditions the evaporation rates were only 0 67 mm and 36 18 mm in the zone i and zone ii areas under mulched drip irrigation conditions respectively the water conservation had mainly occurred in the mulched area zone i where mulched drip irrigation methods were utilized and the evaporation was much less than that of the areas where soil covered drip irrigation without film methods were implemented the results obtained in this study may provide a theoretical basis for future maize production under the conditions of both mulched drip irrigation and soil covered drip irrigation without film processes keywords evaporation maize drip irrigation under mulch soil covered drip irrigation without film film covered areas bare soil areas simdualkc model 1 introduction the west liaohe plain is located in northeastern china s maize belt this maize belt together with the american maize belt and the ukrainian maize belt of the same latitude are globally known as the three golden maize belts of the world it is also an important commodity grain base in china referred to as the inner mongolia granary the west liaohe plain is located in the middle of tongliao city and has the characteristics of a mid temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate at the present time the west liaohe river basin has been cut off and the groundwater over exploitation conditions have become serious leading to sharp drops of groundwater levels and the occurrences of large depression funnel areas therefore the establishment of methods to lower the utilization rates of water resources in order to achieve the sustainable development of agriculture in this area has become a key focus as advanced irrigation technology drip irrigation methods stand out among all the types of irrigation technologies since only the soil in the crop root areas are moistened drip irrigation procedures do not produce surface runoff or deep leakage effects and have low evaporation loss rates li et al 2006 with the implementations of water saving and grain increasing actions in inner mongolia drip irrigation technology has been widely applied in the tongliao area jia et al 2018 the water saving effects of drip irrigation under mulching conditions have been significant wang et al 2016 the previous research results have shown that when compared with drip irrigation without mulch the water use efficiency of the drip irrigation with mulch had increased by approximately 18 qi et al 2019 however the use of mulching film in large quantities is known to have a low recovery rate resulting in the white pollution of the soil wang et al 2017 in addition agricultural film residues tend to reduce water infiltration rates wang et al 2014 affect crop root development and reduce the crop yields ma et al 2008 li et al 2015 at the same time the use of mulching film also increases the costs of planting and affects the sustainable development of agricultural processes in 2015 the ministry of agriculture listed agricultural film residue pesticides and chemical fertilizers as the main non point source pollution problems for the future in recent years soil covered drip irrigation without film has been tested however since the actual mechanism of soil evaporation remains unclear it is necessary to further examine the law of soil evaporation at the present time there are many methods utilized for the determination of evapotranspiration it has been found that each of the aforementioned methods have corresponding application conditions and limitations liu and peng 2009 wang and pei 2001 kang 1985 the evapotranspiration et process is composed of the soil evaporation e and the crop transpiration t it has been found that quantitative analyses of the evaporation rates between crops and crop transpiration can effectively reveal the evaporation mechanisms of drip irrigated maize large lysimeters vorticity correlation technologies micro lysimeters and stem flow gauges have the ability to monitor daily evapotranspiration and evaporation rates between crops liu et al 1998 wang et al 2007 zhao et al 2018 calculated that the e et during grape growth periods ranged between 52 and 59 using vorticity correlation technology micro lysimeters and stem flow gauges it was found that the soil evaporation under the drip irrigation with mulching accounted for approximately 13 5 of the evapotranspiration in addition the soil evaporation under the drip irrigation without mulching accounted for approximately 23 4 of the evapotranspiration zhang et al 2018 due to the high costs of large lysimeters their promotion and applications have been limited micro lysimeters are required to weigh and measure every day the operations are complex and there are many factors which could potentially affect the accuracy of the results liu et al 2018 also there are known to be energy balance unclosed phenomena in vorticity correlation technology ntshidi et al 2020 the previous research results have shown that the measurements of evapotranspiration of vorticity correlation methods are low which affects the overall measurement accuracy alfieri et al 2012 during the process of measuring the stem flow gauges will damage the crops to a certain extent and the gauges cannot be used when the plants are small in recent years a large number of researchers have used simdualkc model to study evaporation and transpiration and high simulation accuracy rates have been achieved in the fao 56 allen et al 1998 the k c is divided into a basic crop coefficient k cb and a soil evaporation coefficient k e using a dual crop coefficient method the transpiration is characterized by k cb et 0 and the evaporation is characterized by k e et 0 therefore the two parts can be effectively distinguished ricardo et al 2012 yan et al 2018 in recent years researchers in the field have widely used simdualkc model to examine the evapotranspiration of different crops in various regions the simdualkc model calibrated and verified by zhang et al 2013 has shown good applicability in winter wheat and maize rotations in the north china plain shi et al 2015 used simdualkc model in northwestern china and estimated that the soil evaporation of greenhouse tomatoes under mulching conditions accounted for 5 4 5 9 of the total evapotranspiration previous studies carried out simulation research on the soil evaporation of maize under pipe irrigation and drip irrigation respectively using simdualkc model and achieved high simulation accuracy zhao et al 2012 yan et al 2017 li et al 2018 conducted a simulation study of the soil evaporation of maize under the conditions of drip irrigation during the growth period in tongliao inner mongolia the results revealed that the mulching film had reduced the soil evaporation particularly during the early growth periods after drip irrigation without mulching is performed the wetted areas are smaller which makes the change trend of evaporation different from that of traditional border irrigation as a result drip irrigation under mulching conditions make the change trend of soil evaporation more complicated due to the mulching effects in fao 56 the ratio of bare soil to wet soil f ew is given the evaporation of the drip irrigation had mainly occurred on the wetted surfaces of the soil without crop coverage the f ew was determined by the sections without crop coverage 1 f c and the wetted soil sections after irrigation f w at the present time the majority of research studies regarding drip irrigation evaporation have focused on the evaporation of the entire experimental treatment during the growth period however few in depth and detailed research studies have been made regarding the evaporation of different areas undergoing drip irrigation treatments particularly those areas covered with film and bare soil under film drip irrigation conditions therefore in the present study based on the measured data between crops of section two years combined with a simdualkc model compare the soil evaporation between different regions of drip irrigation under mulched and drip irrigation without mulch to explore the applicability of the model and the mechanism of water saving in drip irrigation processes for maize crops provide theoretical guidance for the future implementations of both drip irrigation measures with mulch and soil covered drip irrigation without film in the tongliao area of inner mongolia 2 material and methods 2 1 overview of the study area this study s field experiments were carried out between 2017 and 2018 at the horqin left wing middle banner comprehensive experimental station in tongliao city which is located at eastern longitude 123 32 northern latitude of 44 32 and 178 m above sea level located in the eastern end of tongliao city the study area has the climate characteristics of a temperate continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons it is characterized with rapid warming trends in the spring including blowing sand conditions and synchronous hot rainy climate conditions during the summer months featuring concentrated rainfall events the average wind speed is 3 9 m s and the average rainfall is in the range of 150 250 mm the soil type in the study areas is mainly loam the physical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 during the period ranging from 2017 to 2018 the study area was planted april 30th and harvested september 25th a planting method of wide and narrow row spacing was adopted the crops were arranged in two rows with a spacing of 85 cm between the wide rows a spacing of 35 cm between the narrow rows and row spacing of 25 cm the middle sections of the narrow rows were paved with a drip irrigation tape with a spacing of 30 cm between the drip heads the experiment was conducted under two conditions with covering film and soil covered without covering film the covering film was applied in a narrow row with a width of 70 cm and a thickness of 0 08 mm there was no mulching treatment applied for shallow burying rows the drip irrigation tape was shallowly buried 1 2 cm in order to prevent the effects of gale weather conditions impacting the drip irrigation tape in addition although no mulching material was laid all of the other layout methods were the same as that of the mulching drip irrigation process fig 2 the area of each plot of maize measured 4 8 m 60 m with three replicates the experiment was divided into three irrigation levels of high medium and low water which were expressed by wh wm and wl respectively there was a total of six treatments the upper and lower bounds of irrigation were the percentages of soil moisture content in the field water holding capacity and the setting of the medium water level was based on the available literature shi 2006 the high water and low water treatments were 5 and 5 of the upper and lower bounds of the medium water level the upper and lower bounds of the water irrigation in each treatment are shown in table 2 according to root depths the planned wetting layer was set as 20 cm for the planting emergence 40 cm for the emergence jointing and 70 cm for jointing maturity table 3 shows the irrigation amounts of different treatments during the growth period the maize varieties used in the tests were nonghua 106 and the fertilization levels were the same as that of the local farmers the basic fertilizer was applied with n 72 kg ha p2o5 105 kg ha and k2o 60 kg ha which was applied when the seedings had first developed using integrated agricultural machinery then 168 kg ha of urea was applied before jointing tasseling and grouting which was first dissolved in water in a integrated fertilizer tank and then applied with water drop device the agricultural machinery and agronomic supporting measures diseases insect pests and weeds were all managed in the field according to the implementation modes of the local farmers 2 2 observational content and methods 2 2 1 meteorological conditions the data regarding the wind speed atmospheric pressure relative humidity rainfall air temperature solar radiation and so on were automatically collected for every 60 min using a small meteorological station hobou30 made in the united states 2 2 2 evaporation between crops the automatic soil evaporation collection instrument beijing shiyutong technology co ltd was set for the medium water treatments for the mulching and soil covered drip irrigation without film the drip treatments for the mulching irrigation were set outside the mulch and the mulch edges were tangential to the outer edge of the evaporator the buried position of the soil covered drip irrigation without film treatment evaporator was the same as that of the drip irrigation treatment under mulch conditions the equipment fig 1 consisted of the following four parts a solar power supply device weighing component soil column and a protective barrel around the soil column the height was 25 cm and the diameter measured 20 cm the data collection interval was set as one hour also self made micro evaporators were arranged near the automatic soil evaporators and three groups of repeats were arranged for the purpose of checking the data of the automatic soil evaporators various related literature long et al 2010 gao et al 2010 gao and wang 2011 were compared in order to select the appropriate material as well as the diameters and lengths of the micro lysimeters then in accordance with the comparison and selection of the relative reference results combined with the goal of practical operability pvc tubes were used as the inner and outer barrels in this study the lengths of the tubes were 10 cm with outer cylinder s diameter measuring 16 cm and inner cylinder s diameter measuring 14 cm the bottom was sealed with 500 mesh which allowed for good permeability in order to prevent soil leakage an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 1 g was used for weighing at 17 00 h each day in order to ensure that the soil moisture content was consistent with that of the field the soil was changed once every 5 7 days following rainfall and irrigation 2 2 3 soil water content a tdr system trime t3 iph was used for the moisture content monitoring process and a drying method was used for the verifications in addition three groups of repeats were set up with one test completed prior to sowing one test after harvesting and one test every 7 days from the beginning of the sowing period then following rainfall and before and after irrigation additional measurements were made one layer was considered to be 20 cm and five layers were measured to a measurement depth of 1 m 3 introduction of study method simdualkc model is dual crop coefficient models based on the principle of water balance the model has the ability to effectively distinguish crop transpiration t k cb et 0 from inter plant evaporation e k e et 0 using a dual crop coefficient method allen et al 2005 in addition they can effectively calculate crop evapotranspiration moriasi et al 2007 the model includes soil data modules meteorological data modules crop data modules irrigation data modules and film coverage data modules which can accurately simulate crop transpiration and evaporation between crops under both film drip irrigation and shallow burying drip irrigation processes 1 et a k s k cb k e et 0 where et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 k cb is the basal crop coefficient k e is the soil evaporation coefficient k s is the water stress reduction coefficient and et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 since soil evaporation mainly occurs in the wetted section of soil surfaces the soil evaporation under the plant canopy is assumed to be contained in the k cb et 0 and the soil evaporation is referred to as k e et 0 the evaporation rates are known to be largest when the soil is wet however the energy obtained from the soil surface evaporation tends to limit the crop coefficient k cb k e k c max when the surfaces of the soil are dry the soil evaporation will be directly proportional to the residual water content of the soil as follows 2 ke min kr kc max kcb few kc max where k e represents the soil evaporation coefficient k cb indicates the coefficient of basic crops k c max is the maximum value of k c after rainfall or irrigation k r denotes the evaporation reduction coefficient which is dimensionless and dependent on the accumulated depth of the surface soil evaporation or water consumption and f ew represents the ratio of bare soil to wet soil which is the percentage of the largest soil evaporation surface allen et al 1998 in this study the

number of crop rows per plastic sheet spacing between rows spacing between holes along a row and hole diameter in the process of model application values for k cb ini k cb mid and k cb end were selected k cb mid and k cb end were adjusted according to local climatic conditions and planting density and determine daily soil evaporation according to k e value of model output in order to precision and intensive study of evaporation the drip irrigation under mulch treatment was divided into two areas zone i and zone ii the vertical drip irrigation tape was partitioned in the direction shown in fig 2 the zone with mulching film was zone i and the zone without mulching film was zone ii shown in fig 2a for comparison the zone with soil covered drip irrigation without covering film was the same as that with the mulching film the width of zone i was consistent with that of drip irrigation under the film which was dm the width of zone ii was dw dm shown in fig 2b the evaporation area coefficient c was introduced according to the above different zones et in each zone was the product of model output result and coefficient c and et a was the evapotranspiration output of the model 3

discussion 4 1 calibration and verification of the model parameters the parameters of the simdualkc model were calibrated in this study using the measured soil water content data from 2017 the calibrated soil parameters included the evaporation layer depth z e total evaporated water tew and easily evaporated water rew the crop parameters included the crop coefficient k cb and soil water consumption ratio p the initial value adopted was the recommended value of fao 56 then following parameter adjustments the calibrations ended when the simulated value of the moisture content was closest to the measured value the final calibration values of the soil parameters were z e 0 15 m tew 30 mm and rew 10 mm the final calibration results of the crop parameters during each stage are shown in table 3 which were consistent with the calibration results presented by li et al 2018 then the 2018 data were used to verify the applicability of the model in the study area the simulation values of the evaporation between crops were compared with the measured values fig 4 and 5 detail the comparison results of the simulations and actual measurements of the soil water content the goodness of fit test index proposed by previous researches were used to test the model s simulation effects including the determination the coefficient r 2 popova and pereira 2011 regression

comparison of the parameters between the measured soil moisture content and the simulated soil moisture content are shown in table 5 the fitting degree between the simulated soil moisture content and the measured soil moisture content was found to be relatively high in 2018 the regression coefficients of the soil covered drip irrigation without film and drip irrigation under mulch were 0 97 and 1 05 respectively and the determination coefficients were 0 93 and 0 98 respectively also the root mean square errors and consistency indexes were 0 01 and 0 97 and the simulation efficiency rates were 0 88 and 0 86 respectively for the two types of irrigation processes in conclusion the results indicated that the model was suitable for the tongliao area and had displayed good applicability 4 2 comparison of soil evaporation it was found in this study that the model had accurately simulated the soil water content the simdualkc model displayed the ability to effectively distinguish the crop transpiration from the soil evaporation through the basic crop coefficient k cb and the soil evaporation coefficient k e it was observed that for the drip irrigation under mulch layers due to the film mulching of the narrow row the daily water had gathered in the film in the form of water vapor then during the night when the temperatures were low the water vapor had liquefied into water droplets and returned to the soil surface therefore the evaporation of narrow row was ignored and the actual measured soil evaporation of the narrow row was compared with the model s simulated evaporation the area weighted averages of the wide and narrow rows of the soil covered drip irrigation without film system were compared with the soil evaporation simulated by the model the test results of the model simulations are detailed in fig 6 and 7 as can be seen from the above figures the simulated values of the soil evaporation were basically consistent with the actual measured values the planting emergency period refers to a local spring period when there was more wind and less rain less irrigation lower soil surface water content and lower soil evaporation which accounted for 6 19 of the total soil evaporation it was observed that with the development of the growth stages the temperatures had gradually begun to rise therefore in order to meet the water demands of the crops the irrigation processes were increased at the same time the soil evaporation increased the seedling jointing stage accounted for between 48 and 57 of the total soil evaporation in addition during the tasseling period it was found that the plant heights and leaf areas of the crops had reached the maximum the root systems of shallow soil had absorbed more water during that period as a result the soil evaporation decreased accounting for only 8 12 of the total soil evaporation during the mature stage the plant leaves had gradually withered and the evaporation levels had slightly increased finally prior to the harvesting stage the surfaces of the soil tended to be dry with decreased soil evaporation observed it was found in this study that during the growth period of the soil covered drip irrigation without film the average soil evaporation was 141 38 mm however drip irrigation under film the average soil evaporation was determined to be 58 10 mm the soil evaporation of drip irrigation under mulch was found to be 60 lower than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film furthermore the crop transpiration was 21 higher than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film and its evapotranspiration was 11 lower than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film the measured values were found to be slightly higher than the simulated values during the early stages of growth this was determined to be due to the fact that the internal soil temperatures of the evaporators were higher than the external temperatures due to the influences of the external walls since the internal root systems of the evaporators were broken there was no root water absorption and the soil moisture content remained high therefore the evaporation rates were also relatively large particularly in may when the effects of wind and sand were the most obvious it was also observed that during the middle and later stages of growth the evaporation rates were low due to crop coverage and the measured values were found to be in good agreement with the simulated values as shown in table 6 the regression coefficient of the simulated values and the measured values of evaporation between crops from 2017 2018 ranged between 0 83 and 0 90 under the soil covered drip irrigation without film and drip irrigation under mulch respectively the determination coefficient ranged between 0 89 and 0 95 the root mean square error was 0 15 0 35 in addition the consistency index was determined to be between 0 96 and 0 98 and the simulation efficiency was 0 85 0 93 therefore it was confirmed that simdualkc model was able to effectively simulate the evaporation between the maize crops in the tongliao area and the simulation accuracy was high 4 3 examination of the model simulations of the evaporation under the different irrigation treatments as shown in fig 8 the evaporation trends between crops under the different irrigation treatments were the same for example during the early stages the soil evaporation was larger accounting for 64 75 of the total evaporation between crops during the middle stages the soil evaporation tended to be low accounting for between 16 and 23 of the total evaporation however during the later stages due to the dropping of the crop leaves the irrigation was ceased and the surface soil had become gradually dried during that period the evaporation first increased and then decreased the evaporation of the soil covered drip irrigation without film with high water content was 13 higher than that with middle water content and the evaporation of the soil covered drip irrigation without film with low water content was determined to be 5 lower than that with middle water content it was observed that following irrigation and rainfall the soil evaporation rate was high the different irrigation treatments were controlled by the lower boundaries in this study and the irrigation quotas were the same however the irrigation times had varied during the early stages the high water content was only 3 higher than the middle water content and the low water content was only 2 lower than the middle water however following the jointing stage the differences in the two treatments were more obvious with the increases in irrigation particularly during the days of high evaporation after rainfall and irrigation during those periods the high water treatments were 20 higher than that of middle water treatments and the low water treatments were 15 lower than that of middle water treatments when the water content of the soil surfaces had become dry and the daily evaporation intensity was low the evaporation displayed a trend of low water middle water high water which was due to the higher influence of crop coverage when the evaporation intensity was low for the drip irrigation under mulch the film had covered the soil moistening parts of the water irrigation blocks and the air flow from the soil surface to the upper part of the crop canopy had been restricted therefore the effects of the irrigation on the evaporation rates were not significant and evaporation between crops increased significantly after rainfall there were no significant differences observed in the evaporation rates between the different treatments for the drip irrigation under mulch this was mainly due to the fact that the areas covered with mulch could only evaporate from the film holes and the majority of the evaporation was intercepted by the film after irrigation in addition there were no significant differences observed in evaporation rates between the different treatments in the areas not covered with mulch following rainfall events 4 4 comparison of the soil evaporation in different areas of drip irrigation under mulch and soil covered drip irrigation without film the change trend of soil evaporation was the same under the different treatments and in the different regions there was no plant growth less irrigation dry surface soil and less evaporation observed during the planting emergence stage accounting for 5 15 of the soil evaporation in the growth stage the water requirements for plant growth increased during the emergence jointing stage since large amounts of water were available due to the irrigation processes and the soil evaporation with lower plant coverage had reached the maximum accounting for 45 68 of the soil evaporation during the growth stage in addition since the crop coverage during the jointing tasseling stage had sharply increased and the soil evaporation had decreased 10 27 of the soil evaporation had occurred during the growth period the crop coverage reached the maximum during the tasseling grouting stage and the soil evaporation of each treatment was observed to reach the lowest point accounting for only 9 of the total evaporation during the growth period then since the plant growth had ceased during the grouting maturity stage with the plants leaves turning yellow and falling off and the soil evaporation had increased it was also found in this study that due to the different growth potentials of the crops along with the different soil moisture conditions the soil evaporation had varied in the different regions under the different treatments table 7 a small amount of evaporation was observed through the film holes and the broken parts of the film prior to the tasseling period this was attributed to the film coverage in zone i of the drip irrigation under the film the extremely low evaporation under the film approximately 0 had resulted from the plant stem diameters in the film holes reaching the maximum the soil evaporation in zone i of drip irrigation under the film was observed to be 0 67 mm accounting for only 2 of the total soil evaporation under the film in addition the evaporation in the zone ii of the drip irrigation under mulch was 36 18 mm which accounted for 98 of the total evaporation of the drip irrigation under mulch therefore the film mulching treatments had effectively reduced the soil evaporation in zone i with the soil evaporation in zone i found to be 98 lower than that in zone ii the soil evaporation in zone i of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was determined to be 84 59 mm accounting for 72 of the total soil evaporation in the soil covered drip irrigation without film the soil evaporation in zone ii of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was 32 50 mm accounting for 28 of the total soil evaporation in the soil covered drip irrigation without film therefore the soil evaporation in zone ii of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was lower than 62 of zone i it was observed that as more water vapor in zone i was transported from the surfaces of the soil to the upper parts of plant canopy with the air flow particularly after irrigation the water saving of the drip irrigation under mulch mainly occurred in the zone with mulching film zone i and the soil evaporation was far less than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film the evaporation capacity of the drip irrigation under mulch was determined to be 11 higher than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film in the zone without mulch zone ii the main reason for this was that more water had been stored in the soil under the mulch due to the moisture preservation of the film subsequently when the soil moisture content in zone ii was low the water was replenished through lateral migration 5 conclusions simdualkc model displayed the ability to accurately simulate the soil water content and evaporation rates with high simulation accuracy achieved the average soil evaporation of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was 2 4 times of mulch treatment a significant difference of soil evaporation among the different irrigation treatments was observed after the jointing stage the water saving of the drip irrigation under mulch had mainly occurred in the areas with mulch zone i with soil evaporation of 0 67 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10054,due to existing problems related to drip irrigation under the conditions of mulching and the vigorous promotion of soil covered drip irrigation without film drip irrigation experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 in order to explore the mechanism of water conservation three different irrigation treatments were adopted in this study high middle and low irrigation quotas in addition two different experiment areas were selected taking mulching as an example zone i film covered area and zone ⅱ bare soil area for comparison the division of zone with soil covered drip irrigation without film was the same as that with the mulching film the two zones were designed to analyze soil evaporation regularity based on a calibrated simdualkc model under the conditions of both mulched drip irrigation and soil covered drip irrigation without film respectively the results showed that the simdualkc model could potentially be applied to simulate the soil water content and evaporation rates with a higher accuracy the soil evaporation in high water treatment was 13 higher than that in medium water treatment and that in low water treatment was 5 lower than that in medium water treatment under the soil covered drip irrigation without film conditions the evaporation rates were only 0 67 mm and 36 18 mm in the zone i and zone ii areas under mulched drip irrigation conditions respectively the water conservation had mainly occurred in the mulched area zone i where mulched drip irrigation methods were utilized and the evaporation was much less than that of the areas where soil covered drip irrigation without film methods were implemented the results obtained in this study may provide a theoretical basis for future maize production under the conditions of both mulched drip irrigation and soil covered drip irrigation without film processes keywords evaporation maize drip irrigation under mulch soil covered drip irrigation without film film covered areas bare soil areas simdualkc model 1 introduction the west liaohe plain is located in northeastern china s maize belt this maize belt together with the american maize belt and the ukrainian maize belt of the same latitude are globally known as the three golden maize belts of the world it is also an important commodity grain base in china referred to as the inner mongolia granary the west liaohe plain is located in the middle of tongliao city and has the characteristics of a mid temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate at the present time the west liaohe river basin has been cut off and the groundwater over exploitation conditions have become serious leading to sharp drops of groundwater levels and the occurrences of large depression funnel areas therefore the establishment of methods to lower the utilization rates of water resources in order to achieve the sustainable development of agriculture in this area has become a key focus as advanced irrigation technology drip irrigation methods stand out among all the types of irrigation technologies since only the soil in the crop root areas are moistened drip irrigation procedures do not produce surface runoff or deep leakage effects and have low evaporation loss rates li et al 2006 with the implementations of water saving and grain increasing actions in inner mongolia drip irrigation technology has been widely applied in the tongliao area jia et al 2018 the water saving effects of drip irrigation under mulching conditions have been significant wang et al 2016 the previous research results have shown that when compared with drip irrigation without mulch the water use efficiency of the drip irrigation with mulch had increased by approximately 18 qi et al 2019 however the use of mulching film in large quantities is known to have a low recovery rate resulting in the white pollution of the soil wang et al 2017 in addition agricultural film residues tend to reduce water infiltration rates wang et al 2014 affect crop root development and reduce the crop yields ma et al 2008 li et al 2015 at the same time the use of mulching film also increases the costs of planting and affects the sustainable development of agricultural processes in 2015 the ministry of agriculture listed agricultural film residue pesticides and chemical fertilizers as the main non point source pollution problems for the future in recent years soil covered drip irrigation without film has been tested however since the actual mechanism of soil evaporation remains unclear it is necessary to further examine the law of soil evaporation at the present time there are many methods utilized for the determination of evapotranspiration it has been found that each of the aforementioned methods have corresponding application conditions and limitations liu and peng 2009 wang and pei 2001 kang 1985 the evapotranspiration et process is composed of the soil evaporation e and the crop transpiration t it has been found that quantitative analyses of the evaporation rates between crops and crop transpiration can effectively reveal the evaporation mechanisms of drip irrigated maize large lysimeters vorticity correlation technologies micro lysimeters and stem flow gauges have the ability to monitor daily evapotranspiration and evaporation rates between crops liu et al 1998 wang et al 2007 zhao et al 2018 calculated that the e et during grape growth periods ranged between 52 and 59 using vorticity correlation technology micro lysimeters and stem flow gauges it was found that the soil evaporation under the drip irrigation with mulching accounted for approximately 13 5 of the evapotranspiration in addition the soil evaporation under the drip irrigation without mulching accounted for approximately 23 4 of the evapotranspiration zhang et al 2018 due to the high costs of large lysimeters their promotion and applications have been limited micro lysimeters are required to weigh and measure every day the operations are complex and there are many factors which could potentially affect the accuracy of the results liu et al 2018 also there are known to be energy balance unclosed phenomena in vorticity correlation technology ntshidi et al 2020 the previous research results have shown that the measurements of evapotranspiration of vorticity correlation methods are low which affects the overall measurement accuracy alfieri et al 2012 during the process of measuring the stem flow gauges will damage the crops to a certain extent and the gauges cannot be used when the plants are small in recent years a large number of researchers have used simdualkc model to study evaporation and transpiration and high simulation accuracy rates have been achieved in the fao 56 allen et al 1998 the k c is divided into a basic crop coefficient k cb and a soil evaporation coefficient k e using a dual crop coefficient method the transpiration is characterized by k cb et 0 and the evaporation is characterized by k e et 0 therefore the two parts can be effectively distinguished ricardo et al 2012 yan et al 2018 in recent years researchers in the field have widely used simdualkc model to examine the evapotranspiration of different crops in various regions the simdualkc model calibrated and verified by zhang et al 2013 has shown good applicability in winter wheat and maize rotations in the north china plain shi et al 2015 used simdualkc model in northwestern china and estimated that the soil evaporation of greenhouse tomatoes under mulching conditions accounted for 5 4 5 9 of the total evapotranspiration previous studies carried out simulation research on the soil evaporation of maize under pipe irrigation and drip irrigation respectively using simdualkc model and achieved high simulation accuracy zhao et al 2012 yan et al 2017 li et al 2018 conducted a simulation study of the soil evaporation of maize under the conditions of drip irrigation during the growth period in tongliao inner mongolia the results revealed that the mulching film had reduced the soil evaporation particularly during the early growth periods after drip irrigation without mulching is performed the wetted areas are smaller which makes the change trend of evaporation different from that of traditional border irrigation as a result drip irrigation under mulching conditions make the change trend of soil evaporation more complicated due to the mulching effects in fao 56 the ratio of bare soil to wet soil f ew is given the evaporation of the drip irrigation had mainly occurred on the wetted surfaces of the soil without crop coverage the f ew was determined by the sections without crop coverage 1 f c and the wetted soil sections after irrigation f w at the present time the majority of research studies regarding drip irrigation evaporation have focused on the evaporation of the entire experimental treatment during the growth period however few in depth and detailed research studies have been made regarding the evaporation of different areas undergoing drip irrigation treatments particularly those areas covered with film and bare soil under film drip irrigation conditions therefore in the present study based on the measured data between crops of section two years combined with a simdualkc model compare the soil evaporation between different regions of drip irrigation under mulched and drip irrigation without mulch to explore the applicability of the model and the mechanism of water saving in drip irrigation processes for maize crops provide theoretical guidance for the future implementations of both drip irrigation measures with mulch and soil covered drip irrigation without film in the tongliao area of inner mongolia 2 material and methods 2 1 overview of

eastern longitude 123 32 northern latitude of 44 32 and 178 m above sea level located in the eastern end of tongliao city the study area has the climate characteristics of a temperate continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons it is characterized with rapid warming trends in the spring including blowing sand conditions and synchronous hot rainy climate conditions during the summer months featuring concentrated rainfall events the average wind speed is 3 9 m s and the average rainfall is in the range of 150 250 mm the soil type in the study areas is mainly loam the physical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 during the period ranging from 2017 to 2018 the study area was planted april 30th and harvested september 25th a planting method of wide and narrow row spacing was adopted the crops were arranged in two rows with a spacing of 85 cm between the wide rows a spacing of 35 cm between the narrow rows and row spacing of 25 cm the middle sections of the narrow rows were paved with a drip irrigation tape with a spacing of 30 cm between the drip heads the experiment was conducted under two conditions with covering film and soil covered without covering film the covering film was applied in a narrow row with a width of 70 cm and a thickness of 0 08 mm there was no mulching treatment applied for shallow burying rows the drip irrigation tape was shallowly buried 1 2 cm in order to prevent the effects of gale weather conditions impacting the drip irrigation tape in addition although no mulching material was laid all of the other layout methods were the same as that of the mulching drip irrigation process fig 2 the area of each plot of maize measured 4 8 m 60 m with three replicates the experiment was divided into three irrigation levels of high medium and low water which were expressed by wh wm and wl respectively there was a total of six treatments the upper and lower bounds of irrigation were the percentages of soil moisture content in the field water holding capacity and the setting of the medium water level was based on the available literature shi 2006 the high water and low water treatments were 5 and 5 of the upper and lower bounds of the medium water level the upper and lower bounds of the water irrigation in each treatment are shown in table 2 according to root depths the planned wetting layer was set as 20 cm for the planting emergence 40 cm for the emergence jointing and 70 cm for jointing maturity table 3 shows the irrigation amounts of different treatments during the growth period the maize varieties used in the tests were nonghua 106 and the fertilization levels were the same as that of the local farmers the basic fertilizer was applied with n 72 kg ha p2o5 105 kg ha and k2o 60 kg ha which was applied when the seedings had first developed using integrated agricultural machinery then 168 kg ha of urea was applied before jointing tasseling and grouting which was first dissolved in water in a integrated fertilizer tank and then applied with water drop device the agricultural machinery and agronomic supporting measures diseases insect pests and weeds were all managed in the field according to the implementation modes of the local farmers 2 2 observational content and methods 2 2 1 meteorological conditions the data regarding the wind speed atmospheric pressure relative humidity rainfall air temperature solar radiation and so on were automatically collected for every 60 min using a small meteorological station hobou30 made in the united states 2 2 2 evaporation between crops the automatic soil evaporation collection instrument beijing shiyutong technology co ltd was set for the medium water treatments for the mulching and soil covered drip irrigation without film the drip treatments for the mulching irrigation were set outside the mulch and the mulch edges were tangential to the outer edge of the evaporator the buried position of the soil covered drip irrigation without film treatment evaporator was the same as that of the drip irrigation treatment under mulch conditions the equipment fig 1 consisted of the following four parts a solar power supply device weighing component soil column and a protective barrel around the soil column the height was 25 cm and the diameter measured 20 cm the data collection interval was set as one hour also self made micro evaporators were arranged near the automatic soil evaporators and three groups of repeats were arranged for the purpose of checking the data of the automatic soil evaporators various related literature long et al 2010 gao et al 2010 gao and wang 2011 were compared in order to select the appropriate material as well as the diameters and lengths of the micro lysimeters then in accordance with the comparison and selection of the relative reference results combined with the goal of practical operability pvc tubes were used as the inner and outer barrels in this study the lengths of the tubes were 10 cm with outer cylinder s diameter measuring 16 cm and inner cylinder s diameter measuring 14 cm the bottom was sealed with 500 mesh which allowed for good permeability in order to prevent soil leakage an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 1 g was used for weighing at 17 00 h each day in order to ensure that the soil moisture content was consistent with that of the field the soil was changed once every 5 7 days following rainfall and irrigation 2 2 3 soil water content a tdr system trime t3 iph was used for the moisture content monitoring process and a drying method was used for the verifications in addition three groups of repeats were set up with one test completed prior to sowing one test after harvesting and one test every 7 days from the beginning of the sowing period then following rainfall and before and after irrigation additional measurements were made one layer was considered to be 20 cm and five layers were measured to a measurement depth of 1 m 3 introduction of study method simdualkc model is dual crop coefficient models based on the principle of water balance the model has the ability to effectively distinguish crop transpiration t k cb et 0 from inter plant evaporation e k e et 0 using a dual crop coefficient method allen et al 2005 in addition they can effectively calculate crop evapotranspiration moriasi et al 2007 the model includes soil data modules meteorological data modules crop data modules irrigation data modules and film coverage data modules which can accurately simulate crop transpiration and evaporation between crops under both film drip irrigation and shallow burying drip irrigation processes 1 et a k s k cb k e et 0 where et a is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 k cb is the basal crop coefficient k e is the soil evaporation coefficient k s is the water stress reduction coefficient and et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 since soil evaporation mainly occurs in the wetted section of soil surfaces the soil evaporation under the plant canopy is assumed to be contained in the k cb et 0 and the soil evaporation is referred to as k e et 0 the evaporation rates are known to be largest when the soil is wet however the energy obtained from the soil surface evaporation tends to limit the crop coefficient k cb k e k c max when the surfaces of the soil are dry the soil evaporation will be directly proportional to the residual water content of the soil as follows 2 ke min kr kc max kcb few kc max where k e represents the soil evaporation coefficient k cb indicates the coefficient of basic crops k c max is the maximum value of k c after rainfall or irrigation k r denotes the evaporation reduction coefficient which is dimensionless and dependent on the accumulated depth of the surface soil evaporation or water consumption and f ew represents the ratio of bare soil to wet soil which is the percentage of the largest soil evaporation surface allen et al 1998 in this study the

number of crop rows per plastic sheet spacing between rows spacing between holes along a row and hole diameter in the process of model application values for k cb ini k cb mid and k cb end were selected k cb mid and k cb end were adjusted according to local climatic conditions and planting density and determine daily soil evaporation according to k e value of model output in order to precision and intensive study of evaporation the drip irrigation under mulch treatment was divided into two areas zone i and zone ii the vertical drip irrigation tape was partitioned in the direction shown in fig 2 the zone with mulching film was zone i and the zone without mulching film was zone ii shown in fig 2a for comparison the zone with soil covered drip irrigation without covering film was the same as that with the mulching film the width of zone i was consistent with that of drip irrigation under the film which was dm the width of zone ii was dw dm shown in fig 2b the evaporation area coefficient c was introduced according to the above different zones et in each zone was the product of model output result and coefficient c and et a was the evapotranspiration output of the model 3

discussion 4 1 calibration and verification of the model parameters the parameters of the simdualkc model were calibrated in this study using the measured soil water content data from 2017 the calibrated soil parameters included the evaporation layer depth z e total evaporated water tew and easily evaporated water rew the crop parameters included the crop coefficient k cb and soil water consumption ratio p the initial value adopted was the recommended value of fao 56 then following parameter adjustments the calibrations ended when the simulated value of the moisture content was closest to the measured value the final calibration values of the soil parameters were z e 0 15 m tew 30 mm and rew 10 mm the final calibration results of the crop parameters during each stage are shown in table 3 which were consistent with the calibration results presented by li et al 2018 then the 2018 data were used to verify the applicability of the model in the study area the simulation values of the evaporation between crops were compared with the measured values fig 4 and 5 detail the comparison results of the simulations and actual measurements of the soil water content the goodness of fit test index proposed by previous researches were used to test the model s simulation effects including the determination the coefficient r 2 popova and pereira 2011 regression

comparison of the parameters between the measured soil moisture content and the simulated soil moisture content are shown in table 5 the fitting degree between the simulated soil moisture content and the measured soil moisture content was found to be relatively high in 2018 the regression coefficients of the soil covered drip irrigation without film and drip irrigation under mulch were 0 97 and 1 05 respectively and the determination coefficients were 0 93 and 0 98 respectively also the root mean square errors and consistency indexes were 0 01 and 0 97 and the simulation efficiency rates were 0 88 and 0 86 respectively for the two types of irrigation processes in conclusion the results indicated that the model was suitable for the tongliao area and had displayed good applicability 4 2 comparison of soil evaporation it was found in this study that the model had accurately simulated the soil water content the simdualkc model displayed the ability to effectively distinguish the crop transpiration from the soil evaporation through the basic crop coefficient k cb and the soil evaporation coefficient k e it was observed that for the drip irrigation under mulch layers due to the film mulching of the narrow row the daily water had gathered in the film in the form of water vapor then during the night when the temperatures were low the water vapor had liquefied into water droplets and returned to the soil surface therefore the evaporation of narrow row was ignored and the actual measured soil evaporation of the narrow row was compared with the model s simulated evaporation the area weighted averages of the wide and narrow rows of the soil covered drip irrigation without film system were compared with the soil evaporation simulated by the model the test results of the model simulations are detailed in fig 6 and 7 as can be seen from the above figures the simulated values of the soil evaporation were basically consistent with the actual measured values the planting emergency period refers to a local spring period when there was more wind and less rain less irrigation lower soil surface water content and lower soil evaporation which accounted for 6 19 of the total soil evaporation it was observed that with the development of the growth stages the temperatures had gradually begun to rise therefore in order to meet the water demands of the crops the irrigation processes were increased at the same time the soil evaporation increased the seedling jointing stage accounted for between 48 and 57 of the total soil evaporation in addition during the tasseling period it was found that the plant heights and leaf areas of the crops had reached the maximum the root systems of shallow soil had absorbed more water during that period as a result the soil evaporation decreased accounting for only 8 12 of the total soil evaporation during the mature stage the plant leaves had gradually withered and the evaporation levels had slightly increased finally prior to the harvesting stage the surfaces of the soil tended to be dry with decreased soil evaporation observed it was found in this study that during the growth period of the soil covered drip irrigation without film the average soil evaporation was 141 38 mm however drip irrigation under film the average soil evaporation was determined to be 58 10 mm the soil evaporation of drip irrigation under mulch was found to be 60 lower than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film furthermore the crop transpiration was 21 higher than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film and its evapotranspiration was 11 lower than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film the measured values were found to be slightly higher than the simulated values during the early stages of growth this was determined to be due to the fact that the internal soil temperatures of the evaporators were higher than the external temperatures due to the influences of the external walls since the internal root systems of the evaporators were broken there was no root water absorption and the soil moisture content remained high therefore the evaporation rates were also relatively large particularly in may when the effects of wind and sand were the most obvious it was also observed that during the middle and later stages of growth the evaporation rates were low due to crop coverage and the measured values were found to be in good agreement with the simulated values as shown in table 6 the regression coefficient of the simulated values and the measured values of evaporation between crops from 2017 2018 ranged between 0 83 and 0 90 under the soil covered drip irrigation without film and drip irrigation under mulch respectively the determination coefficient ranged between 0 89 and 0 95 the root mean square error was 0 15 0 35 in addition the consistency index was determined to be between 0 96 and 0 98 and the simulation efficiency was 0 85 0 93 therefore it was confirmed that simdualkc model was able to effectively simulate the evaporation between the maize crops in the tongliao area and the simulation accuracy was high 4 3 examination of the model simulations of the evaporation under the different irrigation treatments as shown in fig 8 the evaporation trends between crops under the different irrigation treatments were the same for example during the early stages the soil evaporation was larger accounting for 64 75 of the total evaporation between crops during the middle stages the soil evaporation tended to be low accounting for between 16 and 23 of the total evaporation however during the later stages due to the dropping of the crop leaves the irrigation was ceased and the surface soil had become gradually dried during that period the evaporation first increased and then decreased the evaporation of the soil covered drip irrigation without film with high water content was 13 higher than that with middle water content and the evaporation of the soil covered drip irrigation without film with low water content was determined to be 5 lower than that with middle water content it was observed that following irrigation and rainfall the soil evaporation rate was high the different irrigation treatments were controlled by the lower boundaries in this study and the irrigation quotas were the same however the irrigation times had varied during the early stages the high water content was only 3 higher than the middle water content and the low water content was only 2 lower than the middle water however following the jointing stage the differences in the two treatments were more obvious with the increases in irrigation particularly during the days of high evaporation after rainfall and irrigation during those periods the high water treatments were 20 higher than that of middle water treatments and the low water treatments were 15 lower than that of middle water treatments when the water content of the soil surfaces had become dry and the daily evaporation intensity was low the evaporation displayed a trend of low water middle water high water which was due to the higher influence of crop coverage when the evaporation intensity was low for the drip irrigation under mulch the film had covered the soil moistening parts of the water irrigation blocks and the air flow from the soil surface to the upper part of the crop canopy had been restricted therefore the effects of the irrigation on the evaporation rates were not significant and evaporation between crops increased significantly after rainfall there were no significant differences observed in the evaporation rates between the different treatments for the drip irrigation under mulch this was mainly due to the fact that the areas covered with mulch could only evaporate from the film holes and the majority of the evaporation was intercepted by the film after irrigation in addition there were no significant differences observed in evaporation rates between the different treatments in the areas not covered with mulch following rainfall events 4 4 comparison of the soil evaporation in different areas of drip irrigation under mulch and soil covered drip irrigation without film the change trend of soil evaporation was the same under the different treatments and in the different regions there was no plant growth less irrigation dry surface soil and less evaporation observed during the planting emergence stage accounting for 5 15 of the soil evaporation in the growth stage the water requirements for plant growth increased during the emergence jointing stage since large amounts of water were available due to the irrigation processes and the soil evaporation with lower plant coverage had reached the maximum accounting for 45 68 of the soil evaporation during the growth stage in addition since the crop coverage during the jointing tasseling stage had sharply increased and the soil evaporation had decreased 10 27 of the soil evaporation had occurred during the growth period the crop coverage reached the maximum during the tasseling grouting stage and the soil evaporation of each treatment was observed to reach the lowest point accounting for only 9 of the total evaporation during the growth period then since the plant growth had ceased during the grouting maturity stage with the plants leaves turning yellow and falling off and the soil evaporation had increased it was also found in this study that due to the different growth potentials of the crops along with the different soil moisture conditions the soil evaporation had varied in the different regions under the different treatments table 7 a small amount of evaporation was observed through the film holes and the broken parts of the film prior to the tasseling period this was attributed to the film coverage in zone i of the drip irrigation under the film the extremely low evaporation under the film approximately 0 had resulted from the plant stem diameters in the film holes reaching the maximum the soil evaporation in zone i of drip irrigation under the film was observed to be 0 67 mm accounting for only 2 of the total soil evaporation under the film in addition the evaporation in the zone ii of the drip irrigation under mulch was 36 18 mm which accounted for 98 of the total evaporation of the drip irrigation under mulch therefore the film mulching treatments had effectively reduced the soil evaporation in zone i with the soil evaporation in zone i found to be 98 lower than that in zone ii the soil evaporation in zone i of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was determined to be 84 59 mm accounting for 72 of the total soil evaporation in the soil covered drip irrigation without film the soil evaporation in zone ii of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was 32 50 mm accounting for 28 of the total soil evaporation in the soil covered drip irrigation without film therefore the soil evaporation in zone ii of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was lower than 62 of zone i it was observed that as more water vapor in zone i was transported from the surfaces of the soil to the upper parts of plant canopy with the air flow particularly after irrigation the water saving of the drip irrigation under mulch mainly occurred in the zone with mulching film zone i and the soil evaporation was far less than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film the evaporation capacity of the drip irrigation under mulch was determined to be 11 higher than that of the soil covered drip irrigation without film in the zone without mulch zone ii the main reason for this was that more water had been stored in the soil under the mulch due to the moisture preservation of the film subsequently when the soil moisture content in zone ii was low the water was replenished through lateral migration 5 conclusions simdualkc model displayed the ability to accurately simulate the soil water content and evaporation rates with high simulation accuracy achieved the average soil evaporation of the soil covered drip irrigation without film was 2 4 times of mulch treatment a significant difference of soil evaporation among the different irrigation treatments was observed after the jointing stage the water saving of the drip irrigation under mulch had mainly occurred in the areas with mulch zone i with soil evaporation of 0 67 mm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
