18800,the intermittent nature of stormwater runoff impacts the treatment performance of biofilters also known as stormwater biofiltration or bioretention systems and raingardens during extended dry periods which are common even in temperate climates plants can perish creating unattractive and non functional systems that might leach pollutants during the next rainfall event the current solution is to irrigate during long dry spells which is costly and unsustainable as biofilters become more widespread this paper presents the development of dual mode biofilters where stormwater and greywater are treated within the same system fifty columns utilising eight plant species including understory and climbing ornamentals and designs with and without a carbon source in the submerged zone were subjected to alternating greywater and stormwater inflows over five months six sampling events investigated treatment performance across these switching inflows and an extended dry period atypical event good removal of total suspended solids 83 biochemical oxygen demand 86 and some heavy metals e g lead 96 were reported irrespective of design plant species selection was critical for the removal of nitrogen 2 to 79 and phosphorus 12 to 75 under dual mode operation however following the extended dry period plants with the lowest nutrient outflow concentrations also experienced some of the highest sediment and carbon concentrations suggesting that a mixture of plant species may be beneficial for withstanding abnormal conditions differences between the treatment performance of designs with and without a carbon source were negligible with potential benefits possibly negated due to the increased root mass that comes with age systems were approximately two years old and the release of carbon from root exudates the results demonstrate the potential for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters as an alternative to single mode systems as they can provide effective treatment along with greater volumes of treated water while maintaining system performance throughout the year graphical abstract image 1 keywords raingarden bioretention hybrid phosphorus nitrogen multifunctional infrastructure 1 introduction polluted stormwater is detrimental to the health of receiving waters and this is largely due to the historical reliance on large underground drainage networks that rapidly discharge to these environments brown et al 2009 to counter this problem more holistic approaches to the urban water cycle have been promoted which includes the implementation of multifunctional infrastructure in the urban landscape fletcher et al 2015 stormwater biofilters also known as stormwater biofiltration or bioretention systems and raingardens meet these requirements a green technology placed in the urban landscape to passively reduce peak flows from rainfall events and improve the quality of the associated runoff payne et al 2015 this is achieved through the interplay of surface ponding infiltration vegetation microbial communities filter media and a submerged zone sz payne et al 2015 they are effective in removing sediment nitrogen and phosphorus from stormwater e g bratieres et al 2008 along with heavy metals e g li and davis 2009 pathogens e g chandrasena et al 2017 and a number of micropollutants such as total petroleum hydrocarbons and phthalates e g zhang et al 2014 however their treatment performance is impacted by extended dry periods with vegetation die off mcdowell et al 2008 and leaching of contaminants hatt et al 2007 in climates with distinct dry seasons systems have to be irrigated to prevail during extended dry periods this diminishes their sustainability and increases their costs considering the likely increased prevalence of drought conditions as a result of climate change huntington 2006 the reliability of biofilters needs to be increased before they are considered genuine long term alternatives to conventional water treatment infrastructure we propose a dual mode biofilter where a vegetated sand filter is used to treat stormwater when it rains and greywater when it is generated overcoming the aforementioned issues recent work has seen biofilters successfully treat light greywater fowdar et al 2017 light greywater hereafter referred to as greywater refers to the wastewater from showers baths and bathroom sinks friedler and hadari 2006 it is more consistently available than stormwater as it is weather independent and is less contaminated compared to other wastewater types eriksson et al 2002 in addition incorporating greywater into biofilter operation could have the added benefits of reducing wastewater flows that require expensive end of pipe treatment while providing re use potential and lowering mains water use grant et al 2012 there have been recent studies on dual mode systems treating rainfall or stormwater and greywater however none of these seem to be utilising the concepts of biofiltration leong et al 2018 utilised multi media and granular activated carbon filters and an in line ozone injection system in their work on a decentralised rainwater greywater system they used rainwater and mains water to dilute greywater with promising pollutant removal efficiencies sapkota et al 2018 conceptualised water infrastructure options which included combining stormwater harvesting and greywater re use with a centralised water supply they concluded that hybrid scenarios can substantially reduce potable water demand but need to be chosen on a site specific basis loux et al 2012 suggest that the inclusion of greywater recycling with rainfall collection can provide adequate volumes for irrigation and toilet flushing but note cost as a significant barrier hybrid green roofs have been explored but again this was done from a volume and irrigation perspective rozos et al 2013 stratigea and makropoulos 2015 rather than for water treatment interestingly stormwater groundwater operation utilising biofilter design has been investigated with the successful treatment of groundwater in dry months aloni and brenner 2017 zinger et al 2011 while the amalgamation of these studies provides promise for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters how alternating these water sources would impact treatment performance is unknown for example perhaps the systems will not be able to cope with high levels of inflow variability when different polluted waters are used in a rather random way that is greywater differs significantly from stormwater in terms of pollutant concentrations volumes and frequency duncan 1999 eriksson et al 2002 variables that impact the treatment performance of biofilters daly et al 2012 davis et al 2009 hsieh and davis 2005 while a successful dual mode biofilter would allow on site treatment of stormwater and greywater along with the potential for stormwater harvesting and greywater re use the multifunctional nature of this infrastructure may also contribute to urban cooling coutts et al 2013 enhanced biodiversity kazemi et al 2009 and urban beautification backhaus and fryd 2013 of particular relevance to this study is the use of attractive vegetation to increase the aesthetic appeal of biofilters it is widely accepted that the use and type of vegetation within raingardens is vital for effective stormwater treatment read et al 2008 in addition fowdar et al 2017 found that some popular ornamental plants including vines can effectively treat greywater using a standard biofiltration design however the treatment ability of ornamental and climbing plants in a dual mode stormwater greywater operation is unknown with plant species selection imperative for single mode operation it is anticipated that plant selection may become even more crucial for dual mode biofilters due to the inherent challenge of dealing with significantly different water sources a further design feature of biofilters is a sz which enhances treatment performance and sustains vegetation during dry periods glaister et al 2014 payne et al 2014b more specifically the inclusion of a carbon source in the sz aids biological denitrification of stormwater kim et al 2003 in contrast fowdar et al 2015 suggest that a carbon source may not be required for greywater treatment due to the ample presence of biodegradable organics this may well be true with the results of a large greywater biofiltration study reporting no significant differences in treatment performance between biofilters with and without a carbon source fowdar et al 2017 therefore with the alternating stormwater and greywater inflows that come with dual mode systems the importance of a carbon source is unclear a carbon source may still be important in a dual mode system to aid treatment when inflows are predominantly stormwater this paper reports on a large laboratory scale study that was undertaken to test the viability of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters the aim of this study was to understand how switching between greywater and stormwater impacts treatment performance our primary focus was the role of vegetation and the treatment capability of climbing and ornamental plants our secondary focus was the impact of a carbon source in the sz on the treatment performance of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters the ultimate goal of the study was to establish design and operating conditions of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters for reliable treatment the specific research objectives of this paper included 1 identifying plant species including understory and climbing ornamentals that are effective in dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters for the removal of nutrients and other key contaminants 2 understanding the impact of alternating water sources on treatment performance 3 testing the system under challenging conditions i e extended dry period and 4 ascertaining the influence of a carbon source in the sz on treatment performance to our knowledge this is the first study exploiting single planted biofiltration systems for treatment of both stormwater and greywater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a total of 50 240 mm diameter pvc columns were erected in an open air greenhouse with a solid clear roof eight plant species were used including six ornamental understory and climbing plants along with one common stormwater biofilter plant carex appressa and one common wetland plant phragmites australis as reference species table 1 the ornamental plants were chosen for their water loving nature and potential to withstand high nutrient conditions fowdar et al 2017 all columns consisted of an upper media layer of 500 mm triple washed sand followed by 300 mm of triple washed sand blended with 5 cedar mulch carbon source 70 mm coarse sand and a 70 mm gravel drainage layer fig 1 a 440 mm sz was created through the use of a stand pipe this depth aligns with stormwater biofiltration guidelines for melbourne australia temperate climate with long dry periods which specify a sz of at least 350 mm but ideally 450 500 mm for optimal performance payne et al 2015 zinger et al 2007a 2007b forty columns were of standard design and included a single plant fig 1 five columns were non vegetated controls and five columns were no carbon source controls stormwater biofiltration studies have suggested that the inclusion of a carbon source e g mulch within the sz can promote denitrification through nox removal kim et al 2003 in contrast greywater biofiltration studies have suggested sz carbon additions are unnecessary for effective treatment due to the availability of biodegradable organics in greywater fowdar et al 2015 2017 in addition it is quite possible that the organics will be reduced in the upper unsaturated layer which is aerobic before reaching the sz where anoxic conditions prevail fowdar et al 2015 therefore utilising columns planted with c appressa we investigated the treatment performance of designs with and without a carbon source the experiment initially included five replicates of each design configuration however three columns were removed before the experiment started two due to plant death one each of phormium tenax and p australis and one due to cracking of the column and water leakage one parthenocissus tricuspidata the plants were approximately 20 months old at the beginning of the experiment they were sourced from a local nursery grown for four months within planter bags and then transplanted to the experimental columns for the first eight months the columns were irrigated with tap water and occasionally a nutrient solution to support plant establishment this was followed by 12 months of greywater dosing before the commencement of alternating stormwater and greywater inflows given the age of the systems at the beginning of this experiment plants were well established and able to mimic treatment performance of mature systems further details on the establishment and greywater dosing phases are provided in fowdar et al 2017 2 2 experimental procedure greywater preparation was undertaken using a modified version of the protocol developed by the australian commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro for testing greywater technologies diaper et al 2008 lightly polluted bathroom wastewater i e shower bath and basin wastewater was targeted boyjoo et al 2013 eriksson et al 2002 fowdar et al 2017 with the greywater comprising common household products e g handwash toothpaste laboratory chemicals and secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant mixed with tap water the stormwater composition was based on typical worldwide and melbourne australia concentrations duncan 1999 taylor et al 2005 and consisted of laboratory chemicals and sediment from a local constructed stormwater wetland sieved to 1 mm mixed with dechlorinated tap water the use of similar semi synthetic greywater and stormwater is common practice within this field of research e g bratieres et al 2008 fowdar et al 2017 payne et al 2014b prodanovic et al 2018 target inflow concentrations for key contaminants are provided in table 2 with further details on the water characteristics and preparation methods provided in the supplementary material table s1 and section 2 as this was the first experiment examining dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters we focussed on key contaminants for both water sources separate tanks incorporating electric stirrers were used to continuously and evenly mix each water source during dosing both water sources were conveyed from the tank to the greenhouse using designated overhead pipe networks a timeline of the experiment including dosing volumes and operational mode water source is provided as fig 2 during the first month of the experiment columns received only greywater this equated to 110 mm day 5l of greywater five days per week with the remaining two days being dry given the nascent understanding of greywater biofilters this dosing volume was taken from fowdar et al 2017 and was based on maintaining a 48 h detention time within the sz to enhance denitrification the inflow pattern aligns with a commercial building that is unoccupied over the weekend and therefore not producing greywater inflow was then alternated between greywater and stormwater to investigate the impact of switching water sources on treatment performance this dosing schedule is referred to as mixed mode table 1 in this mode on a weekly basis columns received 110 mm day 5l of greywater on three days tuesday wednesday and friday and 287 mm day 13l of stormwater on two days monday and thursday with the remaining two days being dry greywater dosing was restricted to three days as we were concerned about overloading the systems this type of operation aligns with temperate climates where there is no distinct wet season and regularly switching between water sources may be required the stormwater dosing schedule reflects the general rainfall pattern for melbourne i e a temperate climate with an average annual rainfall of 613 mm and approximately two rainy days per week dispersed evenly throughout the year it aligns with previous stormwater studies e g bratieres et al 2008 payne et al 2014b and allowed the impact on treatment performance of including greywater on traditionally dry days to be further ascertained stormwater volumes sv were calculated to reflect a biofilter with a surface area sized at two percent of its impervious catchment area s v l c a 0 613 104 1000 where ca impervious catchment area m2 following two weeks of mixed mode operation four sequential days of greywater dosing were undertaken to compare the system performance with that of the initial greywater only dosing this allowed us to investigate the impact of stormwater inflows on the greywater treatment performance of the system this was followed by two weeks of mixed mode an extended dry period was then imposed for 26 days during this time columns received 66 mm 3l of tap water on one occasion to avoid plant death but allow the sz to be drawn down while the primary purpose of dual mode biofilters is to avoid extended dry periods by using alternating water sources it is also important to understand how the understory and climbing ornamental plants would cope with this challenging condition while greywater is more consistently produced than stormwater it is reliant on human water use therefore it is plausible that on occasion neither water source would be entering a dual mode biofilter e g holiday periods in this way the resilience of the plants used in this study to withstand extended dry periods was investigated stormwater inflow was used to end the extended dry period simulating a potential real life scenario during holiday periods as such inflow concentrations in the fifth sampling round were low as they were stormwater subsequent to this there was a two week period 12 26 january 2016 when only stormwater was used to dose the columns due to pump failure for the greywater distribution network the experiment concluded with two months in mixed mode during which time it was expected that the system had equilibrated to mixed mode throughout the experiment greywater was distributed to the columns using a sprinkler system via at least two passes while stormwater was manually applied to the ponding zone in a rapid manner via at last three passes this highlights the different but realistic way greywater and stormwater would enter a dual mode biofilter six water quality sampling events were undertaken to investigate the impact of alternating operational modes on treatment performance i e between mixed and greywater only inflows an extended dry period and recovery table 1 two samples of the inflow were collected on each sampling day and for the two antecedent dosing days stormwater volumes were increased to 442 mm day 20l for mixed mode sampling events to reflect a one in one month average recurrence interval event for melbourne which is slightly greater than one pore volume of the columns chandrasena et al 2017 all mixed mode sampling events denote a three day period two days of greywater inflow followed by one day of stormwater inflow sampling day in mixed mode sampling was undertaken following stormwater inflow to ensure that treatment performance was not solely due to the longer residence time of water retained in the columns from previous dosing this reflects how dual mode systems would work during an actual event approximately 10l of water was retained within the columns following stormwater dosing as was elucidated from previous tracer tests chandrasena et al 2017 fowdar et al 2018 this meant collected water was approximately 50 50 old retained within the system from previous dosing and new applied to the system on sampling day payne et al 2014b on mixed mode sampling days on sampling days the entire outflow from each column was collected in designated buckets once a column had finished draining generally two to four hours after dosing a metal plunger cleaned with ethanol and air dried was used to agitate and mix the outflow before a representative 2 06l sub sample was collected consisting of two 1l bottles and one 60 ml bottle analysis of inflow and outflow samples was undertaken in national association of testing authorities nata accredited laboratories for total suspended solids tss total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total dissolved phosphorus tdp filterable reactive phosphorus frp total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonia nh3 oxidised nitrogen nox total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 in addition for five sampling events samples were analysed for cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu lead pb manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn particulate phosphorus pp was calculated by subtracting tdp from tp dissolved organic phosphorus dop by subtracting frp from tdp particulate nitrogen pn by subtracting tdn from tn and dissolved organic nitrogen don by subtracting nh3 and nox from tdn to assess hydraulic performance the infiltration rate ir was measured on six occasions see table 1 immediately following dosing of the columns the drop in depth in mm of ponded influent stormwater or greywater was measured relative to the media surface at 75 s intervals measurements continued until all water had infiltrated or after 20 min whichever occurred sooner fowdar et al 2017 for slow draining columns defined as those that continuously showed no discernible water level drop after 75 s intervals 5 of columns the intervals were increased to allow a water level difference to be measured in these cases measurements proceeded for a few hours the average ir for each column i r c was calculated as the slope of the drop in water level across the measurement time mm hr i r c x x y y x x 2 where x time hrs x mean time hrs y head depth mm y mean head depth mm ir measurements were conducted within one week of sampling events this allowed potential relationships between ir and treatment performance to be examined 2 3 data analysis a fully factorial experimental design was not possible due to resource limitations cost and space therefore the data set was split in order to allow the main factors and interactions to be analysed this approach aligns with similar experimental studies on biofiltration design e g bratieres et al 2008 le coustumer et al 2012 fowdar et al 2017 as concentrations and volumes varied between greywater and stormwater inflows a weighted average was calculated to represent the inflow concentration across mixed mode sampling events as stated previously approximately 10l of water is retained within the columns following stormwater dosing with the remaining 10l of new water flowing through the columns is treated and collected on sampling day to allow direct comparison with outflow concentrations mixed mode inflow concentrations imm accounted for the 10l retained in the system and were calculated as follows i m m c d 1 v d 1 c d 2 v d 2 c d 3 v d 3 v s z v d 1 v d 2 v d 3 v s z where cd1 cd2 and cd3 inflow concentration mg l on day 1 day 2 and day 3 respectively vd1 vd2 vd3 inflow volume l on day 1 day 2 and day 3 respectively vsz volume l of sz to asses overall treatment performance across the entire experiment volume weighted outflow concentrations cv and total pollutant load removal efficiencies lr were calculated for each column this was done to account for the alternating nature of inflow concentrations and volumes used across the sampling events such that a clearer understanding of treatment capacity could be formed cv was calculated as follows c v o 1 6 c o v o o 1 6 v o where co outflow concentration mg l for sampling event 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively vo outflow volume l for sampling event 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively the overall outflow concentrations for each design was then estimated as the median of the replicates lr were estimated as the difference between inflow lin and outflow lout loads across all sampling events as a percentage l i n i 1 6 c i v i l o u t o 1 6 c o v o l r l i n l o u t l i n 100 where ci inflow concentration for event vi inflow volume for event the overall pollutant load removal efficiencies for each design was then estimated as the median of the replicates statistical analysis was undertaken using the ibm spss statistics 24 package as the majority of data did not satisfy the assumptions of parametric testing non parametric methods were employed for the entirety of the statistical analyses these included 1 kruskal wallis h test kwh used to ascertain the significance of differences between overall irs and pollutant load removal efficiencies between designs pairwise comparisons kwh pw with a bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons were utilised post hoc 2 friedman test fmt used to ascertain the significance of changes in irs across measurement rounds for each design in addition to assess the changes in outflow concentrations across the first four sampling events for each design as a means to investigate the impact of switching between inflows on treatment performance pairwise comparisons fmt pw with a bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons were utilised post hoc 3 mann whitney u test mwu used to ascertain the significance of differences between overall load removal percentages of the standard design and that without a carbon source differences in outflow concentrations between the standard design and that without a carbon source for each sampling event were also investigated 4 wilcoxon signed rank test wsr used to assess the significance of changes in outflow concentrations from before and following the extended dry period for each design along with differences in ir between the first ir1 and last ir6 measurement rounds for each design significance was accepted at p 0 05 for all analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance fig 3 illustrates the variation in median irs for each design across the experiment median irs were satisfactory that is 100 mm h for all designs except non vegetated 76 93 mm h in the final ir6 measurement round there was a general decrease in irs from the first to the third measurement round with most designs experiencing their lowest median ir at this point however differences across measurement rounds were not significant for most designs fmt p 0 05 it is hypothesised that the slowing of irs was related to the increase in water volume leading to more saturated conditions in mixed mode this is supported by the recovery of irs following the extended dry period ir5 where maximum irs were observed for most designs potentially the drying process reduced interstitial clogging through biofilm desiccation and produced macropores in the media through cracking of the surface sediment layer leading to faster infiltration comparison between the first ir1 and final ir6 measurement rounds shows a decrease in median irs for all designs and this was significant for p jasminoides wsr p 0 043 for all other designs final observed irs were commensurate with their starting values wsr p 0 05 however all median irs increased following the extended dry period suggesting the extended dry period may have facilitated these recoveries as such the importance of periodic rest periods particularly in wet seasons in maintaining hydraulic conductivity should be explored further for dual mode biofilters for instance fowdar et al 2017 found decreased infiltration rates during winter noticeably improved following an imposed dry period the current experiment was run across warmer months where plants were actively growing seasonal impacts on the ir of dual mode biofilters could be explored by running similar experiments over colder months and longer time periods to understand ir differences between designs the six ir measurements were combined to make one independent group 24 n 30 for each design p tenax had the fastest median ir 409 18 mm h and was significantly faster than c appressa kwh pw p 0 001 and p jasminoides kwh pw p 0 001 c x generalis was the second fastest 378 42 mm h and was significantly faster than c appressa kwh pw p 0 001 and p jasminoides kwh pw p 0 005 c appressa was the slowest design and this was significant compared with p tenax kwh pw p 0 001 c x generalis kwh pw p 0 001 p tricuspidata kwh pw p 0 004 and l japonica kwh pw p 0 030 the results are likely related to the root systems of these plants while c appressa has a fine dense root system that can cause clogging le coustumer et al 2012 p tenax has stout fleshy roots that can extend downward or laterally wehi and clarkson 2007 and c x generalis is rhizomatous with thick roots kubitzki and huber 1998 associated with maintaining hydraulic conductivity archer et al 2002 there were no significant differences between the irs of the no carbon source and with carbon source designs mwu p 0 255 this is not surprising given that the factors influencing irs are most likely plant morphology including root systems and the surface clogging layer formed as a result of sediment accumulation given that the rationale for including a carbon source in the sz was to aid treatment performance i e denitrification and as both designs were planted with c appressa it is expected they would exhibit similar irs 3 2 influence of vegetation on overall treatment performance table 3 presents median outflow concentrations and overall load removal efficiencies for each design across the entire experiment for brevity only a selection of analytes are included in table 3 focusing on those that saw greater differentiation between plant species the remaining data are provided in the supplementary material table s2 all designs reported effective tss and bod5 load removals 83 96 and 86 97 respectively c x generalis reported the lowest tss load removal and this was significantly lower compared to p tenax kwh pw p 0 004 and p australis kwh pw p 0 002 this may be related to the thick root architecture of c x generalis providing preferential pathways for inflows and hence reducing sediment capture by the media the bod5 results are generally consistent with work on vertical wastewater wetlands stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 but are lower than those reported by fowdar et al 2017 for greywater biofilters 97 mean removal for all tested designs this is partly explained by columns receiving a lower organic load in dual mode than greywater only operation as the bod5 of stormwater is considerably less than greywater table 2 in addition the increased driving head due to the greater inflow volume in dual mode operation may have diminished the processing of bod5 in the upper aerobic layers of the columns fowdar et al 2017 c appressa reported the highest outflow bod5 8 78 1 5 mg l and toc 10 06 1 1 mg l concentrations along with a low tn concentration 0 95 0 0 mg l the large dense root system of c appressa that aids highly effective nutrient treatment may be prone to carbohydrate seepage read et al 2008 median tp load removal was varied the non vegetated design provided no removal 0 while p australis and p tenax provided the lowest removal of the planted designs 13 and 12 respectively c appressa and c x generalis provided the highest removal 67 and this was significant compared to the aforementioned three worst performing designs all kwh pw p 0 05 except for c x generalis and p australis kwh pw p 0 059 while the main removal pathways for phosphorus within biofilters are media filtration particulate phosphorus and media sorption dissolved phosphorus fowdar et al 2017 li and davis 2016 muerdter et al 2018 plants do contribute to phosphorus treatment the differences between designs is likely due to direct plant and mycorrhizal uptake desorption of phosphorus from the media by plant roots and the oxidation provision of plants increasing media sorption of phosphorus fowdar et al 2017 muerdter et al 2018 anecdotally c appressa and c x generalis were two of the fastest growing species in the experiment while p australis and p tenax did not flourish higher growth rate and biomass impact pollutant removal due to increased absorptive surface area and potentially higher nutrient needs read et al 2008 similar variation amongst plant species was observed in biofilters exposed to greywater inflows fowdar et al 2017 and the results align with stormwater biofilter studies that have reported tp leaching palmer et al 2013 to treatment henderson et al 2007 the sz may have exacerbated the poor performance of some plant species as some studies have suggested a deep sz reduces phosphorus treatment wang et al 2018 zinger et al 2012 however the results of those studies were inconclusive given either no replicates were used organic matter was present in the sz or poor performing plant species were selected conversely in other studies the inclusion of a sz enhanced phosphorus removal compared to designs not including a sz largely by allowing further treatment between inflow events glaister et al 2014 as the sz may impact phosphorus treatment and given that a deep sz may be obsolete for dual mode biofilters as long dry periods should be minimised with the inclusion of regular greywater inflows future experiments should examine the impact of the sz depth and plant species interaction on treatment performance tdp and frp results closely aligned with tp c appressa and c x generalis provided significantly higher tdp load removal than non vegetated p australis and p tenax all kwh pw p 0 05 along with higher frp load removal compared to non vegetated and p tenax all kwh pw p 0 05 in addition c x generalis provided significantly higher frp removal than p australis kwh pw p 0 012 given inflow tp load was 76 in dissolved form which plants can uptake directly muerdter et al 2018 this highlights the importance of carefully selecting plant species for phosphorus removal dop load removal was significantly different between designs kwh p 0 007 p tenax 65 and p australis 51 provided the best and second worst dop load removal respectively in addition they were the two worst planted designs for tp 12 and 13 respectively tdp 1 and 0 respectively and frp 5 and 7 respectively load removal but the best for tss removal 95 and 96 respectively this suggests that p tenax may have a mechanism for temporarily binding dop bratieres et al 2008 suggest stormwater biofilters can consistently remove high amounts of tp 85 by using optimal design specifications such as sandy loam media and effective plant species as media was kept constant across designs the alternating water sources may have exacerbated plant differences in this experiment for instance phosphorus retained under greywater inflows may leach when stormwater is then applied to the system the decreased inflow concentrations that come with stormwater compared to greywater may also reduce treatment performance due to the shift in reaction e g adsorption and precipitation equilibriums most plant species provided high tn load removal 75 except for p australis and p tenax 9 and 2 respectively all planted designs outperformed the non vegetated design 34 however this was only significant compared to c x generalis kwh pw p 0 020 and c appressa kwh pw p 0 002 poor nitrogen removal is not uncommon for some vegetation bratieres et al 2008 wang et al 2018 and speaks to the criticalness of choosing effective plant species in dual mode stormwater greywater biofilers at the conceptual level the results may indicate an inability of some designs in dual mode operation to reach treatment equilibrium or background concentrations wong et al 2006 per se due to either the alternating concentration or volume of the inflow and or the pollutant loading rate being greater than the processing capacity of the systems tdn nh3 and nox load removals were also significantly different between designs all kwh p 0 001 tdn removal efficiencies closely matched those of tn while planted columns outperformed non vegetated for nh3 removal table 3 this was only significant for c x generalis kwh pw p 0 004 and c appressa kwh pw p 0 001 vegetation mostly provided effective nox removal and this was significant compared to non vegetated for p tricuspidata kwh pw p 0 014 c appressa kwh pw p 0 002 and c x generalis kwh pw p 0 002 nh3 and nox represent two of the major forms of nitrogen directly used by plants given biotic assimilation uptake by plants bacteria fungi or other microbes as the major process for nitrate removal in stormwater biofilters payne et al 2014a this variation across designs is expected with nitrification denitrification likely accounting for 15 of treatment fowdar et al 2018 payne et al 2014a as such differences in nitrogen treatment are likely related to the nitrogen species available for processing versus plant preference and the plant s capacity to access simple organic forms of nitrogen through mycorrhizae or to a lesser extent via direct uptake payne et al 2013 interestingly under higher inflow concentrations 10 mg l denitrification has been shown to increase in proportion to a decrease in plant assimilation payne et al 2014a therefore while nitrogen processing in the current experiment is likely driven by plant assimilation denitrification may exhibit greater influence in dual mode biofiltration systems that receive high nitrogen greywater further work is therefore required to elicit the influence of design features other than plant species selection e g sz depth inclusion of a carbon source on treatment performance in a higher nitrogen environment cd outflow concentrations were mostly below the laboratory detection limit i e 0 0001 mg l cu cr pb mn ni and zn load removals were significantly different between designs all kwh p 0 05 given pb and zn load reductions were high 96 and 93 respectively the practical significance of these differences was considered minimal this is understandable given filtration and adsorption are the major removal pathways for heavy metals in stormwater biofilters and media was kept constant across designs this is further evidenced by the observation that planted designs had statistically similar mn load removal as the non vegetated design all kwh pw p 0 05 in contrast the inclusion of vegetation seemed to enhance cu treatment while only significant compared to the best performing plant species c x generalis kwh pw p 0 002 all planted designs outperformed non vegetated for cu removal this may be due to plants having a direct uptake pathway for cu muerdter et al 2018 with cu confirmed in the tissues of biofilter plants rycewicz borecki et al 2016 while most designs provided effective ni removal 33 74 c x generalis recorded low removal 2 a closer look at each sampling round shows that c x generalis behaved similarly to other designs prior to the extended dry period but leached subsequently suggesting macropore development as the potential cause when viewed in relation to diminished tss removal in the same sampling round p australis provided the best cr load removal of the vegetated designs 87 but provided minimal tp 13 and tn 9 removal while c appressa provided the overall best nutrient removal but the worst cr removal 51 in addition c x generalis provided high nutrient removal but the worst ni removal 2 this shows a plant pollutant interaction effect with an inverse relationship between the contaminants this supports previous findings that plant species are not universally effective at treating all pollutants but rather a mixture of plant species should be used in these systems e g bratieres et al 2008 read et al 2008 fowdar et al 2017 in contrast to nitrogen and phosphorus many of the heavy metals examined in this experiment are only required in trace amounts for plant growth and potentially the adaptive strategies of some plants may be minimising the uptake of cr and ni dalcorso et al 2014 shanker et al 2005 in dual mode operation 3 3 impact of alternating water sources on outflow concentrations figs 4 7 highlight the variation in median concentrations over the duration of the experiment for brevity a selection of plant species are shown ranging from least to most effective with the remaining data provided in the supplementary material figs s1 s4 minimal practical differences were noted for tss bod5 toc and doc outflow concentrations across the alternating water sources fig 4 this is logical as tss removal is largely dependent on mechanical straining provided by the filter media and bod5 removal is dependent on aerobic degradation in the upper media layers in contrast tp tdp and frp outflow concentrations fig 5 for all designs were significantly impacted all fmt p 0 05 except l japonica for frp fmt p 0 060 tp outflow concentrations decreased following stormwater dosing in mixed mode second sampling event and decreased for all designs under greywater only inflows in the third sampling event this is understandable when viewed in relation to the equilibrium reactions of adsorption and precipitation important processes for phosphorus treatment within biofilters decreasing and increasing in accordance with the availability of phosphorus in the stormwater and greywater inflow respectively following the switch back to mixed mode fourth event outflow concentrations for effective plant species e g c appressa and c x generalis were largely unchanged while higher outflow concentrations were observed for less effective plant species e g p australis and p tenax of note is the general decrease in tp tdp and frp outflow concentrations between the two greywater only sampling events first and third events or alternatively between the two mixed sampling events second and fourth events this decreasing trend may be related to decreased loads with the columns subjected to lower phosphorus loading rates than in greywater only mode ultimately the results suggest that despite significant differences in outflow concentrations good performing plant species e g c appressa and c x generalis are able to reduce tp tdp and frp irrespective of the water source changes in dop outflow concentrations were significant for most designs fmt p 0 05 and mostly decreased across the alternating water sources fig 5 good tp removal did not necessarily correlate with good dop removal with some plant species leaching dop but maintaining tp treatment across the alternating water sources e g c x generalis p jasminoides and c appressa as dop accounted for 2 19 of inflow tp across the first four sampling events these results may be attributed to organic phosphorus not being as bioavailable as inorganic phosphorus all designs maintained tn treatment fig 6 following the initial stormwater dosing sampling event two with tn concentration removal high 70 across most plant species however it did vary significantly across most designs and the alternate water sources fmt p 0 05 with c appressa p 0 118 and s nicolai p 0 106 the exceptions this variation exhibited no consistent pattern for instance while c x generalis showed increased tn concentrations in mixed mode p australis had lower concentrations the pattern of tdn removal across operational modes closely resembled tn which is not surprising as tn was mostly in dissolved form 73 86 while significant changes in nh3 outflow concentrations were recorded across the alternating water sources for the majority of designs fmt p 0 05 in practicality they remained relatively stable for most plant species this suggests there may be a processing limit for plant species which is further evidenced by c appressa with and without a carbon source recording negligible nh3 across switching events nox removal was highly variable with all designs experiencing significant differences across the alternating water sources fmt p 0 05 except s nicolai p 0 069 and non vegetated p 0 058 leaching of nox was observed for p tenax p australis and non vegetated columns across all four events highlighting the importance of including effective plant species for nox removal in dual mode biofilters fig 7 shows the variation in outflow concentrations of heavy metals across the sampling events pb 0 003 mg l and zn 0 037 mg l outflow concentrations were consistently low across plant species suggesting minimal impact from the alternating inflows in contrast cr cu mn and ni concentrations showed greater variation all designs recorded significant differences in mn and ni outflow concentrations across the alternating inflows fmt p 0 05 except l japonica p 0 050 and p 0 060 respectively changes in outflow cu concentrations between sampling events were significant for c appressa fmt p 0 021 c x generalis fmt p 0 008 s nicolai fmt p 0 019 and no carbon source fmt p 0 015 however all these designs maintained similar outflow concentrations across the alternating inflows suggesting minimal practical significance 3 4 impact of the extended dry period on treatment performance mean bod5 and tss concentrations fig 4 were higher for all designs following the extended dry period and this was significant for half the designs wsr p 0 05 hatt et al 2007 reported minimal differences in tss removal between wetting and drying events due to mechanical straining being the primary mechanism for its removal however their study was undertaken indoors and used narrow non vegetated columns and thus would have experienced low evapotranspiration the presence of vegetation and higher evapotranspiration in the current experiment would result in faster drying the lower removals may be a result of macropore development within the filter media creating preferential flow paths and leaching due to desiccation microbial death and root die off some of the largest differences in tss removal were associated with c x generalis and c appressa two of the better performing species for tp removal it is hypothesised that accelerated drying may have occurred with these species due to higher water needs all designs leached tp except c x generalis following the extended dry period fig 5 likely due to microbial death and the release of cell bound phosphorus kinsman costello et al 2016 turner and haygarth 2001 this hypothesis is supported by the leaching of dop and pp upon re wetting by all designs except c appressa with and without a carbon source for pp while c x generalis and l japonica were the only designs to report lower frp concentrations following the extended dry period overall plant species that performed well under wet conditions were best able to cope with the extended dry period by either maintaining some phosphorus treatment or minimising leaching e g c x generalis and c appressa suggesting their adaptive strategies are ideal for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters most designs saw significant increases in outflow tn concentration fig 6 following the extended dry period wsr p 0 05 in comparison to tp half the designs maintained tn treatment upon re wetting and the decrease in inflow concentration the increase in outflow concentrations of nitrogen following extended dry periods is not uncommon hatt et al 2007 payne et al 2014b and has been linked to microbial death and the release of cell bound nitrogen baldwin and mitchell 2000 decreased denitrification baldwin and mitchell 2000 along with changes in aerobic anaerobic processing within the biofilter sexstone et al 1988 while other nitrogen species mostly did not register significant differences wsr p 0 05 nox concentrations were significantly larger for most designs wsr p 0 05 perhaps due to biological processing slowing during the dry period anecdotally some plants became noticeably stressed browning of foliage during the extended dry period particularly c appressa it is plausible that the high growth rate and dense root system of c appressa that contribute to it being a good performer under normal conditions may be the same reason it suffers during dry periods read et al 2008 as it has higher water needs that said at the conclusion of the experiment outflow concentrations from most designs were commensurate with starting values suggesting effective recovery following the extended dry period 3 5 influence of a carbon source on treatment performance there were no significant differences in load reductions across the entire experiment for sediment all forms of nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon bod5 cu pb mn and zn between the designs with and without a carbon source all mwu p 0 05 high removal of pb and zn for biofilters with and without a carbon zone in the sz aligns with previous stormwater biofiltration studies blecken et al 2009 however there were significant differences for some heavy metals cr mwu p 0 016 and ni mwu p 0 016 with the design without a carbon source providing higher load removals in each case the greater differentiation in cr and ni removal between the carbon source and no carbon source design may relate to the adaptive strategy of c appressa c appressa is highly effective at removing nutrients with or without a carbon source in contrast with the inclusion of a carbon source c appressa provided the lowest cr and second lowest ni removal compared to other plant species however with no carbon source the load removal of ni and cr by c appressa increased significantly and aligned with other plant species this highlights a plant pollutant interaction effect between nutrients and other elements required in trace amounts for plant growth with the processing of cr and ni by c appressa diminishing in a carbon abundant environment as such the impact of a carbon source in the sz on the removal of heavy metals by different plant species especially those highly effective at nutrient removal should be further explored in biofiltration research minimal practical differences in outflow concentrations were noted across the alternating water sources it is hypothesised that the maturity of the systems approximately two years old by the end of this experiment may have contributed to these results perhaps through the increased root mass that comes with age and the release of carbon from root exudates and hence the growth of microorganisms in the rhizosphere farrar et al 2003 with a carbon source in the sz expected to be more beneficial in the formative years however as this experiment was constrained in testing all designs with and without a carbon source there is uncertainty as to the transferability of this finding to all plant species previous studies suggest that the inclusion of a carbon source in the sz should minimise differences in treatment performance between plant species payne et al 2014b zhang et al 2011 therefore not including a carbon source would likely have increased differences between plant species in our experiment while incoming greywater may provide sufficient biodegradable organics to enhance denitrification without a carbon source there is scope to further scrutinise the carbon source addition for dual mode biofilters future experiments could explore the influence of a carbon source on treatment performance and its interaction with a range of plant species utilising designs with and without the addition the benefit of a carbon source may become more pronounced under higher nitrogen inflows which may increase nitrification denitrification processing as opposed to plant assimilation payne et al 2014a 4 conclusions the results demonstrate the potential for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters as an alternative to single mode systems as they can provide effective treatment along with greater volumes of treated water while maintaining system performance throughout the year the slowing of infiltration rates through mixed mode and recovery following the extended dry period suggest stages of periodic rest may be required particularly during wet seasons to maintain hydraulic performance and minimise interstitial clogging of dual mode biofilters high removal of tss bod5 toc doc and some heavy metals were reported across designs with the careful selection of plant species dual mode biofilters can provide effective treatment of nitrogen and phosphorus irrespective of the water source s this finding was consolidated following the extended dry period with effective plant species c appressa and c x generalis providing removal and or minimising net leaching removal of tss by designs containing generally good plant species for nutrient removal were more adversely affected following the extended dry period compared to other designs comparison of the wet and dry periods results suggest that while short rest periods are important for maintaining infiltration capacity dual mode biofilters utilising understory and climbing ornamentals should not be exposed to long dry periods no practical significance for the inclusion of a carbon source in the sz was found this is attributed to the use of c appressa in the examination and the release of carbon from root exudates and hence the growth of microorganisms in the rhizosphere in mature systems the benefit of a carbon source may be more pronounced under higher nitrogen inflows where nitrification denitrification processing may increase as opposed to plant assimilation as this experiment focussed on key contaminants future work should focus on other pollutants and their long term fate under dual mode operation e g surfactants and metals for greywater along with hydrocarbons and pesticides for stormwater analysis of microorganism and pathogen removal will be crucial across both water sources to allay potential risks associated with this novel technology future work will need to focus on the complex interactions between inflow volumes frequency and pollutant concentrations on the treatment performance of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters including different operational modes and across longer timeframes system recovery following extended dry periods using greywater or mixed mode should also be explored declaration

18800,the intermittent nature of stormwater runoff impacts the treatment performance of biofilters also known as stormwater biofiltration or bioretention systems and raingardens during extended dry periods which are common even in temperate climates plants can perish creating unattractive and non functional systems that might leach pollutants during the next rainfall event the current solution is to irrigate during long dry spells which is costly and unsustainable as biofilters become more widespread this paper presents the development of dual mode biofilters where stormwater and greywater are treated within the same system fifty columns utilising eight plant species including understory and climbing ornamentals and designs with and without a carbon source in the submerged zone were subjected to alternating greywater and stormwater inflows over five months six sampling events investigated treatment performance across these switching inflows and an extended dry period atypical event good removal of total suspended solids 83 biochemical oxygen demand 86 and some heavy metals e g lead 96 were reported irrespective of design plant species selection was critical for the removal of nitrogen 2 to 79 and phosphorus 12 to 75 under dual mode operation however following the extended dry period plants with the lowest nutrient outflow concentrations also experienced some of the highest sediment and carbon concentrations suggesting that a mixture of plant species may be beneficial for withstanding abnormal conditions differences between the treatment performance of designs with and without a carbon source were negligible with potential benefits possibly negated due to the increased root mass that comes with age systems were approximately two years old and the release of carbon from root exudates the results demonstrate the potential for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters as an alternative to single mode systems as they can provide effective treatment along with greater volumes of treated water while maintaining system performance throughout the year graphical abstract image 1 keywords raingarden bioretention hybrid phosphorus nitrogen multifunctional infrastructure 1 introduction polluted stormwater is detrimental to the health of receiving waters and this is largely due to the historical reliance on large underground drainage networks that rapidly discharge to these environments brown et al 2009 to counter this problem more holistic approaches to the urban water cycle have been promoted which includes the implementation of multifunctional infrastructure in the urban landscape fletcher et al 2015 stormwater biofilters also known as stormwater biofiltration or bioretention systems and raingardens meet these requirements a green technology placed in the urban landscape to passively reduce peak flows from rainfall events and improve the quality of the associated runoff payne et al 2015 this is achieved through the interplay of surface ponding infiltration vegetation microbial communities filter media and a submerged zone sz payne et al 2015 they are effective in removing sediment nitrogen and phosphorus from stormwater e g bratieres et al 2008 along with heavy metals e g li and davis 2009 pathogens e g chandrasena et al 2017 and a number of micropollutants such as total petroleum hydrocarbons and phthalates e g zhang et al 2014 however their treatment performance is impacted by extended dry periods with vegetation die off mcdowell et al 2008 and leaching of contaminants hatt et al 2007 in climates with distinct dry seasons systems have to be irrigated to prevail during extended dry periods this diminishes their sustainability and increases their costs considering the likely increased prevalence of drought conditions as a result of climate change huntington 2006 the reliability of biofilters needs to be increased before they are considered genuine long term alternatives to conventional water treatment infrastructure we propose a dual mode biofilter where a vegetated sand filter is used to treat stormwater when it rains and greywater when it is generated overcoming the aforementioned issues recent work has seen biofilters successfully treat light greywater fowdar et al 2017 light greywater hereafter referred to as greywater refers to the wastewater from showers baths and bathroom sinks friedler and hadari 2006 it is more consistently available than stormwater as it is weather independent and is less contaminated compared to other wastewater types eriksson et al 2002 in addition incorporating greywater into biofilter operation could have the added benefits of reducing wastewater flows that require expensive end of pipe treatment while providing re use potential and lowering mains water use grant et al 2012 there have been recent studies on dual mode systems treating rainfall or stormwater and greywater however none of these seem to be utilising the concepts of biofiltration leong et al 2018 utilised multi media and granular activated carbon filters and an in line ozone injection system in their work on a decentralised rainwater greywater system they used rainwater and mains water to dilute greywater with promising pollutant removal efficiencies sapkota et al 2018 conceptualised water infrastructure options which included combining stormwater harvesting and greywater re use with a centralised water supply they concluded that hybrid scenarios can substantially reduce potable water demand but need to be chosen on a site specific basis loux et al 2012 suggest that the inclusion of greywater recycling with rainfall collection can provide adequate volumes for irrigation and toilet flushing but note cost as a significant barrier hybrid green roofs have been explored but again this was done from a volume and irrigation perspective rozos et al 2013 stratigea and makropoulos 2015 rather than for water treatment interestingly stormwater groundwater operation utilising biofilter design has been investigated with the successful treatment of groundwater in dry months aloni and brenner 2017 zinger et al 2011 while the amalgamation of these studies provides promise for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters how alternating these water sources would impact treatment performance is unknown for example perhaps the systems will not be able to cope with high levels of inflow variability when different polluted waters are used in a rather random way that is greywater differs significantly from stormwater in terms of pollutant concentrations volumes and frequency duncan 1999 eriksson et al 2002 variables that impact the treatment performance of biofilters daly et al 2012 davis et al 2009 hsieh and davis 2005 while a successful dual mode biofilter would allow on site treatment of stormwater and greywater along with the potential for stormwater harvesting and greywater re use the multifunctional nature of this infrastructure may also contribute to urban cooling coutts et al 2013 enhanced biodiversity kazemi et al 2009 and urban beautification backhaus and fryd 2013 of particular relevance to this study is the use of attractive vegetation to increase the aesthetic appeal of biofilters it is widely accepted that the use and type of vegetation within raingardens is vital for effective stormwater treatment read et al 2008 in addition fowdar et al 2017 found that some popular ornamental plants including vines can effectively treat greywater using a standard biofiltration design however the treatment ability of ornamental and climbing plants in a dual mode stormwater greywater operation is unknown with plant species selection imperative for single mode operation it is anticipated that plant selection may become even more crucial for dual mode biofilters due to the inherent challenge of dealing with significantly different water sources a further design feature of biofilters is a sz which enhances treatment performance and sustains vegetation during dry periods glaister et al 2014 payne et al 2014b more specifically the inclusion of a carbon source in the sz aids biological denitrification of stormwater kim et al 2003 in contrast fowdar et al 2015 suggest that a carbon source may not be required for greywater treatment due to the ample presence of biodegradable organics this may well be true with the results of a large greywater biofiltration study reporting no significant differences in treatment performance between biofilters with and without a carbon source fowdar et al 2017 therefore with the alternating stormwater and greywater inflows that come with dual mode systems the importance of a carbon source is unclear a carbon source may still be important in a dual mode system to aid treatment when inflows are predominantly stormwater this paper reports on a large laboratory scale study that was undertaken to test the viability of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters the aim of this study was to understand how switching between greywater and stormwater impacts treatment performance our primary focus was the role of vegetation and the treatment capability of climbing and ornamental plants our secondary focus was the impact of a carbon source in the sz on the treatment performance of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters the ultimate goal of the study was to establish design and operating conditions of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters for reliable treatment the specific research objectives of this paper included 1 identifying plant species including understory and climbing ornamentals that are effective in dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters for the removal of nutrients and other key contaminants 2 understanding the impact of alternating water sources on treatment performance 3 testing the system under challenging conditions i e extended dry period and 4 ascertaining the influence of a carbon source in the sz on treatment performance to our knowledge this is the first study exploiting single planted biofiltration systems for treatment of both stormwater and greywater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design a total of 50 240 mm diameter pvc columns were erected in an open air greenhouse with a solid clear roof eight plant species were used including six ornamental understory and climbing plants along with one common stormwater biofilter plant carex appressa and one common wetland plant phragmites australis as reference species table 1 the ornamental plants were chosen for their water loving nature and potential to withstand high nutrient conditions fowdar et al 2017 all columns consisted of an upper media layer of 500 mm triple washed sand followed by 300 mm of triple washed sand blended with 5 cedar mulch carbon source 70 mm coarse sand and a 70 mm gravel drainage layer fig 1 a 440 mm sz was created through the use of a stand pipe this depth aligns with stormwater biofiltration guidelines for melbourne australia temperate climate with long dry periods which specify a sz of at least 350 mm but ideally 450 500 mm for optimal performance payne et al 2015 zinger et al 2007a 2007b forty columns were of standard design and included a single plant fig 1 five columns were non vegetated controls and five columns were no carbon source controls stormwater biofiltration studies have suggested that the inclusion of a carbon source e g mulch within the sz can promote denitrification through nox removal kim et al 2003 in contrast greywater biofiltration studies have suggested sz carbon additions are unnecessary for effective treatment due to the availability of biodegradable organics in greywater fowdar et al 2015 2017 in addition it is quite possible that the organics will be reduced in the upper unsaturated layer which is aerobic before reaching the sz where anoxic conditions prevail fowdar et al 2015 therefore utilising columns planted with c appressa we investigated the treatment performance of designs with and without a carbon source the experiment initially included five replicates of each design configuration however three columns were removed before the experiment started two due to plant death one each of phormium tenax and p australis and one due to cracking of the column and water leakage one parthenocissus tricuspidata the plants were approximately 20 months old at the beginning of the experiment they were sourced from a local nursery grown for four months within planter bags and then transplanted to the experimental columns for the first eight months the columns were irrigated with tap water and occasionally a nutrient solution to support plant establishment this was followed by 12 months of greywater dosing before the commencement of alternating stormwater and greywater inflows given the age of the systems at the beginning of this experiment plants were well established and able to mimic treatment performance of mature systems further details on the establishment and greywater dosing phases are provided in fowdar et al 2017 2 2 experimental procedure greywater preparation was undertaken using a modified version of the protocol developed by the australian commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro for testing greywater technologies diaper et al 2008 lightly polluted bathroom wastewater i e shower bath and basin wastewater was targeted boyjoo et al 2013 eriksson et al 2002 fowdar et al 2017 with the greywater comprising common household products e g handwash toothpaste laboratory chemicals and secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant mixed with tap water the stormwater composition was based on typical worldwide and melbourne australia concentrations duncan 1999 taylor et al 2005 and consisted of laboratory chemicals and sediment from a local constructed stormwater wetland sieved to 1 mm mixed with dechlorinated tap water the use of similar semi synthetic greywater and stormwater is common practice within this field of research e g bratieres et al 2008 fowdar et al 2017 payne et al 2014b prodanovic et al 2018 target inflow concentrations for key contaminants are provided in table 2 with further details on the water characteristics and preparation methods provided in the supplementary material table s1 and section 2 as this was the first experiment examining dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters we focussed on key contaminants for both water sources separate tanks incorporating electric stirrers were used to continuously and evenly mix each water source during dosing both water sources were conveyed from the tank to the greenhouse using designated overhead pipe networks a timeline of the experiment including dosing volumes and operational mode water source is provided as fig 2 during the first month of the experiment columns received only greywater this equated to 110 mm day 5l of greywater five days per week with the remaining two days being dry given the nascent understanding of greywater biofilters this dosing volume was taken from fowdar et al 2017 and was based on maintaining a 48 h detention time within the sz to enhance denitrification the inflow pattern aligns with a commercial building that is unoccupied over the weekend and therefore not producing greywater inflow was then alternated between greywater and stormwater to investigate the impact of switching water sources on treatment performance this dosing schedule is referred to as mixed mode table 1 in this mode on a weekly basis columns received 110 mm day 5l of greywater on three days tuesday wednesday and friday and 287 mm day 13l of stormwater on two days monday and thursday with the remaining two days being dry greywater dosing was restricted to three days as we were concerned about overloading the systems this type of operation aligns with temperate climates where there is no distinct wet season and regularly switching between water sources may be required the stormwater dosing schedule reflects the general rainfall pattern for melbourne i e a temperate climate with an average annual rainfall of 613 mm and approximately two rainy days per week dispersed evenly throughout the year it aligns with previous stormwater studies e g bratieres et al 2008 payne et al 2014b and allowed the impact on treatment performance of including greywater on traditionally dry days to be further ascertained stormwater volumes sv were calculated to reflect a biofilter with a surface area sized at two percent of its impervious catchment area s v l c a 0 613 104 1000 where ca impervious catchment area m2 following two weeks of mixed mode operation four sequential days of greywater dosing were undertaken to compare the system performance with that of the initial greywater only dosing this allowed us to investigate the impact of stormwater inflows on the greywater treatment performance of the system this was followed by two weeks of mixed mode an extended dry period was then imposed for 26 days during this time columns received 66 mm 3l of tap water on one occasion to avoid plant death but allow the sz to be drawn down while the primary purpose of dual mode biofilters is to avoid extended dry periods by using alternating water sources it is also important to understand how the understory and climbing ornamental plants would cope with this challenging condition while greywater is more consistently produced than stormwater it is reliant on human water use therefore it is plausible that on occasion neither water source would be entering a dual mode biofilter e g holiday periods in this way the resilience of the plants used in this study to withstand extended dry periods was investigated stormwater inflow was used to end the extended dry period simulating a potential real life scenario during holiday periods as such inflow concentrations in the fifth sampling round were low as they were stormwater subsequent to this there was a two week period 12 26 january 2016 when only stormwater was used to dose the columns due to pump failure for the greywater distribution network the experiment concluded with two months in mixed mode during which time it was expected that the system had equilibrated to mixed mode throughout the experiment greywater was distributed to the columns using a sprinkler system via at least two passes while stormwater was manually applied to the ponding zone in a rapid manner via at last three passes this highlights the different but realistic way greywater and stormwater would enter a dual mode biofilter six water quality sampling events were undertaken to investigate the impact of alternating operational modes on treatment performance i e between mixed and greywater only inflows an extended dry period and recovery table 1 two samples of the inflow were collected on each sampling day and for the two antecedent dosing days stormwater volumes were increased to 442 mm day 20l for mixed mode sampling events to reflect a one in one month average recurrence interval event for melbourne which is slightly greater than one pore volume of the columns chandrasena et al 2017 all mixed mode sampling events denote a three day period two days of greywater inflow followed by one day of stormwater inflow sampling day in mixed mode sampling was undertaken following stormwater inflow to ensure that treatment performance was not solely due to the longer residence time of water retained in the columns from previous dosing this reflects how dual mode systems would work during an actual event approximately 10l of water was retained within the columns following stormwater dosing as was elucidated from previous tracer tests chandrasena et al 2017 fowdar et al 2018 this meant collected water was approximately 50 50 old retained within the system from previous dosing and new applied to the system on sampling day payne et al 2014b on mixed mode sampling days on sampling days the entire outflow from each column was collected in designated buckets once a column had finished draining generally two to four hours after dosing a metal plunger cleaned with ethanol and air dried was used to agitate and mix the outflow before a representative 2 06l sub sample was collected consisting of two 1l bottles and one 60 ml bottle analysis of inflow and outflow samples was undertaken in national association of testing authorities nata accredited laboratories for total suspended solids tss total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total dissolved phosphorus tdp filterable reactive phosphorus frp total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonia nh3 oxidised nitrogen nox total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 in addition for five sampling events samples were analysed for cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu lead pb manganese mn nickel ni and zinc zn particulate phosphorus pp was calculated by subtracting tdp from tp dissolved organic phosphorus dop by subtracting frp from tdp particulate nitrogen pn by subtracting tdn from tn and dissolved organic nitrogen don by subtracting nh3 and nox from tdn to assess hydraulic performance the infiltration rate ir was measured on six occasions see table 1 immediately following dosing of the columns the drop in depth in mm of ponded influent stormwater or greywater was measured relative to the media surface at 75 s intervals measurements continued until all water had infiltrated or after 20 min whichever occurred sooner fowdar et al 2017 for slow draining columns defined as those that continuously showed no discernible water level drop after 75 s intervals 5 of columns the intervals were increased to allow a water level difference to be measured in these cases measurements proceeded for a few hours the average ir for each column i r c was calculated as the slope of the drop in water level across the measurement time mm hr i r c x x y y x x 2 where x time hrs x mean time hrs y head depth mm y mean head depth mm ir measurements were conducted within one week of sampling events this allowed potential relationships between ir and treatment performance to be examined 2 3 data analysis a fully factorial experimental design was not possible due to resource limitations cost and space therefore the data set was split in order to allow the main factors and interactions to be analysed this approach aligns with similar experimental studies on biofiltration design e g bratieres et al 2008 le coustumer et al 2012 fowdar et al 2017 as concentrations and volumes varied between greywater and stormwater inflows a weighted average was calculated to represent the inflow concentration across mixed mode sampling events as stated previously approximately 10l of water is retained within the columns following stormwater dosing with the remaining 10l of new water flowing through the columns is treated and collected on sampling day to allow direct comparison with outflow concentrations mixed mode inflow concentrations imm accounted for the 10l retained in the system and were calculated as follows i m m c d 1 v d 1 c d 2 v d 2 c d 3 v d 3 v s z v d 1 v d 2 v d 3 v s z where cd1 cd2 and cd3 inflow concentration mg l on day 1 day 2 and day 3 respectively vd1 vd2 vd3 inflow volume l on day 1 day 2 and day 3 respectively vsz volume l of sz to asses overall treatment performance across the entire experiment volume weighted outflow concentrations cv and total pollutant load removal efficiencies lr were calculated for each column this was done to account for the alternating nature of inflow concentrations and volumes used across the sampling events such that a clearer understanding of treatment capacity could be formed cv was calculated as follows c v o 1 6 c o v o o 1 6 v o where co outflow concentration mg l for sampling event 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively vo outflow volume l for sampling event 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively the overall outflow concentrations for each design was then estimated as the median of the replicates lr were estimated as the difference between inflow lin and outflow lout loads across all sampling events as a percentage l i n i 1 6 c i v i l o u t o 1 6 c o v o l r l i n l o u t l i n 100 where ci inflow concentration for event vi inflow volume for event the overall pollutant load

satisfy the assumptions of parametric testing non parametric methods were employed for the entirety of the statistical analyses these included 1 kruskal wallis h test kwh used to ascertain the significance of differences between overall irs and pollutant load removal efficiencies between designs pairwise comparisons kwh pw with a bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons were utilised post hoc 2 friedman test fmt used to ascertain the significance of changes in irs across measurement rounds for each design in addition to assess the changes in outflow concentrations across the first four sampling events for each design as a means to investigate the impact of switching between inflows on treatment performance pairwise comparisons fmt pw with a bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons were utilised post hoc 3 mann whitney u test mwu used to ascertain the significance of differences between overall load removal percentages of the standard design and that without a carbon source differences in outflow concentrations between the standard design and that without a carbon source for each sampling event were also investigated 4 wilcoxon signed rank test wsr used to assess the significance of changes in outflow concentrations from before and following the extended dry period for each design along with differences in ir between the first ir1 and last ir6 measurement rounds for each design significance was accepted at p 0 05 for all analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance fig 3 illustrates the variation in median irs for each design across the experiment median irs were satisfactory that is 100 mm h for all designs except non vegetated 76 93 mm h in the final ir6 measurement round there was a general decrease in irs from the first to the third measurement round with most designs experiencing their lowest median ir at this point however differences across measurement rounds were not significant for most designs fmt p 0 05 it is hypothesised that the slowing of irs was related to the increase in water volume leading to more saturated conditions in mixed mode this is supported by the recovery of irs following the extended dry period ir5 where maximum irs were observed for most designs potentially the drying process reduced interstitial clogging through biofilm desiccation and produced macropores in the media through cracking of the surface sediment layer leading to faster infiltration comparison between the first ir1 and final ir6 measurement rounds shows a decrease in median irs for all designs and this was significant for p jasminoides wsr p 0 043 for all other designs final observed irs were commensurate with their starting values wsr p 0 05 however all median irs increased following the extended dry period suggesting the extended dry period may have facilitated these recoveries as such the importance of periodic rest periods particularly in wet seasons in maintaining hydraulic conductivity should be explored further for dual mode biofilters for instance fowdar et al 2017 found decreased infiltration rates during winter noticeably improved following an imposed dry period the current experiment was run across warmer months where plants were actively growing seasonal impacts on the ir of dual mode biofilters could be explored by running similar experiments over colder months and longer time periods to understand ir differences between designs the six ir measurements were combined to make one independent group 24 n 30 for each design p tenax had the fastest median ir 409 18 mm h and was significantly faster than c appressa kwh pw p 0 001 and p jasminoides kwh pw p 0 001 c x generalis was the second fastest 378 42 mm h and was significantly faster than c appressa kwh pw p 0 001 and p jasminoides kwh pw p 0 005 c appressa was the slowest design and this was significant compared with p tenax kwh pw p 0 001 c x generalis kwh pw p 0 001 p tricuspidata kwh pw p 0 004 and l japonica kwh pw p 0 030 the results are likely related to the root systems of these plants while c appressa has a fine dense root system that can cause clogging le coustumer et al 2012 p tenax has stout fleshy roots that can extend downward or laterally wehi and clarkson 2007 and c x generalis is rhizomatous with thick roots kubitzki and huber 1998 associated with maintaining hydraulic conductivity archer et al 2002 there were no significant differences between the irs of the no carbon source and with carbon source designs mwu p 0 255 this is not surprising given that the factors influencing irs are most likely plant morphology including root systems and the surface clogging layer formed as a result of sediment accumulation given that the rationale for including a carbon source in the sz was to aid treatment performance i e denitrification and as both designs were planted with c appressa it is expected they would exhibit similar irs 3 2 influence of vegetation on overall treatment performance table 3 presents median outflow concentrations and overall load removal efficiencies for each design across the entire experiment for brevity only a selection of analytes are included in table 3 focusing on those that saw greater differentiation between plant species the remaining data are provided in the supplementary material table s2 all designs reported effective tss and bod5 load removals 83 96 and 86 97 respectively c x generalis reported the lowest tss load removal and this was significantly lower compared to p tenax kwh pw p 0 004 and p australis kwh pw p 0 002 this may be related to the thick root architecture of c x generalis providing preferential pathways for inflows and hence reducing sediment capture by the media the bod5 results are generally consistent with work on vertical wastewater wetlands stefanakis and tsihrintzis 2012 but are lower than those reported by fowdar et al 2017 for greywater biofilters 97 mean removal for all tested designs this is partly explained by columns receiving a lower organic load in dual mode than greywater only operation as the bod5 of stormwater is considerably less than greywater table 2 in addition the increased driving head due to the greater inflow volume in dual mode operation may have diminished the processing of bod5 in the upper aerobic layers of the columns fowdar et al 2017 c appressa reported the highest outflow bod5 8 78 1 5 mg l and toc 10 06 1 1 mg l concentrations along with a low tn concentration 0 95 0 0 mg l the large dense root system of c appressa that aids highly effective nutrient treatment may be prone to carbohydrate seepage read et al 2008 median tp load removal was varied the non vegetated design provided no removal 0 while p australis and p tenax provided the lowest removal of the planted designs 13 and 12 respectively c appressa and c x generalis provided the highest removal 67 and this was significant compared to the aforementioned three worst performing designs all kwh pw p 0 05 except for c x generalis and p australis kwh pw p 0 059 while the main removal pathways for phosphorus within biofilters are media filtration particulate phosphorus and media sorption dissolved phosphorus fowdar et al 2017 li and davis 2016 muerdter et al 2018 plants do contribute to phosphorus treatment the differences between designs is likely due to direct plant and mycorrhizal uptake desorption of phosphorus from the media by plant roots and the oxidation provision of plants increasing media sorption of phosphorus fowdar et al 2017 muerdter et al 2018 anecdotally c appressa and c x generalis were two of the fastest growing species in the experiment while p australis and p tenax did not flourish higher growth rate and biomass impact pollutant removal due to increased absorptive surface area and potentially higher nutrient needs read et al 2008 similar variation amongst plant species was observed in biofilters exposed to greywater inflows fowdar et al 2017 and the results align with stormwater biofilter studies that have reported tp leaching palmer et al 2013 to treatment henderson et al 2007 the sz may have exacerbated the poor performance of some plant species as some studies have suggested a deep sz reduces phosphorus treatment wang et al 2018 zinger et al 2012 however the results of those studies were inconclusive given either no replicates were used organic matter was present in the sz or poor performing plant species were selected conversely in other studies the inclusion of a sz enhanced phosphorus removal compared to designs not including a sz largely by allowing further treatment between inflow events glaister et al 2014 as the sz may impact phosphorus treatment and given that a deep sz may be obsolete for dual mode biofilters as long dry periods should be minimised with the inclusion of regular greywater inflows future experiments should examine the impact of the sz depth and plant species interaction on treatment performance tdp and frp results closely aligned with tp c appressa and c x generalis provided significantly higher tdp load removal than non vegetated p australis and p tenax all kwh pw p 0 05 along with higher frp load removal compared to non vegetated and p tenax all kwh pw p 0 05 in addition c x generalis provided significantly higher frp removal than p australis kwh pw p 0 012 given inflow tp load was 76 in dissolved form which plants can uptake directly muerdter et al 2018 this highlights the importance of carefully selecting plant species for phosphorus removal dop load removal was significantly different between designs kwh p 0 007 p tenax 65 and p australis 51 provided the best and second worst dop load removal respectively in addition they were the two worst planted designs for tp 12 and 13 respectively tdp 1 and 0 respectively and frp 5 and 7 respectively load removal but the best for tss removal 95 and 96 respectively this suggests that p tenax may have a mechanism for temporarily binding dop bratieres et al 2008 suggest stormwater biofilters can consistently remove high amounts of tp 85 by using optimal design specifications such as sandy loam media and effective plant species as media was kept constant across designs the alternating water sources may have exacerbated plant differences in this experiment for instance phosphorus retained under greywater inflows may leach when stormwater is then applied to the system the decreased inflow concentrations that come with stormwater compared to greywater may also reduce treatment performance due to the shift in reaction e g adsorption and precipitation equilibriums most plant species provided high tn load removal 75 except for p australis and p tenax 9 and 2 respectively all planted designs outperformed the non vegetated design 34 however this was only significant compared to c x generalis kwh pw p 0 020 and c appressa kwh pw p 0 002 poor nitrogen removal is not uncommon for some vegetation bratieres et al 2008 wang et al 2018 and speaks to the criticalness of choosing effective plant species in dual mode stormwater greywater biofilers at the conceptual level the results may indicate an inability of some designs in dual mode operation to reach treatment equilibrium or background concentrations wong et al 2006 per se due to either the alternating concentration or volume of the inflow and or the pollutant loading rate being greater than the processing capacity of the systems tdn nh3 and nox load removals were also significantly different between designs all kwh p 0 001 tdn removal efficiencies closely matched those of tn while planted columns outperformed non vegetated for nh3 removal table 3 this was only significant for c x generalis kwh pw p 0 004 and c appressa kwh pw p 0 001 vegetation mostly provided effective nox removal and this was significant compared to non vegetated for p tricuspidata kwh pw p 0 014 c appressa kwh pw p 0 002 and c x generalis kwh pw p 0 002 nh3 and nox represent two of the major forms of nitrogen directly used by plants given biotic assimilation uptake by plants bacteria fungi or other microbes as the major process for nitrate removal in stormwater biofilters payne et al 2014a this variation across designs is expected with nitrification denitrification likely accounting for 15 of treatment fowdar et al 2018 payne et al 2014a as such differences in nitrogen treatment are likely related to the nitrogen species available for processing versus plant preference and the plant s capacity to access simple organic forms of nitrogen through mycorrhizae or to a lesser extent via direct uptake payne et al 2013 interestingly under higher inflow concentrations 10 mg l denitrification has been shown to increase in proportion to a decrease in plant assimilation payne et al 2014a therefore while nitrogen processing in the current experiment is likely driven by plant assimilation denitrification may exhibit greater influence in dual mode biofiltration systems that receive high nitrogen greywater further work is therefore required to elicit the influence of design features other than plant species selection e g sz depth inclusion of a carbon source on treatment performance in a higher nitrogen environment cd outflow concentrations were mostly below the laboratory detection limit i e 0 0001 mg l cu cr pb mn ni and zn load removals were significantly different between designs all kwh p 0 05 given pb and zn load reductions were high 96 and 93 respectively the practical significance of these differences was considered minimal this is understandable given filtration and adsorption are the major removal pathways for heavy metals in stormwater biofilters and media was kept constant across designs this is further evidenced by the observation that planted designs had statistically similar mn load removal as the non vegetated design all kwh pw p 0 05 in contrast the inclusion of vegetation seemed to enhance cu treatment while only significant compared to the best performing plant species c x generalis kwh pw p 0 002 all planted designs outperformed non vegetated for cu removal this may be due to plants having a direct uptake pathway for cu muerdter et al 2018 with cu confirmed in the tissues of biofilter plants rycewicz borecki et al 2016 while most designs provided effective ni removal 33 74 c x generalis recorded low removal 2 a closer look at each sampling round shows that c x generalis behaved similarly to other designs prior to the extended dry period but leached subsequently suggesting macropore development as the potential cause when viewed in relation to diminished tss removal in the same sampling round p australis provided the best cr load removal of the vegetated designs 87 but provided minimal tp 13 and tn 9 removal while c appressa provided the overall best nutrient removal but the worst cr removal 51 in addition c x generalis provided high nutrient removal but the worst ni removal 2 this shows a plant pollutant interaction effect with an inverse relationship between the contaminants this supports previous findings that plant species are not universally effective at treating all pollutants but rather a mixture of plant species should be used in these systems e g bratieres et al 2008 read et al 2008 fowdar et al 2017 in contrast to nitrogen and phosphorus many of the heavy metals examined in this experiment are only required in trace amounts for plant growth and potentially the adaptive strategies of some plants may be minimising the uptake of cr and ni dalcorso et al 2014 shanker et al 2005 in dual mode operation 3 3 impact of alternating water sources on outflow concentrations figs 4 7 highlight the variation in median concentrations over the duration of the experiment for brevity a selection of plant species are shown ranging from least to most effective with the remaining data provided in the supplementary material figs s1 s4 minimal practical differences were noted for tss bod5 toc and doc outflow concentrations across the alternating water sources fig 4 this is logical as tss removal is largely dependent on mechanical straining provided by the filter media and bod5 removal is dependent on aerobic degradation in the upper media layers in contrast tp tdp and frp outflow concentrations fig 5 for all designs were significantly impacted all fmt p 0 05 except l japonica for frp fmt p 0 060 tp outflow concentrations decreased following stormwater dosing in mixed mode second sampling event and decreased for all designs under greywater only inflows in the third sampling event this is understandable when viewed in relation to the equilibrium reactions of adsorption and precipitation important processes for phosphorus treatment within biofilters decreasing and increasing in accordance with the availability of phosphorus in the stormwater and greywater inflow respectively following the switch back to mixed mode fourth event outflow concentrations for effective plant species e g c appressa and c x generalis were largely unchanged while higher outflow concentrations were observed for less effective plant species e g p australis and p tenax of note is the general decrease in tp tdp and frp outflow concentrations between the two greywater only sampling events first and third events or alternatively between the two mixed sampling events second and fourth events this decreasing trend may be related to decreased loads with the columns subjected to lower phosphorus loading rates than in greywater only mode ultimately the results suggest that despite significant differences in outflow concentrations good performing plant species e g c appressa and c x generalis are able to reduce tp tdp and frp irrespective of the water source changes in dop outflow concentrations were significant for most designs fmt p 0 05 and mostly decreased across the alternating water sources fig 5 good tp removal did not necessarily correlate with good dop removal with some plant species leaching dop but maintaining tp treatment across the alternating water sources e g c x generalis p jasminoides and c appressa as dop accounted for 2 19 of inflow tp across the first four sampling events these results may be attributed to organic phosphorus not being as bioavailable as inorganic phosphorus all designs maintained tn treatment fig 6 following the initial stormwater dosing sampling event two with tn concentration removal high 70 across most plant species however it did vary significantly across most designs and the alternate water sources fmt p 0 05 with c appressa p 0 118 and s nicolai p 0 106 the exceptions this variation exhibited no consistent pattern for instance while c x generalis showed increased tn concentrations in mixed mode p australis had lower concentrations the pattern of tdn removal across operational modes closely resembled tn which is not surprising as tn was mostly in dissolved form 73 86 while significant changes in nh3 outflow concentrations were recorded across the alternating water sources for the majority of designs fmt p 0 05 in practicality they remained relatively stable for most plant species this suggests there may be a processing limit for plant species which is further evidenced by c appressa with and without a carbon source recording negligible nh3 across switching events nox removal was highly variable with all designs experiencing significant differences across the alternating water sources fmt p 0 05 except s nicolai p 0 069 and non vegetated p 0 058 leaching of nox was observed for p tenax p australis and non vegetated columns across all four events highlighting the importance of including effective plant species for nox removal in dual mode biofilters fig 7 shows the variation in outflow concentrations of heavy metals across the sampling events pb 0 003 mg l and zn 0 037 mg l outflow concentrations were consistently low across plant species suggesting minimal impact from the alternating inflows in contrast cr cu mn and ni concentrations showed greater variation all designs recorded significant differences in mn and ni outflow concentrations across the alternating inflows fmt p 0 05 except l japonica p 0 050 and p 0 060 respectively changes in outflow cu concentrations between sampling events were significant for c appressa fmt p 0 021 c x generalis fmt p 0 008 s nicolai fmt p 0 019 and no carbon source fmt p 0 015 however all these designs maintained similar outflow concentrations across the alternating inflows suggesting minimal practical significance 3 4 impact of the extended dry period on treatment performance mean bod5 and tss concentrations fig 4 were higher for all designs following the extended dry period and this was significant for half the designs wsr p 0 05 hatt et al 2007 reported minimal differences in tss removal between wetting and drying events due to mechanical straining being the primary mechanism for its removal however their study was undertaken indoors and used narrow non vegetated columns and thus would have experienced low evapotranspiration the presence of vegetation and higher evapotranspiration in the current experiment would result in faster drying the lower removals may be a result of macropore development within the filter media creating preferential flow paths and leaching due to desiccation microbial death and root die off some of the largest differences in tss removal were associated with c x generalis and c appressa two of the better performing species for tp removal it is hypothesised that accelerated drying may have occurred with these species due to higher water needs all designs leached tp except c x generalis following the extended dry period fig 5 likely due to microbial death and the release of cell bound phosphorus kinsman costello et al 2016 turner and haygarth 2001 this hypothesis is supported by the leaching of dop and pp upon re wetting by all designs except c appressa with and without a carbon source for pp while c x generalis and l japonica were the only designs to report lower frp concentrations following the extended dry period overall plant species that performed well under wet conditions were best able to cope with the extended dry period by either maintaining some phosphorus treatment or minimising leaching e g c x generalis and c appressa suggesting their adaptive strategies are ideal for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters most designs saw significant increases in outflow tn concentration fig 6 following the extended dry period wsr p 0 05 in comparison to tp half the designs maintained tn treatment upon re wetting and the decrease in inflow concentration the increase in outflow concentrations of nitrogen following extended dry periods is not uncommon hatt et al 2007 payne et al 2014b and has been linked to microbial death and the release of cell bound nitrogen baldwin and mitchell 2000 decreased denitrification baldwin and mitchell 2000 along with changes in aerobic anaerobic processing within the biofilter sexstone et al 1988 while other nitrogen species mostly did not register significant differences wsr p 0 05 nox concentrations were significantly larger for most designs wsr p 0 05 perhaps due to biological processing slowing during the dry period anecdotally some plants became noticeably stressed browning of foliage during the extended dry period particularly c appressa it is plausible that the high growth rate and dense root system of c appressa that contribute to it being a good performer under normal conditions may be the same reason it suffers during dry periods read et al 2008 as it has higher water needs that said at the conclusion of the experiment outflow concentrations from most designs were commensurate with starting values suggesting effective recovery following the extended dry period 3 5 influence of a carbon source on treatment performance there were no significant differences in load reductions across the entire experiment for sediment all forms of nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon bod5 cu pb mn and zn between the designs with and without a carbon source all mwu p 0 05 high removal of pb and zn for biofilters with and without a carbon zone in the sz aligns with previous stormwater biofiltration studies blecken et al 2009 however there were significant differences for some heavy metals cr mwu p 0 016 and ni mwu p 0 016 with the design without a carbon source providing higher load removals in each case the greater differentiation in cr and ni removal between the carbon source and no carbon source design may relate to the adaptive strategy of c appressa c appressa is highly effective at removing nutrients with or without a carbon source in contrast with the inclusion of a carbon source c appressa provided the lowest cr and second lowest ni removal compared to other plant species however with no carbon source the load removal of ni and cr by c appressa increased significantly and aligned with other plant species this highlights a plant pollutant interaction effect between nutrients and other elements required in trace amounts for plant growth with the processing of cr and ni by c appressa diminishing in a carbon abundant environment as such the impact of a carbon source in the sz on the removal of heavy metals by different plant species especially those highly effective at nutrient removal should be further explored in biofiltration research minimal practical differences in outflow concentrations were noted across the alternating water sources it is hypothesised that the maturity of the systems approximately two years old by the end of this experiment may have contributed to these results perhaps through the increased root mass that comes with age and the release of carbon from root exudates and hence the growth of microorganisms in the rhizosphere farrar et al 2003 with a carbon source in the sz expected to be more beneficial in the formative years however as this experiment was constrained in testing all designs with and without a carbon source there is uncertainty as to the transferability of this finding to all plant species previous studies suggest that the inclusion of a carbon source in the sz should minimise differences in treatment performance between plant species payne et al 2014b zhang et al 2011 therefore not including a carbon source would likely have increased differences between plant species in our experiment while incoming greywater may provide sufficient biodegradable organics to enhance denitrification without a carbon source there is scope to further scrutinise the carbon source addition for dual mode biofilters future experiments could explore the influence of a carbon source on treatment performance and its interaction with a range of plant species utilising designs with and without the addition the benefit of a carbon source may become more pronounced under higher nitrogen inflows which may increase nitrification denitrification processing as opposed to plant assimilation payne et al 2014a 4 conclusions the results demonstrate the potential for dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters as an alternative to single mode systems as they can provide effective treatment along with greater volumes of treated water while maintaining system performance throughout the year the slowing of infiltration rates through mixed mode and recovery following the extended dry period suggest stages of periodic rest may be required particularly during wet seasons to maintain hydraulic performance and minimise interstitial clogging of dual mode biofilters high removal of tss bod5 toc doc and some heavy metals were reported across designs with the careful selection of plant species dual mode biofilters can provide effective treatment of nitrogen and phosphorus irrespective of the water source s this finding was consolidated following the extended dry period with effective plant species c appressa and c x generalis providing removal and or minimising net leaching removal of tss by designs containing generally good plant species for nutrient removal were more adversely affected following the extended dry period compared to other designs comparison of the wet and dry periods results suggest that while short rest periods are important for maintaining infiltration capacity dual mode biofilters utilising understory and climbing ornamentals should not be exposed to long dry periods no practical significance for the inclusion of a carbon source in the sz was found this is attributed to the use of c appressa in the examination and the release of carbon from root exudates and hence the growth of microorganisms in the rhizosphere in mature systems the benefit of a carbon source may be more pronounced under higher nitrogen inflows where nitrification denitrification processing may increase as opposed to plant assimilation as this experiment focussed on key contaminants future work should focus on other pollutants and their long term fate under dual mode operation e g surfactants and metals for greywater along with hydrocarbons and pesticides for stormwater analysis of microorganism and pathogen removal will be crucial across both water sources to allay potential risks associated with this novel technology future work will need to focus on the complex interactions between inflow volumes frequency and pollutant concentrations on the treatment performance of dual mode stormwater greywater biofilters including different operational modes and across longer timeframes system recovery following extended dry periods using greywater or mixed mode should also be explored declaration

18801,water disinfection can result in the unintended formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps which have been the subject of intensive investigation over the past 40 years robust methods for evaluating and characterizing the formation of halogenated dbps are prerequisites for ultimately controlling the formation of dbps and ensuring quality and safe disinfected water only a fraction of the total organic halogen tox formed during disinfection has been chemically identified or even well characterized by the classical derivatization gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms method such a method may not be amenable to the detection of polar halogenated dbps which constitute a major portion of the tox that is still unaccounted for accordingly a novel precursor ion scan pis method using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was developed for the rapid selective detection of all polar halogenated dbps no matter whether the dbps are known or unknown in water this article reviews recent literature on the application of the pis method for evaluating the occurrence formation and control of polar halogenated dbps in disinfected waters the challenges in developing the pis method were briefly summarized application of the powerful method pinpointed 150 previously unknown dbps and revealed the formation speciation and transformation of halogenated dbps in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluents and swimming pool water for the same source water positive correlations were found between the total ion intensity tii levels in the pis spectra of m z 35 79 126 9 and the total organic chlorine bromine iodine levels in the disinfected water sample and a disinfected sample with a higher tii level generally showed a higher toxic potency accordingly the tii value can be used as a surrogate to comparatively reflect the water quality and assess the efficiency of a dbp control approach to achieve a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the dbp compositions in different waters and thus better control the dbp formation and reduce their overall toxicity topics for future work were discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts dbps precursor ion scan mass spectrometry water quality 1 introduction to inactivate pathogens and prevent waterborne diseases disinfection is a necessary process in drinking water treatment and it is widely applied in treating wastewater effluent as well as swimming pool water shannon et al 2008 sedlak and von gunten 2011 weaver et al 2009 krasner et al 2009 li et al 2018b disinfection is also essential for ballast water discharged by ships to reduce the spread of invasive species for seawater in membrane based desalination plants to control biofouling and for desalinated water to prevent pathogen contamination werschkun et al 2012 kim et al 2015 fabbricino et al 2019 but as chemical disinfectants can react with different types of organic matter including natural organic matter effluent organic matter microorganisms algal toxins and anthropogenic contaminants a wide range of unintended disinfection byproducts dbps can be created during disinfection richardson et al 2007 xie 2003 krasner et al 2006 yan et al 2014 gonsior et al 2014 bond and graham 2017 hua et al 2014 he et al 2018 hu et al 2018a fang et al 2018 li and mitch 2018 sun et al 2019 since many studies have shown that dbps may cause adverse health effects and pose a risk to the environment dbps are of increasing concern to the general public and researchers alike wendel et al 2016 stalter et al 2016a yang et al 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 hou et al 2018 postigo et al 2017 although toxicological data suggest that many known dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic or carcinogenic epidemiological studies have revealed that known dbps cannot fully account for the increased adverse health effects induced by consumption of drinking water wang et al 2016 therefore identifying unknown dbps and characterizing the composition of dbp mixtures are necessary for pinpointing dbps of epidemiological relevance ever since the first dbp trichloromethane was identified gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms has been used as an effective tool for uncovering new dbps in the past many years mainly because the technique is straightforward and dbps can be identified by comparing the mass spectral ions of unknown dbps against data from large mass spectral libraries richardson et al 2007 richardson and postigo 2016 plewa et al 2017 for instance a new group of nitrogenous dbps chlorophenylacetonitriles has been recently identified in disinfected drinking waters by gc ms zhang et al 2018a moreover gc ms has been commonly used for quantification analysis of volatile semivolatile dbps with known structures e g halonitromethanes haloacetaldehydes and iodinated trihalomethanes thms yang et al 2019 however only a portion of the total organic halogen tox formed during disinfection has been chemically identified or even well characterized by derivatization gc ms krasner et al 2006 such a technique may not be amenable to the detection of highly polar dbps i e dbps containing one or more hydrophilic functional groups such as cooh oh o cho and nh2 or fully or partially present as molecular ions in water which may constitute a significant portion of the tox that is still unaccounted for zhang and minear 2002 li et al 2017a b wang et al 2015 instead liquid chromatography lc ms ms and related techniques have been increasingly used to study polar dbps over the last decade richardson and postigo 2018 in 2005 zhang et al reported that precursor ion scan pis a unique scanning mode in electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi ms ms can be used as an effective tool for the selective detection of chlorinated dbps in two follow up studies zhang s group reported the rapid detection of highly polar brominated and iodinated dbps by performing piss of bromide and iodide at m z 79 81 and 126 9 respectively zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 with such a powerful method numerous polar halogenated dbps have been revealed to form in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluent and recreational water and dozens of them were identified for the first time zhai and zhang 2011 xiao et al 2012 pan et al 2016a gong and zhang 2015 han et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 2016 notably many of the newly identified dbps are toxicologically important dbps as they contain bromine iodine and or nitrogen in their structures previously in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity tests have demonstrated that brominated and iodinated dbps are generally significantly more toxic than their chlorinated analogues and nitrogenous dbps are generally significantly more toxic than their carbonaceous analogues richardson and ternes 2014 plewa et al 2008 in addition the newly identified dbps can be classified into aliphatic dbps e g halomaleic acids and trihalomethanols and aromatic dbps e g 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 2 5 dibromohydroquinone and tetrabromopyrrole liberatore et al 2017 evaluated the comparative in vitro cytotoxicity of four iodophenolic dbps 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 4 iodo 2 methylphenol which were formed in chloraminated oil and gas wastewaters all the four iodophenolic dbps were cytotoxic and 2 4 6 triiodophenol was more toxic than most haloacetic acids haas and all thms recently two bromophenolic dbps 4 bromophenol and 2 4 dibromophenol were demonstrated to bind with human serum albumin using spectroscopic techniques and a molecular docking method zhang et al 2019 two in vivo toxicity studies using a heterotrophic polychaete platynereis dumerilii and an autotrophic alga tetraselmis marina yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 evaluated the comparative toxicity of the newly identified aromatic dbps and commonly known aliphatic dbps indicating that aromatic halogenated dbps generally present tens to hundreds times higher developmental toxicity and growth inhibition than aliphatic halogenated dbps besides both in vivo toxicity studies showed that the newly identified dbps were also ranked in the decreasing order of toxic potency i e iodinated dbps brominated analogues chlorinated analogues in a follow up study tetrabromopyrrole an aromatic and heterocyclic dbp was shown to be over 8000 times more developmentally toxic than bromoacetic acid yang and zhang 2014 li s group also demonstrated that halobenzoquinones were up to 200 times more developmentally toxic in zebrafish embryos than haloacetic acids wang et al 2018 therefore both in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies have indicated that polar halogenated dbps are of significant concern this review aims to 1 describe the development of the pis method 2 summarize the application of the method to the detection identification formation transformation and control of polar halogenated dbps in different water matrices e g drinking water wastewater effluent and swimming pool water and 3 discuss topics for future work to better evaluate and thus help to improve water quality in terms of controlling dbps 2 development of the pis method 2 1 principle of the pis mode the element chlorine has two natural isotopes 35cl and 37cl and their probabilities of occurrence are 75 77 and 24 23 respectively rosenbaum et al 2000 after electrospray ionization esi a compound containing one chlorine atom should generate two molecular ions separated by two m z units in the esi ms full scan spectra and the abundance ratio of the two ions is approximately 3 1 also compounds containing different numbers of chlorine atoms should present different isotope patterns such distinct isotope patterns may be helpful in spotting chlorinated dbps however as matrices of water samples mainly organic matter are generally complex and they coexist with numerous dbps to form a mixture an esi ms full scan spectrum of a chlorinated water sample could contain hundreds to thousands of ions distributed on almost every mass unit zhang et al 2004 the isotope patterns of chlorine containing compounds tend to be hidden by nonhalogenated molecular ions in full scan spectra fortunately by using product ion scans in tandem mass spectrometry a standard chlorine containing compound can readily generate a fragment chlorine ion which can be viewed as the fingerprint of the chlorine containing compound zhang et al 2004 however to confirm whether each ion observed in the ms full scan spectrum is a chlorinated dbp conducting product ion scans is laborious time consuming and impractical for detecting chlorinated dbps in real water samples later zhang et al 2005 realized that a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tqms has a useful ms ms mode pis also known as parent ion scan there are three quadrupoles in the tqms the first mass analyzer q1 the collision cell q2 used for collision induced dissociation and the second mass analyzer q3 in the pis mode compounds in a test sample are ionized by esi and the molecular ions first pass through q1 one by one each molecular ion then collides with the inert argon gas in q2 to produce fragment ions q3 is set to pass only a specific fragment ion and so only those compounds that can generate the pre selected fragment ion can be detected as mentioned earlier chlorine containing compounds have been found to generate chloride ions in the product ion scan when sufficient energy is imposed to break the c cl bond zhang et al 2004 to investigate whether the pis mode can be used in selective detection of chlorinated dbps in a mixture the pis was conducted for a standard sample consisting of three chlorine containing compounds and one chlorine free compound zhang et al 2005 as the chlorine free compound could not generate the fragment ions m z 35 and 37 only the peaks representing the three chlorine containing compounds were observed in the pis spectra of m z 35 and 37 with 2 unit difference thus by setting m z 35 and 37 the pis mode can be used as an effective tool for selectively detecting electrospray ionizable chlorinated dbps in a mixture 2 2 method development in two follow up studies zhang s group reported the rapid selective detection of highly polar brominated and iodinated dbps by conducting piss of m z 79 81 and 126 9 respectively as bromine and iodine have natural isotopes 79br 81br and 126 9i respectively zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 since key instrumental parameters such as cone voltage also known as source cone potential and collision energy may influence the esi tqms piss significantly they were examined with standard solutions haloacids for piss of m z 79 and 81 iodine containing acids and phenols for pis of m z 126 9 although increasing the cone voltage can increase the molecular ion intensities some molecular ions decomposed at the sample cone when the cone voltage was set above a certain level leading to the formation of fake molecular ions e g m z 219 corresponding to c6h4i o originating from hooc c6h3i o with m z 263 due to decarboxylation these fake molecular ions can prejudice the detection of halogenated dbps accordingly cone voltages between 15 and 20 v are recommended for conducting the piss the optimum collision energy depends on analytes generally a high collision energy is required for conducting piss of m z 35 37 to maximize cl intensities during the collision induced decomposition e g 40 ev for dichloroacetic acid while a relatively low collision energy is favorable for the detection of bromine containing compounds with piss of m z 79 81 e g 10 25 ev for bromine containing acetic acids because the c cl and c br bonds are stronger and shorter than the c i bond the optimum collision energy for detecting iodine containing compounds with pis of m z 126 9 is lower than that for detecting brominated or chlorinated analogs furthermore the optimum collision energy for detecting an iodine containing compound increases almost proportionally to the increase in the molecular weight mw of the compound therefore to screen for iodinated dbps a moderate collision energy e g 30 ev is usually applied an alternative is to choose two collision energies i e a high collision energy e g 40 ev for detecting high mw compounds and a low collision energy e g 20 ev for detecting low mw compounds notably when pis of m z 126 9 is conducted ions with m z 171 and 127 corresponding to two commonly known dbps chlorobromoacetic acid clbrchcooh and dichloroacetic acid cl2chcooh can also be seen in the spectra because the m z values of clbrch generated from the decarboxylation of clbrchcoo and cl2chcoo are 127 the interference of cl2chcoo can be readily excluded as cl2chcoo tends to dissociate to cl2ch and cl at collision energies exceeding 15 ev to preclude the interference of clbrch a relatively high collision energy e g 40 ev can be used to conduct pis m z 126 9 an alternative would be to conduct pis m z 128 9 to differentiate the interference of clbrch as clbrch containing molecular ions can be detected by pis m z 128 9 while iodinated dbps cannot after optimization of the instrumental parameters disinfected drinking water samples with complex matrices including two real drinking water samples and two simulated chlor am inated water samples were also analyzed to validate the method zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 it should be mentioned that with esi a soft ionization technique besides molecular ions m h adducts dimers 2m h of polar dbps may be formed through hydrogen bonding especially for acidic dbps with low pka values e g haas the ions of haa adducts dimers with relatively high m z values may overlap with the molecular ions corresponding to high mw dbps thus increasing the difficulty in identifying new halogenated dbps although dilution can reduce the formation of haa adducts dimers it also decreases the ion intensities of unknown dbps whose concentrations are generally significantly lower than those of haas instead zhai and zhang 2009 developed a method to differentiate the adducts dimers of haas from real halogenated dbps with high mws by setting piss of m z values corresponding to the molecular ions of haas at cone voltage 15 v and collision energy 5 10 ev the adducts dimers of haas in water samples can be selectively detected and increasing the cone voltage can cause the adduct dimer ions to become barely detectable these adducts dimers can be further confirmed using product ion scans because only the adduct dimer ions can generate molecular ions of haas as fragments this method may be extended to find the adducts dimers of other highly polar dbps 3 theoretical calculation of the abundance ratios of isotopic ions shown in pis spectra because the isotopic patterns of halogen containing compounds are essential to interpret the ms spectra the theoretical calculation of the abundance ratios of isotopic ions shown in pis spectra is discussed in this section as br and cl are di isotopic and i is monoisotopic a compound containing m n and p atoms of br cl and i respectively consists of m n 1 ions in a full scan the relative abundance of each isotopic ion in the full scan can be calculated by equation 1 zhang et al 2008 1 a n f u l l k max n n 1 0 min n 1 m c m k c n n k 1 3 n k 1 where a n f u l l is the relative abundance of the nth isotopic ion in the full scan k is any integer between max n n 1 0 and min n 1 m and c m k and c n n k 1 are the binomial coefficients the relative abundance of the nth isotopic ion in the piss of m z 79 81 and 126 9 can be calculated by equations 2 4 respectively zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 2 a n p r e 79 k max n n 1 0 min n 1 m c m k c n n k 1 3 n k 1 m k 3 a n p r e 81 k max n n 1 0 min n 1 m c m k c n n k 1 3 n k 1 k 4 a n p r e 126 9 k max n n 1 0 min n 1 m c m k c n n k 1 3 n k 1 the derivation of equations 1 4 was reported in detail previously zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 once the relative abundance of each isotopic ion in a spectrum is obtained the theoretical abundance ratio of all the isotopic ions shown in the spectrum can be calculated by comparing the theoretical and observed abundance ratios of the isotopic ions in the pis spectra the numbers of br and cl atoms in a halogen containing compound can be determined notably although pis of m z 126 9 can indicate whether the compound contains iodine or not the number of i atoms in the compound cannot be determined this is because i has only one natural isotope and the number of i atoms p is not involved in the above equations since calculations based on the above equations are usually tedious an alternative and much simpler method was developed by performing multiplication of combinations of abundance ratios this method can be used for predicting the abundance ratios of the isotopic ions in a full scan or pis spectrum for a compound containing two br one cl and one i fig 1 shows the procedure for calculating the abundance ratios of the isotopic ions in a full scan and piss of m z 79 81 35 and 37 because i is monoisotopic the combination of isotopic ions in the full scan should be expressed as 79br 81br 79br 81br 35cl 37cl which actually can be viewed as the multiplication of the isotopic ratios of the three halogen atoms i e 1 1 1 1 3 1 when the abundance ratio of ions is considered the multiplication 1 1 1 1 3 1 can be performed in two steps for 1 1 1 1 the numbers are multiplied in sequence and the product is added to obtain the ratio of 1 2 1 then 1 2 1 is multiplied by 3 1 to obtain the final ratio of 3 7 5 1 which also indicates that the compound should show four ions in the full scan fig 1a the isotopic pattern in pis of m z 126 9 should be the same as that in the full scan when pis at m z 79 or 81 was conducted one of the br atoms in the compound can be regarded as a monoisotope as molecular ions containing the 81br or 79br fragment from that br atom cannot be detected thus multiplication of the isotopic ratios 1 1 3 1 1 1 can be simplified to 1 1 3 1 1 fig 1b it should be mentioned that to obtain the isotopic ratio in either pis of m z 79 or 81 it suffices to calculate 1 1 3 1 i e the first step as the ratio obtained is multiplied by a constant in the second step however to compare the abundances of the nth isotopic ion in the piss of m z 79 and 81 the ratio must be multiplied by the constant the calculated results demonstrate three isotopic ions with abundance ratio of 3 4 1 in the pis spectrum of m z 79 i e m m 2 m 4 and in the pis spectrum of m z 81 i e m 2 m 4 m 6 the abundance ratio of the nth isotopic ion occurring in the pis of m z 79 and 81 is 1 1 as shown in fig 1c three isotopic ions with abundance ratio of 1 2 1 should occur in the pis spectrum of m z 35 i e m m 2 m 4 and in the pis spectrum of m z 37 i e m 2 m 4 m 6 the abundance ratio of the nth isotopic ion in the pis of m z 35 and 37 is 3 1 based on the alternative method two more examples of how to calculate the abundance ratios of isotopic ions shown in the full scan and pis spectra are illustrated in the supplementary information si 4 application of the pis method for evaluating the occurrence formation and control of dbps in disinfected waters 4 1 sample pretreatment to optimize instrument parameters relatively high concentrations of standard compounds were adopted and standard samples were directly analyzed without sample pretreatment however individual dbps in actual water samples often occur at trace levels sub ng l μg l yang and zhang 2013 wang et al 2016 pan et al 2017 their matrices are generally complex and inorganic ions in such matrices could reduce the esi efficiency for organic analytes therefore to increase the concentrations of analytes to above the detection limits of instruments and to eliminate the effects of inorganic ions it is essential to perform sample pretreatment prior to the pis analysis liquid liquid extraction lle is a commonly adopted method to extract polar halogenated dbps from water because highly polar dbps are believed to contain carboxyl and or phenolic anions and a low ph is propitious to those dbps for keeping them in the neutral form acidification of water samples to ph 0 5 and addition of na2so4 as a salting out agent at a water to na2so4 ratio of 10 1 w w were the first two steps of sample pretreatment notably addition of concentrated sulfuric acid 98 wt may cause the temperature of a water sample to rise significantly and thus could induce the decomposition of analytes so diluted aqueous sulfuric acid 70 v v was used for ph adjustment zhai et al 2014 then methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was added to the water sample at an mtbe to water ratio of 1 10 v v after separation in a separatory funnel the organic layer 70 of the mtbe volume added was transferred to an erlenmeyer flask since the organic layer in the erlenmeyer flask still contained a tiny amount of water which contained high levels of inorganic salts and suppressed the ms signals of organic halogenated dbps it was kept overnight at 4 c in a refrigerator then the tiny water droplets deposited at the bottom of the erlenmeyer flask was removed and the organic layer was transferred to a rotary evaporator to concentrate to 0 5 ml next another solvent acetonitrile was added for solvent exchange from mtbe to acetonitrile zhang et al 2008 with such pretreatment the recoveries for determining polar phenolic halogenated dbps were generally above 90 pan et al 2017 xiao et al 2012 yang and zhang 2013 solid phase extraction spe was also used in sample pretreatment for determination of polar iodinated dbps including two iodinated haas and four aromatic iodinated dbps and the recoveries ranged from 70 to 110 hu et al 2018b stalter et al 2016b reported that compared with ten other sorbents spe with telos env cartridges performed superior in extracting nonvolatile dbps with a tox recovery of 70 the concentrated solution in acetonitrile was stored at 4 c prior to sample analysis the solution was diluted with ultrapure water at a ratio of 1 1 v v and filtered with a 0 22 μm ptfe membrane using a syringe filter once the solution was diluted with ultrapure water the sample was analyzed immediately or else hydrolysis of certain dbps could occur the filtration was performed after dilution liu et al 2015 if it was performed before dilution then due to the change in solubility with solvent mixing the filtered solution in acetonitrile might reprecipitate solids with the addition of ultrapure water especially if the sample had a complex matrix e g a chlorinated wastewater effluent sample the concentration factor adopted in sample pretreatment was chosen based on the original analyte concentrations and the sample matrix for instance for brominated dbp analysis a 1000 fold concentration factor was sufficient for the pretreatment of simulated drinking water samples prepared with natural organic matter humic acid fulvic acid and relatively high levels of bromide zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 whereas a 2000 or even 4000 fold concentration factor was needed for real drinking water samples as their matrices were generally more complex pan et al 2017 liu et al 2015 generally sample volumes of 1 0 4 0 l were required to obtain a 1 ml concentrated solution for the pis analysis a special case reported by yang and zhang 2014 is that the concentration factor of chlorinated wastewater effluent samples should not exceed 100 fold for halogenated pyrroles as target dbps due to the presence of nitrite in the wastewater effluent sample halogenated pyrroles were readily converted to halonitropyrroles during sample pretreatment when a high concentration factor was used pang et al 2013 also adopted the pis approach to detect the brominated oxidation products of the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a using potassium permanganate and they analyzed the water samples without pre concentration spiking the synthetic water with a high initial concentration of tetrabromobisphenol a is one prerequisite for accurate measurement without pre concentration besides since the lc retention times of inorganic ions are considerably shorter than those of the organic analytes in the non pretreated water samples the effluent containing inorganic ions from the lc column outlet can be diverted to waste instead of the ms inlet with the help of a switching valve doing so would eliminate the interference of inorganic ions to ms analysis therefore in cases where samples contain high levels of organic analytes with relatively simple matrices and the available lc ms instruments are equipped with the switching valve sample pretreatment involving extraction may be omitted 4 2 lc separation when samples are injected into the mass spectrometer through direct infusion molecular ions of different compounds may partially or fully overlap in the mass spectra but those compounds may have different retention times on an lc column accordingly to facilitate the ms detection of individual dbps lc was coupled to mass spectrometry for pre separation the waters hss t3 column with the most universal reversed phase sorbent is designed to separate polar organic compounds dahl et al 2012 and it has been commonly applied to separate polar dbps in reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc ding et al 2009 zhai et al 2014 a waters xbridge c18 column was used in high performance liquid chromatography hplc to separate tetrabromobisphenol a and its oxidation products pang et al 2013 mainly because the column sorbent with the trifunctionally bonded c18 ligand as a workhorse can provide conventional and universal lc separation without loss of efficiency marín et al 2014 typically a gradient eluent consisting of either acetonitrile water or methanol water was applied table s1 the methanol water eluent was better in separating most of the polar brominated dbps than the acetonitrile water eluent zhai and zhang 2011 while the acetonitrile water eluent was frequently used in separating iodinated dbps ding and zhang 2009 gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016c as the separation efficiency of hplc is lower than that of uplc hplc separation requires a much longer analysis time around 50 min than uplc analysis 15 min or less because the fast separation of uplc leads to narrow chromatographic peaks the coupled mass spectrometry should have sufficient scan speed to obtain enough data points across the narrow peaks yang et al 2011 foti et al 2013 4 3 detection and identification of new polar halogenated dbps 4 3 1 new polar halogenated dbps selectively detected by the pis method by combining pairs of ions clusters in the pis spectra of m z 79 and 81 all electrospray ionizable brominated dbps can be selectively detected in water samples similarly selective detection of electrospray ionizable chlorinated and iodinated dbps can be achieved by piss of m z 35 37 and 126 9 respectively although the pis method can selectively detect halogen containing compounds and provide m z values of corresponding molecular ions it cannot directly provide exact structural information a series of alternative techniques may be used to complete the structural identification nevertheless the pis method is immensely useful for the selective detection of halogen containing ions clusters and it is the first step in targeting and differentiating new polar halogenated dbps for instance ion cluster m z 378 380 382 384 was initially revealed as a predominant ion cluster in the pis spectrum of m z 79 of a chlorinated saline effluent sample further identification and subsequent toxicity bioassay demonstrated that the ion cluster was tetrabromopyrrole a new dbp with extremely high toxicity yang and zhang 2014 up to now the pis method has been successfully applied in selectively detecting polar halogenated dbps in disinfected water samples with different matrices including simulated drinking water ding and zhang 2009 xiao et al 2010 zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 zhai et al 2014 real tap water liu et al 2015 pan et al 2015 swimming pool water xiao et al 2012 sewage effluents ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 and activated sludge samples cai et al 2016 2017 this pis method can also aid in the identification of new groups of dbps indirectly for instance five fully brominated dbps were detected with pis m z 79 and 81 and then identified in chlorinated wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2013 believed that the chlorinated iodinated and monobromo dibromo analogues of the five fully brominated dbps might also form in chlorinated wastewater effluents but the concentrations of those analogues could be too low to be clearly shown in the pis spectra accordingly based on the identification of the five fully brominated dbps seven new halogenated dbps namely 4 bromophenol 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde and 2 5 dibromohydroquinone were identified with the more sensitive multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode table 1 lists 159 ion clusters observed by using the pis method and most of them are new polar halogenated dbps that were initially detected by the pis method and later identified with additional techniques e g product ion scan and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms the representatives are shown in fig 2 more details regarding those halogenated dbps are summarized in table s1 recently hrms and ultrahigh resolution ms e g fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ms have been used in detecting new dbps gonsior et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 zhang and yang 2018 yang and zhang 2016 kolkman et al 2015 postigo et al 2016 gallidabino et al 2018 kosyakov et al 2017 negreira et al 2016 matsushita et al 2016 however although unambiguous molecular formulas can be obtained based on accurate mass measurements structures of those formulas are still unknown by comparing the m z values of those formulas with the m z values in table 1 it can be quickly determined whether those formulas correspond to known or unknown halogenated dbps 4 3 2 identification of dbps detected by the pis method after the esi tqms pis spectra of m z values corresponding to halogen specific ions were acquired the ions clusters with relatively high intensities especially the prominent ones were further studied by the product ion scans to reveal their possible structures frequently observed product ions included x x 35cl 37cl 79br 81br or 126 9i m coo indicating the presence of carboxyl group m co indicating the presence of cho and m x or m hx confirming the presence of halogen notably the observation of the product ion m x instead of m hx might suggest the absence of a hydrogen atom in the molecular ion zhang et al 2008 mrm is not only a highly sensitive and selective mode used for quantitating target compounds evans et al 2009 it can also provide additional information for proposing a structure to be specific by setting certain transitions of molecular ions to halide ions the number of bromine chlorine atoms and the existence of iodine atoms can be further confirmed based on the isotopic abundance ratios of transition ions besides a previous study has shown a direct relationship between retention times rts of halogen containing compounds and their structures i e the rt ranges of halogenated aliphatic acids benzoic acids and phenols were 0 2 5 2 5 6 0 and 6 0 8 0 min respectively for the given uplc eluent program zhai and zhang 2011 accordingly the mrm mode was used to obtain the specific rt which enabled the analytes to be roughly classified and provided important information for tentative identification generally a proposed structure can be confirmed by matching its rt isotopic abundance ratio of the mrm transition ions and characteristic fragment ions in the product ion scan spectra to the corresponding authentic standard compound the matrix effect of a pretreated sample may cause a slight difference between the rts of the target analyte and the standard compound to verify whether the difference arises from the sample matrix effect the pretreated sample can be spiked with the standard compound if no additional peak is observed in the chromatogram of the spiked sample and the intensity of the original peak increases noticeably it can be confirmed that the rt difference is caused by the sample matrix effect and the proposed structure is identified for a compound with no commercially available standard its identification can be achieved by using a standard compound synthesized in the laboratory an appropriate compound that is a precursor of the target compound is commonly reacted with halogen to synthesize the halogen containing standard compound zhai et al 2014 for instance yang and zhang 2014 reported that the reaction of pyrrole and bromine in the mtbe ethanol medium at 0 c generated tetrabromopyrrole a new dbp formed during the chlorine disinfection of a saline wastewater effluent and the purified product was used for the identification and quantification of tetrabromopyrrole however sometimes the synthesized mixture may be too complex to isolate a pure compound or there is so little of the isolated compound that it simply cannot be weighed under such a circumstance the synthesized mixture is injected into uplc and the fraction corresponding to the target compound is collected such injections and fraction collections are repeated many times to obtain a sufficient volume of the solution which is subjected to tox measurement to calculate the concentration of the target compound finally the samples are spiked with the solution for quantification of the newly identified dbp gong and zhang 2015 alternatively high throughput purification using a preparative column chromatographic system may be an ideal choice to obtain sufficient amounts of purified standards leister et al 2003 hrms is another powerful technique to facilitate the identification of polar halogenated dbps e g 2 4 6 tribromoresorcinol and trihalo hydroxy cyclopentene diones detected by the pis method zhai et al 2014 pan et al 2016a as the mass resolution of the tqms is relatively low and an ion cluster may have more than one composition the isobaric ions could bias the compositional interpretation of new polar dbps chang et al 2017 instead an hrms analysis allows the m z values of a target compound to be accurately determined by comparing the mass errors shown in parts per million ppm between the theoretical and measured accurate m z values of the candidate elemental formula the formula of a new polar dbp can be assigned a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm will confirm the formula unambiguously callahan et al 2011 peterson et al 2012 for a fully identified dbp its concentration in a water sample can be determined using the selected ion recording sir mode or the mrm mode as reported by ding et al 2013 and pan et al 2017 it should be mentioned that without further optimization to choose more suitable product ions in mrm transitions the two studies used halogen ions as product ions for quantitative analysis however product ions set in mrm transitions for quantifying halogenated dbps are not always halogen ions instead the more abundant product ions may be chosen for quantitative analysis for example under the mrm mode m cooh was more suitable than halogen ions for the analysis of most haas duan et al 2011 while m h hcl co was set as the product ion in the analysis of two new aromatic dbps 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone and 2 6 dichloro 3 methyl 1 4 benzoquinone zhao et al 2010 therefore to obtain a lower limit of detection and a lower limit of quantification it is recommended to select suitable product ions in mrm transitions instead of using halogen ions for quantifying halogenated dbps since matrix effects could lead to signal suppression and isotope labeled standard compounds are usually unavailable the standard addition method is generally used to quantify polar halogenated dbps currently the internal standards for rapid quantification of those polar halogenated dbps are not commercially available as the one by one quantification analysis is laborious and time consuming it would be great valuable to synthesize the corresponding internal standards 4 4 evaluation of formation transformation and control of polar halogenated dbps 4 4 1 correlations between the halogen specific total organic halogen tox and total ion intensity tii evaluation of the total level of halogenated dbps is also an important facet of dbp analysis tox analysis is a widely used method to obtain the total level of halogenated dbps including both known and unknown dbps in a disinfected water sample kimura et al 2017 kristiana et al 2015 smith et al 2010 li et al 2017a b the collective parameter tox can be differentiated into total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi to indicate the total concentrations of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps respectively the tii is a measure of the overall ion intensity detected in a mass spectrum by summing all of the ion intensities within an m z range of 36 500 ions with m z 500 are excluded due to their extremely low intensities in the pis spectrum of m z 35 of a water sample the tii value tiipis35 of polar chlorinated dbps in the sample can be obtained and it has been used to indicate the relative formation of polar chlorinated dbps in different water samples similarly tiipis79 and tiipis126 9 can be obtained to indicate the relative levels of brominated and iodinated polar dbps respectively in different water samples interestingly plewa et al 2017 used dbp relative concentrations total ion current tic obtained through broad screen gc ms analyses and toxic potencies tox of those dbps obtained via a cytotoxicity bioassay to establish a tic tox approach which aims to identify the toxicity forcing agents in disinfected water gong and zhang 2015 studied the formation of iodinated dbps during the chlorination of a saline wastewater effluent and found that the tiipis126 9 value exhibited the same trend as the toi concentration under different chlorination conditions during the tobr analysis with the traditional adsorption pyrolysis method activated carbon ac was modified with ozonation to reduce the penetration of tobr during analysis li et al 2010 li et al 2011 also evaluated the performance of ac and ozone modified ac oac with the tox analysis and the pis method they demonstrated that the tobr concentrations with oac were significantly higher than those with ac and the tiipis79 levels in the corresponding filtrate samples passing through oac were lower than those in their ac counterparts that is ozone treatment increased the adsorption capacity of the ac for organic halogen and thus diminished the penetration of polar brominated dbps during the tobr analysis the tii was also observed to be correlated with tox in two other studies liu and zhang 2013 reported that increasing the dose of the quenching agent which in this case was arsenite resulted in a decreasing trend in the measured tobr concentration of the quenched sample this finding is consistent with the tiipis79 data i e the tiipis79 level of the filtrate of the quenched sample from the ac displayed an increasing trend proving the existence of competitive adsorption between arsenite and polar brominated dbps on the ac during tox analysis based on the tii and tox data of tap water samples collected from several major cities in china pan et al 2015 also found highly positive correlations between the halogen specific tox tocl tobr and toi and tii tiipis35 tiipis79 and tiipis126 9 levels with quadratic curve fitting coefficients of 0 999 0 987 and 0 978 respectively therefore although the tii level did not change linearly with the tox possibly due to the mutual suppression effect induced by high levels of halogenated molecular ions it could potentially indicate the overall dbp formation or even the toxicity level of a sample 4 4 2 evaluation of formation and transformation of polar halogenated dbps the pis method enables rapid characterization of the formation of halogenated dbps in a disinfected water sample by conducting the piss of m z values corresponding to halogen specific ions the pis spectra can be obtained and they are considered as snapshots of the entire repertoire of polar halogenated dbps in the water sample the abundant information in the pis spectra allows the comparison of the halogenated dbps formed in different samples e g samples with different source waters and disinfection scenarios zhai and zhang 2011 investigated the formation and transformation trends of polar brominated dbps during chlorination with various contact times from 1 min to 7 d fig 3 the pis m z 79 and 81 spectra showed that different brominated dbps presented different formation and decomposition trends with contact time and they reached their maximum intensities at different contact times many newly identified dbps were aromatic halogenated dbps including 2 4 6 tribromophenol and 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid in the presence of chlorine these aromatic halogenated dbps further decomposed to form aliphatic dbps e g haas and thms so they are also called intermediate dbps zhai et al 2014 also disclosed the whole pictures of polar brominated dbps formed and transformed during chloramination unlike chlorination polar intermediate brominated dbps in chloraminated simulated drinking water samples tended to accumulate rather than decompose with increasing contact time and chloramination favored the formation of nitrogenous brominated dbps based on the modeling of overall reaction kinetics they further indicated that the discrepancy in dbp formation might be mainly ascribed to the active halogen species during chloramination bromo chloramine and bromamine as mild oxidants were the dominant species accounting for the formation of most halogenated dbps and hypohalous acids were minor species at sub ng l levels and thus could not induce decomposition of polar intermediate brominated dbps the pis method was also applied in investigating the effect of initial bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of four groups of newly identified aromatic halogenated dbps in chlorinated drinking water samples pan and zhang 2013 the four groups of aromatic dbps were dihalo salicylic acids dihalo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids dihalo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes and trihalo phenols as the bromide concentration increased each group of aromatic halogenated dbps which were initially less brominated were transformed to dbps containing more bromine atoms the distribution of halogenated aromatic dbps in each group was well modeled via a kinetic model by conducting pis m z 126 9 ding and zhang 2009 revealed the profiles of polar iodinated dbps that were formed during the disinfection of a simulated source water with chlorination chloramination or chlorine ammonia treatment chloramination produced the highest overall level of iodinated dbps followed by chlorine ammonia treatment and chlorination in that order although there was no appreciable difference in the number of iodinated dbps during the chloramination of water samples containing suwannee river fulvic acid or humic acid the fulvic acid sample exhibited higher levels of iodinated aliphatic dbps while the humic acid sample showed higher levels of iodinated aromatic dbps chloramination and chlorine ammonia treatment produced more nitrogenous iodinated dbps than chlorination because more ions with even numbered m z values were observed in the pis spectra of the samples with the first two treatments while focusing on transformation gong et al 2017 found that 4 iodophenol was converted to 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol with the presence of monochloramine several studies have reported the formation of polar halogenated dbps in chlorinated wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 seawater has been adopted for toilet flushing in hong kong since the 1950s but recently concerns have arisen over toxic brominated and iodinated dbps formed during the chlorination of saline wastewater effluents as those dbps may pose adverse effects on marine organisms when the effluents are discharged with the powerful pis method zhang s group successfully disclosed the whole pictures of brominated dbps and iodinated dbps in chlorinated saline wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 the characteristics of dbp formation in the chlorinated saline primary effluent and the chlorinated saline secondary effluent were appreciably different for the secondary effluent numerous polar brominated dbps including some nitrogenous dbps formed and these brominated dbps attained their maximum levels at different chlorine doses according to the ion intensity variations shown in the pis spectra of different samples while fewer and less brominated dbps were observed in the primary effluent and the levels of brominated dbps in the primary effluent kept increasing as the chlorine dose increased moreover the secondary effluent generated much fewer and less iodinated dbps than the primary effluent possibly due to the significantly higher levels of ammonium and iodide leading to the formation of hypoiodous acid in the primary effluent yang and zhang 2014 observed that the newly identified dbps halopyrroles were highly unstable in the pretreated chlorinated effluent sample which was unfavorable for quantitative analysis they studied the potential reasons for that issue by observing the ion variations across the pis spectra it was noticed that the ion cluster representing tetrabromopyrrole decreased significantly with time while a new ion cluster emerged and grew substantially and was later identified to be tribromonitropyrrole based on this finding the authors then proposed that during sample pretreatment the originally low concentration of nitrite in wastewater effluent samples and the sulfuric acid used for ph adjustment could react to generate nitrous acid which could further react with the halopyrroles in the highly concentrated samples leading to the rapid decomposition of halopyrroles understanding the matrix effect induced by nitrite is meaningful for the accurate measurement of halopyrroles after modification of the sample pretreatment method using a less than 100 fold concentration factor to eliminate the interference from the matrix the effects of chlorine dose contact time ph and temperature on the formation of halopyrroles in the chlorinated saline wastewater effluent were revealed only one study applying the pis method to evaluating the formation of new halogenated dbps in swimming pool water has been published xiao et al 2012 results revealed that numerous new halogenated dbps with major species being halo nitro phenols were formed in chlorinated pool water and human body substances including epidermis sweat and urine fig 4 were demonstrated to be an important source of nitrogenous dbps which can be considered as toxicologically important dbps richardson and ternes 2014 a study conducted by kanan and karanfil 2011 observed body fluid analogs exhibiting higher potentials for forming haas than thms carter et al 2015 demonstrated that synthetic urine served as a precursor of a carcinogenic dbp n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during chloramination based on these studies urinating in the swimming pool should be avoided and taking a shower before entering the pool is recommended to reduce the introduction of dbp precursors besides body fluids the introduction of personal care products such as sunscreens cosmetics and lotions into pool water by swimmers is another issue of concern susceptible pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps can act as dbp precursors during chlorination weng et al 2014 shen and andrews 2011 demonstrated that nitrosamine dbps were formed during the chloramination of ppcps with amine groups and wang et al 2013 reported that the chlorination of lotions and sunscreens resulted in the formation of a new group of dbps halobenzoquinones such as 2 3 5 6 tetrabromo 1 4 benzoquinone nevertheless the effects of the introduction of ppcps into pool water on the formation of new polar halogentated dbps are completely unknown and merit further investigation with the pis method such information is important as xiao et al 2012 have shown that halophenols can penetrate across the human skin which may harm swimmers health as a minor application the pis method has been used to study the performance of ac in dbp adsorption tox analysis with the adsorption pyrolysis method generally adopts ac to adsorb organic halogens from water samples because ac is reductive li et al 2010 studied whether it reduces chlorinated dbps during adsorption and found that one type of dbps organic chloramines tend to be reduced by ac during tox analysis the existence of organic chloramines i e n chloroglycine with m z 108 n chloroglycylglycine with m z 165 and n chlorocytosine with m z 144 generated from the chlorination of model amino compounds was confirmed with the pis m z 35 method in two other studies zhang et al 2018b bu et al 2018 a new and facile pretreatment method for tox analysis was reported with two steps electrodialysis and photolysis involved the two steps aim to separate tox and halides and convert tox to halides the pis method was used to compare the overall levels of polar halogenated dbps in samples before and after pretreatment 4 4 3 evaluation of performance of dbp controlling strategies besides application in laboratory analysis ac adsorption has been used widely in drinking water treatment to remove nom which is a major reservoir of dbp precursors unlike the traditional approach of eliminating nom before chlorination jiang et al 2017 proposed a new way i e ac adsorption after chlorination to better control the overall levels of halogenated dbps as the nom fraction with high mw substances may block some mesopores during adsorption the new ac approach focused on adsorbing the intermediate aromatic dbps formed after chlorination the pis method was used to evaluate the formation of the polar halogenated dbps in the two ac related approaches and thus the decrease in dbp formation with different approaches could be characterized and compared based on the pis results and those of other analyses tox thms haas and toxicity bioassay the authors verified that the new approach is significantly more effective at controlling the overall halogenated dbps than the traditional approach a follow up study jiang et al 2018 investigated the applicability of the new strategy to drinking water with different source waters e g different levels of bromide and different disinfection scenarios e g different chlorine contact times further confirming the superiority of the strategy with the pis method pan et al 2013 and liu et al 2015 studied the effects of boiling on the overall levels of polar brominated and chlorinated dbps in simulated and real tap water samples respectively the results revealed that after boiling the tii levels of two tap water samples were reduced by 17 4 51 3 accompanied by reductions in tox concentrations by 37 5 57 1 for either simulated tap water samples or real ones most polar halogenated dbps underwent dehalogenation via hydrolysis and or conversion to volatile compounds via decarboxylation during 5 min of boiling significant reductions 50 were observed in the cytotoxicity and developmental toxicity of the tap water samples after 5 min of boiling demonstrating that boiling can be used as a simple way to reduce the potential health risks of ingesting tap water in addition since iodine containing table salts may favor the formation of iodinated dbps during cooking with chlorinated chloraminated tap water pan et al 2016a b c compared the formation of overall polar iodinated dbps under different cooking conditions by adopting pis of m z 126 9 and they proposed practical suggestions to better control those iodinated dbps also they found that most of the newly identified phenolic iodinated dbps were substantially more developmentally toxic 50 200 times than aliphatic iodinated dbps as bromide exists ubiquitously in water and it can be oxidized to hypobromous acid by chlorine residual in tap water future work may be conducted on the effects of bromide on the formation and toxicity of polar halogenated dbps in cooking with iodized table salts and tap water using the pis m z 79 81 35 37 and 126 9 method to analyze the halogen containing products liu et al 2017 2019 reported the photoconversion of new individual dbps 2 5 dibromohydroquinone and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were chosen as representatives and dbp mixtures of chlorinated saline wastewater effluents in receiving marine water according to the products that were shown in the pis spectra of the seawater solutions containing individual dbps with different light exposure times the photoconversion pathway of halophenolic dbps in seawater was proposed via photonucleophilic substitution bromophenolic iodophenolic dbps were first converted to their chlorinated or hydroxyphenolic analogues and chlorophenolic dbps were transformed into their hydroxyphenolic analogues which could further decompose to produce aliphatic compounds the results of the overall formation of halogenated dbps were consistent with those of their developmental toxicity implying that the photoconversion of halogenated dbps in receiving seawater can be regarded as a detoxification and dehalogenation process 5 application of the pis method to characterization of other organohalogen micropollutants and their transformation products as well as formation mechanisms besides the detection of halogenated dbps generated from the disinfection process the pis method has also served as an effective tool to selectively detect the oxidation products of halogen containing micropollutants during chemical oxidation treatment pang et al 2013 investigated the oxidation of tetrabromobisphenol a a widely used flame retardant by a common oxidant permanganate in terms of kinetics bromine containing products and pathways seven bromine containing oxidation products including 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol and 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone were detected and identified a follow up study gao et al 2016 reported the detection of eight products including haloquinones and halogenated phenols during the reaction of the flame retardant with aqueous chlorine based on the identification of the products the transformation pathways of tetrabromobisphenol a during chlorination were tentatively proposed focusing on the permanganate oxidation of bromophenols extensively used in many industrial products jiang et al 2014a found that brominated polymeric products hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hydroxylated polybrominated biphenyls can be formed readily via the initial generation of bromophenoxyl radicals and the ensuing coupling between the radicals formed another study conducted by jiang et al 2014b reported the role of manganese dioxide as a catalyst in enhancing the permanganate oxidation process of antimicrobial triclosan and its analogue 2 phenoxyphenol on the basis of the identified oxidation products it was found interestingly that manganese dioxide not only accelerated the kinetics significantly but also influenced the transformation pathways of the reactions between phenolic compounds and permanganate more recently the pis method aided in identifying oxidation products and proposing their formation mechanisms in advanced oxidation processes such as oxidation with uv activated persulfate and carbon nanotube activated peroxydisulfate peroxymonosulfate for the degradation of the odorous compounds 2 4 6 trichloroanisole and bromophenols respectively luo et al 2016 guan et al 2017 2018 in addition inorganic halogen ions e g bromide and iodide can be oxidized to hypohalous acids during the oxidation process and hypohalous acids can further react with halogen free micropollutants to form halogenated organics accordingly the pis method was used to reveal the profiles of major products generated during the oxidation of those halogen free contaminants in the presence of halide ions zhou et al 2018 reported that the degradation of four typical steroid estrogens with peroxymonosulfate was accelerated by the presence of bromide and chlorine accompanied by the formation of halogenated hydroxylated and ring opening products li et al 2018a observed that iodide played an important role in the oxidation of the preservative methylparaben and five other phenolic compounds by permanganate due to the formation of hypoiodous acid the degradation rates of the compounds were enhanced remarkably several orders of magnitude faster than those in the absence of iodide and iodinated aromatic products including iodine substitution compounds quinone like compounds and iodinated polymers were simultaneously produced the results obtained in these studies have significant implications for the future application of chemical oxidants to the treatment of micropollutant contaminated water and halide containing water by adopting a time of flight mass spectrometer with mse data acquisition strategy to obtain an ms full scan and ms ms fragmentation information simultaneously the pis method has recently been extended to the non targeted identification of fluoro containing substances perfluoroalkyl compounds xiao et al 2017 unlike the detection of halogentated dbps which requires performing the pis at the m z values corresponding to halide ions the selective detection of perfluoroalkyl compounds was performed using fluorine containing fragments as markers and 90 new or uncommon perfluoroalkyl compounds covering non ionic cationic zwitterionic and anionic compounds were identified in the study 6 conclusions and future study the method using lc esi tqms by setting pis m z 35 37 79 81 or 126 9 was developed innovatively for the fast selective detection of highly polar halogenated dbps in water until now dozens of studies have applied this powerful pis method in investigating the formation speciation and transformation of halogenated dbps especially polar or highly polar ones in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluents and swimming pool water the pis method was also applied in evaluating the efficiencies of different approaches in controlling dbps to achieve a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the dbp compositions in different waters and thus better control dbps and reduce their overall toxicity further improvement and extended application of the method are needed in previous studies with the pis method the prevailing sample pretreatment method was the lle with mtbe the chromatographic separation column in uplc was the hss t3 column and the ionization mode in mass spectrometry was esi it is recommended that different sample pretreatment methods such as solid phase extraction different chromatographic separation columns and different ionization mode such as pressure chemical ionization mode and the atmospheric pressure photoionization mode should be tested by doing so it is expected that more halogenated dbps with different polarities can be extracted separated ionized and then detected by the pis method compared with the conventional off line sample pretreatment the on line spe technique has important advantages in saving time and cost and decreasing experimental errors and contamination cotton et al 2016 nian et al 2018 thus integrating the on line spe technique and lc ms ms may allow the routine monitoring of polar halogenated dbps as the pis method cannot directly provide exact structural information many of the detected ions ion clusters have yet to be fully identified in addition to the methods aforementioned e g product ion scan and hrms other advanced analytical technologies e g fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1h nmr analysis may also aid in identification the pis method may be applied in characterizing the formation of halogenated dbps especially the emerging polar ones from different source waters e g algal wastewater impacted water blending desalinated water and reclaimed water and from different disinfection processes e g using chlorine or alternative disinfectants the dbp formation profiles obtained can help to optimize the water treatment processes to ensure water quality for different purposes the pis method can be used to quickly and comparatively evaluate the overall dbp formation in water samples collected from drinking water treatment plants with different water treatment trains such an evaluation can be beneficial in optimizing dbp control strategies besides the micropollutants discussed above the pis method can be used to selectively detect the halogenated transformation products of other micropollutants e g pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products during disinfection or advanced oxidation processes in most drinking water treatment plants only regulated dbps are monitored routinely however studies have indicated that there are hundreds to thousands of major dbps formed in disinfected drinking water and the regulated dbp data alone may not be enough to ensure the water quality therefore systematic and comprehensive dbp studies involving uplc tqms analysis with the pis method gc analysis tox measurement

18801,water disinfection can result in the unintended formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps which have been the subject of intensive investigation over the past 40 years robust methods for evaluating and characterizing the formation of halogenated dbps are prerequisites for ultimately controlling the formation of dbps and ensuring quality and safe disinfected water only a fraction of the total organic halogen tox formed during disinfection has been chemically identified or even well characterized by the classical derivatization gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms method such a method may not be amenable to the detection of polar halogenated dbps which constitute a major portion of the tox that is still unaccounted for accordingly a novel precursor ion scan pis method using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was developed for the rapid selective detection of all polar halogenated dbps no matter whether the dbps are known or unknown in water this article reviews recent literature on the application of the pis method for evaluating the occurrence formation and control of polar halogenated dbps in disinfected waters the challenges in developing the pis method were briefly summarized application of the powerful method pinpointed 150 previously unknown dbps and revealed the formation speciation and transformation of halogenated dbps in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluents and swimming pool water for the same source water positive correlations were found between the total ion intensity tii levels in the pis spectra of m z 35 79 126 9 and the total organic chlorine bromine iodine levels in the disinfected water sample and a disinfected sample with a higher tii level generally showed a higher toxic potency accordingly the tii value can be used as a surrogate to comparatively reflect the water quality and assess the efficiency of a dbp control approach to achieve a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the dbp compositions in different waters and thus better control the dbp formation and reduce their overall toxicity topics for future work were discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts dbps precursor ion scan mass spectrometry water quality 1 introduction to inactivate pathogens and prevent waterborne diseases disinfection is a necessary process in drinking water treatment and it is widely applied in treating wastewater effluent as well as swimming pool water shannon et al 2008 sedlak and von gunten 2011 weaver et al 2009 krasner et al 2009 li et al 2018b disinfection is also essential for ballast water discharged by ships to reduce the spread of invasive species for seawater in membrane based desalination plants to control biofouling and for desalinated water to prevent pathogen contamination werschkun et al 2012 kim et al 2015 fabbricino et al 2019 but as chemical disinfectants can react with different types of organic matter including natural organic matter effluent organic matter microorganisms algal toxins and anthropogenic contaminants a wide range of unintended disinfection byproducts dbps can be created during disinfection richardson et al 2007 xie 2003 krasner et al 2006 yan et al 2014 gonsior et al 2014 bond and graham 2017 hua et al 2014 he et al 2018 hu et al 2018a fang et al 2018 li and mitch 2018 sun et al 2019 since many studies have shown that dbps may cause adverse health effects and pose a risk to the environment dbps are of increasing concern to the general public and researchers alike wendel et al 2016 stalter et al 2016a yang et al 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 hou et al 2018 postigo et al 2017 although toxicological data suggest that many known dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic or carcinogenic epidemiological studies have revealed that known dbps cannot fully account for the increased adverse health effects induced by consumption of drinking water wang et al 2016 therefore identifying unknown dbps and characterizing the composition of dbp mixtures are necessary for pinpointing dbps of epidemiological relevance ever since the first dbp trichloromethane was identified gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms has been used as an effective tool for uncovering new dbps in the past many years mainly because the technique is straightforward and dbps can be identified by comparing the mass spectral ions of unknown dbps against data from large mass spectral libraries richardson et al 2007 richardson and postigo 2016 plewa et al 2017 for instance a new group of nitrogenous dbps chlorophenylacetonitriles has been recently identified in disinfected drinking waters by gc ms zhang et al 2018a moreover gc ms has been commonly used for quantification analysis of volatile semivolatile dbps with known structures e g halonitromethanes haloacetaldehydes and iodinated trihalomethanes thms yang et al 2019 however only a portion of the total organic halogen tox formed during disinfection has been chemically identified or even well characterized by derivatization gc ms krasner et al 2006 such a technique may not be amenable to the detection of highly polar dbps i e dbps containing one or more hydrophilic functional groups such as cooh oh o cho and nh2 or fully or partially present as molecular ions in water which may constitute a significant portion of the tox that is still unaccounted for zhang and minear 2002 li et al 2017a b wang et al 2015 instead liquid chromatography lc ms ms and related techniques have been increasingly used to study polar dbps over the last decade richardson and postigo 2018 in 2005 zhang et al reported that precursor ion scan pis a unique scanning mode in electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry esi ms ms can be used as an effective tool for the selective detection of chlorinated dbps in two follow up studies zhang s group reported the rapid detection of highly polar brominated and iodinated dbps by performing piss of bromide and iodide at m z 79 81 and 126 9 respectively zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 with such a powerful method numerous polar halogenated dbps have been revealed to form in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluent and recreational water and dozens of them were identified for the first time zhai and zhang 2011 xiao et al 2012 pan et al 2016a gong and zhang 2015 han et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 2016 notably many of the newly identified dbps are toxicologically important dbps as they contain bromine iodine and or nitrogen in their structures previously in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity tests have demonstrated that brominated and iodinated dbps are generally significantly more toxic than their chlorinated analogues and nitrogenous dbps are generally significantly more toxic than their carbonaceous analogues richardson and ternes 2014 plewa et al 2008 in addition the newly identified dbps can be classified into aliphatic dbps e g halomaleic acids and trihalomethanols and aromatic dbps e g 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 2 5 dibromohydroquinone and tetrabromopyrrole liberatore et al 2017 evaluated the comparative in vitro cytotoxicity of four iodophenolic dbps 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 4 iodo 2 methylphenol which were formed in chloraminated oil and gas wastewaters all the four iodophenolic dbps were cytotoxic and 2 4 6 triiodophenol was more toxic than most haloacetic acids haas and all thms recently two bromophenolic dbps 4 bromophenol and 2 4 dibromophenol were demonstrated to bind with human serum albumin using spectroscopic techniques and a molecular docking method zhang et al 2019 two in vivo toxicity studies using a heterotrophic polychaete platynereis dumerilii and an autotrophic alga tetraselmis marina yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 evaluated the comparative toxicity of the newly identified aromatic dbps and commonly known aliphatic dbps indicating that aromatic halogenated dbps generally present tens to hundreds times higher developmental toxicity and growth inhibition than aliphatic halogenated dbps besides both in vivo toxicity studies showed that the newly identified dbps were also ranked in the decreasing order of toxic potency i e iodinated dbps brominated analogues chlorinated analogues in a follow up study tetrabromopyrrole an aromatic and heterocyclic dbp was shown to be over 8000 times more developmentally toxic than bromoacetic acid yang and zhang 2014 li s group also demonstrated that halobenzoquinones were up to 200 times more developmentally toxic in zebrafish embryos than haloacetic acids wang et al 2018 therefore both in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies have indicated that polar halogenated dbps are of significant concern this review aims to 1 describe the development of the pis method 2 summarize the application of the method to the detection identification formation transformation and control of polar halogenated dbps in different water matrices e g drinking water wastewater effluent and swimming pool water and 3 discuss topics for future work to better evaluate and thus help to improve water quality in terms of controlling dbps 2 development of the pis method 2 1 principle of the pis mode the element chlorine has two natural isotopes 35cl and 37cl and their probabilities of occurrence are 75 77 and 24 23 respectively rosenbaum et al 2000 after electrospray ionization esi a compound containing one chlorine atom should generate two molecular ions separated by two m z units in the esi ms full scan spectra and the abundance ratio of the two ions is approximately 3 1 also compounds containing different numbers of chlorine atoms should present different isotope patterns such distinct isotope patterns may be helpful in spotting chlorinated dbps however as matrices of water samples mainly organic matter are generally complex and they coexist with numerous dbps to form a mixture an esi ms full scan spectrum of a chlorinated water sample could contain hundreds to thousands of ions distributed on almost every mass unit zhang et al 2004 the isotope patterns of chlorine containing compounds tend to be hidden by nonhalogenated molecular ions in full scan spectra fortunately by using product ion scans in tandem mass spectrometry a standard chlorine containing compound can readily generate a fragment chlorine ion which can be viewed as the fingerprint of the chlorine containing compound zhang et al 2004 however to confirm whether each ion observed in the ms full scan spectrum is a chlorinated dbp conducting product ion scans is laborious time consuming and impractical for detecting chlorinated dbps in real water samples later zhang et al 2005 realized that a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer tqms has a useful ms ms mode pis also known as parent ion scan there are three quadrupoles in the tqms the first mass analyzer q1 the collision cell q2 used for collision induced dissociation and the second mass analyzer q3 in the pis mode compounds in a test sample are ionized by esi and the molecular ions first pass through q1 one by one each molecular ion then collides with the inert argon gas in q2 to produce fragment ions q3 is set to pass only a specific fragment ion and so only those compounds that can generate the pre selected fragment ion can be detected as mentioned earlier chlorine containing compounds have been found to generate chloride ions in the product ion scan when sufficient energy is imposed to break the c cl bond zhang et al 2004 to investigate whether the pis mode can be used in selective detection of chlorinated dbps in a mixture the pis was conducted for a standard sample consisting of three chlorine containing compounds and one chlorine free compound zhang et al 2005 as the chlorine free compound could not generate the fragment ions m z 35 and 37 only the peaks representing the three chlorine containing compounds were observed in the pis spectra of m z 35 and 37 with 2 unit difference thus by setting m z 35 and 37 the pis mode can be used as an effective tool for selectively detecting electrospray ionizable chlorinated dbps in a mixture 2 2 method development in two follow up studies zhang s group reported the rapid selective detection of highly polar brominated and iodinated dbps by conducting piss of m z 79 81 and 126 9 respectively as bromine and iodine have natural isotopes 79br 81br and 126 9i respectively zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 since key instrumental parameters such as cone voltage also known as source cone potential and collision energy may influence the esi tqms piss significantly they were examined with standard solutions haloacids for piss of m z 79 and 81 iodine containing acids and phenols for pis of m z 126 9 although increasing the cone voltage can increase the molecular ion intensities some molecular ions decomposed at the sample cone when the cone voltage was set above a certain level leading to the formation of fake molecular ions e g m z 219 corresponding to c6h4i o originating from hooc c6h3i o with m z 263 due to decarboxylation these fake molecular ions can prejudice the detection of halogenated dbps accordingly cone voltages between 15 and 20 v are recommended for conducting the piss the optimum collision energy depends on analytes generally a high collision energy is required for conducting piss of m z 35 37 to maximize cl intensities during the collision induced decomposition e g 40 ev for dichloroacetic acid while a relatively low collision energy is favorable for the detection of bromine containing compounds with piss of m z 79 81 e g 10 25 ev for bromine containing acetic acids because the c cl and c br bonds are stronger and shorter than the c i bond the optimum collision energy for detecting iodine containing compounds with pis of m z 126 9 is lower than that for detecting brominated or chlorinated analogs furthermore the optimum collision energy for detecting an iodine containing compound increases almost proportionally to the increase in the molecular weight mw of the compound therefore to screen for iodinated dbps a moderate collision energy e g 30 ev is usually applied an alternative is to choose two collision energies i e a high collision energy e g 40 ev for detecting high mw compounds and a low collision energy e g 20 ev for detecting low mw compounds notably when pis of m z 126 9 is conducted ions with m z 171 and 127 corresponding to two commonly known dbps chlorobromoacetic acid clbrchcooh and dichloroacetic acid cl2chcooh can also be seen in the spectra because the m z values of clbrch generated from the decarboxylation of clbrchcoo and cl2chcoo are 127 the interference of cl2chcoo can be readily excluded as cl2chcoo tends to dissociate to cl2ch and cl at collision energies exceeding 15 ev to preclude the interference of clbrch a relatively high collision energy e g 40 ev can be used to conduct pis m z 126 9 an alternative would be to conduct pis m z 128 9 to differentiate the interference of clbrch as clbrch containing molecular ions can be detected by pis m z 128 9 while iodinated dbps cannot after optimization of the instrumental parameters disinfected drinking water samples with complex matrices including two real drinking water samples and two simulated chlor am inated water samples were also analyzed to validate the method zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 it should be mentioned that with esi a soft ionization technique besides molecular ions m h adducts dimers 2m h of polar dbps may be formed through hydrogen bonding especially for acidic dbps with low pka values e g haas the ions of haa adducts dimers with relatively high m z values may overlap with the molecular ions corresponding to high mw dbps thus increasing the difficulty in identifying new halogenated dbps although dilution can reduce the formation of haa adducts dimers it also decreases the ion intensities of unknown dbps whose concentrations are generally significantly lower than those of haas instead zhai and zhang 2009 developed a method to differentiate the adducts dimers of haas from real halogenated dbps with high mws by setting piss of m z values corresponding to the molecular ions of haas at cone voltage 15 v and collision energy 5 10 ev the adducts dimers of haas in water samples can be selectively detected and increasing the cone voltage can cause the adduct dimer ions to become barely detectable these adducts dimers can be further confirmed using product ion scans because only the adduct dimer ions can generate molecular ions of haas as fragments this method may be extended to find the adducts dimers of other highly polar dbps 3 theoretical calculation of the abundance ratios of isotopic ions shown in pis spectra because the isotopic patterns of halogen containing compounds are essential to interpret the ms spectra the theoretical calculation of the abundance ratios of isotopic ions shown in pis spectra is discussed in this section as br and cl are di isotopic and i is monoisotopic a compound containing m n and p atoms of br cl and i respectively consists of m n 1 ions in a full scan the relative abundance of each isotopic ion in the full scan can be calculated by equation 1 zhang et al

m and c m k and c n n k 1 are the binomial coefficients the relative abundance of the nth isotopic ion in the piss of m z 79 81 and 126 9 can be calculated by equations 2 4 respectively zhang et al

m k c n n k 1 3 n k 1 the derivation of equations 1 4 was reported in detail previously zhang et al 2008 ding and zhang 2009 once the relative abundance of each isotopic ion in a spectrum is obtained the theoretical abundance ratio of all the isotopic ions shown in the spectrum can be calculated by comparing the theoretical and observed abundance ratios of the isotopic ions in the pis spectra the numbers of br and cl atoms in a halogen containing compound can be determined notably although pis of m z 126 9 can indicate whether the compound contains iodine or not the number of i atoms in the compound cannot be determined this is because i has only one natural isotope and the number of i atoms p is not involved in the above equations since calculations based on the above equations are usually tedious an alternative and much simpler method was developed by performing multiplication of combinations of abundance ratios this method can be used for predicting the abundance ratios of the isotopic ions in a full scan or pis spectrum for a compound containing two br one cl and one i fig 1 shows the procedure for calculating the abundance ratios of the isotopic ions in a full scan and piss of m z 79 81 35 and 37 because i is monoisotopic the combination of isotopic ions in the full scan should be expressed as 79br 81br 79br 81br 35cl 37cl which actually can be viewed as the multiplication of the isotopic ratios of the three halogen atoms i e 1 1 1 1 3 1 when the abundance ratio of ions is considered the multiplication 1 1 1 1 3 1 can be performed in two steps for 1 1 1 1 the numbers are multiplied in sequence and the product is added to obtain the ratio of 1 2 1 then 1 2 1 is multiplied by 3 1 to obtain the final ratio of 3 7 5 1 which also indicates that the compound should show four ions in the full scan fig 1a the isotopic pattern in pis of m z 126 9 should be the same as that in the full scan when pis at m z 79 or 81 was conducted one of the br atoms in the compound can be regarded as a monoisotope as molecular ions containing the 81br or 79br fragment from that br atom cannot be detected thus multiplication of the isotopic ratios 1 1 3 1 1 1 can be simplified to 1 1 3 1 1 fig 1b it should be mentioned that to obtain the isotopic ratio in either pis of m z 79 or 81 it suffices to calculate 1 1 3 1 i e the first step as the ratio obtained is multiplied by a constant in the second step however to compare the abundances of the nth isotopic ion in the piss of m z 79 and 81 the ratio must be multiplied by the constant the calculated results demonstrate three isotopic ions with abundance ratio of 3 4 1 in the pis spectrum of m z 79 i e m m 2 m 4 and in the pis spectrum of m z 81 i e m 2 m 4 m 6 the abundance ratio of the nth isotopic ion occurring in the pis of m z 79 and 81 is 1 1 as shown in fig 1c three isotopic ions with abundance ratio of 1 2 1 should occur in the pis spectrum of m z 35 i e m m 2 m 4 and in the pis spectrum of m z 37 i e m 2 m 4 m 6 the abundance ratio of the nth isotopic ion in the pis of m z 35 and 37 is 3 1 based on the alternative method two more examples of how to calculate the abundance ratios of isotopic ions shown in the full scan and pis spectra are illustrated in the supplementary information si 4 application of the pis method for evaluating the occurrence formation and control of dbps in disinfected waters 4 1 sample pretreatment to optimize instrument parameters relatively high concentrations of standard compounds were adopted and standard samples were directly analyzed without sample pretreatment however individual dbps in actual water samples often occur at trace levels sub ng l μg l yang and zhang 2013 wang et al 2016 pan et al 2017 their matrices are generally complex and inorganic ions in such matrices could reduce the esi efficiency for organic analytes therefore to increase the concentrations of analytes to above the detection limits of instruments and to eliminate the effects of inorganic ions it is essential to perform sample pretreatment prior to the pis analysis liquid liquid extraction lle is a commonly adopted method to extract polar halogenated dbps from water because highly polar dbps are believed to contain carboxyl and or phenolic anions and a low ph is propitious to those dbps for keeping them in the neutral form acidification of water samples to ph 0 5 and addition of na2so4 as a salting out agent at a water to na2so4 ratio of 10 1 w w were the first two steps of sample pretreatment notably addition of concentrated sulfuric acid 98 wt may cause the temperature of a water sample to rise significantly and thus could induce the decomposition of analytes so diluted aqueous sulfuric acid 70 v v was used for ph adjustment zhai et al 2014 then methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was added to the water sample at an mtbe to water ratio of 1 10 v v after separation in a separatory funnel the organic layer 70 of the mtbe volume added was transferred to an erlenmeyer flask since the organic layer in the erlenmeyer flask still contained a tiny amount of water which contained high levels of inorganic salts and suppressed the ms signals of organic halogenated dbps it was kept overnight at 4 c in a refrigerator then the tiny water droplets deposited at the bottom of the erlenmeyer flask was removed and the organic layer was transferred to a rotary evaporator to concentrate to 0 5 ml next another solvent acetonitrile was added for solvent exchange from mtbe to acetonitrile zhang et al 2008 with such pretreatment the recoveries for determining polar phenolic halogenated dbps were generally above 90 pan et al 2017 xiao et al 2012 yang and zhang 2013 solid phase extraction spe was also used in sample pretreatment for determination of polar iodinated dbps including two iodinated haas and four aromatic iodinated dbps and the recoveries ranged from 70 to 110 hu et al 2018b stalter et al 2016b reported that compared with ten other sorbents spe with telos env cartridges performed superior in extracting nonvolatile dbps with a tox recovery of 70 the concentrated solution in acetonitrile was stored at 4 c prior to sample analysis the solution was diluted with ultrapure water at a ratio of 1 1 v v and filtered with a 0 22 μm ptfe membrane using a syringe filter once the solution was diluted with ultrapure water the sample was analyzed immediately or else hydrolysis of certain dbps could occur the filtration was performed after dilution liu et al 2015 if it was performed before dilution then due to the change in solubility with solvent mixing the filtered solution in acetonitrile might reprecipitate solids with the addition of ultrapure water especially if the sample had a complex matrix e g a chlorinated wastewater effluent sample the concentration factor adopted in sample pretreatment was chosen based on the original analyte concentrations and the sample matrix for instance for brominated dbp analysis a 1000 fold concentration factor was sufficient for the pretreatment of simulated drinking water samples prepared with natural organic matter humic acid fulvic acid and relatively high levels of bromide zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 whereas a 2000 or even 4000 fold concentration factor was needed for real drinking water samples as their matrices were generally more complex pan et al 2017 liu et al 2015 generally sample volumes of 1 0 4 0 l were required to obtain a 1 ml concentrated solution for the pis analysis a special case reported by yang and zhang 2014 is that the concentration factor of chlorinated wastewater effluent samples should not exceed 100 fold for halogenated pyrroles as target dbps due to the presence of nitrite in the wastewater effluent sample halogenated pyrroles were readily converted to halonitropyrroles during sample pretreatment when a high concentration factor was used pang et al 2013 also adopted the pis approach to detect the brominated oxidation products of the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a using potassium permanganate and they analyzed the water samples without pre concentration spiking the synthetic water with a high initial concentration of tetrabromobisphenol a is one prerequisite for accurate measurement without pre concentration besides since the lc retention times of inorganic ions are considerably shorter than those of the organic analytes in the non pretreated water samples the effluent containing inorganic ions from the lc column outlet can be diverted to waste instead of the ms inlet with the help of a switching valve doing so would eliminate the interference of inorganic ions to ms analysis therefore in cases where samples contain high levels of organic analytes with relatively simple matrices and the available lc ms instruments are equipped with the switching valve sample pretreatment involving extraction may be omitted 4 2 lc separation when samples are injected into the mass spectrometer through direct infusion molecular ions of different compounds may partially or fully overlap in the mass spectra but those compounds may have different retention times on an lc column accordingly to facilitate the ms detection of individual dbps lc was coupled to mass spectrometry for pre separation the waters hss t3 column with the most universal reversed phase sorbent is designed to separate polar organic compounds dahl et al 2012 and it has been commonly applied to separate polar dbps in reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc ding et al 2009 zhai et al 2014 a waters xbridge c18 column was used in high performance liquid chromatography hplc to separate tetrabromobisphenol a and its oxidation products pang et al 2013 mainly because the column sorbent with the trifunctionally bonded c18 ligand as a workhorse can provide conventional and universal lc separation without loss of efficiency marín et al 2014 typically a gradient eluent consisting of either acetonitrile water or methanol water was applied table s1 the methanol water eluent was better in separating most of the polar brominated dbps than the acetonitrile water eluent zhai and zhang 2011 while the acetonitrile water eluent was frequently used in separating iodinated dbps ding and zhang 2009 gong and zhang 2015 pan et al 2016c as the separation efficiency of hplc is lower than that of uplc hplc separation requires a much longer analysis time around 50 min than uplc analysis 15 min or less because the fast separation of uplc leads to narrow chromatographic peaks the coupled mass spectrometry should have sufficient scan speed to obtain enough data points across the narrow peaks yang et al 2011 foti et al 2013 4 3 detection and identification of new polar halogenated dbps 4 3 1 new polar halogenated dbps selectively detected by the pis method by combining pairs of ions clusters in the pis spectra of m z 79 and 81 all electrospray ionizable brominated dbps can be selectively detected in water samples similarly selective detection of electrospray ionizable chlorinated and iodinated dbps can be achieved by piss of m z 35 37 and 126 9 respectively although the pis method can selectively detect halogen containing compounds and provide m z values of corresponding molecular ions it cannot directly provide exact structural information a series of alternative techniques may be used to complete the structural identification nevertheless the pis method is immensely useful for the selective detection of halogen containing ions clusters and it is the first step in targeting and differentiating new polar halogenated dbps for instance ion cluster m z 378 380 382 384 was initially revealed as a predominant ion cluster in the pis spectrum of m z 79 of a chlorinated saline effluent sample further identification and subsequent toxicity bioassay demonstrated that the ion cluster was tetrabromopyrrole a new dbp with extremely high toxicity yang and zhang 2014 up to now the pis method has been successfully applied in selectively detecting polar halogenated dbps in disinfected water samples with different matrices including simulated drinking water ding and zhang 2009 xiao et al 2010 zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 zhai et al 2014 real tap water liu et al 2015 pan et al 2015 swimming pool water xiao et al 2012 sewage effluents ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 and activated sludge samples cai et al 2016 2017 this pis method can also aid in the identification of new groups of dbps indirectly for instance five fully brominated dbps were detected with pis m z 79 and 81 and then identified in chlorinated wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2013 believed that the chlorinated iodinated and monobromo dibromo analogues of the five fully brominated dbps might also form in chlorinated wastewater effluents but the concentrations of those analogues could be too low to be clearly shown in the pis spectra accordingly based on the identification of the five fully brominated dbps seven new halogenated dbps namely 4 bromophenol 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde and 2 5 dibromohydroquinone were identified with the more sensitive multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode table 1 lists 159 ion clusters observed by using the pis method and most of them are new polar halogenated dbps that were initially detected by the pis method and later identified with additional techniques e g product ion scan and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms the representatives are shown in fig 2 more details regarding those halogenated dbps are summarized in table s1 recently hrms and ultrahigh resolution ms e g fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ms have been used in detecting new dbps gonsior et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 zhang and yang 2018 yang and zhang 2016 kolkman et al 2015 postigo et al 2016 gallidabino et al 2018 kosyakov et al 2017 negreira et al 2016 matsushita et al 2016 however although unambiguous molecular formulas can be obtained based on accurate mass measurements structures of those formulas are still unknown by comparing the m z values of those formulas with the m z values in table 1 it can be quickly determined whether those formulas correspond to known or unknown halogenated dbps 4 3 2 identification of dbps detected by the pis method after the esi tqms pis spectra of m z values corresponding to halogen specific ions were acquired the ions clusters with relatively high intensities especially the prominent ones were further studied by the product ion scans to reveal their possible structures frequently observed product ions included x x 35cl 37cl 79br 81br or 126 9i m coo indicating the presence of carboxyl group m co indicating the presence of cho and m x or m hx confirming the presence of halogen notably the observation of the product ion m x instead of m hx might suggest the absence of a hydrogen atom in the molecular ion zhang et al 2008 mrm is not only a highly sensitive and selective mode used for quantitating target compounds evans et al 2009 it can also provide additional information for proposing a structure to be specific by setting certain transitions of molecular ions to halide ions the number of bromine chlorine atoms and the existence of iodine atoms can be further confirmed based on the isotopic abundance ratios of transition ions besides a previous study has shown a direct relationship between retention times rts of halogen containing compounds and their structures i e the rt ranges of halogenated aliphatic acids benzoic acids and phenols were 0 2 5 2 5 6 0 and 6 0 8 0 min respectively for the given uplc eluent program zhai and zhang 2011 accordingly the mrm mode was used to obtain the specific rt which enabled the analytes to be roughly classified and provided important information for tentative identification generally a proposed structure can be confirmed by matching its rt isotopic abundance ratio of the mrm transition ions and characteristic fragment ions in the product ion scan spectra to the corresponding authentic standard compound the matrix effect of a pretreated sample may cause a slight difference between the rts of the target analyte and the standard compound to verify whether the difference arises from the sample matrix effect the pretreated sample can be spiked with the standard compound if no additional peak is observed in the chromatogram of the spiked sample and the intensity of the original peak increases noticeably it can be confirmed that the rt difference is caused by the sample matrix effect and the proposed structure is identified for a compound with no commercially available standard its identification can be achieved by using a standard compound synthesized in the laboratory an appropriate compound that is a precursor of the target compound is commonly reacted with halogen to synthesize the halogen containing standard compound zhai et al 2014 for instance yang and zhang 2014 reported that the reaction of pyrrole and bromine in the mtbe ethanol medium at 0 c generated tetrabromopyrrole a new dbp formed during the chlorine disinfection of a saline wastewater effluent and the purified product was used for the identification and quantification of tetrabromopyrrole however sometimes the synthesized mixture may be too complex to isolate a pure compound or there is so little of the isolated compound that it simply cannot be weighed under such a circumstance the synthesized mixture is injected into uplc and the fraction corresponding to the target compound is collected such injections and fraction collections are repeated many times to obtain a sufficient volume of the solution which is subjected to tox measurement to calculate the concentration of the target compound finally the samples are spiked with the solution for quantification of the newly identified dbp gong and zhang 2015 alternatively high throughput purification using a preparative column chromatographic system may be an ideal choice to obtain sufficient amounts of purified standards leister et al 2003 hrms is another powerful technique to facilitate the identification of polar halogenated dbps e g 2 4 6 tribromoresorcinol and trihalo hydroxy cyclopentene diones detected by the pis method zhai et al 2014 pan et al 2016a as the mass resolution of the tqms is relatively low and an ion cluster may have more than one composition the isobaric ions could bias the compositional interpretation of new polar dbps chang et al 2017 instead an hrms analysis allows the m z values of a target compound to be accurately determined by comparing the mass errors shown in parts per million ppm between the theoretical and measured accurate m z values of the candidate elemental formula the formula of a new polar dbp can be assigned a mass accuracy of less than 5 ppm will confirm the formula unambiguously callahan et al 2011 peterson et al 2012 for a fully identified dbp its concentration in a water sample can be determined using the selected ion recording sir mode or the mrm mode as reported by ding et al 2013 and pan et al 2017 it should be mentioned that without further optimization to choose more suitable product ions in mrm transitions the two studies used halogen ions as product ions for quantitative analysis however product ions set in mrm transitions for quantifying halogenated dbps are not always halogen ions instead the more abundant product ions may be chosen for quantitative analysis for example under the mrm mode m cooh was more suitable than halogen ions for the analysis of most haas duan et al 2011 while m h hcl co was set as the product ion in the analysis of two new aromatic dbps 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone and 2 6 dichloro 3 methyl 1 4 benzoquinone zhao et al 2010 therefore to obtain a lower limit of detection and a lower limit of quantification it is recommended to select suitable product ions in mrm transitions instead of using halogen ions for quantifying halogenated dbps since matrix effects could lead to signal suppression and isotope labeled standard compounds are usually unavailable the standard addition method is generally used to quantify polar halogenated dbps currently the internal standards for rapid quantification of those polar halogenated dbps are not commercially available as the one by one quantification analysis is laborious and time consuming it would be great valuable to synthesize the corresponding internal standards 4 4 evaluation of formation transformation and control of polar halogenated dbps 4 4 1 correlations between the halogen specific total organic halogen tox and total ion intensity tii evaluation of the total level of halogenated dbps is also an important facet of dbp analysis tox analysis is a widely used method to obtain the total level of halogenated dbps including both known and unknown dbps in a disinfected water sample kimura et al 2017 kristiana et al 2015 smith et al 2010 li et al 2017a b the collective parameter tox can be differentiated into total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi to indicate the total concentrations of chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps respectively the tii is a measure of the overall ion intensity detected in a mass spectrum by summing all of the ion intensities within an m z range of 36 500 ions with m z 500 are excluded due to their extremely low intensities in the pis spectrum of m z 35 of a water sample the tii value tiipis35 of polar chlorinated dbps in the sample can be obtained and it has been used to indicate the relative formation of polar chlorinated dbps in different water samples similarly tiipis79 and tiipis126 9 can be obtained to indicate the relative levels of brominated and iodinated polar dbps respectively in different water samples interestingly plewa et al 2017 used dbp relative concentrations total ion current tic obtained through broad screen gc ms analyses and toxic potencies tox of those dbps obtained via a cytotoxicity bioassay to establish a tic tox approach which aims to identify the toxicity forcing agents in disinfected water gong and zhang 2015 studied the formation of iodinated dbps during the chlorination of a saline wastewater effluent and found that the tiipis126 9 value exhibited the same trend as the toi concentration under different chlorination conditions during the tobr analysis with the traditional adsorption pyrolysis method activated carbon ac was modified with ozonation to reduce the penetration of tobr during analysis li et al 2010 li et al 2011 also evaluated the performance of ac and ozone modified ac oac with the tox analysis and the pis method they demonstrated that the tobr concentrations with oac were significantly higher than those with ac and the tiipis79 levels in the corresponding filtrate samples passing through oac were lower than those in their ac counterparts that is ozone treatment increased the adsorption capacity of the ac for organic halogen and thus diminished the penetration of polar brominated dbps during the tobr analysis the tii was also observed to be correlated with tox in two other studies liu and zhang 2013 reported that increasing the dose of the quenching agent which in this case was arsenite resulted in a decreasing trend in the measured tobr concentration of the quenched sample this finding is consistent with the tiipis79 data i e the tiipis79 level of the filtrate of the quenched sample from the ac displayed an increasing trend proving the existence of competitive adsorption between arsenite and polar brominated dbps on the ac during tox analysis based on the tii and tox data of tap water samples collected from several major cities in china pan et al 2015 also found highly positive correlations between the halogen specific tox tocl tobr and toi and tii tiipis35 tiipis79 and tiipis126 9 levels with quadratic curve fitting coefficients of 0 999 0 987 and 0 978 respectively therefore although the tii level did not change linearly with the tox possibly due to the mutual suppression effect induced by high levels of halogenated molecular ions it could potentially indicate the overall dbp formation or even the toxicity level of a sample 4 4 2 evaluation of formation and transformation of polar halogenated dbps the pis method enables rapid characterization of the formation of halogenated dbps in a disinfected water sample by conducting the piss of m z values corresponding to halogen specific ions the pis spectra can be obtained and they are considered as snapshots of the entire repertoire of polar halogenated dbps in the water sample the abundant information in the pis spectra allows the comparison of the halogenated dbps formed in different samples e g samples with different source waters and disinfection scenarios zhai and zhang 2011 investigated the formation and transformation trends of polar brominated dbps during chlorination with various contact times from 1 min to 7 d fig 3 the pis m z 79 and 81 spectra showed that different brominated dbps presented different formation and decomposition trends with contact time and they reached their maximum intensities at different contact times many newly identified dbps were aromatic halogenated dbps including 2 4 6 tribromophenol and 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid in the presence of chlorine these aromatic halogenated dbps further decomposed to form aliphatic dbps e g haas and thms so they are also called intermediate dbps zhai et al 2014 also disclosed the whole pictures of polar brominated dbps formed and transformed during chloramination unlike chlorination polar intermediate brominated dbps in chloraminated simulated drinking water samples tended to accumulate rather than decompose with increasing contact time and chloramination favored the formation of nitrogenous brominated dbps based on the modeling of overall reaction kinetics they further indicated that the discrepancy in dbp formation might be mainly ascribed to the active halogen species during chloramination bromo chloramine and bromamine as mild oxidants were the dominant species accounting for the formation of most halogenated dbps and hypohalous acids were minor species at sub ng l levels and thus could not induce decomposition of polar intermediate brominated dbps the pis method was also applied in investigating the effect of initial bromide concentration on the formation and speciation of four groups of newly identified aromatic halogenated dbps in chlorinated drinking water samples pan and zhang 2013 the four groups of aromatic dbps were dihalo salicylic acids dihalo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids dihalo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes and trihalo phenols as the bromide concentration increased each group of aromatic halogenated dbps which were initially less brominated were transformed to dbps containing more bromine atoms the distribution of halogenated aromatic dbps in each group was well modeled via a kinetic model by conducting pis m z 126 9 ding and zhang 2009 revealed the profiles of polar iodinated dbps that were formed during the disinfection of a simulated source water with chlorination chloramination or chlorine ammonia treatment chloramination produced the highest overall level of iodinated dbps followed by chlorine ammonia treatment and chlorination in that order although there was no appreciable difference in the number of iodinated dbps during the chloramination of water samples containing suwannee river fulvic acid or humic acid the fulvic acid sample exhibited higher levels of iodinated aliphatic dbps while the humic acid sample showed higher levels of iodinated aromatic dbps chloramination and chlorine ammonia treatment produced more nitrogenous iodinated dbps than chlorination because more ions with even numbered m z values were observed in the pis spectra of the samples with the first two treatments while focusing on transformation gong et al 2017 found that 4 iodophenol was converted to 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol with the presence of monochloramine several studies have reported the formation of polar halogenated dbps in chlorinated wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 seawater has been adopted for toilet flushing in hong kong since the 1950s but recently concerns have arisen over toxic brominated and iodinated dbps formed during the chlorination of saline wastewater effluents as those dbps may pose adverse effects on marine organisms when the effluents are discharged with the powerful pis method zhang s group successfully disclosed the whole pictures of brominated dbps and iodinated dbps in chlorinated saline wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 the characteristics of dbp formation in the chlorinated saline primary effluent and the chlorinated saline secondary effluent were appreciably different for the secondary effluent numerous polar brominated dbps including some nitrogenous dbps formed and these brominated dbps attained their maximum levels at different chlorine doses according to the ion intensity variations shown in the pis spectra of different samples while fewer and less brominated dbps were observed in the primary effluent and the levels of brominated dbps in the primary effluent kept increasing as the chlorine dose increased moreover the secondary effluent generated much fewer and less iodinated dbps than the primary effluent possibly due to the significantly higher levels of ammonium and iodide leading to the formation of hypoiodous acid in the primary effluent yang and zhang 2014 observed that the newly identified dbps halopyrroles were highly unstable in the pretreated chlorinated effluent sample which was unfavorable for quantitative analysis they studied the potential reasons for that issue by observing the ion variations across the pis spectra it was noticed that the ion cluster representing tetrabromopyrrole decreased significantly with time while a new ion cluster emerged and grew substantially and was later identified to be tribromonitropyrrole based on this finding the authors then proposed that during sample pretreatment the originally low concentration of nitrite in wastewater effluent samples and the sulfuric acid used for ph adjustment could react to generate nitrous acid which could further react with the halopyrroles in the highly concentrated samples leading to the rapid decomposition of halopyrroles understanding the matrix effect induced by nitrite is meaningful for the accurate measurement of halopyrroles after modification of the sample pretreatment method using a less than 100 fold concentration factor to eliminate the interference from the matrix the effects of chlorine dose contact time ph and temperature on the formation of halopyrroles in the chlorinated saline wastewater effluent were revealed only one study applying the pis method to evaluating the formation of new halogenated dbps in swimming pool water has been published xiao et al 2012 results revealed that numerous new halogenated dbps with major species being halo nitro phenols were formed in chlorinated pool water and human body substances including epidermis sweat and urine fig 4 were demonstrated to be an important source of nitrogenous dbps which can be considered as toxicologically important dbps richardson and ternes 2014 a study conducted by kanan and karanfil 2011 observed body fluid analogs exhibiting higher potentials for forming haas than thms carter et al 2015 demonstrated that synthetic urine served as a precursor of a carcinogenic dbp n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during chloramination based on these studies urinating in the swimming pool should be avoided and taking a shower before entering the pool is recommended to reduce the introduction of dbp precursors besides body fluids the introduction of personal care products such as sunscreens cosmetics and lotions into pool water by swimmers is another issue of concern susceptible pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps can act as dbp precursors during chlorination weng et al 2014 shen and andrews 2011 demonstrated that nitrosamine dbps were formed during the chloramination of ppcps with amine groups and wang et al 2013 reported that the chlorination of lotions and sunscreens resulted in the formation of a new group of dbps halobenzoquinones such as 2 3 5 6 tetrabromo 1 4 benzoquinone nevertheless the effects of the introduction of ppcps into pool water on the formation of new polar halogentated dbps are completely unknown and merit further investigation with the pis method such information is important as xiao et al 2012 have shown that halophenols can penetrate across the human skin which may harm swimmers health as a minor application the pis method has been used to study the performance of ac in dbp adsorption tox analysis with the adsorption pyrolysis method generally adopts ac to adsorb organic halogens from water samples because ac is reductive li et al 2010 studied whether it reduces chlorinated dbps during adsorption and found that one type of dbps organic chloramines tend to be reduced by ac during tox analysis the existence of organic chloramines i e n chloroglycine with m z 108 n chloroglycylglycine with m z 165 and n chlorocytosine with m z 144 generated from the chlorination of model amino compounds was confirmed with the pis m z 35 method in two other studies zhang et al 2018b bu et al 2018 a new and facile pretreatment method for tox analysis was reported with two steps electrodialysis and photolysis involved the two steps aim to separate tox and halides and convert tox to halides the pis method was used to compare the overall levels of polar halogenated dbps in samples before and after pretreatment 4 4 3 evaluation of performance of dbp controlling strategies besides application in laboratory analysis ac adsorption has been used widely in drinking water treatment to remove nom which is a major reservoir of dbp precursors unlike the traditional approach of eliminating nom before chlorination jiang et al 2017 proposed a new way i e ac adsorption after chlorination to better control the overall levels of halogenated dbps as the nom fraction with high mw substances may block some mesopores during adsorption the new ac approach focused on adsorbing the intermediate aromatic dbps formed after chlorination the pis method was used to evaluate the formation of the polar halogenated dbps in the two ac related approaches and thus the decrease in dbp formation with different approaches could be characterized and compared based on the pis results and those of other analyses tox thms haas and toxicity bioassay the authors verified that the new approach is significantly more effective at controlling the overall halogenated dbps than the traditional approach a follow up study jiang et al 2018 investigated the applicability of the new strategy to drinking water with different source waters e g different levels of bromide and different disinfection scenarios e g different chlorine contact times further confirming the superiority of the strategy with the pis method pan et al 2013 and liu et al 2015 studied the effects of boiling on the overall levels of polar brominated and chlorinated dbps in simulated and real tap water samples respectively the results revealed that after boiling the tii levels of two tap water samples were reduced by 17 4 51 3 accompanied by reductions in tox concentrations by 37 5 57 1 for either simulated tap water samples or real ones most polar halogenated dbps underwent dehalogenation via hydrolysis and or conversion to volatile compounds via decarboxylation during 5 min of boiling significant reductions 50 were observed in the cytotoxicity and developmental toxicity of the tap water samples after 5 min of boiling demonstrating that boiling can be used as a simple way to reduce the potential health risks of ingesting tap water in addition since iodine containing table salts may favor the formation of iodinated dbps during cooking with chlorinated chloraminated tap water pan et al 2016a b c compared the formation of overall polar iodinated dbps under different cooking conditions by adopting pis of m z 126 9 and they proposed practical suggestions to better control those iodinated dbps also they found that most of the newly identified phenolic iodinated dbps were substantially more developmentally toxic 50 200 times than aliphatic iodinated dbps as bromide exists ubiquitously in water and it can be oxidized to hypobromous acid by chlorine residual in tap water future work may be conducted on the effects of bromide on the formation and toxicity of polar halogenated dbps in cooking with iodized table salts and tap water using the pis m z 79 81 35 37 and 126 9 method to analyze the halogen containing products liu et al 2017 2019 reported the photoconversion of new individual dbps 2 5 dibromohydroquinone and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were chosen as representatives and dbp mixtures of chlorinated saline wastewater effluents in receiving marine water according to the products that were shown in the pis spectra of the seawater solutions containing individual dbps with different light exposure times the photoconversion pathway of halophenolic dbps in seawater was proposed via photonucleophilic substitution bromophenolic iodophenolic dbps were first converted to their chlorinated or hydroxyphenolic analogues and chlorophenolic dbps were transformed into their hydroxyphenolic analogues which could further decompose to produce aliphatic compounds the results of the overall formation of halogenated dbps were consistent with those of their developmental toxicity implying that the photoconversion of halogenated dbps in receiving seawater can be regarded as a detoxification and dehalogenation process 5 application of the pis method to characterization of other organohalogen micropollutants and their transformation products as well as formation mechanisms besides the detection of halogenated dbps generated from the disinfection process the pis method has also served as an effective tool to selectively detect the oxidation products of halogen containing micropollutants during chemical oxidation treatment pang et al 2013 investigated the oxidation of tetrabromobisphenol a a widely used flame retardant by a common oxidant permanganate in terms of kinetics bromine containing products and pathways seven bromine containing oxidation products including 4 2 hydroxyisopropyl 2 6 dibromophenol and 2 6 dibromo 1 4 benzoquinone were detected and identified a follow up study gao et al 2016 reported the detection of eight products including haloquinones and halogenated phenols during the reaction of the flame retardant with aqueous chlorine based on the identification of the products the transformation pathways of tetrabromobisphenol a during chlorination were tentatively proposed focusing on the permanganate oxidation of bromophenols extensively used in many industrial products jiang et al 2014a found that brominated polymeric products hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hydroxylated polybrominated biphenyls can be formed readily via the initial generation of bromophenoxyl radicals and the ensuing coupling between the radicals formed another study conducted by jiang et al 2014b reported the role of manganese dioxide as a catalyst in enhancing the permanganate oxidation process of antimicrobial triclosan and its analogue 2 phenoxyphenol on the basis of the identified oxidation products it was found interestingly that manganese dioxide not only accelerated the kinetics significantly but also influenced the transformation pathways of the reactions between phenolic compounds and permanganate more recently the pis method aided in identifying oxidation products and proposing their formation mechanisms in advanced oxidation processes such as oxidation with uv activated persulfate and carbon nanotube activated peroxydisulfate peroxymonosulfate for the degradation of the odorous compounds 2 4 6 trichloroanisole and bromophenols respectively luo et al 2016 guan et al 2017 2018 in addition inorganic halogen ions e g bromide and iodide can be oxidized to hypohalous acids during the oxidation process and hypohalous acids can further react with halogen free micropollutants to form halogenated organics accordingly the pis method was used to reveal the profiles of major products generated during the oxidation of those halogen free contaminants in the presence of halide ions zhou et al 2018 reported that the degradation of four typical steroid estrogens with peroxymonosulfate was accelerated by the presence of bromide and chlorine accompanied by the formation of halogenated hydroxylated and ring opening products li et al 2018a observed that iodide played an important role in the oxidation of the preservative methylparaben and five other phenolic compounds by permanganate due to the formation of hypoiodous acid the degradation rates of the compounds were enhanced remarkably several orders of magnitude faster than those in the absence of iodide and iodinated aromatic products including iodine substitution compounds quinone like compounds and iodinated polymers were simultaneously produced the results obtained in these studies have significant implications for the future application of chemical oxidants to the treatment of micropollutant contaminated water and halide containing water by adopting a time of flight mass spectrometer with mse data acquisition strategy to obtain an ms full scan and ms ms fragmentation information simultaneously the pis method has recently been extended to the non targeted identification of fluoro containing substances perfluoroalkyl compounds xiao et al 2017 unlike the detection of halogentated dbps which requires performing the pis at the m z values corresponding to halide ions the selective detection of perfluoroalkyl compounds was performed using fluorine containing fragments as markers and 90 new or uncommon perfluoroalkyl compounds covering non ionic cationic zwitterionic and anionic compounds were identified in the study 6 conclusions and future study the method using lc esi tqms by setting pis m z 35 37 79 81 or 126 9 was developed innovatively for the fast selective detection of highly polar halogenated dbps in water until now dozens of studies have applied this powerful pis method in investigating the formation speciation and transformation of halogenated dbps especially polar or highly polar ones in disinfected drinking water wastewater effluents and swimming pool water the pis method was also applied in evaluating the efficiencies of different approaches in controlling dbps to achieve a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the dbp compositions in different waters and thus better control dbps and reduce their overall toxicity further improvement and extended application of the method are needed in previous studies with the pis method the prevailing sample pretreatment method was the lle with mtbe the chromatographic separation column in uplc was the hss t3 column and the ionization mode in mass spectrometry was esi it is recommended that different sample pretreatment methods such as solid phase extraction different chromatographic separation columns and different ionization mode such as pressure chemical ionization mode and the atmospheric pressure photoionization mode should be tested by doing so it is expected that more halogenated dbps with different polarities can be extracted separated ionized and then detected by the pis method compared with the conventional off line sample pretreatment the on line spe technique has important advantages in saving time and cost and decreasing experimental errors and contamination cotton et al 2016 nian et al 2018 thus integrating the on line spe technique and lc ms ms may allow the routine monitoring of polar halogenated dbps as the pis method cannot directly provide exact structural information many of the detected ions ion clusters have yet to be fully identified in addition to the methods aforementioned e g product ion scan and hrms other advanced analytical technologies e g fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1h nmr analysis may also aid in identification the pis method may be applied in characterizing the formation of halogenated dbps especially the emerging polar ones from different source waters e g algal wastewater impacted water blending desalinated water and reclaimed water and from different disinfection processes e g using chlorine or alternative disinfectants the dbp formation profiles obtained can help to optimize the water treatment processes to ensure water quality for different purposes the pis method can be used to quickly and comparatively evaluate the overall dbp formation in water samples collected from drinking water treatment plants with different water treatment trains such an evaluation can be beneficial in optimizing dbp control strategies besides the micropollutants discussed above the pis method can be used to selectively detect the halogenated transformation products of other micropollutants e g pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products during disinfection or advanced oxidation processes in most drinking water treatment plants only regulated dbps are monitored routinely however studies have indicated that there are hundreds to thousands of major dbps formed in disinfected drinking water and the regulated dbp data alone may not be enough to ensure the water quality therefore systematic and comprehensive dbp studies involving uplc tqms analysis with the pis method gc analysis tox measurement

near future graphical abstract image 10916 keywords mofs arsenic adsorbents decontamination water treatment 1 introduction arsenic contamination is a global threat due to its acute toxicity and carcinogenicity exposure to arsenic polluted water would result in such severe health problems as liver lung kidney and skin cancers hence arsenic has been categorized by world health organization who as the priority issue amongst the toxic substances abdul et al 2015 mandal and suzuki 2002 due to the high mobility of arsenate species in water streams as well as its ease in accumulation in the food chain and the human body effective removal of aquatic arsenate has been an important topic in water treatment sarkar and paul 2016 singh et al 2015 metal organic frameworks mofs a new class of hybrid porous materials built from organic linkers and inorganic metal or metal containing cluster nodes through coordination bonds have attracted tremendous attention in the recent decade rowsell and yaghi 2004 zhou et al 2012 benefitting from the desirable features like great surface areas high porosities customizable functionalities and versatile architectures mofs are considered as a group of state of the art materials compared to the conventional porous ones li et al 2012 wang et al 2016b researchers have been looking into the possibilities of applying mofs in the effective removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater especially with regards to the arsenic species li et al 2018 wang et al 2016b this review aims at comprehensively surveying the significant studies on the topic of arsenic contaminated water remediation based on mofs relevant information including the materials characteristic structures application approaches removal performance interaction mechanisms as well as spectroscopy analyses was systematically reviewed and discussed moreover the feasibility of applying mofs in aquatic arsenic removal was assessed taking into account the cost effectiveness and the further development potentials a careful comparison with other arsenic removal techniques and conventional materials was also be conducted at the end insightful perspectives and suggestions for future studies can be found overall this review could serve as a guide book with respect to arsenic pollutants removal using mofs with the purpose of assisting field related scientists and engineers to gain a better understanding of the materials and their associated decontamination behaviors 2 arsenic contamination and conventional removal technologies arsenic is a metalloid element of group va in the periodic table which normally exist in oxidation states as as iii as 0 as iii and as v mandal and suzuki 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 arsenic is ubiquitous in our environment and it is a component of more than 245 minerals including elemental arsenic arsenides arsentates arsenites etc a variety of natural biological as well as anthropogenic activities could mobilize arsenic species across minerals atmosphere and water bodies arsenic species can be categorized into organic and inorganic subtypes cullen and reimer 1989 in natural environment trace levels of organic arsenic could be detected and typical forms include e g methyl arsenic acid mma and dimethyl arsenic acid dma etc moreover inorganic arsenic is mostly contributed by as v arsenate and as iii arenite which form arsenious acids h3aso3 arsenic acids h3aso4 and their related ionic compounds they mostly exist in water solutions for instance as v is prevalent in oxygenated surface water streams whilst as iii is present in groundwater and other water bodies with reducing conditions mohan and pittman 2007 typically arsenic contamination comes from pesticides herbicides crop desiccants combustion of fossil fuels mining and smelting in semi conductor industries sarkar and paul 2016 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 it could rapidly accumulate to act as a severe threat to the environment and human health as estimated more than 60 000 tons of arsenic is emitted into the environment annually sarkar and paul 2016 the toxicity of arsenic has been well analyzed and clinically studied abdul et al 2015 hughes 2002 as a dangerous carcinogen arsenic could induce severe poisoning on human health mohan and pittman 2007 low to moderate levels of arsenic exposure 10 300 μg l through drinking water could result in skin lesions circulatory disorders neurological complications diabetes respiratory complications hepatic and renal dysfunction mortality etc the ingestion of high concentrations of arsenic causes acute poisoning with symptoms such as vomiting oesophageal and abdominal pain bloody diarrhea and encephalopathy with symptoms such as headache mental confusion and coma abdul et al 2015 chronic exposure to arsenic leads to several disorders on our biological systems such as the digestive respiratory cardiovascular hematopoietic endocrine renal neurological and reproductive systems which ultimately lead to cancer singh et al 2015 it was reported that ca 150 million people are exposed to arsenic contamination from drinking water and this figure continues to escalate mandal and suzuki 2002 murcott 2012 episodes of arsenic pollution have been found in many regions all over the world especially in southern asia and south west america and recently in china and united states as well liu et al 2002 typically more than 45 million people majority in asia bangladesh and india still drink severely arsenic contaminated water chakraborti et al 2003 chen et al 2009 mazumder et al 2000 this threat caused by arsenic contamination could easily spread owing to globalization nowadays rooted from arsenic s substantial toxicity and the wide spread of arsenic contamination the international agency for research on cancer iarc united states environmental protection agency usepa and who have all classified them as a group a carcinogen järup 2003 these international regulation authorities have established a series of stringent standards for controlling arsenic residuals in drinkable water a provisional guideline of 10 μg l as the maximum arsenic level in drinking water is requested according to the public health service standards mohan and pittman 2007 the most commonly applied methods for arsenic removal include oxidization dutta et al 2005 leupin and hug 2005 coprecipitation gallagher et al 2004 wang et al 2011 ion exchange he et al 2012 kim and benjamin 2004 membrane filtration sabbatini et al 2010 yu et al 2013 adsorption gallegos garcia et al 2012 guan et al 2012 mohan and pittman 2007 pal 2010 etc in addition it was reported that certain biological techniques have been available for remediating arsenic contaminated water srivastava et al 2011 these major arsenic removal technologies are compared in table 1 amongst them adsorption using porous materials is regarded as one of the most effective methods due to the high efficiency low cost and ease in operation mohan and pittman 2007 intensive studies have been carried out to develop various adsorbents for arsenic removal and some commercial adsorbents are as well available wang et al 2015 despite that the arsenic adsorption capacity of conventional adsorbents like activated carbons activated alumina and powdered zeolite is unsatisfactory mohan and pittman 2007 wang et al 2015 in order to further improve the adsorption capacity strategic methods including reducing the particle size of adsorbents or preparing materials with hierarchically ordered structures were employed yu et al 2018 these approaches may increase the surface area of adsorbent for efficient contact however they could complicate the synthesis process and consequently raise the production cost thus a new generation of porous materials providing better performance i e greater adsorption capacity fast kinetics tunable functionality for selectivity sufficient reusability etc is on demand for adsorptive removal of arsenic contamination from water 3 mofs and their applications mofs have been attracting a great deal of attention in the past decade it is by definition a class of crystalline porous materials consisting of metal nodes i e metal ions or clusters and organic linkers connected via coordination bonds furukawa et al 2013 rowsell and yaghi 2004 zhou et al 2012 the commonly used metals for construction of mofs include ag i cu ii mg ii zn ii co ii fe iii al iii ln iii zr iv and so on which can adopt various coordination geometries such as trigonal bipyramidal pyramidal square tetrahedral and octahedral as connections to the metals organic linkers such as amines carboxylates sulfonates and phosphates are also key components for mof synthesis through the formation of ordered framework structures mofs demonstrate a series of great features e g large surface area controlled porosity structural tailorability and high crystallinity eddaoudi et al 2002 kitagawa et al 2004 typically the surface areas of mofs range from 1000 to 10 000 m2 g exceeding those of traditional porous materials like activated carbon and zeolites furukawa et al 2013 owing to their advantageous characteristics mofs have been studied for a variety of applications including adsorption and separation gas storage drug delivery sensing proton conduction etc eddaoudi et al 2002 li et al 1999 however due to the lability of ligand metal bonds the earliest reported mofs are sensitive to water content and not yet preferred in applications for instance one of the milestone mofs mof 5 would decompose gradually upon exposure to a humid environment wang et al 2016b with the unceasing efforts to study and improve the stability of mofs more and more water stable mofs have recently emerged for a wide range of water involved applications feng et al 2018 these hydro stable mof structures normally possess strong coordination bonds or significant steric hindrance to prevent the detrimental hydrolysis process that breaks the metal ligand bonds typically water stable mofs could be categorized into three major types 1 metal carboxylate frameworks consisting of high valence metal ions e g uio 66 and mil family 2 metal azolate frameworks containing nitrogen donor ligands e g zifs 3 mofs functionalized by hydrophobic pore surfaces or with blocked metal ions wang et al 2016b therefore over the recent years researchers have been looking into the feasibility of water stable mofs or mof based composites for the removal of unfavorable targets from aqueous media feng et al 2018 kobielska et al 2018 li et al 2018 wang et al 2016b wen et al 2018 it is worthy to note that some of them could provide excellent stability even under harsh conditions kandiah et al 2010 li et al 2018 and can be synthesized on a large scale through cost effective and facile preparation methods kandiah et al 2010 stock and biswas 2012 taking into account the intrinsic features like ordered porous structures versatile architecture and tunable functionalities mofs should present as a promising next generation material with great efficiencies for water treatment when applied for contaminated water remediation mofs could be directly used as adsorbents or combined as separation media wang et al 2016b fig 1 summarizes the development milestones of mofs water stable mofs mofs used for water decontamination applications and particularly for aquatic arsenic removal the key performance indicators of an adsorption process e g adsorption capacity kinetics thermodynamics selectivity stability and reusability are controlled by the mofs highly ordered porous structures surface area hydrophilicity functionality pore size and distribution etc 4 survey of arsenic removal by mofs this section surveys the reported studies that applied mof based materials for arsenic removal the key characteristics of materials removal performance and mechanisms are summarized herein the presentation logic is according to the targeting arsenic species arsenate as v arsenite as iii and organic arsenic organoarsenic several studies analyzed the capability of mofs for both as v and as iii removal they are combined with the work focusing on arsenite as iii in the subsection 4 2 generally in each subsection mofs with similar origins i e rooting in the same family like zifs mils uios etc are discussed together 4 1 mof based materials for as v removal the first mof used to remove arsenic species from water solutions was fe btc reported by zhu et al in 2012 zhu et al 2012 fe btc is a mof containing iron nodes and 1 3 5 benzenetricarboxylic linkers it was synthesized through a facile solvothermal method under an autogenous pressure and applied as the adsorbents for as v uptake across a ph range of 2 10 the optimal condition was ph 4 at which fe btc could achieve an adsorption capacity of 12 3 mg g this was more than 6 times as high as that of fe2o3 nanoparticles 50 nm size and 36 times higher than that of commercially available powdered iron oxide analyzed by infrared ir measurements the appearance of a new ir band at 824 cm 1 corresponding with fe o as groups confirmed the adsorption of as v species moreover the transmission electron microscopy tem confirmed that as v adsorption took place on interior sites of the mof interacting with the frameworks fe nodes overall this was one of the milestone studies in regards to arsenic removal by mofs unveiling the potential of these materials for the capture of arsenic species even though the adsorption capacity was not stunning further to that researchers started looking into the classic mofs e g zifs and mils for arsenic removal li et al reported that zif 8 exhibited an adsorption capacity of 76 5 mg g at a low equilibrium concentration 9 8 μg l compared to that of active carbon 3 mg g and zeolite 13 92 mg g li et al 2014a the mechanism studies suggested that the adsorption was attributed to the large amount of external active sites zn oh produced through the dissociative adsorption of water and subsequently formed inner sphere complexes with the arsenate species further to that massoudinejad et al prepared ethylenediamine functionalized zif 8 with cubic structures for arsenic adsorption from aqueous solutions massoudinejad et al 2018 it was found that after functionalization the arsenic adsorption capacity increased from 72 to 83 5 mg per gram of adsorbent the equilibrium time of pristine zif 8 and ed zif 8 for arsenic adsorption was approximately 5 and 6 h respectively besides wu et al assessed the adsorption capacity of zif 8 particles prepared in different solvents and co templates wu et al 2014 it was found that zif 8 synthesized in water has the lowest capacity whilst the hierarchically structured zif 8 synthesized with surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and amino acid l histidine could achieve better adsorption performance in particular the adsorption capacity of 91 mg g was observed for hierarchical zif 8 with dual micro mesoporosity this might be due to the mesostructured pores and enhanced porosity which facilitate mass transfer within the open framework of zif 8 besides the abundant active sites zn oh formed by water dissolution could bind as v species more effectively besides zifs mil family is another representative class of mofs applied for as v removal férey et al 2005 li et al studied mil 53 al which could function efficiently across a ph range of 6 8 li et al 2014b it exhibited a decent as v adsorption capacity of 106 mg g at the optimal condition of ph 8 which could be accomplished within 11 h it was suggested by the fourier transform infrared ftir and x ray photoelectron xps data that the adsorption mechanism was due to the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions its structural integrity was preserved throughout the experiments and no aluminum ion was detected in the post adsorption solutions ensuring the safety of using this material for application in drinking water treatment moreover vu et al reported the adsorption of as v by mil 53 fe which had an adsorption capacity of 21 mg g vu et al 2015 the mof was synthesized via hf free solvothermal methods and demonstrated an excellent adsorption kinetics which required only 60 150 min to reach equilibrium the adsorption mechanism was suggested to be based on a lewis acid base interaction between the anionic arsenate species and cationic fe node several studies used mil 88 in different forms for arsenate removal firstly wu et al reported that iron based mil 88a microrods could deliver a high adsorption rate and an excellent uptake capacity of 145 mg g wu et al 2018 this might be resulted from the large number of channels and cages in its framework and therefore as v was not only adsorbed onto the materials surfaces but also throughout its interiors secondly hou et al reported an environmentally friendly route for the preparation of iron based mil 88b and evaluated its capability for arsenate removal hou et al 2018 the synthesis occurred at room temperature without heating and did not include the use of toxic organic solvents extremely dangerous hydrofluoric acid or strong alkali mil 88b exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity of 156 mg g and the mechanism study suggested that as v molecules coordinated with the oxygen molecules of feo clusters in the framework thirdly gu et al demonstrated an effective strategy to fabricate the bimetallic fe mg mil 88b gu et al 2019 the synergetic contribution from two active metal centers renders fe mg mil 88b a better arsenate adsorbent than the monometallic fe mil 88b it exhibited an impressive decontamination performance towards arsenate species including a remarkable uptake capacity 303 mg g considerably fast adsorption rate broad ph working range strong anti interference exceptional regeneration and structural stability as well as excellent cycling stability fourthly xie et al fabricated a dual functional nh2 mil 88 fe nanooctahedra for highly sensitive detection and efficient removal of as v from polluted water xie et al 2017 the material exhibited a high saturated adsorption capacity of 125 mg g and fast sorption kinetics capable of reducing the trace as v content to meet the regulated standard 10 μg l within 60 min in addition cai et al discovered that mil 100 fe had an excellent as v adsorption capacity of 110 mg g with sufficient reusability and selectivity in the presence of common anions cai et al 2016 it was found in the ftir study that the adsorption was accomplished through the formation of fe o as v complexes within the mil 100 fe structures the uptake of arsenate species blocked the uniform mesoporous channels of mil 100 fe and upon arsenic desorption the long range order of porous structure recovered immediately as comparative studies liu et al calcined mil 100 fe at different temperatures to form α fe2o3 for as v removal liu et al 2014b whereas the adsorption capacities of the metal oxides ranged merely between 70 and 95 mg g similarly hei et al used mil 100 fe to fabricate γ fe2o3 by facile thermolysis hei et al 2014 which has an adsorption capacity for as v of 90 mg g these studies validated the characteristic advantages of using mofs in aquatic arsenic removal moving forward from the zifs and mils miscellaneous mofs have been developed and evaluated for arsenate removal atallah et al synthesized a chemically stable porous indium based aubm 1 atallah et al 2018 which displayed a great arsenate uptake capacity of 103 mg g at neutral ph it was found that its adsorption was an endothermic process and followed a pseudo second order kinetic model zhang et al synthesized a microporous tetranuclear co ii based mof co mof which revealed an excellent adsorption property on removing as v zhang et al 2018 co mof could work at ph 4 10 and had the maximal adsorption capacity of 96 mg g lv et al studied the adsorption performance of ni mof for arsenic v species lv et al 2019 and confirmed its maximum adsorption capacity as 134 mg g lastly representing a group of highly stable mofs zirconium based mofs have shown exceptional adsorption behaviors for arsenic removal cavka et al 2008 furukawa et al 2014 kandiah et al 2010 li et al prepared mof 808 with nano order particle sizes for as v adsorption li et al 2015 the mof 808 adsorbent showed an adsorption capacity of 25 mg g at ph 4 it was also found that more than 80 of the adsorption efficiency can be retained after five regeneration reuse cycles the adsorption mechanism was attributed to the interactions between as v ions and the zr sites in mof 808 wang et al reported a milestone study in 2015 using water stable zr mof uio 66 to remove as v wang et al 2015 the uio 66 adsorbents provided a superior adsorption capacity of 303 mg g at ph 2 which was much higher than those of other synthetic or commercial adsorbents 5 280 mg g generally 100 mg g uio 66 was efficient across a wide ph range from 1 to 10 and its adsorption efficiency was not affected by the presence of typical anions no3 cl so4 2 and co3 2 the mechanism analysis suggested that the terminal hydroxyl groups and organic ligands were the main adsorption sites which captured as v ions to the zr6 nodes via the formation of zr o as coordination complex on the basis of the fascinating structural and adsorptive properties researchers combined uio 66 with separation media to efficiently capture arsenic species liu et al 2015b ma et al 2017 huo et al synthesized a magnetic fe3o4 uio 66 composite using a direct epitaxial approach for the efficient removal of arsenate from wastewater huo et al 2019 the composites exhibited an adsorption capacity of 73 mg g and can be readily separated from post treatment water solutions owing to its magnetic responsive feature wang et al incorporated uio 66 into the unique micro channels of alumina hollow fibers for a continuous arsenic contaminated water remediation process as shown in fig 2 wang et al 2016a the functional hollow fiber could produce potable water recovery with less than 10 μg l arsenic content from the arsenic contaminated feed initial arsenic concentration 1000 μg l employing this method stable support of mofs can be ensured for efficient contact with polluted inflow and not to lose any detectable materials in recovery outflows as no zirconium signal was detected in the effluents moreover he et al integrated nanosized uio 66 into the selective layer polyamide layer of a thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane and applied the fabricated membranes for arsenic contaminated water purification he et al 2017 it was found that the tfn membrane had a robust long term stability higher pure water permeability owing to the increased hydrophilicity and remarkable rejection 99 towards arsenate species 4 2 mof based materials for as iii and dual as iii v removal compared to as v species as iii is regarded to be more toxic and its removal from water streams is normally more difficult than that of as v various researchers examined the removal ability of zifs for arsenite in addition to arsenate in 2014 jian et al reported that zif 8 was efficient for the simultaneous elimination of as v and as iii owing to the terminal hydroxyl and amine groups jian et al 2015 the mof was synthesized at room temperature using a slightly modified method the langmuir model suggested that zif 8 had moderate capacities for both as v and as iii 60 mg g and 49 mg g respectively at neutral ph due to the highly porous structure with pore sizes ranging from 8 to 16 å the adsorption equilibria of zif 8 for as v and as iii were established in 7 and 13 h respectively it was found that the adsorption rate was controlled by diffusion between particles rather than that through interior pores which means the uptake of arsenic occurred on the surface sites of zif 8 the adsorption efficiency was not influenced by the presence of sulphate so4 2 and nitrate ions no3 but was considerably affected by the presence of phosphate po4 3 and carbonate ions co3 2 the ftir and xps studies suggested that arsenic species were coordinated to the terminal hydroxyl and imidazole nitrogen groups moreover liu et al prepared zif 8 in three different morphologies i e cubic leaf shaped and dodecahedral zif 8 for as iii adsorption liu et al 2015a it shall be noted that the leaf shaped zif 8 had a surface area of 13 m2 g and was considered to be non porous whilst the highly porous cubic and dodecahedral zif 8 had the surface area of 958 and 1151 m2 g respectively nevertheless these three zif 8 adsorbents could reduce the as iii concentration 200 μg l to a level of less than 10 μg l in 2 h and their adsorption capacities at ph 8 5 were 122 108 and 117 mg g for cubic leaf shaped and dodecahedral zif 8 respectively therefore the as iii adsorption kinetics and capacity did not correlate with the surface areas of zif 8 rather by the surface functional groups that complexed with as iii species during the adsorption process this was further supported by the ftir and xps analyses which suggested the adsorption mechanism as terminal hydroxyl groups substitution to form zn o as complexes on the surface of zif 8 besides the dodecahedral zif 8 appeared to be the most stable framework as confirmed by the x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses towards the spent materials in comparison nasir et al also synthesized a two dimensional leaf shaped 2d zif l as arsenite adsorbents nasir et al 2018 it was found that the synthesized zif l had a maximum uptake of arsenite of 44 mg g at ph 10 and room temperature hydroxyl substitution forming inner sphere complexes together with electrostatic interaction referencing to the surface charge of zif l played the major role for arsenite adsorption in addition to direct use of raw zifs huo et al fabricated water stable magnetic responsive fe3o4 zif 8 composites for the adsorptive removal of as iii from aqueous solutions huo et al 2018 fe3o4 zif 8 possessed a core shell structure fe3o4 as core and zif 8 as shell with a high surface area 1133 m2 g the composites had a maximum as iii uptake capacity of 100 mg g which might be originated from strong surface complex interaction the adsorption appeared to be a spontaneous endothermic and entropy increase process moreover zif 8 was combined with 1d β mno2 by jian et al to achieve concurrent oxidation and adsorptive removal of arsenite jian et al 2016 the synthesized β mno2 zif 8 exhibited a great mechanical stability and high surface area of 883 m2 g it could achieve an improved as iii adsorption capacity of 140 mg g compared to that of zif 8 bulk which was due to the oxidation ability of β mno2 in the core of this composite its unique 1d nanostructure sufficiently prevented the agglomeration problem of zif 8 particles in the aqueous solution the composites in the form of nanowires could be easily separated from aqueous media after settling for 30 min besides the zif materials wang et al reported a mil 100 fe based filter for the efficient removal of as iii from synthetic groundwater wang et al 2018 mil 100 fe is implanted on the substrate of a commercially available iron mesh to serves as a dual functional system for the oxidation of as iii and the adsorption of the resulted as v complete removal of as iii can be achieved within 6 h with the aid of oxygen and joule heating the satisfactory structural stability and recycle performance promoted the filter to be used for remediating arsenic contamination in groundwater moreover mils were also used to form magnetic composites and applied for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v the magnetic composites are preferred in practical applications due to their magnetic responsive properties for easy harnessing and separation from post treatment water solutions yang et al developed cofe2o4 mil 100 fe hybrid magnetic nanoparticles yang and yin 2017 which were able to remove 100 μg l as iii and as v within 2 min the rapid adsorption kinetics may be due to its mesoporous structure with an average diameter of 260 nm this cofe2o4 mil 100 fe composite exhibited adsorption capacities of 144 mg g for as iii and 115 mg g for as v its adsorption efficiency would not be affected by the presence of inorganic ions so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 po4 3 ca2 and mg2 or natural organic substances owing to the electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion effects of the mil 100 fe shell the mechanism analysis suggested that the capture of as v and as iii on cofe2o4 mil 100 fe occurred via terminal hydroxyl groups substitution with the formation of fe o as complexes the relatively higher adsorption capacity of as iii might be attributed to hydrogen bonding which resulted in a multi layer adsorption of neutral as iii species whereas the adsorption of ionic as v species was a monolayer reaction process besides folens et al developed fe3o4 mil 101 cr folens et al 2016 which delivered adsorption capacities of 121 and 80 mg g for as iii and as v respectively the structural integrity of this hybrid nano material could be well maintained during the adsorption process and even after desorption whilst no significant leaching of cr or fe elements was observed throughout further to zifs and mils studies using uio mofs brought more insights to better understand arsenite uptake mechanisms in 2016 audu et al reported a dual capture of as v and as iii via the application of uio 66 and its thiolated derivative uio 66 sh 2 audu et al 2016 the uptakes of as v and as iii were 40 mg g and 10 mg g respectively after 6 h it was found that the thiolated uio 66 provided a significantly improved as iii adsorption performance compared to the non functionalized analogues which infers the critical role of characteristic organic linkers for as iii removal this work represented a promising adsorptive strategy for effective elimination of the mixed arsenic pollution the detailed mechanism analysis suggested that the as v species interacted with the zr6o4 oh 4 cluster nodes whilst the as iii species majorly coordinated with the thiolated ligands sh groups as shown in fig 3 in 2018 he et al also studied the as iii v removal performance by uio 66 and uio 66 nh2 he et al 2018 it was reported that at ph 9 2 uio 66 had exceptional removal capacities of 205 and 68 mg g for as iii and as v respectively the adsorption performance of these zr mofs remained stable after six adsorption desorption test cycles the as removal processes were determined to be exothermic chemisorption reactions fixed bed reactor removal experiments were conducted which confirmed the number of effective treatment volumes reached 2270 and 1775 bed volumes for as iii and as v respectively capable of remediating 100 μg l contaminated water to meet the regulation standard 10 μg l ftir and xps studies indicated that zr oh groups in zr mofs played a critical role in arsenic adsorption whilst the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes study revealed that arsenic adsorption on zr mofs would not change the materials oxidation states the x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra demonstrated that it formed bidentate mononuclear complexes for as v and bidentate binuclear complexes for as iii on the hexanuclear zr clusters of zr mofs hence with the advantages of nontoxicity great stability excellent adsorption capacity low cost and easy availability zr mof uio 66 has a promising future for arsenic contaminated water remediation furthermore shen et al adopted a slightly different strategy by using the photocatalytic oxidation ability to remove as iii over uio 66 and its functionalized derivatives uio 66 x x nh2 no2 and br shen et al 2015 it was found that uio 66 nh2 had the highest catalytic performance according to the apparent first order rate constants followed by uio 66 uio 66 br and uio 66 no2 this might be due to the greater electron density of organic ligands by introducing an electron donator nh2 which improves the transfer of photo induced charge carriers and enhances the photocatalytic capability for as iii oxidation lastly some very recent studies explored the capability of mof 74 for the removal of inorganic arsenic species yu et al reported that crystal zn mof 74 can effectively remove both as v and as iii yu et al 2019 leading to adsorption capacities of 325 mg g and 211 mg g respectively the removal mechanism as unveiled by ir and xps studies was due to the zn o as coordination interactions between the open metal sites and the specific arsenic species moreover sun et al prepared a novel nanostructured fe co based mof 74 adsorbent for both as iii and as v sun et al 2019 the fe co mof 74 nanoparticles had a spherical structure with diameters ranging from 60 to 100 nm and the specific surface area was 148 m2 g it had the maximum adsorption capacities toward as iii and as v as 266 and 292 mg g respectively the adsorption performance as well as the adsorbent structures remained stable after regeneration 4 3 mof based materials for organoarsenic removal the number of reports on organoarenic removal by mofs is generally lower than that of inorganic arsenic species removal there are several meaningful studies conducted by jhung s group to assess the capability of organoarsenic species removal by typical mof based materials firstly jung et al carried out a study to assess the adsorption capacities of p arsanilic acid asa using mesoporous zif 8 materials jung et al 2015 the excellent adsorption capacity and facile regeneration towards spent adsorbents suggested that mesoporous zif 8 has a great potential in the adsorptive removal of organoarsenic compounds such as asa the mechanism study indicated that electrostatic interactions between the positively charged zif 8 surface and the anionic forms of asa controlled this highly efficient adsorption process secondly jun et al investigated the adsorption of asa and roxarsone rox with regards to a variety of porous materials including mil 100 fe mil 100 al mil 100 cr activated carbon zeolite hy and goethite jun et al 2015 in particular mil 100 fe exhibited the highest adsorption capacity it was shown that water binds less preferably onto mil 100 fe than other mil 100 analogues whilst asa and rox could coordinate more strongly to mil 100 fe binding to the coordinatively unsaturated sites cuss thirdly sarker et al compared the adsorption efficiency of phenylarsonic acid paa and asa onto functionalized mil 101 i e mil 101 oh and mil 101 oh 3 with that of pristine mil 101 and commercial ac sarker et al 2017 the highly porous mil 101 bearing three hydroxyl groups mil 101 oh 3 exhibited remarkable paa and asa adsorption capacities it was suggested that hydrogen bonding was the key for organoarsenic species adsorption whilst organoarsenic species and mil 101 oh 3 were respectively the hydrogen bond acceptors and donors mil 101 oh 3 could be regenerated by acidic ethanol treatment which renders it a promising adsorbent for the removal of paa and asa from water furthermore lv et al employed an amino functionalized indium based nh2 mil 68 in for asa adsorption lv et al 2018 it was found that the key adsorption mechanism involves both π π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions between nh2 mil 68 in and asa the introduced nh2 groups on mil 68 in did not affect π π stacking interactions between aryl units but greatly improved both the adsorption capacity 401 mg g and adsorption rate through hydrogen bonding enhancement the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic and nh2 mil 68 in exhibited an excellent reusability moreover li et al prepared uio 66 with tunable missing linker defects using different amounts of synthesis modulators li et al 2016 and applied the materials for the efficient decontamination of rox from wastewater the defects in uio 66 not only resulted in an enhanced porosity but also induced the creation of zr oh groups that served as the main active adsorption sites for efficient rox uptake these resulted in an excellent adsorptive capacity 730 mg g and fast adsorption kinetics 30 min the outstanding adsorption behaviors render this water stable material a great potential choice for organic pollutants removal besides tian et al synthesized an amine modified uio 67 uio 67 nh2 and applied it for asa adsorption tian et al 2018 detailed analysis revealed that the contribution of different adsorption forces followed an order of as o zr coordination π π stacking h bonding the amine groups in uio 67 nh2 played a critical role in enhancing the adsorption affinity through strengthening the as o zr coordination and π π stacking as well as forming new adsorption sites through hydrogen bonding 5 insights and perspectives after surveying the relevant literature of aquatic arsenic removal using mofs this section analyzes the information by identifying some significant trends in those reports comparing mofs with other arsenic removal materials evaluating the practical feasibility of mofs and synthesizing the findings into future outlooks for further development 5 1 analysis of literature information regarding the functional mofs and their applications for aquatic arsenic removal has been summarized in table 2 scanning through these studies it is apparent that many reported mofs possess desirable features for decontamination applications their basic performance characteristics removal mechanisms and strategies to tune the materials for optimal behaviors can be identified for a holistic understanding 5 1 1 performance basic characteristics overall mof based materials especially highly water stable ones can function across a wide range of water conditions having adsorption capacities ranging from a few mg g to hundreds of mg g most of them exhibit excellent kinetic behaviors requiring between several minutes to hours to establish adsorption equilibria they also demonstrate great selectivity and strong anti interference towards common co existing ions e g ca2 mg2 so4 2 co3 2 cl and no3 natural organic matters and water matrices e g groundwater and surface water more importantly these mofs could provide not only excellent adsorptive capability but are able to retain the performance efficacy over a series of application cycles amongst the reported mof adsorbents iron and zirconium based mofs are the most extensively studied materials this is due to their intrinsic advantages such as readily obtained raw materials with nontoxic metal source good biocompatibility and distinguished physicochemical features e g high porosity framework flexibility and chemical stability properties generally uio 66 and some fe based mofs exhibit the best adsorption performance 5 1 2 arsenic removal mechanisms removal of aquatic arsenic by mof based materials is mainly owed to the adsorptive behaviors of mofs thermodynamic investigations hint the spontaneous characteristics of these adsorption processes a series of isotherm studies suggest that the adsorption of as v and organoarsenic is more likely a homogeneous monolayer process described by the langmuir model whilst as iii is more prone to follow the freundlich model on the other hand the adsorption kinetics could normally be modeled by the pseudo second order kinetic equation inferring that complexation effects chemisorptions dominate the uptake process with the aids of spectroscopic tools researchers have identified the critical role of terminal hydroxyl groups for arsenic complexation leading to the formation of m o as m metal complexes within the mof structures moreover other functional groups e g amino group nh2 and thiol group sh introduced to mof structures could as well facilitate the arsenic process this was clearly explained by audu et al who claimed mofs could chemoselectively capture as v oxyanions at the hydroxylated node and neutral as iii species with the thiolated organic linkers audu et al 2016 besides some attractive interactions including electrostatic interactions effects of hydrogen bonding van der waals forces etc between mofs and arsenic species could be assistive to the uptake process li et al 2018 since most mofs carry definite surface charges in a specific aqueous environment there is an obvious tendency for them to attract the oppositely charged arsenic species if present moreover van der waals forces always exist and their enforcing extent is dependent upon the material s surface area wen et al 2018 as some mofs possess large surface area and porosity van der waals forces shall contribute to the arsenic uptake process by the highly porous structures 5 1 3 performance enhancement strategies the literature reveals that more efficient and faster uptake can be achieved with increasing the density of active sites and making these sites internal to mofs easily accessible achieved by enlarging the pore aperture size or reducing the particle size a few effective approaches to enhance the adsorption performance of mofs include i adopting longer organic ligands to improve pore size which may facilitate the diffusion of target pollutants through mofs cavka et al 2008 howarth et al 2015 ii applying proper defect engineering to enlarge their pore size and introduce extra adsorption sites as well as to make mofs more hydrophilic ghosh et al 2014 li et al 2017b shearer et al 2016 iii introducing functionalities e g nh2 oh and sh in organic linkers to offer additional adsorption sites and improve selectivity li et al 2017a luo et al 2015 2016 iv introducing functionalities at the metal nodes via post synthetic ligand exchange and post synthetic modification methods liang et al 2016 liu et al 2014a peng et al 2016 the functional groups of which may be more active than those incorporated into the organic ligands because of steric hindrance v constructing mof based composites via the hybridization of mofs with other functional materials such as magnetic materials e g fe3o4 or separation media e g filters min et al 2017 ricco et al 2015 yang et al 2017 which would improve the applicability of mofs for an easy recovery from solutions and synergistic effects amongst different components within the composites rapti et al 2016 5 2 comparison with other arsenic removal materials to date many materials have been studied for aquatic arsenic removal which includes activated carbon metal oxides zeolites layered doubled hydroxides ldhs laterite soil etc baig et al 2015 gallegos garcia et al 2012 goh et al 2008 guan et al 2012 hao et al 2018 lata and samadder 2016 mohan and pittman 2007 nicomel et al 2015 pal 2010 sarkar and paul 2016 singh et al 2015 yu et al 2018 their capabilities for this particular application have been comprehensively studied firstly the advantage of some naturally available materials is the cost effectiveness for instance the raw material prices of silica and clay are quite cheap ca 0 1 0 2 kg babel and kurniawan 2003 however these materials cannot provide sufficient adsorption capacities as well as selectivity and many other water contaminants can deactivate their functionalities much lowering the removal efficiency secondly activated carbon has been studied for various adsorption applications but in the case of ionic adsorption it could only remove a few milligrams of metal ions per gram of activated carbon and can hardly be regenerated without substantial treatment thirdly iron or iron compounds represent the majority of commercial products they normally have strong affinities to arsenic species together with simultaneous oxidation ability however their adsorption efficiency is high only at low ph conditions and their reusability is limited finally there are some advanced composites synthesized in laboratories for effective arsenic removal but they are quite expensive in terms of production cost for instance yu et al reported an yttrium manganese binary composite which displayed an outstanding as v adsorption capacity 280 mg g at neutral ph yu et al 2015 it required 25 h to reach equilibrium and could be easily regenerated however it could only work efficiently across a limited ph range of 5 7 its synthesis process was very complicated and costly and when they are recycled the product quality can hardly be maintained further to these conventional adsorbents mofs could provide greater adsorption capacities e g 303 mg g with respect to uio 66 and able to work over a much wider ph range from very acidic to basic conditions the excellent performance of mofs is associated with the higher accessible surface area and more active sites for the arsenic uptake to take place normally conventional bulk adsorbents are limited by the non accessible bulk volume of which the active sites are only present on the outer surface as shown in fig 4 zhu et al 2012 to enlarge the adsorbent s surface area and consequently improve adsorption capacities efforts shall be made to reduce the particle size nonetheless decreasing particle sizes requires additional energy input not to mention that the aggregation of nanoparticles may deteriorate the adsorbents stabilities and functionalities mofs represent a new strategy by providing tailored porous host and permanent framework structure for adsorption applications the structure with void spaces and passage channels allows targeting species to diffuse and interact with interior functional sites these sites could either be due to metal nodes or organic ligands and as a consequence mofs expose more active sites for adsorptions compared to most conventional nanoparticles in unit space wang et al 2015 moreover mofs can be readily designed and modified to suit the specific application purpose via a variety of methods such as ligand decoration defects engineering metal sites functionalization etc deria et al 2014 fang et al 2015 kim et al 2012 abundant active reactive sites distributed throughout the fine structures can be utilized to a large extent with sufficient chemical stability it is certain that mofs could be the state of art option contributing to highly efficient arsenic removal process 5 3 evaluation on practical applicability to promote mofs for industrial scale applications it is requested to understand the materials production cost water stability capability to work with real water samples and solutions to resolve the material loss problem 5 3 1 material cost concerns cost appears to be the first and foremost concerning issue for mofs to be applied in contaminated water remediations majorly mofs are synthesized via solvothermal methods which used a fairly low temperatures e g 120 c the main contributors to mof production prices are the solvent and ligand costs which account for more than 70 of the material cost to date with the continuing efforts by the material scientists and chemical engineers syntheses of functional mofs have been optimized to be quite facile and cost effective some of the mofs can be successfully prepared at room temperature without any thermal energy input or without the use of toxic organic solvents hu and zhao 2015 jabbari et al 2016 julien et al 2017 and they are still able to remove aquatic arsenic species effectively moreover desantis et al conducted a techno economic analysis to evaluate the cost of industrial scale mof synthesis the researchers identified that the production prices of representative mofs i e mof 5 hkust 1 ni2 dobdc mg2 dobdc can be controlled to 8 10 kg with an optimized process and alternative synthesis methods like liquid assisted grinding and aqueous synthesis it was also recognized that a fully continuous synthesis operation with incorporation of chemical recycling designs has the potential to further reduce the production cost 5 3 2 water stability metal leaching concerns there were considerable negative claims on mofs due to the materials limited hydrothermal stability in earlier reports wang et al 2016b since mofs contain metal ion nodes when the materials cannot maintain the structural robustness in water solutions the metal ions would leach into water and induce severe secondary contamination thus preventing this potential metal leaching is critical if mofs are to be widely used in water treatment thus far the water stability of mofs has undergone substantial improvement over the past years as discussed in section 3 more and more water stable mofs have been developed to sustain and steadily function at a variety of extreme water conditions feng et al 2018 wang et al 2016b moreover in relevant studies by li et al and folens et al the researchers have examined if there is leaching of metal elements belong to the mof adsorbents i e aluminum and chromium respectively throughout the application processes folens et al 2016 li et al 2014b none of the metal signals was detected 5 3 3 realistic water tests it is admitted that most of the current studies dealt with synthetic water samples simply introducing the corresponding arsenic species to pure water as contaminated water feed in laboratory settings in reality however water bodies carry many more additional substances e g other ionic compounds organic matters suspended solids micro organisms etc which may complicate the arsenic removal process as observed in the literature most mofs could sustain their adsorption efficacy when co existing with the common ions in addition to that some researchers have conducted the tests that applied mofs under realistic water conditions to validate their application feasibility for instance sun et al reported that the prepared fe co mof 74 adsorbent had stable adsorption ability even when it was used in a real water matrix sun et al 2019 yang et al collected real arsenic containing water samples from a rural well in shanxi china and applied cofe2o4 mil 100 fe for decontamination the researchers even assembled a simple water filter by packing cofe2o4 mil 100 fe for the simultaneous removal of particle impurities and arsenic pollutants the test results validated the mof based materials excellent performance besides researchers also simulated the natural water conditions from which mofs were tested for arsenic removal e g the mil 100 fe filter developed by wang et al can efficiently remove arsenic from synthetic groundwater wang et al 2018 and uio 67 nh2 prepared by tian et al can remediate the simulated natural and wastewater with asa pollution tian et al 2018 5 3 4 spent mofs separation issues spent materials separation is an important issue that must be considered if mofs are to be used at full scale installations this is because most of the mofs are synthesized as powder forms and in practical applications dispersed particles would easily leak out from the treatment compartment resulting in severe material loss and ineffectiveness of treatment strategies to resolve this problem include fabricating magnetic mof based materials that can be easily retrieved via magnetic forces and combining mofs with filtration media to ensure a secure support and efficient contact relevant studies were carried out by yang et al and huo et al who fabricated magnetic nanocomposites huo et al 2018 2019 yang and yin 2017 as well as by wang et al and he et al who developed conceptual adsorptive membranes with hybrid adsorption filtration behaviors for arsenic removal he et al 2017 wang et al 2016a 5 4 future outlooks taking all the findings together mof based materials have emerged to be a highly effective selective and stable option for aqueous removal of arsenic species however one cannot deny the fact that substantial work must be done before mofs can be widely used in practice although many concerns regarding their application feasibility have been gradually tackled over recent years these issues still need to be investigated more closely at the next stage right now the primary issue of mofs is up scaling of the synthesis process which was seldom addressed by researchers currently most mofs are synthesized via solvothermal or hydrothermal methods and it requires the use of a large amount of organic solvents like n n dimethylformamide dmf and methanol furukawa et al 2013 rowsell and yaghi 2004 stock and biswas 2012 to synthesize mofs in large quantities without deteriorating the materials properties at industrial levels scientists and engineers shall work together to develop preferable strategies and processes taking into account the scaling effect of reactions as well as the environmental influence of waste solvents moreover although most mofs can be prepared under mild conditions the materials still appear to be rather costly compared to the readily available carbonaceous materials more work shall be carried out to make mofs a cost effective option for applications e g strategies for minimizing solvent usage and exploration for constructive organic ligands with much cheaper prices focusing on the effective aquatic arsenic removal by mof based materials future studies should put more efforts in understanding the detailed mechanism the mofs well defined crystalline structures provide an invaluable platform for in depth analyses of arsenic removal mechanisms besides further development should concentrate on the applicability improvements through proper material engineering and chemical engineering some strategies that scientist could consider for exploration include 1 developing mofs with greener synthesis and greater application efficacy 2 modifying mofs to provide ultrahigh porosity and enriched active sites through the introduction of multiple metal organic functional groups or further complexity to the crystalline structures 3 preparing novel and multifunctional mof based platforms such as hybrid mof on mof heteroarchitectures 4 synthesizing multi component hybrid mof composites via chemical decorations with functional materials such as quantum dots ionic liquids carbon based materials and zeolites 5 studying the effect of defects in mof structures or developing amorphous mofs for certain applications 6 investigating the effects of antimony sb or similar anions e g phosphate and fluoride on arsenic adsorption more carefully as arsenic normally occurs together with these compounds in water and they share numerous similarities in chemical properties and toxicity ungureanu et al 2015 6 conclusion amongst many methods and materials reported to date the unique physio chemical properties of mofs and their excellent removal efficiency towards arsenic have attracted growing attentions in academic and industrial communities in this review article the characteristics of the mofs and their adsorption performance recently reported mostly from 2014 to 2019 were systemically reviewed and summarized the information has been sorted according to the arsenic species mofs materials and application effectiveness by carefully analyzing these studies significant insights are identified and directions for future studies are suggested overall this critical review provides an updated and clearer understanding of aquatic arsenic removal by mofs in consideration of the great application potential of mof based materials for water treatment with further research and development the materials could be promoted for successful industrial use in the foreseeable future funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors acknowledgements

near future graphical abstract image 10916 keywords mofs arsenic adsorbents decontamination water treatment 1 introduction arsenic contamination is a global threat due to its acute toxicity and carcinogenicity exposure to arsenic polluted water would result in such severe health problems as liver lung kidney and skin cancers hence arsenic has been categorized by world health organization who as the priority issue amongst the toxic substances abdul et al 2015 mandal and suzuki 2002 due to the high mobility of arsenate species in water streams as well as its ease in accumulation in the food chain and the human body effective removal of aquatic arsenate has been an important topic in water treatment sarkar and paul 2016 singh et al 2015 metal organic frameworks mofs a new class of hybrid porous materials built from organic linkers and inorganic metal or metal containing cluster nodes through coordination bonds have attracted tremendous attention in the recent decade rowsell and yaghi 2004 zhou et al 2012 benefitting from the desirable features like great surface areas high porosities customizable functionalities and versatile architectures mofs are considered as a group of state of the art materials compared to the conventional porous ones li et al 2012 wang et al 2016b researchers have been looking into the possibilities of applying mofs in the effective removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater especially with regards to the arsenic species li et al 2018 wang et al 2016b this review aims at comprehensively surveying the significant studies on the topic of arsenic contaminated water remediation based on mofs relevant information including the materials characteristic structures application approaches removal performance interaction mechanisms as well as spectroscopy analyses was systematically reviewed and discussed moreover the feasibility of applying mofs in aquatic arsenic removal was assessed taking into account the cost effectiveness and the further development potentials a careful comparison with other arsenic removal techniques and conventional materials was also be conducted at the end insightful perspectives and suggestions for future studies can be found overall this review could serve as a guide book with respect to arsenic pollutants removal using mofs with the purpose of assisting field related scientists and engineers to gain a better understanding of the materials and their associated decontamination behaviors 2 arsenic contamination and conventional removal technologies arsenic is a metalloid element of group va in the periodic table which normally exist in oxidation states as as iii as 0 as iii and as v mandal and suzuki 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 arsenic is ubiquitous in our environment and it is a component of more than 245 minerals including elemental arsenic arsenides arsentates arsenites etc a variety of natural biological as well as anthropogenic activities could mobilize arsenic species across minerals atmosphere and water bodies arsenic species can be categorized into organic and inorganic subtypes cullen and reimer 1989 in natural environment trace levels of organic arsenic could be detected and typical forms include e g methyl arsenic acid mma and dimethyl arsenic acid dma etc moreover inorganic arsenic is mostly contributed by as v arsenate and as iii arenite which form arsenious acids h3aso3 arsenic acids h3aso4 and their related ionic compounds they mostly exist in water solutions for instance as v is prevalent in oxygenated surface water streams whilst as iii is present in groundwater and other water bodies with reducing conditions mohan and pittman 2007 typically arsenic contamination comes from pesticides herbicides crop desiccants combustion of fossil fuels mining and smelting in semi conductor industries sarkar and paul 2016 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 it could rapidly accumulate to act as a severe threat to the environment and human health as estimated more than 60 000 tons of arsenic is emitted into the environment annually sarkar and paul 2016 the toxicity of arsenic has been well analyzed and clinically studied abdul et al 2015 hughes 2002 as a dangerous carcinogen arsenic could induce severe poisoning on human health mohan and pittman 2007 low to moderate levels of arsenic exposure 10 300 μg l through drinking water could result in skin lesions circulatory disorders neurological complications diabetes respiratory complications hepatic and renal dysfunction mortality etc the ingestion of high concentrations of arsenic causes acute poisoning with symptoms such as vomiting oesophageal and abdominal pain bloody diarrhea and encephalopathy with symptoms such as headache mental confusion and coma abdul et al 2015 chronic exposure to arsenic leads to several disorders on our biological systems such as the digestive respiratory cardiovascular hematopoietic endocrine renal neurological and reproductive systems which ultimately lead to cancer singh et al 2015 it was reported that ca 150 million people are exposed to arsenic contamination from drinking water and this figure continues to escalate mandal and suzuki 2002 murcott 2012 episodes of arsenic pollution have been found in many regions all over the world especially in southern asia and south west america and recently in china and united states as well liu et al 2002 typically more than 45 million people majority in asia bangladesh and india still drink severely arsenic contaminated water chakraborti et al 2003 chen et al 2009 mazumder et al 2000 this threat caused by arsenic contamination could easily spread owing to globalization nowadays rooted from arsenic s substantial toxicity and the wide spread of arsenic contamination the international agency for research on cancer iarc united states environmental protection agency usepa and who have all classified them as a group a carcinogen järup 2003 these international regulation authorities have established a series of stringent standards for controlling arsenic residuals in drinkable water a provisional guideline of 10 μg l as the maximum arsenic level in drinking water is requested according to the public health service standards mohan and pittman 2007 the most commonly applied methods for arsenic removal include oxidization dutta et al 2005 leupin and hug 2005 coprecipitation gallagher et al 2004 wang et al 2011 ion exchange he et al 2012 kim and benjamin 2004 membrane filtration sabbatini et al 2010 yu et al 2013 adsorption gallegos garcia et al 2012 guan et al 2012 mohan and pittman 2007 pal 2010 etc in addition it was reported that certain biological techniques have been available for remediating arsenic contaminated water srivastava et al 2011 these major arsenic removal technologies are compared in table 1 amongst them adsorption using porous materials is regarded as one of the most effective methods due to the high efficiency low cost and ease in operation mohan and pittman 2007 intensive studies have been carried out to develop various adsorbents for arsenic removal and some commercial adsorbents are as well available wang et al 2015 despite that the arsenic adsorption capacity of conventional adsorbents like activated carbons activated alumina and powdered zeolite is unsatisfactory mohan and pittman 2007 wang et al 2015 in order to further improve the adsorption capacity strategic methods including reducing the particle size of adsorbents or preparing materials with hierarchically ordered structures were employed yu et al 2018 these approaches may increase the surface area of adsorbent for efficient contact however they could complicate the synthesis process and consequently raise the production cost thus a new generation of porous materials providing better performance i e greater adsorption capacity fast kinetics tunable functionality for selectivity sufficient reusability etc is on demand for adsorptive removal of arsenic contamination from water 3 mofs and their applications mofs have been attracting a great deal of attention in the past decade it is by definition a class of crystalline porous materials consisting of metal nodes i e metal ions or clusters and organic linkers connected via coordination bonds furukawa et al 2013 rowsell and yaghi 2004 zhou et al 2012 the commonly used metals for construction of mofs include ag i cu ii mg ii zn ii co ii fe iii al iii ln iii zr iv and so on which can adopt various coordination geometries such as trigonal bipyramidal pyramidal square tetrahedral and octahedral as connections to the metals organic linkers such as amines carboxylates sulfonates and phosphates are also key components for mof synthesis through the formation of ordered framework structures mofs demonstrate a series of great features e g large surface area controlled porosity structural tailorability and high crystallinity eddaoudi et al 2002 kitagawa et al 2004 typically the surface areas of mofs range from 1000 to 10 000 m2 g exceeding those of traditional porous materials like activated carbon and zeolites furukawa et al 2013 owing to their advantageous characteristics mofs have been studied for a variety of applications including adsorption and separation gas storage drug delivery sensing proton conduction etc eddaoudi et al 2002 li et al 1999 however due to the lability of ligand metal bonds the earliest reported mofs are sensitive to water content and not yet preferred in applications for instance one of the milestone mofs mof 5 would decompose gradually upon exposure to a humid environment wang et al 2016b with the unceasing efforts to study and improve the stability of mofs more and more water stable mofs have recently emerged for a wide range of water involved applications feng et al 2018 these hydro stable mof structures normally possess strong coordination bonds or significant steric hindrance to prevent the detrimental hydrolysis process that breaks the metal ligand bonds typically water stable mofs could be categorized into three major types 1 metal carboxylate frameworks consisting of high valence metal ions e g uio 66 and mil family 2 metal azolate frameworks containing nitrogen donor ligands e g zifs 3 mofs functionalized by hydrophobic pore surfaces or with blocked metal ions wang et al 2016b therefore over the recent years researchers have been looking into the feasibility of water stable mofs or mof based composites for the removal of unfavorable targets from aqueous media feng et al 2018 kobielska et al 2018 li et al 2018 wang et al 2016b wen et al 2018 it is worthy to note that some of them could provide excellent stability even under harsh conditions kandiah et al 2010 li et al 2018 and can be synthesized on a large scale through cost effective and facile preparation methods kandiah et al 2010 stock and biswas 2012 taking into account the intrinsic features like ordered porous structures versatile architecture and tunable functionalities mofs should present as a promising next generation material with great efficiencies for water treatment when applied for contaminated water remediation mofs could be directly used as adsorbents or combined as separation media wang et al 2016b fig 1 summarizes the development milestones of mofs water stable mofs mofs used for water decontamination applications and particularly for aquatic arsenic removal the key performance indicators of an adsorption process e g adsorption capacity kinetics thermodynamics selectivity stability and reusability are controlled by the mofs highly ordered porous structures surface area hydrophilicity functionality pore size and distribution etc 4 survey of arsenic removal by mofs this section surveys the reported studies that applied mof based materials for arsenic removal the key characteristics of materials removal performance and mechanisms are summarized herein the presentation logic is according to the targeting arsenic species arsenate as v arsenite as iii and organic arsenic organoarsenic several studies analyzed the capability of mofs for both as v and as iii removal they are combined with the work focusing on arsenite as iii in the subsection 4 2 generally in each subsection mofs with similar origins i e rooting in the same family like zifs mils uios etc are discussed together 4 1 mof based materials for as v removal the first mof used to remove arsenic species from water solutions was fe btc reported by zhu et al in 2012 zhu et al 2012 fe btc is a mof containing iron nodes and 1 3 5 benzenetricarboxylic linkers it was synthesized through a facile solvothermal method under an autogenous pressure and applied as the adsorbents for as v uptake across a ph range of 2 10 the optimal condition was ph 4 at which fe btc could achieve an adsorption capacity of 12 3 mg g this was more than 6 times as high as that of fe2o3 nanoparticles 50 nm size and 36 times higher than that of commercially available powdered iron oxide analyzed by infrared ir measurements the appearance of a new ir band at 824 cm 1 corresponding with fe o as groups confirmed the adsorption of as v species moreover the transmission electron microscopy tem confirmed that as v adsorption took place on interior sites of the mof interacting with the frameworks fe nodes overall this was one of the milestone studies in regards to arsenic removal by mofs unveiling the potential of these materials for the capture of arsenic species even though the adsorption capacity was not stunning further to that researchers started looking into the classic mofs e g zifs and mils for arsenic removal li et al reported that zif 8 exhibited an adsorption capacity of 76 5 mg g at a low equilibrium concentration 9 8 μg l compared to that of active carbon 3 mg g and zeolite 13 92 mg g li et al 2014a the mechanism studies suggested that the adsorption was attributed to the large amount of external active sites zn oh produced through the dissociative adsorption of water and subsequently formed inner sphere complexes with the arsenate species further to that massoudinejad et al prepared ethylenediamine functionalized zif 8 with cubic structures for arsenic adsorption from aqueous solutions massoudinejad et al 2018 it was found that after functionalization the arsenic adsorption capacity increased from 72 to 83 5 mg per gram of adsorbent the equilibrium time of pristine zif 8 and ed zif 8 for arsenic adsorption was approximately 5 and 6 h respectively besides wu et al assessed the adsorption capacity of zif 8 particles prepared in different solvents and co templates wu et al 2014 it was found that zif 8 synthesized in water has the lowest capacity whilst the hierarchically structured zif 8 synthesized with surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and amino acid l histidine could achieve better adsorption performance in particular the adsorption capacity of 91 mg g was observed for hierarchical zif 8 with dual micro mesoporosity this might be due to the mesostructured pores and enhanced porosity which facilitate mass transfer within the open framework of zif 8 besides the abundant active sites zn oh formed by water dissolution could bind as v species more effectively besides zifs mil family is another representative class of mofs applied for as v removal férey et al 2005 li et al studied mil 53 al which could function efficiently across a ph range of 6 8 li et al 2014b it exhibited a decent as v adsorption capacity of 106 mg g at the optimal condition of ph 8 which could be accomplished within 11 h it was suggested by the fourier transform infrared ftir and x ray photoelectron xps data that the adsorption mechanism was due to the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions its structural integrity was preserved throughout the experiments and no aluminum ion was detected in the post adsorption solutions ensuring the safety of using this material for application in drinking water treatment moreover vu et al reported the adsorption of as v by mil 53 fe which had an adsorption capacity of 21 mg g vu et al 2015 the mof was synthesized via hf free solvothermal methods and demonstrated an excellent adsorption kinetics which required only 60 150 min to reach equilibrium the adsorption mechanism was suggested to be based on a lewis acid base interaction between the anionic arsenate species and cationic fe node several studies used mil 88 in different forms for arsenate removal firstly wu et al reported that iron based mil 88a microrods could deliver a high adsorption rate and an excellent uptake capacity of 145 mg g wu et al 2018 this might be resulted from the large number of channels and cages in its framework and therefore as v was not only adsorbed onto the materials surfaces but also throughout its interiors secondly hou et al reported an environmentally friendly route for the preparation of iron based mil 88b and evaluated its capability for arsenate removal hou et al 2018 the synthesis occurred at room temperature without heating and did not include the use of toxic organic solvents extremely dangerous hydrofluoric acid or strong alkali mil 88b exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity of 156 mg g and the mechanism study suggested that as v molecules coordinated with the oxygen molecules of feo clusters in the framework thirdly gu et al demonstrated an effective strategy to fabricate the bimetallic fe mg mil 88b gu et al 2019 the synergetic contribution from two active metal centers renders fe mg mil 88b a better arsenate adsorbent than the monometallic fe mil 88b it exhibited an impressive decontamination performance towards arsenate species including a remarkable uptake capacity 303 mg g considerably fast adsorption rate broad ph working range strong anti interference exceptional regeneration and structural stability as well as excellent cycling stability fourthly xie et al fabricated a dual functional nh2 mil 88 fe nanooctahedra for highly sensitive detection and efficient removal of as v from polluted water xie et al 2017 the material exhibited a high saturated adsorption capacity of 125 mg g and fast sorption kinetics capable of reducing the trace as v content to meet the regulated standard 10 μg l within 60 min in addition cai et al discovered that mil 100 fe had an excellent as v adsorption capacity of 110 mg g with sufficient reusability and selectivity in the presence of common anions cai et al 2016 it was found in the ftir study that the adsorption was accomplished through the formation of fe o as v complexes within the mil 100 fe structures the uptake of arsenate species blocked the uniform mesoporous channels of mil 100 fe and upon arsenic desorption the long range order of porous structure recovered immediately as comparative studies liu et al calcined mil 100 fe at different temperatures to form α fe2o3 for as v removal liu et al 2014b whereas the adsorption capacities of the metal oxides ranged merely between 70 and 95 mg g similarly hei et al used mil 100 fe to fabricate γ fe2o3 by facile thermolysis hei et al 2014 which has an adsorption capacity for as v of 90 mg g these studies validated the characteristic advantages of using mofs in aquatic arsenic removal moving forward from the zifs and mils miscellaneous mofs have been developed and evaluated for arsenate removal atallah et al synthesized a chemically stable porous indium based aubm 1 atallah et al 2018 which displayed a great arsenate uptake capacity of 103 mg g at neutral ph it was found that its adsorption was an endothermic process and followed a pseudo second order kinetic model zhang et al synthesized a microporous tetranuclear co ii based mof co mof which revealed an excellent adsorption property on removing as v zhang et al 2018 co mof could work at ph 4 10 and had the maximal adsorption capacity of 96 mg g lv et al studied the adsorption performance of ni mof for arsenic v species lv et al 2019 and confirmed its maximum adsorption capacity as 134 mg g lastly representing a group of highly stable mofs zirconium based mofs have shown exceptional adsorption behaviors for arsenic removal cavka et al 2008 furukawa et al 2014 kandiah et al 2010 li et al prepared mof 808 with nano order particle sizes for as v adsorption li et al 2015 the mof 808 adsorbent showed an adsorption capacity of 25 mg g at ph 4 it was also found that more than 80 of the adsorption efficiency can be retained after five regeneration reuse cycles the adsorption mechanism was attributed to the interactions between as v ions and the zr sites in mof 808 wang et al reported a milestone study in 2015 using water stable zr mof uio 66 to remove as v wang et al 2015 the uio 66 adsorbents provided a superior adsorption capacity of 303 mg g at ph 2 which was much higher than those of other synthetic or commercial adsorbents 5 280 mg g generally 100 mg g uio 66 was efficient across a wide ph range from 1 to 10 and its adsorption efficiency was not affected by the presence of typical anions no3 cl so4 2 and co3 2 the mechanism analysis suggested that the terminal hydroxyl groups and organic ligands were the main adsorption sites which captured as v ions to the zr6 nodes via the formation of zr o as coordination complex on the basis of the fascinating structural and adsorptive properties researchers combined uio 66 with separation media to efficiently capture arsenic species liu et al 2015b ma et al 2017 huo et al synthesized a magnetic fe3o4 uio 66 composite using a direct epitaxial approach for the efficient removal of arsenate from wastewater huo et al 2019 the composites exhibited an adsorption capacity of 73 mg g and can be readily separated from post treatment water solutions owing to its magnetic responsive feature wang et al incorporated uio 66 into the unique micro channels of alumina hollow fibers for a continuous arsenic contaminated water remediation process as shown in fig 2 wang et al 2016a the functional hollow fiber could produce potable water recovery with less than 10 μg l arsenic content from the arsenic contaminated feed initial arsenic concentration 1000 μg l employing this method stable support of mofs can be ensured for efficient contact with polluted inflow and not to lose any detectable materials in recovery outflows as no zirconium signal was detected in the effluents moreover he et al integrated nanosized uio 66 into the selective layer polyamide layer of a thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane and applied the fabricated membranes for arsenic contaminated water purification he et al 2017 it was found that the tfn membrane had a robust long term stability higher pure water permeability owing to the increased hydrophilicity and remarkable rejection 99 towards arsenate species 4 2 mof based materials for as iii and dual as iii v removal compared to as v species as iii is regarded to be more toxic and its removal from water streams is normally more difficult than that of as v various researchers examined the removal ability of zifs for arsenite in addition to arsenate in 2014 jian et al reported that zif 8 was efficient for the simultaneous elimination of as v and as iii owing to the terminal hydroxyl and amine groups jian et al 2015 the mof was synthesized at room temperature using a slightly modified method the langmuir model suggested that zif 8 had moderate capacities for both as v and as iii 60 mg g and 49 mg g respectively at neutral ph due to the highly porous structure with pore sizes ranging from 8 to 16 å the adsorption equilibria of zif 8 for as v and as iii were established in 7 and 13 h respectively it was found that the adsorption rate was controlled by diffusion between particles rather than that through interior pores which means the uptake of arsenic occurred on the surface sites of zif 8 the adsorption efficiency was not influenced by the presence of sulphate so4 2 and nitrate ions no3 but was considerably affected by the presence of phosphate po4 3 and carbonate ions co3 2 the ftir and xps studies suggested that arsenic species were coordinated to the terminal hydroxyl and imidazole nitrogen groups moreover liu et al prepared zif 8 in three different morphologies i e cubic leaf shaped and dodecahedral zif 8 for as iii adsorption liu et al 2015a it shall be noted that the leaf shaped zif 8 had a surface area of 13 m2 g and was considered to be non porous whilst the highly porous cubic and dodecahedral zif 8 had the surface area of 958 and 1151 m2 g respectively nevertheless these three zif 8 adsorbents could reduce the as iii concentration 200 μg l to a level of less than 10 μg l in 2 h and their adsorption capacities at ph 8 5 were 122 108 and 117 mg g for cubic leaf shaped and dodecahedral zif 8 respectively therefore the as iii adsorption kinetics and capacity did not correlate with the surface areas of zif 8 rather by the surface functional groups that complexed with as iii species during the adsorption process this was further supported by the ftir and xps analyses which suggested the adsorption mechanism as terminal hydroxyl groups substitution to form zn o as complexes on the surface of zif 8 besides the dodecahedral zif 8 appeared to be the most stable framework as confirmed by the x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses towards the spent materials in comparison nasir et al also synthesized a two dimensional leaf shaped 2d zif l as arsenite adsorbents nasir et al 2018 it was found that the synthesized zif l had a maximum uptake of arsenite of 44 mg g at ph 10 and room temperature hydroxyl substitution forming inner sphere complexes together with electrostatic interaction referencing to the surface charge of zif l played the major role for arsenite adsorption in addition to direct use of raw zifs huo et al fabricated water stable magnetic responsive fe3o4 zif 8 composites for the adsorptive removal of as iii from aqueous solutions huo et al 2018 fe3o4 zif 8 possessed a core shell structure fe3o4 as core and zif 8 as shell with a high surface area 1133 m2 g the composites had a maximum as iii uptake capacity of 100 mg g which might be originated from strong surface complex interaction the adsorption appeared to be a spontaneous endothermic and entropy increase process moreover zif 8 was combined with 1d β mno2 by jian et al to achieve concurrent oxidation and adsorptive removal of arsenite jian et al 2016 the synthesized β mno2 zif 8 exhibited a great mechanical stability and high surface area of 883 m2 g it could achieve an improved as iii adsorption capacity of 140 mg g compared to that of zif 8 bulk which was due to the oxidation ability of β mno2 in the core of this composite its unique 1d nanostructure sufficiently prevented the agglomeration problem of zif 8 particles in the aqueous solution the composites in the form of nanowires could be easily separated from aqueous media after settling for 30 min besides the zif materials wang et al reported a mil 100 fe based filter for the efficient removal of as iii from synthetic groundwater wang et al 2018 mil 100 fe is implanted on the substrate of a commercially available iron mesh to serves as a dual functional system for the oxidation of as iii and the adsorption of the resulted as v complete removal of as iii can be achieved within 6 h with the aid of oxygen and joule heating the satisfactory structural stability and recycle performance promoted the filter to be used for remediating arsenic contamination in groundwater moreover mils were also used to form magnetic composites and applied for the simultaneous removal of as iii and as v the magnetic composites are preferred in practical applications due to their magnetic responsive properties for easy harnessing and separation from post treatment water solutions yang et al developed cofe2o4 mil 100 fe hybrid magnetic nanoparticles yang and yin 2017 which were able to remove 100 μg l as iii and as v within 2 min the rapid adsorption kinetics may be due to its mesoporous structure with an average diameter of 260 nm this cofe2o4 mil 100 fe composite exhibited adsorption capacities of 144 mg g for as iii and 115 mg g for as v its adsorption efficiency would not be affected by the presence of inorganic ions so4 2 co3 2 sio3 2 po4 3 ca2 and mg2 or natural organic substances owing to the electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion effects of the mil 100 fe shell the mechanism analysis suggested that the capture of as v and as iii on cofe2o4 mil 100 fe occurred via terminal hydroxyl groups substitution with the formation of fe o as complexes the relatively higher adsorption capacity of as iii might be attributed to hydrogen bonding which resulted in a multi layer adsorption of neutral as iii species whereas the adsorption of ionic as v species was a monolayer reaction process besides folens et al developed fe3o4 mil 101 cr folens et al 2016 which delivered adsorption capacities of 121 and 80 mg g for as iii and as v respectively the structural integrity of this hybrid nano material could be well maintained during the adsorption process and even after desorption whilst no significant leaching of cr or fe elements was observed throughout further to zifs and mils studies using uio mofs brought more insights to better understand arsenite uptake mechanisms in 2016 audu et al reported a dual capture of as v and as iii via the application of uio 66 and its thiolated derivative uio 66 sh 2 audu et al 2016 the uptakes of as v and as iii were 40 mg g and 10 mg g respectively after 6 h it was found that the thiolated uio 66 provided a significantly improved as iii adsorption performance compared to the non functionalized analogues which infers the critical role of characteristic organic linkers for as iii removal this work represented a promising adsorptive strategy for effective elimination of the mixed arsenic pollution the detailed mechanism analysis suggested that the as v species interacted with the zr6o4 oh 4 cluster nodes whilst the as iii species majorly coordinated with the thiolated ligands sh groups as shown in fig 3 in 2018 he et al also studied the as iii v removal performance by uio 66 and uio 66 nh2 he et al 2018 it was reported that at ph 9 2 uio 66 had exceptional removal capacities of 205 and 68 mg g for as iii and as v respectively the adsorption performance of these zr mofs remained stable after six adsorption desorption test cycles the as removal processes were determined to be exothermic chemisorption reactions fixed bed reactor removal experiments were conducted which confirmed the number of effective treatment volumes reached 2270 and 1775 bed volumes for as iii and as v respectively capable of remediating 100 μg l contaminated water to meet the regulation standard 10 μg l ftir and xps studies indicated that zr oh groups in zr mofs played a critical role in arsenic adsorption whilst the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes study revealed that arsenic adsorption on zr mofs would not change the materials oxidation states the x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectra demonstrated that it formed bidentate mononuclear complexes for as v and bidentate binuclear complexes for as iii on the hexanuclear zr clusters of zr mofs hence with the advantages of nontoxicity great stability excellent adsorption capacity low cost and easy availability zr mof uio 66 has a promising future for arsenic contaminated water remediation furthermore shen et al adopted a slightly different strategy by using the photocatalytic oxidation ability to remove as iii over uio 66 and its functionalized derivatives uio 66 x x nh2 no2 and br shen et al 2015 it was found that uio 66 nh2 had the highest catalytic performance according to the apparent first order rate constants followed by uio 66 uio 66 br and uio 66 no2 this might be due to the greater electron density of organic ligands by introducing an electron donator nh2 which improves the transfer of photo induced charge carriers and enhances the photocatalytic capability for as iii oxidation lastly some very recent studies explored the capability of mof 74 for the removal of inorganic arsenic species yu et al reported that crystal zn mof 74 can effectively remove both as v and as iii yu et al 2019 leading to adsorption capacities of 325 mg g and 211 mg g respectively the removal mechanism as unveiled by ir and xps studies was due to the zn o as coordination interactions between the open metal sites and the specific arsenic species moreover sun et al prepared a novel nanostructured fe co based mof 74 adsorbent for both as iii and as v sun et al 2019 the fe co mof 74 nanoparticles had a spherical structure with diameters ranging from 60 to 100 nm and the specific surface area was 148 m2 g it had the maximum adsorption capacities toward as iii and as v as 266 and 292 mg g respectively the adsorption performance as well as the adsorbent structures remained stable after regeneration 4 3 mof based materials for organoarsenic removal the number of reports on organoarenic removal by mofs is generally lower than that of inorganic arsenic species removal there are several meaningful studies conducted by jhung s group to assess the capability of organoarsenic species removal by typical mof based materials firstly jung et al carried out a study to assess the adsorption capacities of p arsanilic acid asa using mesoporous zif 8 materials jung et al 2015 the excellent adsorption capacity and facile regeneration towards spent adsorbents suggested that mesoporous zif 8 has a great potential in the adsorptive removal of organoarsenic compounds such as asa the mechanism study indicated that electrostatic interactions between the positively charged zif 8 surface and the anionic forms of asa controlled this highly efficient adsorption process secondly jun et al investigated the adsorption of asa and roxarsone rox with regards to a variety of porous materials including mil 100 fe mil 100 al mil 100 cr activated carbon zeolite hy and goethite jun et al 2015 in particular mil 100 fe exhibited the highest adsorption capacity it was shown that water binds less preferably onto mil 100 fe than other mil 100 analogues whilst asa and rox could coordinate more strongly to mil 100 fe binding to the coordinatively unsaturated sites cuss thirdly sarker et al compared the adsorption efficiency of phenylarsonic acid paa and asa onto functionalized mil 101 i e mil 101 oh and mil 101 oh 3 with that of pristine mil 101 and commercial ac sarker et al 2017 the highly porous mil 101 bearing three hydroxyl groups mil 101 oh 3 exhibited remarkable paa and asa adsorption capacities it was suggested that hydrogen bonding was the key for organoarsenic species adsorption whilst organoarsenic species and mil 101 oh 3 were respectively the hydrogen bond acceptors and donors mil 101 oh 3 could be regenerated by acidic ethanol treatment which renders it a promising adsorbent for the removal of paa and asa from water furthermore lv et al employed an amino functionalized indium based nh2 mil 68 in for asa adsorption lv et al 2018 it was found that the key adsorption mechanism involves both π π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions between nh2 mil 68 in and asa the introduced nh2 groups on mil 68 in did not affect π π stacking interactions between aryl units but greatly improved both the adsorption capacity 401 mg g and adsorption rate through hydrogen bonding enhancement the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic and nh2 mil 68 in exhibited an excellent reusability moreover li et al prepared uio 66 with tunable missing linker defects using different amounts of synthesis modulators li et al 2016 and applied the materials for the efficient decontamination of rox from wastewater the defects in uio 66 not only resulted in an enhanced porosity but also induced the creation of zr oh groups that served as the main active adsorption sites for efficient rox uptake these resulted in an excellent adsorptive capacity 730 mg g and fast adsorption kinetics 30 min the outstanding adsorption behaviors render this water stable material a great potential choice for organic pollutants removal besides tian et al synthesized an amine modified uio 67 uio 67 nh2 and applied it for asa adsorption tian et al 2018 detailed analysis revealed that the contribution of different adsorption forces followed an order of as o zr coordination π π stacking h bonding the amine groups in uio 67 nh2 played a critical role in enhancing the adsorption affinity through strengthening the as o zr coordination and π π stacking as well as forming new adsorption sites through hydrogen bonding 5 insights and perspectives after surveying the relevant literature of aquatic arsenic removal using mofs this section analyzes the information by identifying some significant trends in those reports comparing mofs with other arsenic removal materials evaluating the practical feasibility of mofs and synthesizing the findings into future outlooks for further development 5 1 analysis of literature information regarding the functional mofs and their applications for aquatic arsenic removal has been summarized in table 2 scanning through these studies it is apparent that many reported mofs possess desirable features for decontamination applications their basic performance characteristics removal mechanisms and strategies to tune the materials for optimal behaviors can be identified for a holistic understanding 5 1 1 performance basic characteristics overall mof based materials especially highly water stable ones can function across a wide range of water conditions having adsorption capacities ranging from a few mg g to hundreds of mg g most of them exhibit excellent kinetic behaviors requiring between several minutes to hours to establish adsorption equilibria they also demonstrate great selectivity and strong anti interference towards common co existing ions e g ca2 mg2 so4 2 co3 2 cl and no3 natural organic matters and water matrices e g groundwater and surface water more importantly these mofs could provide not only excellent adsorptive capability but are able to retain the performance efficacy over a series of application cycles amongst the reported mof adsorbents iron and zirconium based mofs are the most extensively studied materials this is due to their intrinsic advantages such as readily obtained raw materials with nontoxic metal source good biocompatibility and distinguished physicochemical features e g high porosity framework flexibility and chemical stability properties generally uio 66 and some fe based mofs exhibit the best adsorption performance 5 1 2 arsenic removal mechanisms removal of aquatic arsenic by mof based materials is mainly owed to the adsorptive behaviors of mofs thermodynamic investigations hint the spontaneous characteristics of these adsorption processes a series of isotherm studies suggest that the adsorption of as v and organoarsenic is more likely a homogeneous monolayer process described by the langmuir model whilst as iii is more prone to follow the freundlich model on the other hand the adsorption kinetics could normally be modeled by the pseudo second order kinetic equation inferring that complexation effects chemisorptions dominate the uptake process with the aids of spectroscopic tools researchers have identified the critical role of terminal hydroxyl groups for arsenic complexation leading to the formation of m o as m metal complexes within the mof structures moreover other functional groups e g amino group nh2 and thiol group sh introduced to mof structures could as well facilitate the arsenic process this was clearly explained by audu et al who claimed mofs could chemoselectively capture as v oxyanions at the hydroxylated node and neutral as iii species with the thiolated organic linkers audu et al 2016 besides some attractive interactions including electrostatic interactions effects of hydrogen bonding van der waals forces etc between mofs and arsenic species could be assistive to the uptake process li et al 2018 since most mofs carry definite surface charges in a specific aqueous environment there is an obvious tendency for them to attract the oppositely charged arsenic species if present moreover van der waals forces always exist and their enforcing extent is dependent upon the material s surface area wen et al 2018 as some mofs possess large surface area and porosity van der waals forces shall contribute to the arsenic uptake process by the highly porous structures 5 1 3 performance enhancement strategies the literature reveals that more efficient and faster uptake can be achieved with increasing the density of active sites and making these sites internal to mofs easily accessible achieved by enlarging the pore aperture size or reducing the particle size a few effective approaches to enhance the adsorption performance of mofs include i adopting longer organic ligands to improve pore size which may facilitate the diffusion of target pollutants through mofs cavka et al 2008 howarth et al 2015 ii applying proper defect engineering to enlarge their pore size and introduce extra adsorption sites as well as to make mofs more hydrophilic ghosh et al 2014 li et al 2017b shearer et al 2016 iii introducing functionalities e g nh2 oh and sh in organic linkers to offer additional adsorption sites and improve selectivity li et al 2017a luo et al 2015 2016 iv introducing functionalities at the metal nodes via post synthetic ligand exchange and post synthetic modification methods liang et al 2016 liu et al 2014a peng et al 2016 the functional groups of which may be more active than those incorporated into the organic ligands because of steric hindrance v constructing mof based composites via the hybridization of mofs with other functional materials such as magnetic materials e g fe3o4 or separation media e g filters min et al 2017 ricco et al 2015 yang et al 2017 which would improve the applicability of mofs for an easy recovery from solutions and synergistic effects amongst different components within the composites rapti et al 2016 5 2 comparison with other arsenic removal materials to date many materials have been studied for aquatic arsenic removal which includes activated carbon metal oxides zeolites layered doubled hydroxides ldhs laterite soil etc baig et al 2015 gallegos garcia et al 2012 goh et al 2008 guan et al 2012 hao et al 2018 lata and samadder 2016 mohan and pittman 2007 nicomel et al 2015 pal 2010 sarkar and paul 2016 singh et al 2015 yu et al 2018 their capabilities for this particular application have been comprehensively studied firstly the advantage of some naturally available materials is the cost effectiveness for instance the raw material prices of silica and clay are quite cheap ca 0 1 0 2 kg babel and kurniawan 2003 however these materials cannot provide sufficient adsorption capacities as well as selectivity and many other water contaminants can deactivate their functionalities much lowering the removal efficiency secondly activated carbon has been studied for various adsorption applications but in the case of ionic adsorption it could only remove a few milligrams of metal ions per gram of activated carbon and can hardly be regenerated without substantial treatment thirdly iron or iron compounds represent the majority of commercial products they normally have strong affinities to arsenic species together with simultaneous oxidation ability however their adsorption efficiency is high only at low ph conditions and their reusability is limited finally there are some advanced composites synthesized in laboratories for effective arsenic removal but they are quite expensive in terms of production cost for instance yu et al reported an yttrium manganese binary composite which displayed an outstanding as v adsorption capacity 280 mg g at neutral ph yu et al 2015 it required 25 h to reach equilibrium and could be easily regenerated however it could only work efficiently across a limited ph range of 5 7 its synthesis process was very complicated and costly and when they are recycled the product quality can hardly be maintained further to these conventional adsorbents mofs could provide greater adsorption capacities e g 303 mg g with respect to uio 66 and able to work over a much wider ph range from very acidic to basic conditions the excellent performance of mofs is associated with the higher accessible surface area and more active sites for the arsenic uptake to take place normally conventional bulk adsorbents are limited by the non accessible bulk volume of which the active sites are only present on the outer surface as shown in fig 4 zhu et al 2012 to enlarge the adsorbent s surface area and consequently improve adsorption capacities efforts shall be made to reduce the particle size nonetheless decreasing particle sizes requires additional energy input not to mention that the aggregation of nanoparticles may deteriorate the adsorbents stabilities and functionalities mofs represent a new strategy by providing tailored porous host and permanent framework structure for adsorption applications the structure with void spaces and passage channels allows targeting species to diffuse and interact with interior functional sites these sites could either be due to metal nodes or organic ligands and as a consequence mofs expose more active sites for adsorptions compared to most conventional nanoparticles in unit space wang et al 2015 moreover mofs can be readily designed and modified to suit the specific application purpose via a variety of methods such as ligand decoration defects engineering metal sites functionalization etc deria et al 2014 fang et al 2015 kim et al 2012 abundant active reactive sites distributed throughout the fine structures can be utilized to a large extent with sufficient chemical stability it is certain that mofs could be the state of art option contributing to highly efficient arsenic removal process 5 3 evaluation on practical applicability to promote mofs for industrial scale applications it is requested to understand the materials production cost water stability capability to work with real water samples and solutions to resolve the material loss problem 5 3 1 material cost concerns cost appears to be the first and foremost concerning issue for mofs to be applied in contaminated water remediations majorly mofs are synthesized via solvothermal methods which used a fairly low temperatures e g 120 c the main contributors to mof production prices are the solvent and ligand costs which account for more than 70 of the material cost to date with the continuing efforts by the material scientists and chemical engineers syntheses of functional mofs have been optimized to be quite facile and cost effective some of the mofs can be successfully prepared at room temperature without any thermal energy input or without the use of toxic organic solvents hu and zhao 2015 jabbari et al 2016 julien et al 2017 and they are still able to remove aquatic arsenic species effectively moreover desantis et al conducted a techno economic analysis to evaluate the cost of industrial scale mof synthesis the researchers identified that the production prices of representative mofs i e mof 5 hkust 1 ni2 dobdc mg2 dobdc can be controlled to 8 10 kg with an optimized process and alternative synthesis methods like liquid assisted grinding and aqueous synthesis it was also recognized that a fully continuous synthesis operation with incorporation of chemical recycling designs has the potential to further reduce the production cost 5 3 2 water stability metal leaching concerns there were considerable negative claims on mofs due to the materials limited hydrothermal stability in earlier reports wang et al 2016b since mofs contain metal ion nodes when the materials cannot maintain the structural robustness in water solutions the metal ions would leach into water and induce severe secondary contamination thus preventing this potential metal leaching is critical if mofs are to be widely used in water treatment thus far the water stability of mofs has undergone substantial improvement over the past years as discussed in section 3 more and more water stable mofs have been developed to sustain and steadily function at a variety of extreme water conditions feng et al 2018 wang et al 2016b moreover in relevant studies by li et al and folens et al the researchers have examined if there is leaching of metal elements belong to the mof adsorbents i e aluminum and chromium respectively throughout the application processes folens et al 2016 li et al 2014b none of the metal signals was detected 5 3 3 realistic water tests it is admitted that most of the current studies dealt with synthetic water samples simply introducing the corresponding arsenic species to pure water as contaminated water feed in laboratory settings in reality however water bodies carry many more additional substances e g other ionic compounds organic matters suspended solids micro organisms etc which may complicate the arsenic removal process as observed in the literature most mofs could sustain their adsorption efficacy when co existing with the common ions in addition to that some researchers have conducted the tests that applied mofs under realistic water conditions to validate their application feasibility for instance sun et al reported that the prepared fe co mof 74 adsorbent had stable adsorption ability even when it was used in a real water matrix sun et al 2019 yang et al collected real arsenic containing water samples from a rural well in shanxi china and applied cofe2o4 mil 100 fe for decontamination the researchers even assembled a simple water filter by packing cofe2o4 mil 100 fe for the simultaneous removal of particle impurities and arsenic pollutants the test results validated the mof based materials excellent performance besides researchers also simulated the natural water conditions from which mofs were tested for arsenic removal e g the mil 100 fe filter developed by wang et al can efficiently remove arsenic from synthetic groundwater wang et al 2018 and uio 67 nh2 prepared by tian et al can remediate the simulated natural and wastewater with asa pollution tian et al 2018 5 3 4 spent mofs separation issues spent materials separation is an important issue that must be considered if mofs are to be used at full scale installations this is because most of the mofs are synthesized as powder forms and in practical applications dispersed particles would easily leak out from the treatment compartment resulting in severe material loss and ineffectiveness of treatment strategies to resolve this problem include fabricating magnetic mof based materials that can be easily retrieved via magnetic forces and combining mofs with filtration media to ensure a secure support and efficient contact relevant studies were carried out by yang et al and huo et al who fabricated magnetic nanocomposites huo et al 2018 2019 yang and yin 2017 as well as by wang et al and he et al who developed conceptual adsorptive membranes with hybrid adsorption filtration behaviors for arsenic removal he et al 2017 wang et al 2016a 5 4 future outlooks taking all the findings together mof based materials have emerged to be a highly effective selective and stable option for aqueous removal of arsenic species however one cannot deny the fact that substantial work must be done before mofs can be widely used in practice although many concerns regarding their application feasibility have been gradually tackled over recent years these issues still need to be investigated more closely at the next stage right now the primary issue of mofs is up scaling of the synthesis process which was seldom addressed by researchers currently most mofs are synthesized via solvothermal or hydrothermal methods and it requires the use of a large amount of organic solvents like n n dimethylformamide dmf and methanol furukawa et al 2013 rowsell and yaghi 2004 stock and biswas 2012 to synthesize mofs in large quantities without deteriorating the materials properties at industrial levels scientists and engineers shall work together to develop preferable strategies and processes taking into account the scaling effect of reactions as well as the environmental influence of waste solvents moreover although most mofs can be prepared under mild conditions the materials still appear to be rather costly compared to the readily available carbonaceous materials more work shall be carried out to make mofs a cost effective option for applications e g strategies for minimizing solvent usage and exploration for constructive organic ligands with much cheaper prices focusing on the effective aquatic arsenic removal by mof based materials future studies should put more efforts in understanding the detailed mechanism the mofs well defined crystalline structures provide an invaluable platform for in depth analyses of arsenic removal mechanisms besides further development should concentrate on the applicability improvements through proper material engineering and chemical engineering some strategies that scientist could consider for exploration include 1 developing mofs with greener synthesis and greater application efficacy 2 modifying mofs to provide ultrahigh porosity and enriched active sites through the introduction of multiple metal organic functional groups or further complexity to the crystalline structures 3 preparing novel and multifunctional mof based platforms such as hybrid mof on mof heteroarchitectures 4 synthesizing multi component hybrid mof composites via chemical decorations with functional materials such as quantum dots ionic liquids carbon based materials and zeolites 5 studying the effect of defects in mof structures or developing amorphous mofs for certain applications 6 investigating the effects of antimony sb or similar anions e g phosphate and fluoride on arsenic adsorption more carefully as arsenic normally occurs together with these compounds in water and they share numerous similarities in chemical properties and toxicity ungureanu et al 2015 6 conclusion amongst many methods and materials reported to date the unique physio chemical properties of mofs and their excellent removal efficiency towards arsenic have attracted growing attentions in academic and industrial communities in this review article the characteristics of the mofs and their adsorption performance recently reported mostly from 2014 to 2019 were systemically reviewed and summarized the information has been sorted according to the arsenic species mofs materials and application effectiveness by carefully analyzing these studies significant insights are identified and directions for future studies are suggested overall this critical review provides an updated and clearer understanding of aquatic arsenic removal by mofs in consideration of the great application potential of mof based materials for water treatment with further research and development the materials could be promoted for

18803,biogenic sulfide bs in anaerobic digesters was previously suggested to mitigate the potential impacts of metallic nanoparticles m nps on antibiotic resistance genes args propagation by sulfidation of the m nps in this study a new role of bs in regulating args responses to m nps is reported it was observed that cuo nps at environmentally relevant level had no significant effects on the spread of args however higher dosage 50 mg gtss contributed to the propagation of args whose abundances would be effectively reduced by 74 115 if bs production was stimulated instead introduction of edta a metal ion chelator resulted in much lower attenuation efficiencies 12 40 indicating that restriction of the bioavailability of cuo nps might not be the only reason for the buffering of arg responses in the presence of bs further investigation showed that the presence of bs together with activation of key enzymes o acetyl serine sulfhydrylase and γ glutamylcysteine synthetase supplied and favored the biosynthesis and transformation of cysteine which mitigated the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps moreover the amounts of cysteine and its metabolite glutathione in sludge were associated with the abundances of args negatively implying that in situ generated cysteine was the important args regulator exploration of possible mechanisms revealed that the biosynthesized cysteine might limit gene transfer potential via mobile genetic elements as cysteine restricted the abundances of inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr 1 in addition the cysteine remarkably alleviated the copper stress and copper resistance which in turn blocked possible co selection between copper and antibiotic resistance this work provides new insight into attenuation of the bio effects of nps in digesters graphical abstract image 1 keywords biogenic sulfide cuo nanoparticle antibiotic resistance genes cysteine biosynthesis anaerobic digestion 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is widely applied to treat waste sludge because it showed advantages in sludge reduction as well as nutrient and energy recovery huang et al 2019 during this anaerobic treatment process biogenic sulfide bs is inevitably generated via the transformation of sulfur whose content was reported to be 1 of the dry sludge zhang et al 2017a generally the formation of bs is undesirable because of the resulting problems such as odour nuisance corrosion of digesters sulfide toxicity and competition with methanogens appels et al 2008 jiang et al 2015 lin et al 2018 however recent studies also suggested that bs could serve as a shield passivating toxic contaminants present in waste sludge for example metallic nanoparticles m nps which have been found to accumulated in sludge with considerable abundances and diversities tou et al 2017 were observed to be sulfidized by bs during sludge anaerobic digestion donner et al 2011 kim et al 2016 lombi et al 2012 the nano metal sulfides formed had lower solubility than the pristine nps which mitigated the bio effects of nps on digestion performance gonzalez estrella et al 2015 yang et al 2012 similarly it has also been suggested that the bs rich condition might account for the buffered responses of antibiotic resistance genes args to m nps exposure results from kim et al 2016 found that the rapid sulfidation of ag nps to ag2s nps effectively sequestered ag and therefore blocked biological interactions with the digester microbial community generally m nps such as ag nps and cuo nps exhibit considerable solubility bioavailable metal released from these m nps would serve as selective pressure driving the proliferation of args baker austin et al 2006 di cesare et al 2016 luo et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 therefore the restricted solubility of ag2s nps might be responsible for the lack of changes in args patterns observed in a digester exposed to ag nps kim et al 2016 miller et al 2013 however the contribution of sulfidation to restriction of metal release from m nps has recently been challenged for instance results from two research groups confirmed that cus nps yielded from cuo nps after sulfidation exhibited higher solubility than pristine nps li et al 2015 ma et al 2014 hence bs induced sulfidation might not be the main mechanism if the impacts of cuo nps on args were buffered in anaerobic digesters m nps such as tio2 qiu et al 2015 al2o3 qiu et al 2012 and zno wang et al 2018 were capable of promoting the horizontal transfer of multi resistance within or across genera in pure culture or indigenous aquatic microbiota systems considering the high dense of bacteria and richness of nutrition in digesters huang et al 2016 2017 the dissemination of args in sludge would be facilitated with present m nps it has also been pointed out that the stimulated transfer of args induced by zno nps was a particle specific effect rather than the effect of released zn2 wang et al 2018 taking the limited or low solubility of tio2 nps and al2o3 nps into consideration it seems that the activated args transfer was not associated with the solubility of nps thus sulfidation might not be effective to mitigate the impacts of m nps on the horizontal transfer of args m nps and args are both concerning emerging contaminants accumulated in waste sludge tou et al 2017 vikesland et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to understand how bs regulates the responses of args to m nps during sludge anaerobic digestion in the current study cuo nps were chosen as representative m nps the assessed amounts of cuo nps in anaerobic digestion systems were in the range from 1 to 100 mg gtss according to previous studies and the environmental relevant levels of cuo nps in sludge were usually set as 1 5 mg gtss unsar et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017c since bs was observed to effectively mitigate the impact of cuo nps on eight target args the objectives of this study were to investigate 1 whether bs induced sulfidation was the major regulator of args and 2 if not to determine how args patterns were regulated 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of waste sludge and nanoparticles waste sludge used in this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china the waste sludge was settled at 4 c for 24 h and then the supernatant was discharged the settlement was filtered through stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and finally concentrated to total suspended solids tss of about 10 g l for subsequent studies cuo nps were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa a stock dispersion of cuo nps was prepared by adding 2 25g of nps to 1 0 l of distilled water ph 7 0 the suspension was sonicated at 25 c for 1 h 250 w 40 khz every time before being diluted for the following experiments 2 2 the roles of bs in regulating args patterns responding to cuo nps exposure during sludge anaerobic digestion serum bottles with working volume of 300 ml were used to simulate anaerobic digesters in this section a total of 10 series of reactors were set up and classified into four groups g a g b g c and g d each reactor set contained biological triplicates the reactors were described in figure s1 in g a three series of reactors were exposed to different doses of cuo nps 5 25 and 50 mg gtss respectively the higher dosages 25 and 50 mg gtss were applied not only to get a full insight on the fates of args responding to nps whose production and application were growing every year huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017c but also to uncover the exact roles of bs playing in regulating args more conveniently and logically in g b and g c all digesters were initially exposed to 50 mg gtss cuo nps the two series in g b were supplemented with 0 5 and 1 mm of sulfate respectively to stimulate the production of bs the two series in g c were dosed with 1 and 3 mm of edta respectively g d reactors were not exposed to cuo nps randomly chosen series in this group were supplied with 1 mm sulfate and 1 mm edta respectively the remaining series without any addition was regarded as the control all reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 35 2 c the ph value of the digestion mixture was maintained at 7 0 the digestion period of each batch was 17 d according to a previous study huang et al 2019 2 3 effects of cuo nps exposure on the activities of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of cysteine sludge samples collected from reactors in g a at the end of digestion were washed 3 times with 0 85 nacl solution then 2 5 g of wet sludge was re sampled and re suspended in 5 ml of nacl solution and sonicated 40 khz 20 min in ice bath to extract crude enzymes the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12000 g 4 c for 10 min and placed on ice for subsequent enzyme assays the total protein was estimated according to a previous study fediuc et al 2005 to determine the activity of o acetyl serine sulfhydrylase oass the reaction mixture contained 5 mm o acetyl l serine oas 3 mm na2s 10 mm dithiothreitol and 0 1 m sodium phosphate ph 8 in 0 2 ml of crude extract warrilow and hawkesford 2000 the reaction was initiated by the addition of oas followed by incubation at 50 c for 10 min and terminated by addition of acidic ninhydrin fediuc et al 2005 the cysteine produced was measured by recording absorbance at 560 nm oass activity is presented in μmol of cysteine produced per mg protein per min to determine the activity of γ glutamylcysteine synthetase γ gcs the reaction mixture was composed of 10 mm na glutamate 10 mm l aminobutyrate 2 mm na2 edta 0 02 bovine serum albumen 20 mm mgcl2 5 mm na2 atp and 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 2 in 0 2 ml of crude extract nagalakshmi and prasad 2001 the reaction was pre incubated for 2 min at room temperature followed by incubation at 37 c for 30 min and terminated by 5 trichloroacetic acid then the liberated phosphate was estimated the γ gcs activity is presented in as μmol of pi produced per mg protein per h 2 4 the roles of biosynthesized cysteine and metabolic glutathione in regulating args patterns in response to cuo nps exposure during sludge anaerobic digestion to explore the roles of biosynthesized cysteine and glutathione gsh on the args patterns specific enzymatic inhibitors i e hydroxylamine hydrochloride for oass and buthionine sulfoximine bso for γ gcs were applied hirase and molin 2001 kimura and kimura 2004 in this section briefly all digesters were classified into two groups in group i seven series of reactors were exposed to 50 mg gtss cuo nps plus 1 mm sulfate six series chosen at random were supplied with hydroxylamine 1 5 and 10 mm or bso 0 5 1 and 5 mm respectively the remaining reactor was set as the control digesters in group ii were almost duplicates of group i except that none of the reactors was exposed to cuo nps all other operations were the same as those described in section 2 2 2 5 quantification of antibiotic and copper resistance genes in sludge samples sludge samples for dna extraction were collected by centrifugation at the end of each experiment genomic dna was extracted following purkhold s protocol which consisted of lysozyme proteinase k and sodium dodecyl sulfate treatments purkhold et al 2000 according to the literature tetracycline sulfonamide and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin resistance genes are the most abundant args in sludge tian et al 2016 thus some frequently detected args representing these types such as tetc and tetq suli and sulii and ermb and ermx were assessed in this study in addition strb and mexb were targeted to reflect the fate of aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance respectively in addition inti1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 representing diverse mobile genetic elements mges were tracked to reveal the potential for horizontal gene transfer in sludge zhang et al 2016c as copper has been demonstrated to play important roles in co selection of resistance genes zhu et al 2013 two copper resistance genes copa and pcor were also quantified quantitative pcr experiments were conducted using the standard curve method details of the reaction mixture amplification program and melting curves were also described in our previous studies huang et al 2016 2017 the primers and annealing temperature for each target gene are presented in table s1 as shown in table s2 the amplification efficiencies of all target genes were in the range 100 10 with r2 0 99 data in table s3 suggest that inhibitors used in this study i e hydroxylamine hydrochloride and bso did not significantly contribute to the propagation of args 2 6 other analytical methods and statistical analysis tss and vss were measured according to our previous publications huang et al 2017 cysteine and reactive oxygen species ros were determined following the protocols described by su et al 2016 gsh in sludge was extracted using an hclo4 edta method and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc which were detailed in supporting information the concentration of copper was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry perkinelmer optima 2100 dv usa all tests in this study were performed in triplicate and the one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of results p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bs on args patterns in response to cuo nps during sludge anaerobic digestion during last decades a lot of attention has been paid to the impacts of nps on anaerobic digestion performance however the potential effects of nps on the fates of args have rarely been concerned in this study it was found that only the highest dosage of cuo nps 50 mg gtss resulted in the significant reduction p 0 05 in vss destruction efficiency figure s2 with respect to args patterns they were more sensitive to cuo nps exposure as shown in fig 1 a d the relative abundances of 8 target args were in the range of 10 5 10 1 and sulfonamide resistance genes were the most abundant these observations were comparable with previous studies huang et al 2017 ma et al 2011 the lowest dose of cuo nps 5 mg gtss caused no significant difference p 0 05 in the relative abundances of most of the assessed args except ermb and strb compared with the control however when the test doses increased the propagation of args was stimulated for example the relative abundances of sul i sul ii tet c tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were about 1 73 p 0 030 1 77 p 0 021 1 35 p 0 028 2 76 p 0 016 9 96 p 0 003 1 92 p 0 001 18 17 p 0 004 and 3 99 fold p 0 006 those in the control respectively fig 1 when sludge was exposed to 50 mg gtss cuo nps similar trends were also observed for mges the abundances of inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 in response to cuo nps 50mg gtss were 8 48 p 0 001 4 50 p 0 010 and 6 14 p 0 009 fold those in the control respectively fig 1e g this was consistent with our previous metagenomics results in which diverse mges were confirmed to be enriched by m nps huang et al 2019 according to a recent study the presence of agnps in digesters had no remarkable impacts on args distribution kim et al 2016 the absence of any effects was suggested to be due to the formation of ag2s nps in anaerobic digesters which limited the bioavailability of ag nps to sludge bacteria kim et al 2016 based on this theory the propagation of args in the present study might be on account of un buffered biological effects of cuo nps to test this extra sulfate which would inevitably be transformed to bs in anaerobic condition was added into our digesters as shown in fig 2 although the addition of sulfate led to a slight increment in most target genes except sul i erm x and inti 1 in digesters without cuo nps exposure sulfate dose dependently mitigated the propagation of args and mges induced by cuo nps for instance in the presence of 1 mm sulfate the relative abundances of target args exposed to cuo nps were only 0 89 2 04 fold those in the control in other words the contributions of cuo nps to the dissemination of sul i sul ii tet c tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were reduced by 115 84 74 102 97 75 94 and 89 respectively fig 2a h similarly the impacts of cuo nps on mges were reduced by 52 101 p 0 05 fig 2i k apparently the biological effects of cuo nps on args could be effectively mitigated by bs 3 2 is sulfidation induced by bs the main regulator of args patterns generally sulfidation of m nps decreases their biological effects on microorganisms because the transformed product usually exhibits lower solubilty compared with pristine nps kim et al 2016 li et al 2015 given that bioavailable metal is believed to be a driver of args proliferation baker austin et al 2006 luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c it seems logical that the decreased bioavailable copper after sulfidation in this study might account for the decreased args abundances to test this speculation edta a metal chelator which captures copper ions and decreases their bioavailability was added into digesters li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b it was found that the relative abundances of target genes except tet c decreased on edta addition at the dose of 3 mm edta the contributions of cuo nps to the propagation of sul i sul ii tet q erm b str b and mex b was reduced by 40 p 0 061 22 p 0 016 44 p 0 029 38 p 0 014 25 p 0 015 and 38 p 0 036 respectively thus data obtained following the addition of sulfate or edta all indicated that the bioavailable copper released from cuo nps did contribute to the propagation of args however the effect of sulfate was much greater than that of edta hence other additional factors as well as sulfidation may be involved in the moderation of the responses of args to cuo nps in the presence of bs this was consistent with our previous study in which released ions were not the main reason for the toxicity of cuo nps su et al 2016 recent studies which suggested that cus nps yielded from cuo nps showed much higher solubility li et al 2015 ma et al 2014 also challenge the role of sulfidation in limiting args dissemination therefore sulfide rich conditions in digesters might trigger another mechanism responsible for counteracting effects of cuo nps on args 3 3 effects of bs on the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps apart from the released bioavailable metal ions nps might also affect the distribution of args via induced oxidative stress which would trigger sos response and facilitate the horizontal transfer of args among bacteria beaber et al 2004 qiu et al 2012 in the current study the ratio of glutathione gsh glutathione disulfide gssg decreased significantly from 9 6 to 3 5 in the presence of 50mg gtss cuo nps p 0 05 fig 3 a that might be attributable to the formation of ros whose level was almost 1 8 fold that in the control without cuo nps exposure fig 3b normally ros are generated in aerobic processes but key roles of ros in anaerobic conditions were also observed in recent studies mu and chen 2011 su et al 2016 the ros induced here resulted in the transformation of gsh to its oxidized form i e gssg disrupting the intracellular redox balance however once sulfate was added the ros level was decreased and the redox balance was recovered fig 3a and b similar observations concerning the mitigation of oxidative stress were reported in previous studies most of which were closely related to cysteine because it is involved in the biosynthesis of gsh to defend against oxidative stress setyawati et al 2016 su et al 2016 therefore the amounts of cysteine in sludge bacteria were evaluated as shown in fig 3c cuo nps exposure contributed to a significant depletion of cysteine in sludge p 0 05 sulfate addition dramatically increased corresponding amount of cysteine by about 8 5 fold compared with that in sludge exposed to nps alone p 0 05 it seems that sulfide rich conditions might benefit the in situ biosynthesis of cysteine bs can be metabolized into organic sulfur compounds with the participation of several key enzymes fig 3e sekowska et al 2000 su et al 2016 oass which catalyzes the last step in the transformation of sulfide to cysteine was found to be activated by cuo nps fig 3e furthermore the activity of γ gcs the rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of gsh from cysteine nagalakshmi and prasad 2001 was increased by 68 in the presence of cuo nps similar stimulated activities were also observed in previous studies most of which mainly focused on plants results from fediuc et al 2005 suggested that the activity of oass was increased under cadmium stress free copper was observed to stimulate γ gcs increasing the biosynthesis of gsh nagalakshmi and prasad 2001 as bacteria shared similar sulfur assimilation metabolisms with plants sekowska et al 2000 the copper ions released from cuo nps in digesters might be responsible for the enzyme activation by two possible mechanisms 1 free copper directly triggered activation of the enzymes or 2 copper ions first stimulated γ gcs facilitating the consumption of cysteine which in turn increased the activity of oass because oass is feedback regulated by the concentration of cysteine leon et al 1987 the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps might trigger demand for cysteine and gsh which might also result in the increased activities of the enzymes however even with the activated oass and γ gcs cuo nps still resulted in the depletion of cysteine fig 3 possibly because of a shortage of bs as it was consumed in the sulfidation of cuo nps once sulfate was added to the reactors the sulfide rich conditions would supply and favor the in situ biosynthesis and metabolism of cysteine which further mitigated the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps 3 4 the roles of biosynthesized cysteine and metabolic gsh in regulating args responding to cuo nps to validate the role of cysteine biosynthesized from sulfide in the regulation of args hydroxylamine a specific inhibitor of oass fig 3e hirase and molin 2001 was added into digesters as shown in fig 4 a although the presence of sulfate was found to favor the biosynthesis of cysteine the addition of hydroxylamine dose dependently decreased the concentrations of cysteine in sludge at doses of 5 and 10 mm hydroxylamine the abundances of cysteine were respectively 51 and 37 that without addition of inhibitor p 0 05 accordingly significant rebounds in args abundances were observed for example when 10 mm hydroxylamine was added into digesters the relative abundances of sul i sul ii tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were significantly p 0 05 increased to 1 66 1 45 2 98 5 50 1 35 8 00 and 2 40 fold those in sludge exposed to sulfate without the addition of hydroxylamine respectively fig 4b tet c was the most insensitive arg its abundance in response to 10 mm hydroxylamine was only 1 22 fold p 0 067 that without inhibitor addition in fig 2a h corresponding abundances of sul i sul ii tet c tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b exposed to cuo nps were 1 94 1 58 1 24 3 83 7 72 1 56 8 91 and 2 84 fold those attenuated by sulfate addition clearly it turned out that the contribution of sulfate addition to args reduction was limited once cysteine biosynthesis was inhibited similarly to validate the hypothesis that gsh a metabolite of cysteine played a considerable roles in the dissemination of args bso a specific inhibitor of γ gcs fig 3e kimura and kimura 2004 was added into anaerobic digesters as shown in fig 5 a bso dose dependently suppressed the level of gsh the presence of 1 and 5 mm bso decreased the levels of gsh by 20 p 0 049 and 30 p 0 032 respectively compared with that without bso addition the relative abundances of assessed genes increased on the addition of bso fig 5b in the presence of 5 mm bso the relative abundances of tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were significantly increased p 0 05 by 199 147 32 256 and 72 respectively in addition sul i sul ii and tet c showed similar but insignificant trends increasing by 21 p 0 24 20 p 0 07 and 15 p 0 22 respectively clearly the amount of gsh was also important for the regulation of args therefore both cysteine and its metabolite gsh are regulators of args patterns in responses to cuo nps 3 5 underlying mechanisms by which biosynthesized cysteine regulates args patterns in response to cuo nps to uncover the underlying mechanisms of regulation of args by cysteine mges i e inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 were evaluated on account of their vital roles in facilitating the dissemination of args among bacteria huang et al 2016 thomas and nielsen 2005 fig 6 shows that the relative abundances of these mges were all significantly increased p 0 05 when the in situ biosynthesis of cysteine was inhibited by hydroxylamine for instance when 10 mm hydroxylamine was added the amounts of inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 were 1 5 2 6 and 5 3 fold those in the absence of the inhibitor p 0 05 respectively inti 1 the most prevalent mge in various environments can integrate and transfer args via gene cassettes gatica et al 2016 gillings et al 2015 with respect to non cassette resistance genes inserting sequence common regions iscrs a newly highlighted complex integron element plays an essential role in their transfer toleman et al 2006 clearly the dissemination and acquisition of args in bacteria could be facilitated by mges however our results indicate that biosynthesized cysteine could limit the abundances of mges which in turn restricted the possibility of args transfer via mges moreover it has been pointed out that the transfer frequency or the recombination rate of mges is strictly controlled by the sos response beaber et al 2004 guerin et al 2009 the sos response can be induced by several stresses aertsen and michiels 2006 for example the oxidative stress induced by al2o3 nps was demonstrated to trigger the sos response in escherichia coli promoting gene transfer qiu et al 2012 in the current study cuo nps were observed to disrupt the balance of the redox couple gsh gssg fig 3 the induced oxidative stress was found to be mitigated by biosynthesis and metabolism of cysteine from bs therefore the limited abundances of mges in the presence of in situ biosynthesized cysteine as well as the mitigation of oxidative stress by biosynthesized cysteine may restrict the horizontal transfer of args these might be the key reasons for the regulation of args shown in fig 2 co selection between heavy metal and antibiotic resistance is another mechanism for the evolution and propagation of args baker austin et al 2006 li et al 2017 in the present study the amount of free copper was found to be negatively associated with the amount of cysteine fig 7 a when the biosynthesis of cysteine was severely inhibited fig 4a the concentration of free copper could reach up to 7 fold and 16 fold that without inhibitor treatments p 0 05 both cysteine and its metabolite gsh contain the thiol group sh which is able to chelate heavy metals ma et al 2015 in addition nps made from for example zno and ag tended to be transformed to zn cysteine and ag gsh respectively over the course of anaerobic digestion kim et al 2016 lombi et al 2012 hence in the presence of decreased amounts of cysteine and gsh more non chelated copper might be available it is also possible that more available bs resulting from the inhibition of cysteine biosynthesis could favor the formation of cus nps which contribute to higher copper content as cus nps were suggested to be more soluble than the pristine cuo nps li et al 2015 ma et al 2014 in any case copper stress seems closely associated with bio generated cysteine fig 7b reveals the patterns of copper resistance genes when cysteine biosynthesis was inhibited it is obvious that cop a and pco r were significantly regulated by the amounts of cysteine produced p 0 05 the relative abundances of cop a and pco r under cysteine limited condition were almost two fold and 22 fold those in cysteine rich conditions respectively copper resistance was suggested to be positively correlated with bioavailable cu rather than total cu zhang et al 2016c recently luo et al 2017 have reported the co occurrence of sul i and copper resistance genes pcoa pcob pcoc pcod pcoe and pcos in full scale biogas reactors results from zhang et al also demonstrated that cop a and pco r both positively correlated with args such as sul i tet o and erm b zhang et al 2016a 2016b therefore promotion of cysteine synthesis could block possible co selection between copper and antibiotic resistance by lowering the amount of bioavailable copper the higher doses of cuo nps applied in the current study may limit the reference value of this study in evaluating the risks of nps on the fate of args in real environment however the levels of cuo nps beyond the buffering capability of sludge were applied to produce clear responses of args to nps and more importantly to determine the regulatory role of bs in such experimental systems it is easy to compare the respective contributions of sulfidation and cysteine biosynthesis to the effects on patterns of args the critical role of cysteine disclosed in this study provides new insight into the role of bs in attenuating the bio effects of m nps 4 conclusions it was found in this study that cuo nps at environmentally relevant concentration had no significant effects on the fate of args however higher dosages would contribute to the propagation of args and the trends were effectively mitigated by the presence of bs in digesters the regulation of args was not attributable to sulfidation instead cysteine whose biosynthesis and metabolism were favored and supplied by bs and the activated key enzymes oass and γ gcs was found to be the vital args regulator further investigations indicated that cysteine in situ biosynthesized from bs not only restricted horizontal gene transfer potential by limiting the abundances of mges and mitigating oxidative stress but also blocked possible co selection by alleviating copper stress and reducing the abundances of copper resistance genes declaration of interests the authors

18803,biogenic sulfide bs in anaerobic digesters was previously suggested to mitigate the potential impacts of metallic nanoparticles m nps on antibiotic resistance genes args propagation by sulfidation of the m nps in this study a new role of bs in regulating args responses to m nps is reported it was observed that cuo nps at environmentally relevant level had no significant effects on the spread of args however higher dosage 50 mg gtss contributed to the propagation of args whose abundances would be effectively reduced by 74 115 if bs production was stimulated instead introduction of edta a metal ion chelator resulted in much lower attenuation efficiencies 12 40 indicating that restriction of the bioavailability of cuo nps might not be the only reason for the buffering of arg responses in the presence of bs further investigation showed that the presence of bs together with activation of key enzymes o acetyl serine sulfhydrylase and γ glutamylcysteine synthetase supplied and favored the biosynthesis and transformation of cysteine which mitigated the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps moreover the amounts of cysteine and its metabolite glutathione in sludge were associated with the abundances of args negatively implying that in situ generated cysteine was the important args regulator exploration of possible mechanisms revealed that the biosynthesized cysteine might limit gene transfer potential via mobile genetic elements as cysteine restricted the abundances of inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr 1 in addition the cysteine remarkably alleviated the copper stress and copper resistance which in turn blocked possible co selection between copper and antibiotic resistance this work provides new insight into attenuation of the bio effects of nps in digesters graphical abstract image 1 keywords biogenic sulfide cuo nanoparticle antibiotic resistance genes cysteine biosynthesis anaerobic digestion 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is widely applied to treat waste sludge because it showed advantages in sludge reduction as well as nutrient and energy recovery huang et al 2019 during this anaerobic treatment process biogenic sulfide bs is inevitably generated via the transformation of sulfur whose content was reported to be 1 of the dry sludge zhang et al 2017a generally the formation of bs is undesirable because of the resulting problems such as odour nuisance corrosion of digesters sulfide toxicity and competition with methanogens appels et al 2008 jiang et al 2015 lin et al 2018 however recent studies also suggested that bs could serve as a shield passivating toxic contaminants present in waste sludge for example metallic nanoparticles m nps which have been found to accumulated in sludge with considerable abundances and diversities tou et al 2017 were observed to be sulfidized by bs during sludge anaerobic digestion donner et al 2011 kim et al 2016 lombi et al 2012 the nano metal sulfides formed had lower solubility than the pristine nps which mitigated the bio effects of nps on digestion performance gonzalez estrella et al 2015 yang et al 2012 similarly it has also been suggested that the bs rich condition might account for the buffered responses of antibiotic resistance genes args to m nps exposure results from kim et al 2016 found that the rapid sulfidation of ag nps to ag2s nps effectively sequestered ag and therefore blocked biological interactions with the digester microbial community generally m nps such as ag nps and cuo nps exhibit considerable solubility bioavailable metal released from these m nps would serve as selective pressure driving the proliferation of args baker austin et al 2006 di cesare et al 2016 luo et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 therefore the restricted solubility of ag2s nps might be responsible for the lack of changes in args patterns observed in a digester exposed to ag nps kim et al 2016 miller et al 2013 however the contribution of sulfidation to restriction of metal release from m nps has recently been challenged for instance results from two research groups confirmed that cus nps yielded from cuo nps after sulfidation exhibited higher solubility than pristine nps li et al 2015 ma et al 2014 hence bs induced sulfidation might not be the main mechanism if the impacts of cuo nps on args were buffered in anaerobic digesters m nps such as tio2 qiu et al 2015 al2o3 qiu et al 2012 and zno wang et al 2018 were capable of promoting the horizontal transfer of multi resistance within or across genera in pure culture or indigenous aquatic microbiota systems considering the high dense of bacteria and richness of nutrition in digesters huang et al 2016 2017 the dissemination of args in sludge would be facilitated with present m nps it has also been pointed out that the stimulated transfer of args induced by zno nps was a particle specific effect rather than the effect of released zn2 wang et al 2018 taking the limited or low solubility of tio2 nps and al2o3 nps into consideration it seems that the activated args transfer was not associated with the solubility of nps thus sulfidation might not be effective to mitigate the impacts of m nps on the horizontal transfer of args m nps and args are both concerning emerging contaminants accumulated in waste sludge tou et al 2017 vikesland et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to understand how bs regulates the responses of args to m nps during sludge anaerobic digestion in the current study cuo nps were chosen as representative m nps the assessed amounts of cuo nps in anaerobic digestion systems were in the range from 1 to 100 mg gtss according to previous studies and the environmental relevant levels of cuo nps in sludge were usually set as 1 5 mg gtss unsar et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017c since bs was observed to effectively mitigate the impact of cuo nps on eight target args the objectives of this study were to investigate 1 whether bs induced sulfidation was the major regulator of args and 2 if not to determine how args patterns were regulated 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of waste sludge and nanoparticles waste sludge used in this study was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china the waste sludge was settled at 4 c for 24 h and then the supernatant was discharged the settlement was filtered through stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and finally concentrated to total suspended solids tss of about 10 g l for subsequent studies cuo nps were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa a stock dispersion of cuo nps was prepared by adding 2 25g of nps to 1 0 l of distilled water ph 7 0 the suspension was sonicated at 25 c for 1 h 250 w 40 khz every time before being diluted for the following experiments 2 2 the roles of bs in regulating args patterns responding to cuo nps exposure during sludge anaerobic digestion serum bottles with working volume of 300 ml were used to simulate anaerobic digesters in this section a total of 10 series of reactors were set up and classified into four groups g a g b g c and g d each reactor set contained biological triplicates the reactors were described in figure s1 in g a three series of reactors were exposed to different doses of cuo nps 5 25 and 50 mg gtss respectively the higher dosages 25 and 50 mg gtss were applied not only to get a full insight on the fates of args responding to nps whose production and application were growing every year huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017c but also to uncover the exact roles of bs playing in regulating args more conveniently and logically in g b and g c all digesters were initially exposed to 50 mg gtss cuo nps the two series in g b were supplemented with 0 5 and 1 mm of sulfate respectively to stimulate the production of bs the two series in g c were dosed with 1 and 3 mm of edta respectively g d reactors were not exposed to cuo nps randomly chosen series in this group were supplied with 1 mm sulfate and 1 mm edta respectively the remaining series without any addition was regarded as the control all reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 35 2 c the ph value of the digestion mixture was maintained at 7 0 the digestion period of each batch was 17 d according to a previous study huang et al 2019 2 3 effects of cuo nps exposure on the activities of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of cysteine sludge samples collected from reactors in g a at the end of digestion were washed 3 times with 0 85 nacl solution then 2 5 g of wet sludge was re sampled and re suspended in 5 ml of nacl solution and sonicated 40 khz 20 min in ice bath to extract crude enzymes the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12000 g 4 c for 10 min and placed on ice for subsequent enzyme assays the total protein was estimated according to a previous study fediuc et al 2005 to determine the activity of o acetyl serine sulfhydrylase oass the reaction mixture contained 5 mm o acetyl l serine oas 3 mm na2s 10 mm dithiothreitol and 0 1 m sodium phosphate ph 8 in 0 2 ml of crude extract warrilow and hawkesford 2000 the reaction was initiated by the addition of oas followed by incubation at 50 c for 10 min and terminated by addition of acidic ninhydrin fediuc et al 2005 the cysteine produced was measured by recording absorbance at 560 nm oass activity is presented in μmol of cysteine produced per mg protein per min to determine the activity of γ glutamylcysteine synthetase γ gcs the reaction mixture was composed of 10 mm na glutamate 10 mm l aminobutyrate 2 mm na2 edta 0 02 bovine serum albumen 20 mm mgcl2 5 mm na2 atp and 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 2 in 0 2 ml of crude extract nagalakshmi and prasad 2001 the reaction was pre incubated for 2 min at room temperature followed by incubation at 37 c for 30 min and terminated by 5 trichloroacetic acid then the liberated phosphate was estimated the γ gcs activity is presented in as μmol of pi produced per mg protein per h 2 4 the roles of biosynthesized cysteine and metabolic glutathione in regulating args patterns in response to cuo nps exposure during sludge anaerobic digestion to explore the roles of biosynthesized cysteine and glutathione gsh on the args patterns specific enzymatic inhibitors i e hydroxylamine hydrochloride for oass and buthionine sulfoximine bso for γ gcs were applied hirase and molin 2001 kimura and kimura 2004 in this section briefly all digesters were classified into two groups in group i seven series of reactors were exposed to 50 mg gtss cuo nps plus 1 mm sulfate six series chosen at random were supplied with hydroxylamine 1 5 and 10 mm or bso 0 5 1 and 5 mm respectively the remaining reactor was set as the control digesters in group ii were almost duplicates of group i except that none of the reactors was exposed to cuo nps all other operations were the same as those described in section 2 2 2 5 quantification of antibiotic and copper resistance genes in sludge samples sludge samples for dna extraction were collected by centrifugation at the end of each experiment genomic dna was extracted following purkhold s protocol which consisted of lysozyme proteinase k and sodium dodecyl sulfate treatments purkhold et al 2000 according to the literature tetracycline sulfonamide and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin resistance genes are the most abundant args in sludge tian et al 2016 thus some frequently detected args representing these types such as tetc and tetq suli and sulii and ermb and ermx were assessed in this study in addition strb and mexb were targeted to reflect the fate of aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance respectively in addition inti1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 representing diverse mobile genetic elements mges were tracked to reveal the potential for horizontal gene transfer in sludge zhang et al 2016c as copper has been demonstrated to play important roles in co selection of resistance genes zhu et al 2013 two copper resistance genes copa and pcor were also quantified quantitative pcr experiments were conducted using the standard curve method details of the reaction mixture amplification program and melting curves were also described in our previous studies huang et al 2016 2017 the primers and annealing temperature for each target gene are presented in table s1 as shown in table s2 the amplification efficiencies of all target genes were in the range 100 10 with r2 0 99 data in table s3 suggest that inhibitors used in this study i e hydroxylamine hydrochloride and bso did not significantly contribute to the propagation of args 2 6 other analytical methods and statistical analysis tss and vss were measured according to our previous publications huang et al 2017 cysteine and reactive oxygen species ros were determined following the protocols described by su et al 2016 gsh in sludge was extracted using an hclo4 edta method and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc which were detailed in supporting information the concentration of copper was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry perkinelmer optima 2100 dv usa all tests in this study were performed in triplicate and the one way analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of results p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bs on args patterns in response to cuo nps during sludge anaerobic digestion during last decades a lot of attention has been paid to the impacts of nps on anaerobic digestion performance however the potential effects of nps on the fates of args have rarely been concerned in this study it was found that only the highest dosage of cuo nps 50 mg gtss resulted in the significant reduction p 0 05 in vss destruction efficiency figure s2 with respect to args patterns they were more sensitive to cuo nps exposure as shown in fig 1 a d the relative abundances of 8 target args were in the range of 10 5 10 1 and sulfonamide resistance genes were the most abundant these observations were comparable with previous studies huang et al 2017 ma et al 2011 the lowest dose of cuo nps 5 mg gtss caused no significant difference p 0 05 in the relative abundances of most of the assessed args except ermb and strb compared with the control however when the test doses increased the propagation of args was stimulated for example the relative abundances of sul i sul ii tet c tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were about 1 73 p 0 030 1 77 p 0 021 1 35 p 0 028 2 76 p 0 016 9 96 p 0 003 1 92 p 0 001 18 17 p 0 004 and 3 99 fold p 0 006 those in the control respectively fig 1 when sludge was exposed to 50 mg gtss cuo nps similar trends were also observed for mges the abundances of inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 in response to cuo nps 50mg gtss were 8 48 p 0 001 4 50 p 0 010 and 6 14 p 0 009 fold those in the control respectively fig 1e g this was consistent with our previous metagenomics results in which diverse mges were confirmed to be enriched by m nps huang et al 2019 according to a recent study the presence of agnps in digesters had no remarkable impacts on args distribution kim et al 2016 the absence of any effects was suggested to be due to the formation of ag2s nps in anaerobic digesters which limited the bioavailability of ag nps to sludge bacteria kim et al 2016 based on this theory the propagation of args in the present study might be on account of un buffered biological effects of cuo nps to test this extra sulfate which would inevitably be transformed to bs in anaerobic condition was added into our digesters as shown in fig 2 although the addition of sulfate led to a slight increment in most target genes except sul i erm x and inti 1 in digesters without cuo nps exposure sulfate dose dependently mitigated the propagation of args and mges induced by cuo nps for instance in the presence of 1 mm sulfate the relative abundances of target args exposed to cuo nps were only 0 89 2 04 fold those in the control in other words the contributions of cuo nps to the dissemination of sul i sul ii tet c tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were reduced by 115 84 74 102 97 75 94 and 89 respectively fig 2a h similarly the impacts of cuo nps on mges were reduced by 52 101 p 0 05 fig 2i k apparently the biological effects of cuo nps on args could be effectively mitigated by bs 3 2 is sulfidation induced by bs the main regulator of args patterns generally sulfidation of m nps decreases their biological effects on microorganisms because the transformed product usually exhibits lower solubilty compared with pristine nps kim et al 2016 li et al 2015 given that bioavailable metal is believed to be a driver of args proliferation baker austin et al 2006 luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c it seems logical that the decreased bioavailable copper after sulfidation in this study might account for the decreased args abundances to test this speculation edta a metal chelator which captures copper ions and decreases their bioavailability was added into digesters li et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b it was found that the relative abundances of target genes except tet c decreased on edta addition at the dose of 3 mm edta the contributions of cuo nps to the propagation of sul i sul ii tet q erm b str b and mex b was reduced by 40 p 0 061 22 p 0 016 44 p 0 029 38 p 0 014 25 p 0 015 and 38 p 0 036 respectively thus data obtained following the addition of sulfate or edta all indicated that the bioavailable copper released from cuo nps did contribute to the propagation of args however the effect of sulfate was much greater than that of edta hence other additional factors as well as sulfidation may be involved in the moderation of the responses of args to cuo nps in the presence of bs this was consistent with our previous study in which released ions were not the main reason for the toxicity of cuo nps su et al 2016 recent studies which suggested that cus nps yielded from cuo nps showed much higher solubility li et al 2015 ma et al 2014 also challenge the role of sulfidation in limiting args dissemination therefore sulfide rich conditions in digesters might trigger another mechanism responsible for counteracting effects of cuo nps on args 3 3 effects of bs on the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps apart from the released bioavailable metal ions nps might also affect the distribution of args via induced oxidative stress which would trigger sos response and facilitate the horizontal transfer of args among bacteria beaber et al 2004 qiu et al 2012 in the current study the ratio of glutathione gsh glutathione disulfide gssg decreased significantly from 9 6 to 3 5 in the presence of 50mg gtss cuo nps p 0 05 fig 3 a that might be attributable to the formation of ros whose level was almost 1 8 fold that in the control without cuo nps exposure fig 3b normally ros are generated in aerobic processes but key roles of ros in anaerobic conditions were also observed in recent studies mu and chen 2011 su et al 2016 the ros induced here resulted in the transformation of gsh to its oxidized form i e gssg disrupting the intracellular redox balance however once sulfate was added the ros level was decreased and the redox balance was recovered fig 3a and b similar observations concerning the mitigation of oxidative stress were reported in previous studies most of which were closely related to cysteine because it is involved in the biosynthesis of gsh to defend against oxidative stress setyawati et al 2016 su et al 2016 therefore the amounts of cysteine in sludge bacteria were evaluated as shown in fig 3c cuo nps exposure contributed to a significant depletion of cysteine in sludge p 0 05 sulfate addition dramatically increased corresponding amount of cysteine by about 8 5 fold compared with that in sludge exposed to nps alone p 0 05 it seems that sulfide rich conditions might benefit the in situ biosynthesis of cysteine bs can be metabolized into organic sulfur compounds with the participation of several key enzymes fig 3e sekowska et al 2000 su et al 2016 oass which catalyzes the last step in the transformation of sulfide to cysteine was found to be activated by cuo nps fig 3e furthermore the activity of γ gcs the rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of gsh from cysteine nagalakshmi and prasad 2001 was increased by 68 in the presence of cuo nps similar stimulated activities were also observed in previous studies most of which mainly focused on plants results from fediuc et al 2005 suggested that the activity of oass was increased under cadmium stress free copper was observed to stimulate γ gcs increasing the biosynthesis of gsh nagalakshmi and prasad 2001 as bacteria shared similar sulfur assimilation metabolisms with plants sekowska et al 2000 the copper ions released from cuo nps in digesters might be responsible for the enzyme activation by two possible mechanisms 1 free copper directly triggered activation of the enzymes or 2 copper ions first stimulated γ gcs facilitating the consumption of cysteine which in turn increased the activity of oass because oass is feedback regulated by the concentration of cysteine leon et al 1987 the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps might trigger demand for cysteine and gsh which might also result in the increased activities of the enzymes however even with the activated oass and γ gcs cuo nps still resulted in the depletion of cysteine fig 3 possibly because of a shortage of bs as it was consumed in the sulfidation of cuo nps once sulfate was added to the reactors the sulfide rich conditions would supply and favor the in situ biosynthesis and metabolism of cysteine which further mitigated the oxidative stress induced by cuo nps 3 4 the roles of biosynthesized cysteine and metabolic gsh in regulating args responding to cuo nps to validate the role of cysteine biosynthesized from sulfide in the regulation of args hydroxylamine a specific inhibitor of oass fig 3e hirase and molin 2001 was added into digesters as shown in fig 4 a although the presence of sulfate was found to favor the biosynthesis of cysteine the addition of hydroxylamine dose dependently decreased the concentrations of cysteine in sludge at doses of 5 and 10 mm hydroxylamine the abundances of cysteine were respectively 51 and 37 that without addition of inhibitor p 0 05 accordingly significant rebounds in args abundances were observed for example when 10 mm hydroxylamine was added into digesters the relative abundances of sul i sul ii tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were significantly p 0 05 increased to 1 66 1 45 2 98 5 50 1 35 8 00 and 2 40 fold those in sludge exposed to sulfate without the addition of hydroxylamine respectively fig 4b tet c was the most insensitive arg its abundance in response to 10 mm hydroxylamine was only 1 22 fold p 0 067 that without inhibitor addition in fig 2a h corresponding abundances of sul i sul ii tet c tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b exposed to cuo nps were 1 94 1 58 1 24 3 83 7 72 1 56 8 91 and 2 84 fold those attenuated by sulfate addition clearly it turned out that the contribution of sulfate addition to args reduction was limited once cysteine biosynthesis was inhibited similarly to validate the hypothesis that gsh a metabolite of cysteine played a considerable roles in the dissemination of args bso a specific inhibitor of γ gcs fig 3e kimura and kimura 2004 was added into anaerobic digesters as shown in fig 5 a bso dose dependently suppressed the level of gsh the presence of 1 and 5 mm bso decreased the levels of gsh by 20 p 0 049 and 30 p 0 032 respectively compared with that without bso addition the relative abundances of assessed genes increased on the addition of bso fig 5b in the presence of 5 mm bso the relative abundances of tet q erm b erm x str b and mex b were significantly increased p 0 05 by 199 147 32 256 and 72 respectively in addition sul i sul ii and tet c showed similar but insignificant trends increasing by 21 p 0 24 20 p 0 07 and 15 p 0 22 respectively clearly the amount of gsh was also important for the regulation of args therefore both cysteine and its metabolite gsh are regulators of args patterns in responses to cuo nps 3 5 underlying mechanisms by which biosynthesized cysteine regulates args patterns in response to cuo nps to uncover the underlying mechanisms of regulation of args by cysteine mges i e inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 were evaluated on account of their vital roles in facilitating the dissemination of args among bacteria huang et al 2016 thomas and nielsen 2005 fig 6 shows that the relative abundances of these mges were all significantly increased p 0 05 when the in situ biosynthesis of cysteine was inhibited by hydroxylamine for instance when 10 mm hydroxylamine was added the amounts of inti 1 tn916 1545 and iscr1 were 1 5 2 6 and 5 3 fold those in the absence of the inhibitor p 0 05 respectively inti 1 the most prevalent mge in various environments can integrate and transfer args via gene cassettes gatica et al 2016 gillings et al 2015 with respect to non cassette resistance genes inserting sequence common regions iscrs a newly highlighted complex integron element plays an essential role in their transfer toleman et al 2006 clearly the dissemination and acquisition of args in bacteria could be facilitated by mges however our results indicate that biosynthesized cysteine could limit the abundances of mges which in turn restricted the possibility of args transfer via mges moreover it has been pointed out that the transfer frequency or the recombination rate of mges is strictly controlled by the sos response beaber et al 2004 guerin et al 2009 the sos response can be induced by several stresses aertsen and michiels 2006 for example the oxidative stress induced by al2o3 nps was demonstrated to trigger the sos response in escherichia coli promoting gene transfer qiu et al 2012 in the current study cuo nps were observed to disrupt the balance of the redox couple gsh gssg fig 3 the induced oxidative stress was found to be mitigated by biosynthesis and metabolism of cysteine from bs therefore the limited abundances of mges in the presence of in situ biosynthesized cysteine as well as the mitigation of oxidative stress by biosynthesized cysteine may restrict the horizontal transfer of args these might be the key reasons for the regulation of args shown in fig 2 co selection between heavy metal and antibiotic resistance is another mechanism for the evolution and propagation of args baker austin et al 2006 li et al 2017 in the present study the amount of free copper was found to be negatively associated with the amount of cysteine fig 7 a when the biosynthesis of cysteine was severely inhibited fig 4a the concentration of free copper could reach up to 7 fold and 16 fold that without inhibitor treatments p 0 05 both cysteine and its metabolite gsh contain the thiol group sh which is able to chelate heavy metals ma et al 2015 in addition nps made from for example zno and ag tended to be transformed to zn cysteine and ag gsh respectively over the course of anaerobic digestion kim et al 2016 lombi et al 2012 hence in the presence of decreased amounts of cysteine and gsh more non chelated copper might be available it is also possible that more available bs resulting from the inhibition of cysteine biosynthesis could favor the formation of cus nps which contribute to higher copper content as cus nps were suggested to be more soluble than the pristine cuo nps li et al 2015 ma et al 2014 in any case copper stress seems closely associated with bio generated cysteine fig 7b reveals the patterns of copper resistance genes when cysteine biosynthesis was inhibited it is obvious that cop a and pco r were significantly regulated by the amounts of cysteine produced p 0 05 the relative abundances of cop a and pco r under cysteine limited condition were almost two fold and 22 fold those in cysteine rich conditions respectively copper resistance was suggested to be positively correlated with bioavailable cu rather than total cu zhang et al 2016c recently luo et al 2017 have reported the co occurrence of sul i and copper resistance genes pcoa pcob pcoc pcod pcoe and pcos in full scale biogas reactors results from zhang et al also demonstrated that cop a and pco r both positively correlated with args such as sul i tet o and erm b zhang et al 2016a 2016b therefore promotion of cysteine synthesis could block possible co selection between copper and antibiotic resistance by lowering the amount of bioavailable copper the higher doses of cuo nps applied in the current study may limit the reference value of this study in evaluating the risks of nps on the fate of args in real environment however the levels of cuo nps beyond the buffering capability of sludge were applied to produce clear responses of args to nps and more importantly to determine the regulatory role of bs in such experimental systems it is easy to compare the respective contributions of sulfidation and cysteine biosynthesis to the effects on patterns of args the critical role of cysteine disclosed in this study provides new insight into the role of bs in attenuating the bio effects of m nps 4 conclusions it was found in this study that cuo nps at environmentally relevant concentration had no significant effects on the fate of args however higher dosages would contribute to the propagation of args and the trends were effectively mitigated by the presence of bs in digesters the regulation of args was not attributable to sulfidation instead cysteine whose biosynthesis and metabolism were favored and supplied by bs and the activated key enzymes oass and γ gcs was found to be the vital args regulator further investigations indicated that cysteine in situ biosynthesized from bs not only restricted horizontal gene transfer potential by limiting the abundances of mges and mitigating oxidative stress but also blocked possible co selection by alleviating copper stress and reducing the abundances of copper resistance genes declaration of interests the authors

18804,the widespread of water borne antibiotic resistance genes args represents a growing threat to the health of millions of people our study detected the relative abundances of 10 arg subtypes in the shanghai river network where the major arg components were strb sul1 and ermb these args were significantly enriched by the combined sewage tail water from urban wastewater treatment plant and runoff from agricultural areas which reached the suzhou sz dianpu dp and huangpu hp river respectively one way anova p 0 01 the target args were distributed in varying patterns across different rivers bla ctx m and bla tem contributed to the increase of total args in the rivers influenced by urban sources particularly in the sz river whose distribution of args was significantly related to that of the confluence of the whole river network mantel test p 0 01 the bacterial community was closely structured with args and potential pathogenic bacteria s association with target args became significant in downstream samples procrustes test p 0 03 water near urban wastewater fallouts was observed to have the highest content of intl1 in the dp river whose downstream samples intl arg relationship fitted the same regression model as that of the network confluence r 0 84 p 0 001 the amelioration of river water quality does not reduce args but may affect their distributional patterns

the development of a city is often associated with the spread of antimicrobial resistance amr due to the increasing input of anthropogenic waste pruden et al 2013 wellington et al 2013 such as domestic wastewater guo et al 2017 municipal solid waste graham et al 2011 and husbandry waste wang et al 2017 shanghai is the core city of the yangtze delta estuary which harbors the most populous urban agglomeration in the world and the most antibiotic contaminated river basin in china zhang et al 2015 its intensive industrial activities and accelerating urbanization are reportedly linked to the increasing occurrences of antibiotic resistance genes args in the estuary environment zhu et al 2017 recent metagenomic analyses showed that pathogens in human environments shared almost the same resistome with the ones in nature pehrsson et al 2016 primarily because args could readily transfer across bacterial species via horizontal gene transfer hgt the detected high abundance of mobile genetic elements mges in the major tributary rivers of the yangtze delta estuary demonstrate the high hgt potentials of args jiang et al 2013 which jeopardizes the health of 20 million people living in the same watershed similar to other metropolises in developing countries shanghai faces preeminent challenges from water and wastewater management including the combined sewer point source pollution in the old downtown area walsh et al 2011 the discharge of tail water from urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp gao et al 2015 and the agricultural area source pollution in semirural suburbs ji et al 2012 in 2015 china issued a national action plan for the prevention and control of water pollution which requires the shanghai municipality to reduce the percentage of black and odorous water bodies in the whole river network to 10 by 2020 mee 2015 although this strict administrative action may effectively improve river water quality in the downtown areas its effects on the removal of args remains largely unknown however to date few studies have focused on the characterization of args across different pollution sources in this estuary or compared their impacts on the distribution of amr related genes along main rivers in shanghai city this is a major omission in that different from other water bodies rivers linked to the yangtze delta estuary can hold contaminants for a relatively long time due to the effects of tidal currents zheng et al 2016 and the extended residence period has been proved to facilitate the enrichment of args wu et al 2018b to address these knowledge gaps our study selected shanghai river network s three major rivers each of which is associated with different anthropogenic pollution sources we detected args that are commonly of concern in the environment and their parallel antibiotics including sulfonamides sas tetracyclines tcs macrolides mls aminoglycosides agy and beta lactams have been previously detected in the study area shi et al 2014 yan et al 2013 the bacterial community structures were also profiled these data were then analyzed with other arm determinants and water quality across all target rivers which allowed a holistic characterization of the spread of args from multiple sampling sections 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study area included 10 sites on the suzhou sz river dianpu dp river and huangpu hp river which primarily constitute the shanghai river network and converge at nenjiang quay the site nj fig 1 three sampling sections including the upstream wastewater input and downstream were selected to depict the args distributions along the river network fig 1 with respect to the sampling sites along the sz river which receives combined sewage in the old downtown the site sz 1 was located in the upstream of the combined sewage pump stations the sz 2 was located near the pump stations outfalls the wetland park wetpark was located in the downstream areas of sz river in the dp river the site dp 1 wwtp areas neighboring tail water outfalls and dp 2 were selected as the upstream input and downstream sampling sites respectively in parallel to the sampling of typical urban rivers a reservoir res was selected as the upstream sampling site of the hp river the site mh which was agriculturally influenced in the vicinity of feedlots and farm land was selected as the input sampling site the site xp which has been reclaimed into a riverside park was selected as the downstream sampling site fig 1 there were no industrial or agricultural wastewater outfalls from site mh to xp 2 2 samples collection and pretreatment the central goal of this study was to characterize the spatial pattern of arg contamination from upstream to downstream areas of the target river network and to further explain the impacts of different anthropogenic pollution on the variation of args across different rivers considering that pump stations functioned when there was a storm to avoid city waterlogging all water samples were collected monthly from april to june rainy season of shanghai in 2016 and 2017 surface water in the top 0 5 m of the river surface was collected in triplicates all collected samples 600 ml containers were returned to the laboratory on ice in the dark approximately 100 ml of samples were frozen at 20 c before physicochemical analyses and the remaining samples were stored at 4 c for vacuum filtration 0 22 μm membrane membranesolutions allpure shanghai within 12 h of sampling the membranes were stored at 40 c before the dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and target genes genomic dna of river water was extracted by using power soil dna extraction kits mobio usa and a ribolyzer fastpre 24 mp usa according to manufactures suggested protocols the yields and quality of dna extractions were verified by uv vis spectrophotometer merinton 4000 beijing the dna concentrations were calculated based on the od260 value and the absorption ratio of od260 280 in this study was between 1 8 and 2 0 the extracted dna samples were stored at 40 c prior to the polymerase chain reaction pcr assays prior to pcr tests the extracted dna samples were diluted 5 times at 5 ngdna μl to reduce interference to the reaction there were 11 genes targeted in this study which included 10 subtypes of args and 1 marker genes of mges specifically the args were comprised of sul1 and sul2 that encode resistance sulr to the sas luo et al 2010 ermb and mefa that encode resistance mlsr to the mls wu et al 2015 bla ctx m and bla tem that encode resistance blar to beta lactams ahammad et al 2014 and aada1 and strb that encode resistance agyr to the agy the target mge marker gene was intl1 which represents the integrons yu et al 2016 the primers and amplification process are detailed in the supplementary information si 1 2 4 real time quantitative pcr qpcr assays all qpcr assays were performed with biorad cfx96 touch biorad usa each reaction was in a 10 μl mixture system which contained 1 μl of template dna 0 5 μl of each primer 10 nm 3 μl of nuclease free ddh2o and 5 μl of sybr green mix tiangen beijing the 16s rrna gene 16s rdna was also quantified to normalize detected genes across samples with different bacterial abundances at a magnitude of 108 log10 copies ml water all reactions were run simultaneously with standards of known quantities serially diluted six times 1 10 to 1 106 and a non template control nuclease free ddh2o the standard calibration curves for all target genes yielded r2 0 99 with amplification efficiencies ranging from 0 95 to 1 10 in this study the non template control nuclease free ddh2o of 16s rdna was required to be no less than 30 circles before reaching the threshold value the primers and qpcr protocols are provided in the si

were merged and illustrated by the cytoscape 3 0 2 software 3 results 3 1 abundance and variations of target args in river water there were 10 subtypes of args quantified using qpcr in all samples notably strb 1 5 1 3 log10 copies 16s rdna sul1 0 4 0 7 log10 copies 16s rdna and ermb 1 5 1 6 log10 copies 16s rdna were consistently observed as the major 90 arg subtypes with respect to conferring the resistance of agyr sulr and mlsr across all sampling sites fig 2 by contrast there was no apparent predominance concerning the relative abundance between bla tem and bla ctx m 2 4 versus 2 2 log10 copies 16s rdna and between tetm and tetq approximately 2 5 log10 copies 16s rdna as shown in the fig 1 the whole river network was divided into three sections for sampling to compare args levels across sampling sections the relative abundances of target arg subtypes in each sample were summed to perform the statistical analysis the overall trend was less abundant args in the upper streams 0 41 0 7 vs 0 36 0 9 log10 copies 16s rdna kruskal wallis kw χ2 18 5 p 0 001 specifically dp 1 had the highest abundance of target args 0 24 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna fig 2 in the upstream section one way anova f 7 1 p 0 01 where the major arg components were the sulr genes 0 27 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna in the following input section fig 1 which included the sites sz 2 wwtp and mh the discharge of all types of wastewater significantly elevated the total level of arg by 2 3 orders of magnitude paired t test pt p 0 01 compared to the hp river agriculturally influenced the increase of args in the sz and dp rivers was more apparently attributed to the enrichment of blar subtypes whose relative abundance increased to 1 5 0 6 and 1 2 1 0 log10 copies 16s rdna in the site sz 2 and wwtp fig 2 respectively as rivers flowed to the downstream section fig 1 the total contents of the target arg decreased by half from site sz 2 to wetpark 0 43 0 2 log10 copies 16s rdna pt p 0 18 similarly the sum of the abundance of the target args decreased to 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna in the site dp 2 mann whitney u test mw w 108 p 0 05 in the dp river fig 2 by contrast in the hp river the relative abundance of target args in the site xp was statistically the same as that of site mh pt p 0 36 among all downstream samples water in the whole river network confluence site site nj had the most abundant args 1 5 1 3 log10 copies 16s rdna kw p 0 05 particularly obvious for blar 0 26 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna and tetr 0 35 0 7 log10 copies 16s rdna in addition fig 3 a shows that more unique arg clusters are apparent in the hp river except for the nj confluence samples compared to the sz and dp samples suggesting less homogenization of the distribution of args in the urban rivers 3 2 dynamics of the bacterial community from upstream to downstream as shown in fig 3b bacterial communities featured higher diversity in upstream samples than downstream samples 4 5 vs 7 0 of the shannon index and meanwhile their compositions at the phylum level were also observed with distinct shifts pca bartlett s test χ2 106 6 p 0 001 although these variations based on the bray curtis distance were significantly different across the three rivers anosim r 0 71 p 0 001 the compositions of sequenced bacteria seemed less different to each other among the downstream samples fig 3b overall the predominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for 70 total bacterial 16s rdna sequences in all samples fig s1 proteobacteria were the largest group in the urban wastewater influenced rivers 38 9 18 6 fig s1 they increased by 20 from upstream to downstream samples in the sz river kw test χ2 10 7 p 0 05 this increase in the phylum of proteobacteria generally resulted from the variations of α and β proteobacteria fig s2 however proteobacteria s abundance was kept at 35 across all samples in the dp river e g site dp 2 where the major class was β proteobacteria 20 abundance fig s2 actinobacteria the most abundant phylum in the agriculturally impacted hp river 33 7 16 6 fig s1 was primarily represented by actinobacteria 5 25 fig s2 its abundance was detected with no significant variations across different sampling sections kw test p 0 49 in the hp river the insignificant variations of actinobacteria s abundance were also observed along the sz and dp rivers one way anova p 0 05 fig s2 similarly the relative abundance of bacteroidetes stayed on average at 11 4 7 0 in the hp river with no significant differences across sampling sections kw test p 0 66 however interestingly in rivers influenced by urban sources bacteroidetes experienced a 10 decline from the upstream to input sections pt p 0 05 fig s1 most of which was contributed by bacteroidia fig s2 at the genus level the bacteria whose subtaxon species were commonly classified as pathogens were analyzed as shown in fig s3 the annotated potential pathogenic bacterial genera were composed of klebsiella tzouvelekis et al 2012 mycobacterium naas et al 2001 pseudomonas perron et al 2004 acinetobacter byrne bailey et al 2009 and bacteroides eitel et al 2013 in our target river network samples si 2 in the sz river pseudomonas was detected in the upstream sampling sites including the site sz 1 6 0 of total classified genera and sz 2 1 4 the abundance of mycobacterium in the urban sewer fallouts sampling site sz 2 was 2 1 in the wetpark samples acinetobacter emerged and was detected as the most abundant potential pathogenic genus 9 5 fig s3 as the dp river flowed from the site dp 1 to wwtp the dominant genus of bacteroides increased from 4 2 to 13 5 fig s3 in the downstream samples the genera of mycobacterium pseudomonas and clostridium were all detected which had an averaged abundance 0 5 the hp river had less abundant target bacterial genera than the urban rivers the mycobacterium and pseudomonas both increased from 0 1 to 0 5 from upstream to downstream during which the clostridium and vibrio decreased to 0 1 fig s3 3 3 network analysis of relationships between bacterial communities and args in different rivers this study used network analyses to delineate the relationships among dominant bacteria target arg subtypes and potential pathogens relative abundance at the genus level fig 4 overall three predominant phyla including proteobacteria all its 5 classes actinobacteria most were actinobacteria and bacteroidetes flavobacteriia established linkages with nearly all target arg subtypes except the sulr table s2 which were detected as the major args in the whole river network fig 2 notably the arg subtypes that were significantly related to bacteria genus were different across sampling rivers the networked args in the hp river were classified as the mlsr tetr and agyr subtypes whereas the blar subtypes were more closely integrated in the urban rivers network models fig 4 in terms of potential pathogenic bacterial genera they displayed closer associations with other bacteria in the urban rivers than in the agricultural river as shown in fig 4a bacteroides and mycobacterium in the sz river possessed 20 linkages with the other bacteria but they were not closely related to the target args p 0 05 the only possible pathogenic arg ermb carrier was classified under the genus of pseudomonas in the sz river r 0 80 p 0 01 fig 4a similarly in the dp river fig 4b there were no args directly related to potential pathogens p 0 05 which nevertheless were closely structured with the whole bacteria community and even the bacteria with low abundance including klebsiella and escherichia 0 1 fig s3 established significant correlations with other bacteria in positive ways however the model showed the bacterial community in the hp river being less tightly intercorrelated in the network fig 4c where only the genus of bacteroides exhibited 10 positive relationships with other bacteria in the whole sequenced community 3 4 variations of intl1 and physicochemical factors as shown in table 1 among the three sampling sections the relative abundance of the intergon marker gene intl1 was significantly lower in the upstream areas of rivers one way anova f 14 3 p 0 01 where the site sz 1 had the lowest content 1 87 0 9 log10 copies 16s rdna however the input of combined sewerage enriched the intl1 by 1 5 orders of magnitude to 0 19 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna in the site sz 2 the treated urban wastewater and agriculturally impacted water also elevated the level of intl1 at the sites wwtp and mh 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna table 1 it is noteworthy that intl1 s abundance was averaged 0 96 1 5 log10 copies 16s rdna at the river network s confluence nj the decrease from the site xp to the downstream site nj 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna table 1 was probably caused by dilution of flows from the sites wetpark and dp 2 fig 1 whose intl1 s abundances were 1 40 1 2 and 0 96 1 5 log10 copies 16s rdna respectively in addition the varying pattern of intl1 s abundance is generally in accordance with the variation of target args across the hp river fig 2 which nevertheless was hardly observed in any other two rivers as shown in fig 5 the total abundance of target args in the hp river held significant correlations with intl1 in each sampling section in positive ways pearson r 0 60 p 0 01 in contrast the args and intl1 did not fit any significant linear regressions in the sz river s samples pearson kendal and spearman p 0 05 and no significant correlations between total target args and intl1 were detected in the dp river fig 5 except for at the site dp 2 river water sampled in the present study was generally neutral with ph values in the range of 6 8 7 5 table 1 their do values except for that of the wwtp samples 0 5 0 2 mg l were all above 3 mg l it appeared that higher do values usually cooccurred with higher nitrate nitrite contents in river water samples in addition nearly all samples tn and toc contents increased in the input section and then decreased in the downstream section particularly toc 10 0 3 8 mg l to 36 1 26 7 mg l the tp held a similar varying tendency to the tn with detected contents ranging from 0 15 to 2 0 mg l table 1 4 discussion the release of anthropogenic wastewater has long been known as a gateway of args to natural water environments such as freshwater lakes czekalski et al 2014 rivers amos et al 2014 estuaries zhu et al 2017 and sea water chen et al 2013 recent study suggests the relevance of agricultural sources and wwtps as reservoirs and environmental suppliers of genetic determinants of resistance whose dissemination to the human environment should be contained pruden et al 2013 by conducting comparative investigations we clearly showed that the combined sewage pump stations more greatly enriched target args fig 2 and intl1 table 1 in their effluent receiving river relative to the enrichment by wwtps and agricultural impacts this highlighted an increased amr risk in densely populated areas e g riverside parks and quay sites fig 1 where the human direct exposure rates are potentially high thus within the large context that china pledges to contain the spread of amr nhc 2016 it is becoming more critically important for future amr management of the urban water environment to know how the abundance and variation of args are related to different contamination sources which we reported for the first time in the major river network of the yangtze delta estuary 4 1 effects of different pollution sources in the river network as shown in fig 2 target args were significantly enriched in the water sampled from the input section kw χ2 18 6 p 0 001 which is in agreement with previous studies czekalski et al 2014 wu et al 2018b these args in the sz and dp rivers slightly decreased by 0 5 orders of magnitude from the input to their own downstream samples whereas they remained at the same level in the hp river fig 2 however compared to the upstream samples the whole river network s confluence water site nj fig 1 was characterized by significantly more abundant args in total 1 0 vs 1 5 log10 copies 16s rdna pt p 0 01 however notably the composition of profiled args was significantly different between the sites nj and xp anosim r 0 58 p 0 001 fig 3a it is interesting to note that site nj s args distributional pattern seems to be more closely correlated with that of site wetpark than with that of site xp mantel test r 0 66 vs 0 31 p 0 05 this suggests that the combined sewage could impose drastic impacts on the distribution of args in downstream river water and the impacts were more pronounced than the centralized municipal wwtp mantel test p 0 14 this is probably because raw wastewater usually contains relatively high levels of amr selective agents 1 μg l such as antibiotics and detergents abegglen et al 2009 meng et al 2013 and their effects could be preponderant over other factors in a complex environment mcnamara et al 2014 different types of pollution sources could also result in the variations of args bacteria relationships regarding the visualized positive correlations r 0 8 p 0 01 fig 4 more tensely networked blar subtypes in the urban rivers suggest the relevance of human use β lactam as a determinant of the occurrence of args or the potential selection of blar bacteria lamba et al 2017 maurya et al 2016 which were classified under the phylum of proteobacteria in our study table s2 by contrast in the hp river tetm and mefa were more closely related to the bacterial community which was also found in other sites with agricultural activities wang et al 2015 and firmicutes and actinobacteria were usually considered the gene carriers of tetr and mlsr su et al 2015 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 4 2 associations among args potential pathogenic bacteria and bacterial community conditions the target args and selected pathogenic bacterial genera were rarely correlated in the river network fig 4 but both of them exhibited high connectivity with the main bacterial community notably several predominant bacteria acted as the linking nodes that connected target args and postulated pathogenic bacterial genera fig 4 for example in the sz river the phylum of bacteroidetes was correlated with bla tem and bacteroides at the same time r 0 8 p 0 01 fig 4a in the hp river tetq and bacteroides were linked by actinobacteria r 0 8 p 0 01 fig 4c thus it is not surprising to find the significant correlations between the bacterial community and args mantel test r 0 21 p 0 01 and potential pathogenic bacteria mantel test r 0 71 p 0 001 interestingly these indirect linkages between target pathogenic genera and args whose variations were related to the bacterial community in the whole river network vpa 10 5 explained table s3 became statistically significant when rivers converged in the downstream area as shown in fig 6 the procrustes test validated target args being significantly structured with potential pathogenic bacteria profiles across downstream samples m2 0 75 r 0 49 p 0 03 permutations 999 whereas similar structural associations were observed in none of separated single rivers procrustes test p 0 05 this may suggest that the mixture of contaminated water facilitates the occurrences of the amr knapp et al 2010 wu et al 2018b the following vpa specifies that 49 of the variation of args in downstream samples was caused by the changes in bacterial community composition table s4 to which the phylum of bacteroidetes one of the dominant bacteria mostly contributed bioenv r 0 22 table s5 in addition previous studies noted that identical bacteria args forsberg et al 2014 pehrsson et al 2016 and inner bacterial community associations li et al 2017 yao et al 2014 were often found in comparable sources samples as shown in table 1 the varying trends of nitrogen carbon and phosphorus parameters were not analogous across three rivers anosim r 0 p 0 001 but the differences in these factors between the dp and hp rivers were larger than those between the dp and sz rivers anosim r 0 45 vs 0 23 p 0 001 accordingly our network analysis showed that the grouped args in different rivers belonged to distinct arg subtypes fig 4 additionaly bacteroides being the dominant subtaxon genus of bacteroidetes fig s2 which mostly contributed to the variations of bacterial community table s5 exhibited contrasting correlation positive vs negative patterns with the bacterial community between the urban and agricultural river samples fig 4 overall the combined effects of environmental conditions and the bacterial community on the distribution of args were detected within the whole river network vpa 1 table s3 and the effects became more influential in downstream areas vpa 52 table s4 4 3 cooccurrence of intl1 and target args in different sites the spread of args is usually facilitated by the prevalence of mges wu et al 2018a yu et al 2016 particularly of integrons chen et al 2010 ma et al 2017 here we found that intl1 may play an important role in the variation of args from the perspective of its cooccurring pattern with target args fig 5 fig 5 shows poor correlations between intl1 and target args in the upstream of the sz and dp rivers this might imply that the integration of args via integrons could less likely occur from upstream to input sections probably due to the lack of selective agents such as antibiotics chen et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 and heavy metals li et al 2017 in the comparatively pristine upstream environments martinez 2008 however the linear correlation between args and intl1 became significant in the downstream site dp 2 pearson r 0 79 p 0 01 fig 5 which is statistically the same as their relationship in site nj pearson r 0 84 p 0 001 with 95 confidence levels amos et al 2015 you et al 2018 this detected similarity between the sites nj and dp 2 args vs intl1 fig 5 probably suggests that compared to other pollution input sources the wwtp site dp 1 vs dp 2 table 1 promoted the intl1 induced enrichment of args in the downstream water of all rivers in shanghai site nj fig 1 moreover this process seemed unaffected by the flows from the sz pearson p 0 05 and hp rivers pearson r 0 49 p 0 05 whose downstream samples intl1 arg relationship did not fit the same regression as that of site nj fig 5 4 4 implications for water quality amelioration and arg control according to the shanghai environmental protection bureau sepb 2018 the hp river s water quality was classified in the ⅲ category site xp and its upper stream table 1 while those of the sz and dp rivers fell in the ⅴ and ⅳ categories more polluted respectively in our study the total contents of target args 0 2 0 9 log10 copies 16s rdna fig 2 were significantly lower in the hp river kw test χ2 35 1 p 0 001 it appeared that the higher water quality was linked to the lower abundance of args as shown in table s4 the variations of compositions of args were partially related to the environmental conditions however we did not find any significant positive correlations between target arg subtypes and physiochemical properties of the sampled river water spearman p 0 05 table s6 in addition although river water quality has been improved in the last a few years mee 2015 sun et al 2016 the abundance of detected args became 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than 5 years ago in the hp river jiang et al 2013 such as with bla tem 103 vs 104 5 and sul1 105 vs 107 8 this implies that the amelioration of water quality might not necessarily reduce args in the river networks rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the occurrences of args that are affected by selective pressures martinez 2008 wright 2007 the hgt fig 5 and bacterial proliferation fig 6 cannot be simply explained by river water quality which is merely evaluated based on the conventional physiochemical parameters xu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 hence for future amr risk control a holistic assessment system containing microbial activity is needed tan et al 2015 5 conclusions our parallel studies characterized the distributional patterns of args in three main rivers of shanghai city and clearly showed that the inputs of urban and agricultural wastewater were all associated with the variations of args in the downstream river water however the driving factors of the distribution and variation of args differed by river section and pollution type and the following conclusions can be drawn 1 discharge of combined sewage provided most args that could affect or be used to form distributional patterns of target args in the downstream river water 2 bacterial structure was closely associated with args in the river network and pathogenic bacteria and args may become significantly correlated in the downstream sections due to the variations of the whole bacterial community 3 the intl1 induced enrichment of args in the river network s confluence was most closely related to the flows from the wwtp influenced river 4 the improvement of water quality is not directly linked to the reduction in the abundance of args but it partially affected their distributions and compositions contributors the study was conceived by x h x b and d w all authors contributed to the data collection x c and x h provided args and

18804,the widespread of water borne antibiotic resistance genes args represents a growing threat to the health of millions of people our study detected the relative abundances of 10 arg subtypes in the shanghai river network where the major arg components were strb sul1 and ermb these args were significantly enriched by the combined sewage tail water from urban wastewater treatment plant and runoff from agricultural areas which reached the suzhou sz dianpu dp and huangpu hp river respectively one way anova p 0 01 the target args were distributed in varying patterns across different rivers bla ctx m and bla tem contributed to the increase of total args in the rivers influenced by urban sources particularly in the sz river whose distribution of args was significantly related to that of the confluence of the whole river network mantel test p 0 01 the bacterial community was closely structured with args and potential pathogenic bacteria s association with target args became

relationship fitted the same regression model as that of the network confluence r 0 84 p 0 001 the amelioration of river water quality does not reduce args but may affect their distributional patterns in the river network in shanghai graphical abstract image 1 keywords water environment antibiotics resistance genes bacterial community pollution sources shanghai river network 1 introduction globally the development of a city is often associated with the spread of antimicrobial resistance amr due to the increasing input of anthropogenic waste pruden et al 2013 wellington et al 2013 such as domestic wastewater guo et al 2017 municipal solid waste graham et al 2011 and husbandry waste wang et al 2017 shanghai is the core city of the yangtze delta estuary which harbors the most populous urban agglomeration in the world and the most antibiotic contaminated river basin in china zhang et al 2015 its intensive industrial activities and accelerating urbanization are reportedly linked to the increasing occurrences of antibiotic resistance genes args in the estuary environment zhu et al 2017 recent metagenomic analyses showed that pathogens in human environments shared almost the same resistome with the ones in nature pehrsson et al 2016 primarily because args could readily transfer across bacterial species via horizontal gene transfer hgt the detected high abundance of mobile genetic elements mges in the major tributary rivers of the yangtze delta estuary demonstrate the high hgt potentials of args jiang et al 2013 which jeopardizes the health of 20 million people living in the same watershed similar to other metropolises in developing countries shanghai faces preeminent challenges from water and wastewater management including the combined sewer point source pollution in the old downtown area walsh et al 2011 the discharge of tail water from urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp gao et al 2015 and the agricultural area source pollution in semirural suburbs ji et al 2012 in 2015 china issued a national action plan for the prevention and control of water pollution which requires the shanghai municipality to reduce the percentage of black and odorous water bodies in the whole river network to 10 by 2020 mee 2015 although this strict administrative action may effectively improve river water quality in the downtown areas its effects on the removal of args remains largely unknown however to date few studies have focused on the characterization of args across different pollution sources in this estuary or compared their impacts on the distribution of amr related genes along main rivers in shanghai city this is a major omission in that different from other water bodies rivers linked to the yangtze delta estuary can hold contaminants for a relatively long time due to the effects of tidal currents zheng et al 2016 and the extended residence period has been proved to facilitate the enrichment of args wu et al 2018b to address these knowledge gaps our study selected shanghai river network s three major rivers each of which is associated with different anthropogenic pollution sources we detected args that are commonly of concern in the environment and their parallel antibiotics including sulfonamides sas tetracyclines tcs macrolides mls aminoglycosides agy and beta lactams have been previously detected in the study area shi et al 2014 yan et al 2013 the bacterial community structures were also profiled these data were then analyzed with other arm determinants and water quality across all target rivers which allowed a holistic characterization of the spread of args from multiple sampling sections 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study area included 10 sites on the suzhou sz river dianpu dp river and huangpu hp river which primarily constitute the shanghai river network and converge at nenjiang quay the site nj fig 1 three sampling sections including the upstream wastewater input and downstream were selected to depict the args distributions along the river network fig 1 with respect to the sampling sites along the sz river which receives combined sewage in the old downtown the site sz 1 was located in the upstream of the combined sewage pump stations the sz 2 was located near the pump stations outfalls the wetland park wetpark was located in the downstream areas of sz river in the dp river the site dp 1 wwtp areas neighboring tail water outfalls and dp 2 were selected as the upstream input and downstream sampling sites respectively in parallel to the sampling of typical urban rivers a reservoir res was selected as the upstream sampling site of the hp river the site mh which was agriculturally influenced in the vicinity of feedlots and farm land was selected as the input sampling site the site xp which has been reclaimed into a riverside park was selected as the downstream sampling site fig 1 there were no industrial or agricultural wastewater outfalls from site mh to xp 2 2 samples collection and pretreatment the central goal of this study was to characterize the spatial pattern of arg contamination from upstream to downstream areas of the target river network and to further explain the impacts of different anthropogenic pollution on the variation of args across different rivers considering that pump stations functioned when there was a storm to avoid city waterlogging all water samples were collected monthly from april to june rainy season of shanghai in 2016 and 2017 surface water in the top 0 5 m of the river surface was collected in triplicates all collected samples 600 ml containers were returned to the laboratory on ice in the dark approximately 100 ml of samples were frozen at 20 c before physicochemical analyses and the remaining samples were stored at 4 c for vacuum filtration 0 22 μm membrane membranesolutions allpure shanghai within 12 h of sampling the membranes were stored at 40 c before the dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and target genes genomic dna of river water was extracted by using power soil dna extraction kits mobio usa and a ribolyzer fastpre 24 mp usa according to manufactures suggested protocols the yields and quality of dna extractions were verified by uv vis spectrophotometer merinton 4000 beijing the dna concentrations were calculated based on the od260 value and the absorption ratio of od260 280 in this study was between 1 8 and 2 0 the extracted dna samples were stored at 40 c prior to the polymerase chain reaction pcr assays prior to pcr tests the extracted dna samples were diluted 5 times at 5 ngdna μl to reduce interference to the reaction there were 11 genes targeted in this study which included 10 subtypes of args and 1 marker genes of mges specifically the args were comprised of sul1 and sul2 that encode resistance sulr to the sas luo et al 2010 ermb and mefa that encode resistance mlsr to the mls wu et al 2015 bla ctx m and bla tem that encode resistance blar to beta lactams ahammad et al 2014 and aada1 and strb that encode resistance agyr to the agy the target mge marker gene was intl1 which represents the integrons yu et al 2016 the primers and amplification process are detailed in the supplementary information si 1 2 4 real time quantitative pcr qpcr assays all qpcr assays were performed with biorad cfx96 touch biorad usa each reaction was in a 10 μl mixture system which contained 1 μl of template dna 0 5 μl of each primer 10 nm 3 μl of nuclease free ddh2o and 5 μl of sybr green mix tiangen beijing the 16s rrna gene 16s rdna was also quantified to normalize detected genes across samples with different bacterial abundances at a magnitude of 108 log10 copies ml water all reactions were run simultaneously with standards of known quantities serially diluted six times 1 10 to 1 106 and a non template control nuclease free ddh2o the standard calibration curves for all target genes yielded r2 0 99 with amplification efficiencies ranging from 0 95 to 1 10 in this study the non template control nuclease free ddh2o of 16s rdna was required to be no less than 30 circles before reaching the threshold value the primers and qpcr protocols are provided in the si

were merged and illustrated by the cytoscape 3 0 2 software 3 results 3 1 abundance and variations of target args in river water there were 10 subtypes of args quantified using qpcr in all samples notably strb 1 5 1 3 log10 copies 16s rdna sul1 0 4 0 7 log10 copies 16s rdna and ermb 1 5 1 6 log10 copies 16s rdna were consistently observed as the major 90 arg subtypes with respect to conferring the resistance of agyr sulr and mlsr across all sampling sites fig 2 by contrast there was no apparent predominance concerning the relative abundance between bla tem and bla ctx m 2 4 versus 2 2 log10 copies 16s rdna and between tetm and tetq approximately 2 5 log10 copies 16s rdna as shown in the fig 1 the whole river network was divided into three sections for sampling to compare args levels across sampling sections the relative abundances of target arg subtypes in each sample were summed to perform the statistical analysis the overall trend was less abundant args in the upper streams 0 41 0 7 vs 0 36 0 9 log10 copies 16s rdna kruskal wallis kw χ2 18 5 p 0 001 specifically dp 1 had the highest abundance of target args 0 24 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna fig 2 in the upstream section one way anova f 7 1 p 0 01 where the major arg components were the sulr genes 0 27 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna in the following input section fig 1 which included the sites sz 2 wwtp and mh the discharge of all types of wastewater significantly elevated the total level of arg by 2 3 orders of magnitude paired t test pt p 0 01 compared to the hp river agriculturally influenced the increase of args in the sz and dp rivers was more apparently attributed to the enrichment of blar subtypes whose relative abundance increased to 1 5 0 6 and 1 2 1 0 log10 copies 16s rdna in the site sz 2 and wwtp fig 2 respectively as rivers flowed to the downstream section fig 1 the total contents of the target arg decreased by half from site sz 2 to wetpark 0 43 0 2 log10 copies 16s rdna pt p 0 18 similarly the sum of the abundance of the target args decreased to 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna in the site dp 2 mann whitney u test mw w 108 p 0 05 in the dp river fig 2 by contrast in the hp river the relative abundance of target args in the site xp was statistically the same as that of site mh pt p 0 36 among all downstream samples water in the whole river network confluence site site nj had the most abundant args 1 5 1 3 log10 copies 16s rdna kw p 0 05 particularly obvious for blar 0 26 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna and tetr 0 35 0 7 log10 copies 16s rdna in addition fig 3 a shows that more unique arg clusters are apparent in the hp river except for the nj confluence samples compared to the sz and dp samples suggesting less homogenization of the distribution of args in the urban rivers 3 2 dynamics of the bacterial community from upstream to downstream as shown in fig 3b bacterial communities featured higher diversity in upstream samples than downstream samples 4 5 vs 7 0 of the shannon index and meanwhile their compositions at the phylum level were also observed with distinct shifts pca bartlett s test χ2 106 6 p 0 001 although these variations based on the bray curtis distance were significantly different across the three rivers anosim r 0 71 p 0 001 the compositions of sequenced bacteria seemed less different to each other among the downstream samples fig 3b overall the predominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for 70 total bacterial 16s rdna sequences in all samples fig s1 proteobacteria were the largest group in the urban wastewater influenced rivers 38 9 18 6 fig s1 they increased by 20 from upstream to downstream samples in the sz river kw test χ2 10 7 p 0 05 this increase in the phylum of proteobacteria generally resulted from the variations of α and β proteobacteria fig s2 however proteobacteria s abundance was kept at 35 across all samples in the dp river e g site dp 2 where the major class was β proteobacteria 20 abundance fig s2 actinobacteria the most abundant phylum in the agriculturally impacted hp river 33 7 16 6 fig s1 was primarily represented by actinobacteria 5 25 fig s2 its abundance was detected with no significant variations across different sampling sections kw test p 0 49 in the hp river the insignificant variations of actinobacteria s abundance were also observed along the sz and dp rivers one way anova p 0 05 fig s2 similarly the relative abundance of bacteroidetes stayed on average at 11 4 7 0 in the hp river with no significant differences across sampling sections kw test p 0 66 however interestingly in rivers influenced by urban sources bacteroidetes experienced a 10 decline from the upstream to input sections pt p 0 05 fig s1 most of which was contributed by bacteroidia fig s2 at the genus level the bacteria whose subtaxon species were commonly classified as pathogens were analyzed as shown in fig s3 the annotated potential pathogenic bacterial genera were composed of klebsiella tzouvelekis et al 2012 mycobacterium naas et al 2001 pseudomonas perron et al 2004 acinetobacter byrne bailey et al 2009 and bacteroides eitel et al 2013 in our target river network samples si 2 in the sz river pseudomonas was detected in the upstream sampling sites including the site sz 1 6 0 of total classified genera and sz 2 1 4 the abundance of mycobacterium in the urban sewer fallouts sampling site sz 2 was 2 1 in the wetpark samples acinetobacter emerged and was detected as the most abundant potential pathogenic genus 9 5 fig s3 as the dp river flowed from the site dp 1 to wwtp the dominant genus of bacteroides increased from 4 2 to 13 5 fig s3 in the downstream samples the genera of mycobacterium pseudomonas and clostridium were all detected which had an averaged abundance 0 5 the hp river had less abundant target bacterial genera than the urban rivers the mycobacterium and pseudomonas both increased from 0 1 to 0 5 from upstream to downstream during which the clostridium and vibrio decreased to 0 1 fig s3 3 3 network analysis of relationships between bacterial communities and args in different rivers this study used network analyses to delineate the relationships among dominant bacteria target arg subtypes and potential pathogens relative abundance at the genus level fig 4 overall three predominant phyla including proteobacteria all its 5 classes actinobacteria most were actinobacteria and bacteroidetes flavobacteriia established linkages with nearly all target arg subtypes except the sulr table s2 which were detected as the major args in the whole river network fig 2 notably the arg subtypes that were significantly related to bacteria genus were different across sampling rivers the networked args in the hp river were classified as the mlsr tetr and agyr subtypes whereas the blar subtypes were more closely integrated in the urban rivers network models fig 4 in terms of potential pathogenic bacterial genera they displayed closer associations with other bacteria in the urban rivers than in the agricultural river as shown in fig 4a bacteroides and mycobacterium in the sz river possessed 20 linkages with the other bacteria but they were not closely related to the target args p 0 05 the only possible pathogenic arg ermb carrier was classified under the genus of pseudomonas in the sz river r 0 80 p 0 01 fig 4a similarly in the dp river fig 4b there were no args directly related to potential pathogens p 0 05 which nevertheless were closely structured with the whole bacteria community and even the bacteria with low abundance including klebsiella and escherichia 0 1 fig s3 established significant correlations with other bacteria in positive ways however the model showed the bacterial community in the hp river being less tightly intercorrelated in the network fig 4c where only the genus of bacteroides exhibited 10 positive relationships with other bacteria in the whole sequenced community 3 4 variations of intl1 and physicochemical factors as shown in table 1 among the three sampling sections the relative abundance of the intergon marker gene intl1 was significantly lower in the upstream areas of rivers one way anova f 14 3 p 0 01 where the site sz 1 had the lowest content 1 87 0 9 log10 copies 16s rdna however the input of combined sewerage enriched the intl1 by 1 5 orders of magnitude to 0 19 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna in the site sz 2 the treated urban wastewater and agriculturally impacted water also elevated the level of intl1 at the sites wwtp and mh 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna table 1 it is noteworthy that intl1 s abundance was averaged 0 96 1 5 log10 copies 16s rdna at the river network s confluence nj the decrease from the site xp to the downstream site nj 0 5 log10 copies 16s rdna table 1 was probably caused by dilution of flows from the sites wetpark and dp 2 fig 1 whose intl1 s abundances were 1 40 1 2 and 0 96 1 5 log10 copies 16s rdna respectively in addition the varying pattern of intl1 s abundance is generally in accordance with the variation of target args across the hp river fig 2 which nevertheless was hardly observed in any other two rivers as shown in fig 5 the total abundance of target args in the hp river held significant correlations with intl1 in each sampling section in positive ways pearson r 0 60 p 0 01 in contrast the args and intl1 did not fit any significant linear regressions in the sz river s samples pearson kendal and spearman p 0 05 and no significant correlations between total target args and intl1 were detected in the dp river fig 5 except for at the site dp 2 river water sampled in the present study was generally neutral with ph values in the range of 6 8 7 5 table 1 their do values except for that of the wwtp samples 0 5 0 2 mg l were all above 3 mg l it appeared that higher do values usually cooccurred with higher nitrate nitrite contents in river water samples in addition nearly all samples tn and toc contents increased in the input section and then decreased in the downstream section particularly toc 10 0 3 8 mg l to 36 1 26 7 mg l the tp held a similar varying tendency to the tn with detected contents ranging from 0 15 to 2 0 mg l table 1 4 discussion the release of anthropogenic wastewater has long been known as a gateway of args to natural water environments such as freshwater lakes czekalski et al 2014 rivers amos et al 2014 estuaries zhu et al 2017 and sea water chen et al 2013 recent study suggests the relevance of agricultural sources and wwtps as reservoirs and environmental suppliers of genetic determinants of resistance whose dissemination to the human environment should be contained pruden et al 2013 by conducting comparative investigations we clearly showed that the combined sewage pump stations more greatly enriched target args fig 2 and intl1 table 1 in their effluent receiving river relative to the enrichment by wwtps and agricultural impacts this highlighted an increased amr risk in densely populated areas e g riverside parks and quay sites fig 1 where the human direct exposure rates are potentially high thus within the large context that china pledges to contain the spread of amr nhc 2016 it is becoming more critically important for future amr management of the urban water environment to know how the abundance and variation of args are related to different contamination sources which we reported for the first time in the major river network of the yangtze delta estuary 4 1 effects of different pollution sources in the river network as shown in fig 2 target args were significantly enriched in the water sampled from the input section kw χ2 18 6 p 0 001 which is in agreement with previous studies czekalski et al 2014 wu et al 2018b these args in the sz and dp rivers slightly decreased by 0 5 orders of magnitude from the input to their own downstream samples whereas they remained at the same level in the hp river fig 2 however compared to the upstream samples the whole river network s confluence water site nj fig 1 was characterized by significantly more abundant args in total 1 0 vs 1 5 log10 copies 16s rdna pt p 0 01 however notably the composition of profiled args was significantly different between the sites nj and xp anosim r 0 58 p 0 001 fig 3a it is interesting to note that site nj s args distributional pattern seems to be more closely correlated with that of site wetpark than with that of site xp mantel test r 0 66 vs 0 31 p 0 05 this suggests that the combined sewage could impose drastic impacts on the distribution of args in downstream river water and the impacts were more pronounced than the centralized municipal wwtp mantel test p 0 14 this is probably because raw wastewater usually contains relatively high levels of amr selective agents 1 μg l such as antibiotics and detergents abegglen et al 2009 meng et al 2013 and their effects could be preponderant over other factors in a complex environment mcnamara et al 2014 different types of pollution sources could also result in the variations of args bacteria relationships regarding the visualized positive correlations r 0 8 p 0 01 fig 4 more tensely networked blar subtypes in the urban rivers suggest the relevance of human use β lactam as a determinant of the occurrence of args or the potential selection of blar bacteria lamba et al 2017 maurya et al 2016 which were classified under the phylum of proteobacteria in our study table s2 by contrast in the hp river tetm and mefa were more closely related to the bacterial community which was also found in other sites with agricultural activities wang et al 2015 and firmicutes and actinobacteria were usually considered the gene carriers of tetr and mlsr su et al 2015 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 4 2 associations among args potential pathogenic bacteria and bacterial community conditions the target args and selected pathogenic bacterial genera were rarely correlated in the river network fig 4 but both of them exhibited high connectivity with the main bacterial community notably several predominant bacteria acted as the linking nodes that connected target args and postulated pathogenic bacterial genera fig 4 for example in the sz river the phylum of bacteroidetes was correlated with bla tem and bacteroides at the same time r 0 8 p 0 01 fig 4a in the hp river tetq and bacteroides were linked by actinobacteria r 0 8 p 0 01 fig 4c thus it is not surprising to find the significant correlations between the bacterial community and args mantel test r 0 21 p 0 01 and potential pathogenic bacteria mantel test r 0 71 p 0 001 interestingly these indirect linkages between target pathogenic genera and args whose variations were related to the bacterial community in the whole river network vpa 10 5 explained table s3 became statistically significant when rivers converged in the downstream area as shown in fig 6 the procrustes test validated target args being significantly structured with potential pathogenic bacteria profiles across downstream samples m2 0 75 r 0 49 p 0 03 permutations 999 whereas similar structural associations were observed in none of separated single rivers procrustes test p 0 05 this may suggest that the mixture of contaminated water facilitates the occurrences of the amr knapp et al 2010 wu et al 2018b the following vpa specifies that 49 of the variation of args in downstream samples was caused by the changes in bacterial community composition table s4 to which the phylum of bacteroidetes one of the dominant bacteria mostly contributed bioenv r 0 22 table s5 in addition previous studies noted that identical bacteria args forsberg et al 2014 pehrsson et al 2016 and inner bacterial community associations li et al 2017 yao et al 2014 were often found in comparable sources samples as shown in table 1 the varying trends of nitrogen carbon and phosphorus parameters were not analogous across three rivers anosim r 0 p 0 001 but the differences in these factors between the dp and hp rivers were larger than those between the dp and sz rivers anosim r 0 45 vs 0 23 p 0 001 accordingly our network analysis showed that the grouped args in different rivers belonged to distinct arg subtypes fig 4 additionaly bacteroides being the dominant subtaxon genus of bacteroidetes fig s2 which mostly contributed to the variations of bacterial community table s5 exhibited contrasting correlation positive vs negative patterns with the bacterial community between the urban and agricultural river samples fig 4 overall the combined effects of environmental conditions and the bacterial community on the distribution of args were detected within the whole river network vpa 1 table s3 and the effects became more influential in downstream areas vpa 52 table s4 4 3 cooccurrence of intl1 and target args in different sites the spread of args is usually facilitated by the prevalence of mges wu et al 2018a yu et al 2016 particularly of integrons chen et al 2010 ma et al 2017 here we found that intl1 may play an important role in the variation of args from the perspective of its cooccurring pattern with target args fig 5 fig 5 shows poor correlations between intl1 and target args in the upstream of the sz and dp rivers this might imply that the integration of args via integrons could less likely occur from upstream to input sections probably due to the lack of selective agents such as antibiotics chen et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 and heavy metals li et al 2017 in the comparatively pristine upstream environments martinez 2008 however the linear correlation between args and intl1 became significant in the downstream site dp 2 pearson r 0 79 p 0 01 fig 5 which is statistically the same as their relationship in site nj pearson r 0 84 p 0 001 with 95 confidence levels amos et al 2015 you et al 2018 this detected similarity between the sites nj and dp 2 args vs intl1 fig 5 probably suggests that compared to other pollution input sources the wwtp site dp 1 vs dp 2 table 1 promoted the intl1 induced enrichment of args in the downstream water of all rivers in shanghai site nj fig 1 moreover this process seemed unaffected by the flows from the sz pearson p 0 05 and hp rivers pearson r 0 49 p 0 05 whose downstream samples intl1 arg relationship did not fit the same regression as that of site nj fig 5 4 4 implications for water quality amelioration and arg control according to the shanghai environmental protection bureau sepb 2018 the hp river s water quality was classified in the ⅲ category site xp and its upper stream table 1 while those of the sz and dp rivers fell in the ⅴ and ⅳ categories more polluted respectively in our study the total contents of target args 0 2 0 9 log10 copies 16s rdna fig 2 were significantly lower in the hp river kw test χ2 35 1 p 0 001 it appeared that the higher water quality was linked to the lower abundance of args as shown in table s4 the variations of compositions of args were partially related to the environmental conditions however we did not find any significant positive correlations between target arg subtypes and physiochemical properties of the sampled river water spearman p 0 05 table s6 in addition although river water quality has been improved in the last a few years mee 2015 sun et al 2016 the abundance of detected args became 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than 5 years ago in the hp river jiang et al 2013 such as with bla tem 103 vs 104 5 and sul1 105 vs 107 8 this implies that the amelioration of water quality might not necessarily reduce args in the river networks rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the occurrences of args that are affected by selective pressures martinez 2008 wright 2007 the hgt fig 5 and bacterial proliferation fig 6 cannot be simply explained by river water quality which is merely evaluated based on the conventional physiochemical parameters xu et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 hence for future amr risk control a holistic assessment system containing microbial activity is needed tan et al 2015 5 conclusions our parallel studies characterized the distributional patterns of args in three main rivers of shanghai city and clearly showed that the inputs of urban and agricultural wastewater were all associated with the variations of args in the downstream river water however the driving factors of the distribution and variation of args differed by river section and pollution type and the following conclusions can be drawn 1 discharge of combined sewage provided most args that could affect or be used to form distributional patterns of target args in the downstream river water 2 bacterial structure was closely associated with args in the river network and pathogenic bacteria and args may become significantly correlated in the downstream sections due to the variations of the whole bacterial community 3 the intl1 induced enrichment of args in the river network s confluence was most closely related to the flows from the wwtp influenced river 4 the improvement of water quality is not directly linked to the reduction in the abundance of args but it partially affected their distributions and compositions contributors the study was conceived by x h x b and d w all authors contributed to the data collection x c and x h provided args and
