usually bimodal with a short rainy season vuli from november to january with 200 380 mm of precipitation and a long rainy season masika from february or early march to late may with 400 800 mm precipitation during 2014 15 and 2015 16 rainfall was erratic see tables 1 and 2 in saidia et al 2019 soils in ilakala and changarawe are categorized as haplic acrisols and mollic fluvisols based on the tanzania land evaluation tool developed by trans sec 2017 according to soil survey staff 2014 and landon 1991 the physical and chemical analysis of soils at the study sites table 1 indicate that

management in all experiments maize tmv1 medium maturing 110 days and open pollinated lyimo et al 2014 and pigeon pea babati white a long maturing variety that takes about nine months to mature saxena et al 2010 were planted sowing was done on january 21 22 2015 in ilakala with replanting on march 23 24 2015 the changarawe site was sown on march 07 2015 and replanted on march 20 2015 due to drought in 2016 both sites were sown january 16 23 the decision on sowing dates was based on farmers experience advice from the tanzania meteorological agent tma and advice from researchers at the tanzania agriculture research institute tari ilonga both varieties are commonly used in the area kanyeka et al 2007 myaka et al 2006 fertilizers used were di ammonium phosphate dap nh4 2hpo4 a granulated solid fertilizer 18 n and 46 p2o5 and urea 46 n in each village an experiment was laid out in split split plot design with five replications as described by montgomery 2013 the main plot comprised three moisture management options 1 tied ridges 2 open ridges and 3 flat cultivation the sub plot factor composed of three cropping options 1 maize sole crop 2 pigeon pea sole crop and 3 1 1 additive inter cropping of maize with pigeon pea as described by natarajan 1990 the sub sub plot factor comprised three crop specific fertilizer application rates 1 control 0 kg p and 0 kg n ha 2 micro dosing rate 10 kg p and 20 kg n ha in maize 10 kg p and 9 kg n ha in pigeon pea and 3 recommended rates of 40 kg p ha and 80 kg n ha for maize marandu et al 2014 and 20 kg p ha kuma rao et al 1995 and18 kg n ha for pigeon pea orientation of plots and treatments on the gently to moderately sloping field was arranged based on montgomery 2013 replications were oriented along a slope with replication one starting at the upper part of the field plots were oriented across the slope ridges were constructed across the slope in order to reduce runoff and harvest rainwater in the field ridges were 75 cm apart with 20 cm height while the distance between ties was 150 cm and 15 cm high as recommended by edje and ossom 2010 plot sizes were 5 m x 4 m resulting in 20m2 maize seeds on ridges were sown on the fore side and pigeon pea on the back side of the ridges because maize need more moisture than pigeon pea which is drought tolerant additionally the purpose of these ridges was rain water harvesting and soil moisture conservation in the field the germination test for both maize and pigeon pea was 97 99 two seeds were sown in holes at a spacing of 75 cm x 30 cm for maize and 75 cm x 50 cm for pigeon pea in both sole and inter cropping thinning was done three weeks after sowing resulting in one plant per hill di ammonium phosphate dap was applied at planting by placing fertilizer in holes 5 cm away from seed hole 5 7 cm deep and covering fertilizer by soil on both maize and pigeon pea crops however in intercropping fertilizer application was done only for maize plants with the assumption that the associate crop would benefit from the main crop urea was applied to maize during the fourth leaf vegetative stage v4 by placing fertilizer in a hole 5 cm deep close to a plant camara et al 2013 kanyeka et al 2007 other nutrients were not applied but weeding and insecticide application were done as recommended kanyeka et al 2007 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil moisture soil moisture content was determined using a delta t device moisture meter type hh2 a frequency domain reflectometry fdr with sm300 moisture sensor that measures volumetric soil moisture content by responding to changes in the apparent dielectric constant of moist soil anchit et al 2016 volumetric soil moisture content as the ratio between the volume of water present and the total volume of the sample is expressed in percentage vol as described by delta t devices ltd 2013 the sampling hole was dug at a center of each plot in all treatments and for ridges the hole was dug at a bottom measurements were taken from a hole dug by hand hoe at a soil depth of 35 cm where a pair of metal rings from a sensor was inserted directly at 5 cm 15 cm and 30 cm depths down the soil respectively four sides in each depth were marked and the pair of metal rings was inserted three times in each side with moisture content averaged per depth to determine duration of soil moisture conservation in each inter row rainwater harvesting practice soil moisture content was measured 0 5 2 and 10 days after rainfall for three consecutive events 2 3 2 yields of maize and pigeon pea crops were harvested at harvest maturity from a harvest area of 3 m2 four rows in flat cultivation and four ridges in open and tied ridges were harvested about 12 to 13 maize plants were cut 5 cm above the ground from each 3 m2 sampling area cobs were dehusked and shelled grains collected were oven dried untill 12 5 grain moisture content was achieved using the grain moisture meter cimmyt 2013 procedures for harvesting pigeon pea were based on icrisat 1992 with 8 or 9 plants harvested from each 3 m2 sampling area plot grains collected from pods were oven dried at 80 c to 10 grain moisture content grain weight was measured using the advanced electronic balance endel k 3000bh and converted into hectare basis t ha 1 for maize and pigeon pea in both sole and inter cropping plots 2 4 data analysis data collected were subjected to shapiro wilk test for normality w test statistic using genstat 17 version most of variables were between 0 8 and 1 0 indicating normal distribution then analysis of

test compares soil moisture content between tied ridges and flat cultivation with the hypothesis that the means of flat cultivations were equal to tied ridges land equivalent ratio ler is the relative land area under sole crops that is required to produce the yields achieved by inter cropping it is an index of biological advantage used to compare the effectiveness of the inter cropping system used in the study as proposed by federer 1993 where yields from intercrop and sole crop of each crop were used as follows 3 l e r x i x s y i y s where x and y are the component crops namely maize and pigeon pea in the sole s and intercrop i 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics soil moisture content at different soil depths varied with duration after rainfall across rainwater harvesting rwh practices fig 2 flat cultivation open ridges and tied ridges at 5 cm soil depth had no significant differences p 0 05 in moisture conservation at 12 h after rainfall soil moisture content decreased with soil depth after 12 h and two days after rainfall from flat cultivation while in open and tied ridge plots moisture increased from 5 cm depth down the soil two days after rainfall open and tied ridges had highest soil moisture content at 15 cm depth ten days after rainfall soil moisture content increased with soil depths from 5 cm to 30 cm in all rwh practices fig 2 when t test was done at 30 cm soil depth tied ridges had significantly higher p 0 001 soil moisture content this increased by 24 77 more than flat cultivation 10 days after rainfall 3 2 effects of inter row rainwater harvesting practices and fertilizer use on yield inter row rainwater harvesting increases maize yields significantly p 0 001 and 0 004 at ilakala in 2016 and changarawe in 2015 only table 2 yields increased from flat cultivation to tied ridges except at ilakala in 2015 where maize yields decreased toward tied ridges maize sole cropping had significantly higher grain yields than inter cropping system p 0 001 at ilakala in 2016 and changarawe in 2015 and 2016 application of fertilizer increased maize yields significantly p 0 001 at ilakala in 2015 2016 and changarawe in 2015 2016 yields increased with increasing application rate from none to micro dosing and recommended fertilizer table 2 maize yields increased significantly p 0 001 and 0 004 under the combined effects of inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer interaction effects between inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer use at micro dosing and recommended rates had higher maize yields than fertilizer use and rainwater harvesting alone the combination of tied ridges and fertilizer application at recommended rates had the highest maize yield at both study sites in 2015 and 2016 the yield difference between fertilizer use alone and its combination with tied ridges was higher by 0 37 t ha ilakala 2015 0 24 t ha ilakala 2016 0 33 t ha changarawe 2015 and 0 32 t ha changarawe 2016 table 2 rainwater harvest had significant effect on pigeon pea yield p 0 009 at ilakala during 2015 only table 3 on average flat cultivation had higher grain yields than ridging cultivation pigeon pea sole cropping had significantly higher yields p 0 001 than inter cropping at ilakala in 2015 on average sole cropping had higher yields than inter cropping however the yield difference is very small 2 5 fertilizer application increased pigeon pea yields significantly p 0 005 at changarawe in 2015 however yields decreased significantly p 0 04 with fertilizer application in 2015 at ilakala table 3 interaction of inter row rainwater harvesting cropping systems and fertilizer use 3 3 3 on grain yields were significant p 0 05 see table 3 in saidia et al 2019 and fig 3 fertilizer application increased grain yields in sole maize from control 1 t ha 1 to recommended rates 2 5 3 t ha 1 in 2015 with a significant increase to 3 8 t ha 1 in 2016 the trend of sole pigeon pea yield was inconsistency with fertilizer use and soil moisture management practice however fertilizer application in flat cultivation increased pigeon pea yields in 2015 at changarawe inter cropping maize and pigeon pea had overall higher yields than sole cropping plots with yields increasing with fertilizer application the intercropping system between maize and pigeon pea was affected by cropping season and locations fig 3 flat cultivation and fertilizer micro dosing and recommended rates had the highest grain yields of 4 5 t ha 1 fig 3 3 3 land use efficiency of cropping systems under rainwater harvesting rwh practices and fertilizer use land equivalent ratio ler is used to describe land use efficiency in maize and pigeon pea cropping systems as shown in table 4 the ler values range from 1 36 to 2 68 at ilakala and from 1 40 to 2 79 at changarawe for rwh tied ridge plots have higher land use efficiency 0 36 0 91 under intercropping than sole crop while flat cultivation plots have 0 99 1 79 higher land use than sole crop fertilizer micro dosing and recommended rates had the highest ler 2 29 2 73 except at ilakala in 2015 tied ridges with recommended fertilizer application had highest ler 2 62 at changarawe in 2016 open ridges with micro dose fertilizer application resulted in the highest ler of 3 53 in 2016 at ilakala flat cultivation combined with fertilizer application had the highest ler of 2 58 from recommended rates at ilakala and 3 61 from micro dosing rates at changarawe in 2015 4 discussion 4 1 site characteristics and effects of rainwater harvesting and fertilizer on yield variations in rainfall amount and distribution between ilakala and changarawe during the seasons are due to their distance from each other and other differences in geographical locations the ilakala site is hilly surrounded by mountains and characterized by high vegetation cover including forests in contrast changarawe is undulating and has a moderate vegetation cover during the study there was a strong difference in rainfall pattern between the two cropping seasons especially with regard to the onset of rain and erratic rainfall fig 1 but their patterns were typical mary and majule 2009 germer et al 2011 this inter and intra seasonal variation of rainfall is increasingly influenced by climate change kijazi et al 2012 different geographical characteristics and rainfall variation between cropping seasons influenced maize and pigeon pea yields see table 4 in saidia et al 2019 tied ridges had higher maize grain yields than flat cultivation due to reduced runoff and increased soil moisture conservation fig 2 in moderate slopping landscape 9 15 equation 1 however in extreme moisture stress conditions maize growth may be poorer contrary to what is expected under inter row rainwater harvesting for instance changarawe had a low amount of rainfall 358 mm characterized by flooding in march and prolonged dry spells in april and may 2015 this condition confines runoff in ridges and increases surface evapo transpiration which probably affected yields negatively as reported by karuma et al 2016 in general maize yields was increase from flat cultivation to tied ridges because the crop grows well under moderate soil moisture conditions hence it is susceptible to moisture stress awosanmi et al 2017 in contrast to maize pigeon pea yields were better in flat cultivation than tied ridges because it is more sensitive to excess water pigeon pea is well adapted to drought due to its deep tap root system that reaches up to two meters as well as its osmotic adjustment in leaves emefiene et al 2013 thus pigeon pea has an inherent advantage due to its increased tolerance to drought under current climate changes augustino et al 2012 significant increase in yields from micro dosing and recommended rates indicate the importance of applying fertilizer under low soil nitrogen and phosphorus saidia et al 2018 masunga and kazumba 2017 amuri et al 2013 however further increases in yields were due to interaction effects of inter row rainwater harvesting using ridges and fertilizer application under the current changes of rainfall distribution therefore the combination of inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer use would reduce gap between actual and potential yields by 40 in a bad year and 53 in a good year for tropical maize with 7 5 t ha potential yield van ittersum et al 2016 inter cropping maize and pigeon pea had higher substantial yields than sole crops due to complementary and facilitative effects between these crops kimaro et al 2009 pigeon pea benefits from managements aimed at maize while maize simultaneously benefits from soil fertility improvement due to biological nitrogen fixation and incorporation of green manure from pigeon pea crop further different growth habits below and above the ground which reduced inter specific competition for resources could substantially increase yields compared to sole crop yields this diversification of maize and pigeon pea crops is advantageous for the food nutritional and income security of small scale farmers karuma et al 2016 4 2 land utilization in cropping systems land equivalent ratios ler higher than 1 0 indicate that the maize pigeon pea inter cropping system is more efficient with respect to land utilization than sole cropping federer 1993 on average ler in this study are within the range of 1 66 2 79 recorded by dania et al 2014 in nigeria however some extreme land equivalent ratios were due to water harvesting practices and fertilizer use that was site and seasonal dependent prolonged dry spells of more than two weeks negatively affected yields and resulted in low ler of tied ridges compared with flat cultivation however during 2016 ridges both improved crop growth and had higher ler than flat cultivation due to soil moisture conservation under short term dry spells of a week and not more than two weeks differences in crop growth above and below architecture of maize and pigeon pea reduced inter specific competition and enhanced resource use efficiency this is complementary facilitative interaction effects that increase ler under maize and pigeon pea intercropping kimaro et al 2009 pigeon pea has a tap root system that can penetrate up to 2 m deep extracting more water and nutrients from both top and deep soil layers than maize which is shallow rooted further pigeon pea babati white variety grows slowly during its first two months ultimately flowering 6 7 months after sowing while maize growth is faster reaching tasselling two months after sowing the addition of 10 and 20 kg p ha in form of dap at planting increases ler indicating the importance of applying n as starter dose and p for root development and enhanced nitrogen fixation in low soil n and p rao et al 1987 also report a similar trend for ler under flat cultivation in sorghum and pigeon pea intercrops when nitrogen and phosphorus are applied therefore maize and pigeon pea inter cropping under inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer use would reduce land use conflict between farmers and pastoralists in africa as reported by cabot 2017 roseline and amusain 2017 and walwa 2017 5 conclussion and recommendations tied ridges conserved more soil moisture than flat cultivation over ten days dry spell fertilizer application increases maize yields significantly under low soil nitrogen and phosphorus conditions when combined with inter row rainwater harvesting tied ridging is the best strategy in sub humid tropical areas where water stress from drought is increasingly common the main rain season is experiencing shortage of rainfall especially for cereal crops like maize which are sensitive to dry spells even short term ones lasting a week adoption of micro dosing at a rate of 10 kg p ha to promote land productivity under maize pigeon pea intercrops is encouraged as an entry point for small scale farmers the strategy of inter cropping under inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer micro dosing is encouraged to increase the food and income security of smallholder farms in sub humid tropical conditions inter cropping maize and pigeon pea is suitable in both ridged and flat cultivation as long as fertilizers are properly applied declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

management in all experiments maize tmv1 medium maturing 110 days and open pollinated lyimo et al 2014 and pigeon pea babati white a long maturing variety that takes about nine months to mature saxena et al 2010 were planted sowing was done on january 21 22 2015 in ilakala with replanting on march 23 24 2015 the changarawe site was sown on march 07 2015 and replanted on march 20 2015 due to drought in 2016 both sites were sown january 16 23 the decision on sowing dates was based on farmers experience advice from the tanzania meteorological agent tma and advice from researchers at the tanzania agriculture research institute tari ilonga both varieties are commonly used in the area kanyeka et al 2007 myaka et al 2006 fertilizers used were di ammonium phosphate dap nh4 2hpo4 a granulated solid fertilizer 18 n and 46 p2o5 and urea 46 n in each village an experiment was laid out in split split plot design with five replications as described by montgomery 2013 the main plot comprised three moisture management options 1 tied ridges 2 open ridges and 3 flat cultivation the sub plot factor composed of three cropping options 1 maize sole crop 2 pigeon pea sole crop and 3 1 1 additive inter cropping of maize with pigeon pea as described by natarajan 1990 the sub sub plot factor comprised three crop specific fertilizer application rates 1 control 0 kg p and 0 kg n ha 2 micro dosing rate 10 kg p and 20 kg n ha in maize 10 kg p and 9 kg n ha in pigeon pea and 3 recommended rates of 40 kg p ha and 80 kg n ha for maize marandu et al 2014 and 20 kg p ha kuma rao et al 1995 and18 kg n ha for pigeon pea orientation of plots and treatments on the gently to moderately sloping field was arranged based on montgomery 2013 replications were oriented along a slope with replication one starting at the upper part of the field plots were oriented across the slope ridges were constructed across the slope in order to reduce runoff and harvest rainwater in the field ridges were 75 cm apart with 20 cm height while the distance between ties was 150 cm and 15 cm high as recommended by edje and ossom 2010 plot sizes were 5 m x 4 m resulting in 20m2 maize seeds on ridges were sown on the fore side and pigeon pea on the back side of the ridges because maize need more moisture than pigeon pea which is drought tolerant additionally the purpose of these ridges was rain water harvesting and soil moisture conservation in the field the germination test for both maize and pigeon pea was 97 99 two seeds were sown in holes at a spacing of 75 cm x 30 cm for maize and 75 cm x 50 cm for pigeon pea in both sole and inter cropping thinning was done three weeks after sowing resulting in one plant per hill di ammonium phosphate dap was applied at planting by placing fertilizer in holes 5 cm away from seed hole 5 7 cm deep and covering fertilizer by soil on both maize and pigeon pea crops however in intercropping fertilizer application was done only for maize plants with the assumption that the associate crop would benefit from the main crop urea was applied to maize during the fourth leaf vegetative stage v4 by placing fertilizer in a hole 5 cm deep close to a plant camara et al 2013 kanyeka et al 2007 other nutrients were not applied but weeding and insecticide application were done as recommended kanyeka et al 2007 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 soil moisture soil moisture content was determined using a delta t device moisture meter type hh2 a frequency domain reflectometry fdr with sm300 moisture sensor that measures volumetric soil moisture content by responding to changes in the apparent dielectric constant of moist soil anchit et al 2016 volumetric soil moisture content as the ratio between the volume of water present and the total volume of the sample is expressed in percentage vol as described by delta t devices ltd 2013 the sampling hole was dug at a center of each plot in all treatments and for ridges the hole was dug at a bottom measurements were taken from a hole dug by hand hoe at a soil depth of 35 cm where a pair of metal rings from a sensor was inserted directly at 5 cm 15 cm and 30 cm depths down the soil respectively four sides in each depth were marked and the pair of metal rings was inserted three times in each side with moisture content averaged per depth to determine duration of soil moisture conservation in each inter row rainwater harvesting practice soil moisture content was measured 0 5 2 and 10 days after rainfall for three consecutive events 2 3 2 yields of maize and pigeon pea crops were harvested at harvest maturity from a harvest area of 3 m2 four rows in flat cultivation and four ridges in open and tied ridges were harvested about 12 to 13 maize plants were cut 5 cm above the ground from each 3 m2 sampling area cobs were dehusked and shelled grains collected were oven dried untill 12 5 grain moisture content was achieved using the grain moisture meter cimmyt 2013 procedures for harvesting pigeon pea were based on icrisat 1992 with 8 or 9 plants harvested from each 3 m2 sampling area plot grains collected from pods were oven dried at 80 c to 10 grain moisture content grain weight was measured using the advanced electronic balance endel k 3000bh and converted into hectare basis t ha 1 for maize and pigeon pea in both sole and inter cropping plots 2 4 data analysis data

land area under sole crops that is required to produce the yields achieved by inter cropping it is an index of biological advantage used to compare the effectiveness of the inter cropping system used in the study as proposed by federer 1993 where yields from intercrop and sole crop of each crop were used as follows 3 l e r x i x s y i y s where x and y are the component crops namely maize and pigeon pea in the sole s and intercrop i 3 results 3 1 soil moisture dynamics soil moisture content at different soil depths varied with duration after rainfall across rainwater harvesting rwh practices fig 2 flat cultivation open ridges and tied ridges at 5 cm soil depth had no significant differences p 0 05 in moisture conservation at 12 h after rainfall soil moisture content decreased with soil depth after 12 h and two days after rainfall from flat cultivation while in open and tied ridge plots moisture increased from 5 cm depth down the soil two days after rainfall open and tied ridges had highest soil moisture content at 15 cm depth ten days after rainfall soil moisture content increased with soil depths from 5 cm to 30 cm in all rwh practices fig 2 when t test was done at 30 cm soil depth tied ridges had significantly higher p 0 001 soil moisture content this increased by 24 77 more than flat cultivation 10 days after rainfall 3 2 effects of inter row rainwater harvesting practices and fertilizer use on yield inter row rainwater harvesting increases maize yields significantly p 0 001 and 0 004 at ilakala in 2016 and changarawe in 2015 only table 2 yields increased from flat cultivation to tied ridges except at ilakala in 2015 where maize yields decreased toward tied ridges maize sole cropping had significantly higher grain yields than inter cropping system p 0 001 at ilakala in 2016 and changarawe in 2015 and 2016 application of fertilizer increased maize yields significantly p 0 001 at ilakala in 2015 2016 and changarawe in 2015 2016 yields increased with increasing application rate from none to micro dosing and recommended fertilizer table 2 maize yields increased significantly p 0 001 and 0 004 under the combined effects of inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer interaction effects between inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer use at micro dosing and recommended rates had higher maize yields than fertilizer use and rainwater harvesting alone the combination of tied ridges and fertilizer application at recommended rates had the highest maize yield at both study sites in 2015 and 2016 the yield difference between fertilizer use alone and its combination with tied ridges was higher by 0 37 t ha ilakala 2015 0 24 t ha ilakala 2016 0 33 t ha changarawe 2015 and 0 32 t ha changarawe 2016 table 2 rainwater harvest

significantly higher yields p 0 001 than inter cropping at ilakala in 2015 on average sole cropping had higher yields than inter cropping however the yield difference is very small 2 5 fertilizer application increased pigeon pea yields significantly p 0 005 at changarawe in 2015 however yields decreased significantly p 0 04 with fertilizer application in 2015 at ilakala table 3 interaction of inter row rainwater harvesting cropping systems and fertilizer use 3 3 3 on grain yields were significant p 0 05 see table 3 in saidia et al 2019 and fig 3 fertilizer application increased grain yields in sole maize from control 1 t ha 1 to recommended rates 2 5 3 t ha 1 in 2015 with a significant increase to 3 8 t ha 1 in 2016 the trend of sole pigeon pea yield was inconsistency with fertilizer use and soil moisture management practice however fertilizer application in flat cultivation increased pigeon pea yields in 2015 at changarawe inter cropping maize and pigeon pea had overall higher yields than sole cropping plots with yields increasing with fertilizer application the intercropping system between maize and pigeon pea was affected by cropping season and locations fig 3 flat cultivation and fertilizer micro dosing and recommended rates had the highest grain yields of 4 5 t ha 1 fig 3 3 3 land use efficiency of cropping systems under rainwater harvesting rwh practices and fertilizer use land equivalent ratio ler is used to describe land use efficiency in maize and pigeon pea cropping systems as shown in table 4 the ler values range from 1 36 to 2 68 at ilakala and from 1 40 to 2 79 at changarawe for rwh tied ridge plots have higher land use efficiency 0 36 0 91 under intercropping than sole crop while flat cultivation plots have 0 99 1 79 higher land use than sole crop fertilizer micro dosing and recommended rates had the highest ler 2 29 2 73 except at ilakala in 2015 tied ridges with recommended fertilizer application had highest ler 2 62 at changarawe in 2016 open ridges with micro dose fertilizer application resulted in the highest ler of 3 53 in 2016 at ilakala flat cultivation combined with fertilizer application had the highest ler of 2 58 from recommended rates at ilakala and 3 61 from micro dosing rates at changarawe in 2015 4 discussion 4 1 site characteristics and effects of rainwater harvesting and fertilizer on yield variations in rainfall amount and distribution between ilakala and changarawe during the seasons are due to their distance from each other and other differences in geographical locations the ilakala site is hilly surrounded by mountains and characterized by high vegetation cover including forests in contrast changarawe is undulating and has a moderate vegetation cover during the study there was a strong difference in rainfall pattern between the two cropping seasons especially with regard to the onset of rain and erratic rainfall fig 1 but their patterns were typical mary and majule 2009 germer et al 2011 this inter and intra seasonal variation of rainfall is increasingly influenced by climate change kijazi et al 2012 different geographical characteristics and rainfall variation between cropping seasons influenced maize and pigeon pea yields see table 4 in saidia et al 2019 tied ridges had higher maize grain yields than flat cultivation due to reduced runoff and increased soil moisture conservation fig 2 in moderate slopping landscape 9 15 equation 1 however in extreme moisture stress conditions maize growth may be poorer contrary to what is expected under inter row rainwater harvesting for instance changarawe had a low amount of rainfall 358 mm characterized by flooding in march and prolonged dry spells in april and may 2015 this condition confines runoff in ridges and increases surface evapo transpiration which probably affected yields negatively as reported by karuma et al 2016 in general maize yields was increase from flat cultivation to tied ridges because the crop grows well under moderate soil moisture conditions hence it is susceptible to moisture stress awosanmi et al 2017 in contrast to maize pigeon pea yields were better in flat cultivation than tied ridges because it is more sensitive to excess water pigeon pea is well adapted to drought due to its deep tap root system that reaches up to two meters as well as its osmotic adjustment in leaves emefiene et al 2013 thus pigeon pea has an inherent advantage due to its increased tolerance to drought under current climate changes augustino et al 2012 significant increase in yields from micro dosing and recommended rates indicate the importance of applying fertilizer under low soil nitrogen and phosphorus saidia et al 2018 masunga and kazumba 2017 amuri et al 2013 however further increases in yields were due to interaction effects of inter row rainwater harvesting using ridges and fertilizer application under the current changes of rainfall distribution therefore the combination of inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer use would reduce gap between actual and potential yields by 40 in a bad year and 53 in a good year for tropical maize with 7 5 t ha potential yield van ittersum et al 2016 inter cropping maize and pigeon pea had higher substantial yields than sole crops due to complementary and facilitative effects between these crops kimaro et al 2009 pigeon pea benefits from managements aimed at maize while maize simultaneously benefits from soil fertility improvement due to biological nitrogen fixation and incorporation of green manure from pigeon pea crop further different growth habits below and above the ground which reduced inter specific competition for resources could substantially increase yields compared to sole crop yields this diversification of maize and pigeon pea crops is advantageous for the food nutritional and income security of small scale farmers karuma et al 2016 4 2 land utilization in cropping systems land equivalent ratios ler higher than 1 0 indicate that the maize pigeon pea inter cropping system is more efficient with respect to land utilization than sole cropping federer 1993 on average ler in this study are within the range of 1 66 2 79 recorded by dania et al 2014 in nigeria however some extreme land equivalent ratios were due to water harvesting practices and fertilizer use that was site and seasonal dependent prolonged dry spells of more than two weeks negatively affected yields and resulted in low ler of tied ridges compared with flat cultivation however during 2016 ridges both improved crop growth and had higher ler than flat cultivation due to soil moisture conservation under short term dry spells of a week and not more than two weeks differences in crop growth above and below architecture of maize and pigeon pea reduced inter specific competition and enhanced resource use efficiency this is complementary facilitative interaction effects that increase ler under maize and pigeon pea intercropping kimaro et al 2009 pigeon pea has a tap root system that can penetrate up to 2 m deep extracting more water and nutrients from both top and deep soil layers than maize which is shallow rooted further pigeon pea babati white variety grows slowly during its first two months ultimately flowering 6 7 months after sowing while maize growth is faster reaching tasselling two months after sowing the addition of 10 and 20 kg p ha in form of dap at planting increases ler indicating the importance of applying n as starter dose and p for root development and enhanced nitrogen fixation in low soil n and p rao et al 1987 also report a similar trend for ler under flat cultivation in sorghum and pigeon pea intercrops when nitrogen and phosphorus are applied therefore maize and pigeon pea inter cropping under inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer use would reduce land use conflict between farmers and pastoralists in africa as reported by cabot 2017 roseline and amusain 2017 and walwa 2017 5 conclussion and recommendations tied ridges conserved more soil moisture than flat cultivation over ten days dry spell fertilizer application increases maize yields significantly under low soil nitrogen and phosphorus conditions when combined with inter row rainwater harvesting tied ridging is the best strategy in sub humid tropical areas where water stress from drought is increasingly common the main rain season is experiencing shortage of rainfall especially for cereal crops like maize which are sensitive to dry spells even short term ones lasting a week adoption of micro dosing at a rate of 10 kg p ha to promote land productivity under maize pigeon pea intercrops is encouraged as an entry point for small scale farmers the strategy of inter cropping under inter row rainwater harvesting and fertilizer micro dosing is encouraged to increase the food and income security of smallholder farms in sub humid tropical conditions inter cropping maize and pigeon pea is suitable in both ridged and flat cultivation as long as fertilizers are properly applied declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10936,new technologies are needed in order to improve water use efficiency and aid irrigation management to meet this challenge crop coefficient kc estimation models based on remotely sensed crop reflectance were developed using new public domain satellite imagery spectral modeling of kc is possible due to the high correlations between kc and the crop phenologic development and spectral reflectance in this study cotton evapotranspiration was measured in the field during two seasons using the eddy covariance method kc was estimated as the ratio between reference evapotranspiration and the measured cotton evapotranspiration in addition a time series of sentinel 2 imagery was processed to produce 21 vegetation indices based on the sensor s unique spectral bands empirical kc vegetation index models were derived and ranked according to their prediction error this was performed for each season separately and in addition cross validation between the seasons was performed in accordance with previous findings we found strong correlations between kc and indices that are based on the red and red edge bands mtci rep and s2rep in addition other spectral indices that are strongly correlated to kc were identified the merris terrestrial chlorophyll index mtci had the closest relation to kc r2 0 91 it was also demonstrated that the model developed for the first season can be successfully applied to the second season data to predict kc and vice versa with rmse 0 1 therefore this study cross validates the models for estimating cotton water consumption using satellite imagery that is available at no cost at a temporal resolution of five days and a spatial resolution of 10 20 m the confidence inspired by this validation sets the scene for near real time irrigation decision support systems keywords eddy covariance remote sensing irrigation evapotranspiration spectral modeling 1 introduction dwindling land resources and water shortage are expected to affect food supply significantly world water assessment programme wwap 2014 schmitz et al 2014 mayor et al 2016 consequently food security starts with adequate and sufficient water for agriculture and with efficient use of water in irrigation crop coeﬃcient kc based estimation of crop water consumption is one of the most commonly used methods for irrigation management allen et al 1998 this approach for estimating the crop evapotranspiration etc is based on the estimation of reference evapotranspiration from a hypothetical crop et0 such that etc kc x et0 while et0 is commonly derived using the penman monteith method or based on pan evaporation measurements kc is empirically determined in water consumption experiments for specific crops in specific environments to isolate the atmospheric evaporative demand from the plant reaction kc tables derived from such experiments are available for most crops and in most regions of the world allen et al 1998 however the use of standard kc tables often results in erroneous etc estimations because of deviations from standard growing practices extreme weather conditions pests crop diseases and other stress factors that inhibit regular crop development moreover standard kc tables that assume uniform field conditions cannot handle within field variations in etc in previous studies these issues were addressed by using vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery as surrogates of kc duchemin et al 2006 kamble et al 2013 since some vegetation indices closely follow the kc temporal trajectory linear regression models between satellite derived vegetation indices and kc can be used to create kc maps of the field for satellite images throughout the season these maps capture the actual crop development including the variability within the field thus enabling more accurate estimation of etc and even precision irrigation up until recently the application of this method was hindered by the lack of public domain imagery at a high revisit frequency with sufficient spatial resolution in a previous study rozenstein et al 2018 kc estimation models were developed for cotton based on sentinel 2 imagery that is available at a frequency of 5 days at 10 20 m spatial resolution this enabled for the ﬁrst time to estimate kc at a frequency high enough to support irrigation decisions and at a ﬁne spatial resolution that well captures within ﬁeld variability these results suggested that most vegetation indices that are based on sentinel 2 bands are suitable predictors for cotton kc moreover it was found that vegetation indices that are based on the red and red edge spectral bands performed better than indices developed for satellite sensors of previous generations e g landsat spot and modis that do not use these bands this progress in estimating cotton water consumption using satellite imagery that is available at no cost was a step forward towards the development of crop water requirements models following those results we extended the study for another season of measurements to test and validate the remote sensing based kc estimation models for cotton accordingly the specific objectives of this study were 1 to measure the actual daily etc empirically in a cotton field 2 to validate and assess the performance of the rozenstein et al 2018 models in a cotton field different from the one in which they had been developed 3 to combine the measurements from both seasons to improve the generality of the sentinel 2 based etc prediction models 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and local climate the measurements took place during the summer of 2017 in a commercial cotton field near negba in the shfela region in israel fig 1 this location is about 20 km away from tel nof where field measurements were conducted in the previous year rozenstein et al 2018 this field was chosen because it was relatively flat and large enough to contain most of the flux footprint measured by the eddy covariance system which is described in section 2 2 burba 2013 the field had a rectangle shape with a mean length of 770 m and mean width of 500 m the long dimension was oriented nearly north south see fig 1 right cotton cv pima was sown on march 27 2017 and drip fertigated throughout the season according to the israeli extension service recommendations since this is the best practice it is assumed that the field was not under stress at any point during the season the irrigation was stopped on august 24 2017 and the cotton was harvested on september 25 2017 field measurements of evapotranspiration were conducted between 25 july and 11 september 2017 the local summer climate is rainless according to data supplied by the israel meteorological service from the negba meteorological station about 2 5 km south west of the experiment location between 2015 and 2017 the annual average number of rainy days i e rainfall 1 mm was 59 with an annual average rainfall of 409 mm there was no significant rainfall during the summer months june through august total summer rainfall for 3 years only 4 7 mm between 2015 and 2017 the average annual and growing season average march september meteorological data were relative humidity 68 and 68 respectively relative humidity at 12 00 52 and 50 respectively mean daily air temperature 20 4 and 23 2 c respectively mean daily minimum air temperature 15 6 and 18 1 c respectively and corresponding mean daily maximum temperature 25 6 and 28 5 c respectively 2 2 agro meteorological measurements these measurements were conducted to determine et0 and etc from which the crop coefficient kc was calculated as etc et0 et0 was calculated based on meteorological data and etc was measured with an eddy covariance system the agro meteorology unit of the israel ministry of agriculture and rural development regularly estimates the reference evapotranspiration et0 at selected locations across israel in this study daily et0 was calculated according to the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 based on meteorological measurements of temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar irradiance at the negba meteorological station located about 2 5 km south west of the eddy flux tower this public domain data is available for download from http www meteo co il direct measurements of etc were performed by an eddy covariance system that measured latent le and sensible h heat fluxes in a manner similar to that described in rozenstein et al 2018 an eddy covariance ec system was installed on a tower at 3 7 m above the ground at a position that allowed a fetch of about 400 m for the prevailing northwesterly wind fig 1b the system consisted of a three axis ultrasonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific logan ut usa that measured the wind speed vector and sonic temperature and a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific logan ut usa that measured water vapor concentration to minimize wind distortion effects the csat3 anemometer head was oriented towards the approximate direction of the predominant wind raw signals from the ec system were sampled at 20 hz signals were recorded on a cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa and later processed by the eddypro software li cor lincoln ne usa to generate the flux data to assure sufficient data quality the lowest quality measurement points with a quality flag class of 2 mauder and foken 2004 were filtered out overall 9 23 of all measurements were either removed as a result of quality issues or missing due to or technical problems roughly half of those gaps 4 62 of the data points were gap filled by interpolation the eddypro software estimated the distance of the 90 flux footprint of each 30 min data point by using kljun s footprint model kljun et al 2004 the footprint data was later used to demark the area that contributed to the flux thus defining an analysis polygon fig 1b additional measurements facilitated energy balance closure analysis net radiation rn was measured with a net radiometer q 7 1 rebs seattle wa usa installed at 3 7 m height on the same pole of the ec system air temperature and relative humidity were measured by a sensor hmp45 campbell sci logan ut usa positioned at a height of 3 7 m within a ventilated radiation shield soil heat flux g was estimated as 10 of rn as suggested in fao 56 allen et al 1998 thirty minute averages of measured variables net radiation air temperature and relative humidity were also recorded on the cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa all the equipment was powered by car batteries that were charged during the day by solar panels 2 3 satellite measurements 2 3 1 pre processing a total of seven relatively cloud free sentinel 2a images acquired during the cotton growing season were analyzed in this study the images were downloaded as level 2a atmospherically corrected products from the sentinels scientific data hub and processed using sentinel application platform snap gascon and ramoino 2017 in order to perform the analysis only for pixels that contributed to the measured water vapor flux an analysis polygon was defined using a similar protocol to rozenstein et al 2018 in short the pixels selected for the analysis were within the 90 flux footprint of the eddy covariance measurements taken between 7 am and 6 pm cloud free throughout the imagery time series and contained within the field boundary the analysis polygon was produced by thresholding the half hourly flux point density histogram at 1 this final analysis polygon corresponds to 393 sentinel 2 pixels at 10 m2 each for all seven images 2 3 2 spectral indices we derived 21 vegetation indices from all of the cloud free images throughout the growing season linear regression models were developed between the field measured kc on the days of image acquisition and the corresponding spectral indices the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse values were calculated for every model the kc ndvi model developed in this study was compared to other similar models from the literature that were developed for cotton montgomery et al 2015 and with a general field crop model kamble et al 2013 in addition the field measured kc values and the estimates of kc ndvi models were compared with the recommended kc for cotton in this region that is provided by the israeli extension service cross validation of the models developed during the two sites tel nof rozenstein et al 2018 and negba this study was performed by testing the performance of the tel nof models when applied to negba imagery and the negba models when applied to tel nof imagery finally combined models based on both sites were derived and tested on the combined dataset from both sites 3 results the energy balance closure was used to assess the validity of the ec flux measurements wilson et al 2002 in this analysis half hourly values of consumed energy of latent and sensible heat le h were regressed against corresponding values of the available energy rn g where rn is net radiation and g is soil heat flux fig 2 the 0 84 regression slope of the le h against rn g and the relatively high r2 0 92 indicate a reasonable energy balance closure as is common in such flux measurements wilson et al 2002 and reliable flux measurements by the eddy covariance system albeit this closure was not as good as the energy balance closure in the previous campaign rozenstein et al 2018 which had a regression slope of 0 96 possible reasons for the energy balance closure difference between the two campaigns are 1 the use of a different vapor concentration sensor in the ec system 2 the quality checks of turbulent flux measurements as analyzed by eddypro were somewhat better in the previous rozenstein et al 2018 than in the current campaign 3 in the current campaign g was estimated as 10 of rn and wasn t actually measured as done in the previous campaign to account for the lack of energy balance closure in the estimation of etc the energy balance was forced to close using the bowen ratio approach twine et al 2000 this approach assumes that the ratio between sensible and latent heat flux the bowen ratio is correctly measured by the ec system however h and le should be individually adjusted to close the energy balance after adjusting both le and h the energy balance was perfectly closed with a slope equal to 1 as expected most of the regression models between each of the 21 vegetation indices and kc were found to perform well by rozenstein et al 2018 in the tel nof experiment but the models performance in negba were not as good table 1 the coefficient of determination is lower for most of the negba models and the rmse is higher by up to one order of magnitude therefore while in tel nof many of the indices were reasonable surrogates for kc in negba only a few of them performed well for example the ndvi model did not perform satisfactorily in negba r2 0 4581 rmse 0 1263 compared to tel nof r2 0 9491 rmse 0 0193 however when compared against other ndvi models kamble et al 2013 montgomery et al 2015 it gave a better prediction for kc still indices based on the red edge bands performed best mtci consistently ranks best while reip and s2rep that were found to perform well in tel nof worked well in negba too cross validations of the models show that some of the models developed for one site can be successfully applied at the other site to estimate kc those include the red edge based indices mtci reip s2rep along with others such as evi and tsavi the israeli extension service kc table values were usually higher than those measured and predicted for mid season and lower at the end of the season fig 3 4 discussion the results are in line with those of rozenstein et al 2018 and suggest that some vegetation indices that are based on sentinel 2 bands are suitable predictors for cotton kc and that those based on the red and red edge spectral bands mtci rep and s2rep are the best ones other indices i e evi and tsavi show acceptable performance at each site but not as good as red edge based mtci which demonstrated the best kc prediction ability of all the indices tested in this study this determination is based on the index performance in both site specific models and the combined model that is based on both sites the consistent performance of the models based on these indices and their successful application at two different sites suggests that in the future models for a certain crop and region can be calibrated at one representative plot and then applied in neighboring sites at a reasonable accuracy accordingly these results demonstrate the potential of developing kc prediction for field crops using sentinel 2 that would perform better compared to older public domain satellite sensors that did not cover the red edge region and did not provide as short a revisit time as the sentinel 2 pair of sensors i e landsat spot in addition the inferior performance of older ndvi based models for kc prediction when tested against our field measurements suggest that the generality of those older models is limited and that the new models should be further tested in more environments to solidify the confidence in their performance before irrigation recommendations can be based on their predictions since in this study the field measurements were carried out during the mid late stages of the growing season the models developed in this paper still require further testing and

10936,new technologies are needed in order to improve water use efficiency and aid irrigation management to meet this challenge crop coefficient kc estimation models based on remotely sensed crop reflectance were developed using new public domain satellite imagery spectral modeling of kc is possible due to the high correlations between kc and the crop phenologic development and spectral reflectance in this study cotton evapotranspiration was measured in the field during two seasons using the eddy covariance method kc was estimated as the ratio between reference evapotranspiration and the measured cotton evapotranspiration in addition a time series of sentinel 2 imagery was processed to produce 21 vegetation indices based on the sensor s unique spectral bands empirical kc vegetation index models were derived and ranked according to their prediction error this was performed for each season separately and in addition cross validation between the seasons was performed in accordance with previous findings we found strong correlations between kc and indices that are based on the red and red edge bands mtci rep and s2rep in addition other spectral indices that are strongly correlated to kc were identified the merris terrestrial chlorophyll index mtci had the closest relation to kc r2 0 91 it was also demonstrated that the model developed for the first season can be successfully applied to the second season data to predict kc and vice versa with rmse 0 1 therefore this study cross validates the models for estimating cotton water consumption using satellite imagery that is available at no cost at a temporal resolution of five days and a spatial resolution of 10 20 m the confidence inspired by this validation sets the scene for near real time irrigation decision support systems keywords eddy covariance remote sensing irrigation evapotranspiration spectral modeling 1 introduction dwindling land resources and water shortage are expected to affect food supply significantly world water assessment programme wwap 2014 schmitz et al 2014 mayor et al 2016 consequently food security starts with adequate and sufficient water for agriculture and with efficient use of water in irrigation crop coeﬃcient kc based estimation of crop water consumption is one of the most commonly used methods for irrigation management allen et al 1998 this approach for estimating the crop evapotranspiration etc is based on the estimation of reference evapotranspiration from a hypothetical crop et0 such that etc kc x et0 while et0 is commonly derived using the penman monteith method or based on pan evaporation measurements kc is empirically determined in water consumption experiments for specific crops in specific environments to isolate the atmospheric evaporative demand from the plant reaction kc tables derived from such experiments are available for most crops and in most regions of the world allen et al 1998 however the use of standard kc tables often results in erroneous etc estimations because of deviations from standard growing practices extreme weather conditions pests crop diseases and other stress factors that inhibit regular crop development moreover standard kc tables that assume uniform field conditions cannot handle within field variations in etc in previous studies these issues were addressed by using vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery as surrogates of kc duchemin et al 2006 kamble et al 2013 since some vegetation indices closely follow the kc temporal trajectory linear regression models between satellite derived vegetation indices and kc can be used to create kc maps of the field for satellite images throughout the season these maps capture the actual crop development including the variability within the field thus enabling more accurate estimation of etc and even precision irrigation up until recently the application of this method was hindered by the lack of public domain imagery at a high revisit frequency with sufficient spatial resolution in a previous study rozenstein et al 2018 kc estimation models were developed for cotton based on sentinel 2 imagery that is available at a frequency of 5 days at 10 20 m spatial resolution this enabled for the ﬁrst time to estimate kc at a frequency high enough to support irrigation decisions and at a ﬁne spatial resolution that well captures within ﬁeld variability these results suggested that most vegetation indices that are based on sentinel 2 bands are suitable predictors for cotton kc moreover it was found that vegetation indices that are based on the red and red edge spectral bands performed better than indices developed for satellite sensors of previous generations e g landsat spot and modis that do not use these bands this progress in estimating cotton water consumption using satellite imagery that is available at no cost was a step forward towards the development of crop water requirements models following those results we extended the study for another season of measurements to test and validate the remote sensing based kc estimation models for cotton accordingly the specific objectives of this study were 1 to measure the actual daily etc empirically in a cotton field 2 to validate and assess the performance of the rozenstein et al 2018 models in a cotton field different from the one in which they had been developed 3 to combine the measurements from both seasons to improve the generality of the sentinel 2 based etc prediction models 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and local climate the measurements took place during the summer of 2017 in a commercial cotton field near negba in the shfela region in israel fig 1 this location is about 20 km away from tel nof where field measurements were conducted in the previous year rozenstein et al 2018 this field was chosen because it was relatively flat and large enough to contain most of the flux footprint measured by the eddy covariance system which is described in section 2 2 burba 2013 the field had a rectangle shape with a mean length of 770 m and mean width of 500 m the long dimension was oriented nearly north south see fig 1 right cotton cv pima was sown on march 27 2017 and drip fertigated throughout the season according to the israeli extension service recommendations since this is the best practice it is assumed that the field was not under stress at any point during the season the irrigation was stopped on august 24 2017 and the cotton was harvested on september 25 2017 field measurements of evapotranspiration were conducted between 25 july and 11 september 2017 the local summer climate is rainless according to data supplied by the israel meteorological service from the negba meteorological station about 2 5 km south west of the experiment location between 2015 and 2017 the annual average number of rainy days i e rainfall 1 mm was 59 with an annual average rainfall of 409 mm there was no significant rainfall during the summer months june through august total summer rainfall for 3 years only 4 7 mm between 2015 and 2017 the average annual and growing season average march september meteorological data were relative humidity 68 and 68 respectively relative humidity at 12 00 52 and 50 respectively mean daily air temperature 20 4 and 23 2 c respectively mean daily minimum air temperature 15 6 and 18 1 c respectively and corresponding mean daily maximum temperature 25 6 and 28 5 c respectively 2 2 agro meteorological measurements these measurements were conducted to determine et0 and etc from which the crop coefficient kc was calculated as etc et0 et0 was calculated based on meteorological data and etc was measured with an eddy covariance system the agro meteorology unit of the israel ministry of agriculture and rural development regularly estimates the reference evapotranspiration et0 at selected locations across israel in this study daily et0 was calculated according to the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 based on meteorological measurements of temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar irradiance at the negba meteorological station located about 2 5 km south west of the eddy flux tower this public domain data is available for download from http www meteo co il direct measurements of etc were performed by an eddy covariance system that measured latent le and sensible h heat fluxes in a manner similar to that described in rozenstein et al 2018 an eddy covariance ec system was installed on a tower at 3 7 m above the ground at a position that allowed a fetch of about 400 m for the prevailing northwesterly wind fig 1b the system consisted of a three axis ultrasonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific logan ut usa that measured the wind speed vector and sonic temperature and a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific logan ut usa that measured water vapor concentration to minimize wind distortion effects the csat3 anemometer head was oriented towards the approximate direction of the predominant wind raw signals from the ec system were sampled at 20 hz signals were recorded on a cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa and later processed by the eddypro software li cor lincoln ne usa to generate the flux data to assure sufficient data quality the lowest quality measurement points with a quality flag class of 2 mauder and foken 2004 were filtered out overall 9 23 of all measurements were either removed as a result of quality issues or missing due to or technical problems roughly half of those gaps 4 62 of the data points were gap filled by interpolation the eddypro software estimated the distance of the 90 flux footprint of each 30 min data point by using kljun s footprint model kljun et al 2004 the footprint data was later used to demark the area that contributed to the flux thus defining an analysis polygon fig 1b additional measurements facilitated energy balance closure analysis net radiation rn was measured with a net radiometer q 7 1 rebs seattle wa usa installed at 3 7 m height on the same pole of the ec system air temperature and relative humidity were measured by a sensor hmp45 campbell sci logan ut usa positioned at a height of 3 7 m within a ventilated radiation shield soil heat flux g was estimated as 10 of rn as suggested in fao 56 allen et al 1998 thirty minute averages of measured variables net radiation air temperature and relative humidity were also recorded on the cr3000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa all the equipment was powered by car batteries that were charged during the day by solar panels 2 3 satellite measurements 2 3 1 pre processing a total of seven relatively cloud free sentinel 2a images acquired during the cotton growing season were analyzed in this study the images were downloaded as level 2a atmospherically corrected products from the sentinels scientific data hub and processed using sentinel application platform snap gascon and ramoino 2017 in order to perform the analysis only for pixels that contributed to the measured water vapor flux an analysis polygon was defined using a similar protocol to rozenstein et al 2018 in short the pixels selected for the analysis were within the 90 flux footprint of the eddy covariance measurements taken between 7 am and 6 pm cloud free throughout the imagery time series and contained within the field boundary the analysis polygon was produced by thresholding the half hourly flux point density histogram at 1 this final analysis polygon corresponds to 393 sentinel 2 pixels at 10 m2 each for all seven images 2 3 2 spectral indices we derived 21 vegetation indices from all of the cloud free images throughout the growing season linear regression models were developed between the field measured kc on the days of image acquisition and the corresponding spectral indices the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse values were calculated for every model the kc ndvi model developed in this study was compared to other similar models from the literature that were developed for cotton montgomery et al 2015 and with a general field crop model kamble et al 2013 in addition the field measured kc values and the estimates of kc ndvi models were compared with the recommended kc for cotton in this region that is provided by the israeli extension service cross validation of the models developed during the two sites tel nof rozenstein et al 2018 and negba this study was performed by testing the performance of the tel nof models when applied to negba imagery and the negba models when applied to tel nof imagery finally combined models based on both sites were derived and tested on the combined dataset from both sites 3 results the energy balance closure was used to assess the validity of the ec flux measurements wilson et al 2002 in this analysis half hourly values of consumed energy of latent and sensible heat le h were regressed against corresponding values of the available energy rn g where rn is net radiation and g is soil heat flux fig 2 the 0 84 regression slope of the le h against rn g and the relatively high r2 0 92 indicate a reasonable energy balance closure as is common in such flux measurements wilson et al 2002 and reliable flux measurements by the eddy covariance system albeit this closure was not as good as the energy balance closure in the previous campaign rozenstein et al 2018 which had a regression slope of 0 96 possible reasons for the energy balance closure difference between the two campaigns are 1 the use of a different vapor concentration sensor in the ec system 2 the quality checks of turbulent flux measurements as analyzed by eddypro were somewhat better in the previous rozenstein et al 2018 than in the current campaign 3 in the current campaign g was estimated as 10 of rn and wasn t actually measured as done in the previous campaign to account for the lack of energy balance closure in the estimation of etc the energy balance was forced to close using the bowen ratio approach twine et al 2000 this approach assumes that the ratio between sensible and latent heat flux the bowen ratio is correctly measured by the ec system however h and le should be individually adjusted to close the energy balance after adjusting both le and h the energy balance was perfectly closed with a slope equal to 1 as expected most of the regression models between each of the 21 vegetation indices and kc were found to perform well by rozenstein et al 2018 in the tel nof experiment but the models performance in negba were not as good table 1 the coefficient of determination is lower for most of the negba models and the rmse is higher by up to one order of magnitude therefore while in tel nof many of the indices were reasonable surrogates for kc in negba only a few of them performed well for example the ndvi model did not perform satisfactorily in negba r2 0 4581 rmse 0 1263 compared to tel nof r2 0 9491 rmse 0 0193 however when compared against other ndvi models kamble et al 2013 montgomery et al 2015 it gave a better prediction for kc still indices based on the red edge bands performed best mtci consistently ranks best while reip and s2rep that were found to perform well in tel nof worked well in negba too cross validations of the models show that some of the models developed for one site can be successfully applied at the other site to estimate kc those include the red edge based indices mtci reip s2rep along with others such as evi and tsavi the israeli extension service kc table values were usually higher than those measured and predicted for mid season and lower at the end of the season fig 3 4 discussion the results are in line with those of rozenstein et al 2018 and suggest that some vegetation indices that are based on sentinel 2 bands are suitable predictors for cotton kc and that those based on the red and red edge spectral bands mtci rep and s2rep are the best ones other indices i e evi and tsavi show acceptable performance at each site but not as good as red edge based mtci which demonstrated the best kc prediction ability of all the indices tested in this study this determination is based on the index performance in both site specific models and the combined model that is based on both sites the consistent performance of the models based on these indices and their successful application at two different sites suggests that in the future models for a certain crop and region can be calibrated at one representative plot and then applied in neighboring sites at a reasonable accuracy accordingly these results demonstrate the potential of developing kc prediction for field crops using sentinel 2 that would perform better compared to older public domain satellite sensors that did not cover the red edge region and did not provide as short a revisit time as the sentinel 2 pair of sensors i e landsat spot in addition the inferior performance of older ndvi based models for kc prediction when tested against our field measurements suggest that the generality of those older models is limited and that the new models should be further tested in more environments to solidify the confidence in their performance before irrigation recommendations can be based on their predictions since in this study the field measurements were carried out during the mid late stages of the growing season the models developed in this paper still require further testing and adaptations to extend their application to the entire growing season moreover in future studies irrigation trials would be conducted to test the mtci based model against the common irrigation practice in israel to examine whether it can increase the water use efficiency without significant yield reduction 5 conclusion in this study kc models derived at two different cotton fields and growing

alfalfa medicago sativa l a perennial legume with high yields and forage quality is one of the most widely used forage crops in the united states of america usa the average harvested area was 7 3 million ha with total hay production of 59 million tons during 2013 2015 usda nass 2016 for the same period the average harvested area in oklahoma was about 99 900 ha with 0 69 million tons of hay production usda nass 2016 it is believed that alfalfa has one of the largest seasonal water requirements among forage crops wright 1988 due to its long growing season perennial deep root systems and high forage yields in multiple harvests harvesting of hay influences dynamics of soil moisture and evapotranspiration et as it diminishes plant transpiration quickly and conserves soil moisture for regrowth therefore accurately quantifying the dynamics of et is crucial for efficient water management and improved water use efficiency since et is one of the major components of water balance

site received 631 and 1109 mm precipitation in 2016 and 2017 respectively the 30 year 1981 2010 mean precipitation was 925 mm total precipitation during the main growing season april october was 501 and 930 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared to the 30 year mean of 660 mm as a result cumulative harvested dry biomass yield was higher during the wet year 2017 10 t ha 1 than the dry year 2016 7 5 t ha 1 cumulative precipitation from january to april was 250 mm 30 year mean in 2016 but it was 1 6 398 mm and 0 4 101 mm times of the 30 year mean in 2017 and 2018 respectively because of dry conditions biomass yield at the first harvest in may averaged only 1 41 t ha 1 in 2018 and 3 t ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 table 1 similar yields 3 t ha 1 in may harvests in 2016 and 2017 suggested that cumulative precipitation of 250 mm for the period of january april which is also about the 30 year mean precipitation for the same period was enough to produce attainable forage yield for the first harvest 3 3 daily rates and annual dynamics of et daily et reached up to 6 9 mm d 1 and 8 day average et reached up to 5 64 mm d 1 during the study period fig 1 as expected et rates in this non irrigated study were smaller than the et rates reported for well irrigated alfalfa fields in southern idaho wright 1988 and davis california hanson et al 2007 daily et occasionally exceeded 10 mm d 1 and averaged 8 mm d 1 during peak et periods wright 1988 daily et from smoothed curves reached about 8 mm d 1 with some daily spikes reaching up to 12 mm d 1 hanson et al 2007 those sites had higher forage yields as well due to irrigation average annual forage yield was 17 6 t ha 1 for the idaho site and yield up to 19 t ha 1 was recorded for the california site annual dynamics of et followed growth patterns of alfalfa the et rates began to increase rapidly from mid february with the rise in temperature and beginning of vegetation growth monthly harvesting of hay caused large fluctuations in et rates during the may august period poor growth of alfalfa in spring 2018 sums of evi laimod and fpar for the january april period were 4 38 13 5 and 6 37 respectively as compared to spring 2017 sums of evi laimod and fpar for the january april period were 5 42 23 1 and 8 19 respectively due to dry conditions resulted in lower et rates during the entire spring 2018 fig 1 as a result cumulative et for the january april period was 218 and 135 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively in comparison cumulative et values were similar in 2016 52 mm and 2017 57 mm after doy day of the year 300 due to crop senescence hanson et al 2007 also reported similar et rates and patterns in fully and deficit irrigated alfalfa fields after doy 300 the magnitudes of et were strongly regulated by growth status of alfalfa during the may 3 june 7 period of 2017 when hay yield and cumulative precipitation were 4 41 t ha 1 and 192 mm respectively the maximum 8 day average et was 5 64 mm d 1 with a daily average et of 4 30 mm d 1 and cumulative et of 152 mm table 1 in comparison the maximum 8 day average et was 4 36 mm d 1 with a daily average et of 3 53 mm d 1 and cumulative et of 106 mm during the may 18 june 17 period of 2016 when hay yield and cumulative precipitation were 2 37 t ha 1 and 27 mm respectively higher precipitation and resultant higher forage production generated higher cumulative et during the main growing season april october in 2017 734 mm than 2016 652 mm cumulative et was 1 3 and 0 79 times of cumulative precipitation during the 2016 and 2017 main growing seasons respectively deep root systems allow alfalfa to draw water from a greater depth of the soil profile in dry conditions annual et in 2017 wet year was 901 mm 81 of the total annual precipitation in comparison annual et values in irrigated alfalfa fields were up to 1557 mm semi arid climate in turkey benli et al 2006 and 1381 mm mediterranean climate in california hanson et al 2007 substantially higher et in those studies as compared to our study can be attributed to irrigation and higher forage yields annual et of 900 mm for alfalfa in 2017 wet year in our study was similar to the annual et 920 mm reported for native tallgrass prairie in a wet year 2015 at the same location bajgain et al 2018 3 4 response of et to ppfd ta and vpd the et fluxes increased linearly with increasing ppfd with no sign of saturation even beyond 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 2 the fluxes increased rapidly with increasing ta up to 30 c and declined thereafter fig 2 the et fluxes increased rapidly with increasing vpd up to 3 kpa and then plateaued beyond certain thresholds of ta and vpd partial closure of stomata decreases canopy conductance to et fluxes and avoids further loss of water in terms of transpiration monteith 1995 however et are affected less than co2 fluxes wagle et al 2018a b because non stomatal effects such as increased photorespiration or heterotrophic respiration also suppress co2 fluxes at higher ta and vpd long 1991 morison and gifford 1983 as a result optimum ta and vpd were 25 c and 2 2 kpa respectively for alfalfa nee and approximately 26 c and 2 7 kpa respectively for alfalfa gpp for the same site years wagle et al 2019 as compared to approximately 30 c of ta and 3 kpa of vpd for et in this study 3 5 seasonal dynamics of ewue comparison of seasonal patterns of ewue evimod and laimod between 2016 and 2017 growing seasons showed that they were mostly higher during 2017 wet year than 2016 dry year fig 3 the magnitude of 8 day composite ewue was 4 g c mm 1 et seasonal april october sums of laimod were 47 4 and 52 m2 m 2 and seasonal sums of evimod were 11 and 12 in 2016 and 2017 respectively higher forage production and canopy coverage were associated with a greater increase in gpp 22 than et 13 in 2017 wet year as compared to 2016 dry year higher canopy coverage increases light use efficiency for greater carbon uptake but decreases soil evaporation by attenuating radiation transmitted to the soil surface consequently ewue at the seasonal scale seasonal sums of gpp to et was 2 38 and 2 57 g c mm 1 et in 2016 and 2017 respectively similarly if ewue was considered as the ratio of cumulative dry forage yield to seasonal et then it was 11 5 and 13 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 et in 2016 and 2017 respectively this result supports the findings of previous studies hu et al 2008 wagle et al 2015b that ewue is low during years or on sites with low productivity compared to years or sites with high productivity these findings illustrate a pronounced effect of vegetation productivity on ewue by altering carbon uptake and water loss differently 3 6 comparison between ec measured et and etmod16 the maximum 8 day composite daily value of etmod16 during the 2016 growing season was 3 32 mm d 1 fig 4 while the maximum 8 day composite daily value of ec measured et was 4 78 m d 1 on the same day april 30 the maximum 8 day composite daily value of ec measured et was 5 64 mm d 1 on may 25 2017 while etmod16 observations were missing from april 7 to july 12 2017 in 2018 the maximum 8 day composite daily value of ec measured et was 3 64 mm d 1 at the end of april when etmod was 2 2 mm d 1 a linear regression of 8 day composite ec measured et and etmod16 showed they were strongly correlated r2 0 73 due to similar seasonal annual patterns fig 4 however the slope without intercept was only 0 64 indicating etmod16 underestimated et by 36 compared to ec measured et the rmse was 1 06 mm d 1 cv ratio was 1 09 histogram match was 0 64 and spaef was 0 6 while optimal spaef value equals to 1 previous studies have reported substantial underestimation of actual et by the etmod16 product in semi arid and arid climates hu et al 2015 ramoelo et al 2014 but better performance of the etmod16 product in humid climates hu et al 2015 in addition previous studies have reported different performances of the etmod16 product for different biomes the etmod16 product underestimated actual et in croplands bhattarai et al 2017 kim et al 2012 velpuri et al 2013 but performed better in forests bhattarai et al 2017 kim et al 2012 thus substantial underestimation of actual et for non irrigated alfalfa in this study is consistent with the underestimation of et by the etmod16 product in croplands under dry conditions substantially lower magnitudes of etmod16 could arise from uncertainties related to several factors such as parameterizing soil moisture content and precipitation using meteorological factors overestimating environmental stresses on canopy conductance and coarser resolution of meteorological data used in the etmod16 algorithm yang et al 2015 environmental stresses on canopy conductance could be lower than estimated by the model due to greater root zone depth commonly 1 m or more and soil water availability of alfalfa as compared to most croplands thus it is necessary to validate the etmod16 product and parameterize at additional sites for specific biomes for its further improvement 3 7 relationships of et with satellite remote sensing products the relationship between et and several vegetation indices derived from the viirs and modis are presented in table 2 the laiviirs showed a stronger relationship r2 0 68 with et than did ndviviirs eviviirs and fparviirs similarly laimod also showed a stronger relationship r2 0 74 with et than did other modis products ndvi evi and fpar the et laimod relationship was slightly improved when laimod was integrated with ta adj r2 0 78 and par adj r2 0 79 in comparison the evimod explained only 62 r2 0 62 and rmse 0 86 mm d 1 of variations in et however the et evimod relationship was substantially improved when evimod was integrated with ta adj r2 0 76 and rmse 0 68 mm d 1 and par adj r2 0 83 and rmse 0 57 mm d 1 the results showed that evi and par could explain 83 of variations in alfalfa et which was consistent with the findings of previous studies that et was jointly controlled by interaction between biological and climatic variables brümmer et al 2012 wagle et al 2017b a strong correspondence of vegetation indices with et indicated the potential to upscale site level alfalfa et to large spatial scales by integrating remote sensing observations and climate developing such an empirical or statistical approach using a few easily acquired variables is necessary for each biome or crop type since more complex models often require several and not readily available variables for large areas to produce reliable et estimates liou and kar 2014 the empirical statistical approach based on few readily available variables can be more robust and applicable than solving complex physical models with limited data glenn et al 2008 4 conclusions annual dynamics of et followed growth patterns and status of alfalfa higher forage production and precipitation caused higher cumulative et during the main growing season april october in 2017 734 mm than 2016 652 mm annual et in 2017 wet year was 901 mm which was 0 81 time i e 81 of total annual precipitation the 8 day composite values of et and ewue the ratio of gpp to et reached about 5 6 mm d 1 and 4 g c mm 1 et respectively as compared to ec measured et the magnitudes of etmod16 failed to capture daily peaks resulting in underestimation of actual et by 36 the results indicated the necessity to validate the etmod16 product and parameterize at additional sites for specific biomes for further improvement our results illustrate that a simple statistical model which integrates readily available remote sensing and climate data e g evi and par can provide reliable estimates of alfalfa et offering the potential of upscaling site level et measurements to large areas however long term measurements of et across multiple locations are necessary to provide more insights into water dynamics of alfalfa and to develop test robust statistical et models for alfalfa

alfalfa medicago sativa l a perennial legume with high yields and forage quality is one of the most widely used forage crops in the united states of america usa the average harvested area was 7 3 million ha with total hay production of 59 million tons during 2013 2015 usda nass 2016 for the same period the average harvested area in oklahoma was about 99 900 ha with 0 69 million tons of hay production usda nass 2016 it is believed that alfalfa has one of the largest seasonal water requirements among forage crops wright 1988 due to its long growing season perennial deep root systems and high forage yields in multiple harvests harvesting of hay influences dynamics of soil moisture and evapotranspiration et as it diminishes plant transpiration quickly and conserves soil moisture for regrowth therefore accurately quantifying the dynamics of et is crucial for efficient water management and improved water use efficiency since et is one of the major components of water balance although several studies have reported et in alfalfa most of them used lysimeters benli et al 2006 benz et al 1984 reicosky et al 1983 rosenberg 1969 wright 1988 or the bowen ratio energy balance breb method todd et al 2000 few studies have measured et in alfalfa with the eddy covariance ec technique hanson et al 2007 kizer and elliott 1991 kizer and elliott 1991 measured et with a portable ec system over irrigated alfalfa in stillwater oklahoma during the 1986 and 1987 growing seasons to evaluate the system performance based on energy balance closure ebc but did not report et measurements hanson et al 2007 measured et from fully and deficit irrigated commercial alfalfa fields in california using the ec energy balance and surface renewal energy balance methods respectively and determined the magnitudes and annual budgets of et these studies were performed in irrigated alfalfa details on daily magnitudes and seasonal annual dynamics and budgets of et in non irrigated alfalfa which represents the majority of lands planted to alfalfa are lacking in addition to our understanding temporal variability of alfalfa et with respect to major environmental biophysical factors and harvesting of hay is not well understood ecosystem water use efficiency ewue is a key parameter to measure the trade off between carbon gains and water losses of terrestrial ecosystems emmerich 2007 ponton et al 2006 although the definition and quantification of ewue can vary depending on different approaches ec measurements have increasingly been used to estimate ewue at the ecosystem level as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to et law et al 2002 wagle et al 2016 however understanding the dynamics and controlling factors of ewue using ec data is still lacking for alflafa in this study ec data collected over two years from a non irrigated alfalfa field in central oklahoma have been used to address the following objectives 1 to quantify daily magnitudes and seasonal annual

cumulative et for the january april period was 218 and 135 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively in comparison cumulative et values were similar in 2016 52 mm and 2017 57 mm after doy day of the year 300 due to crop senescence hanson et al 2007 also reported similar et rates and patterns in fully and deficit irrigated alfalfa fields after doy 300 the magnitudes of et were strongly regulated by growth status of alfalfa during the may 3 june 7 period of 2017 when hay yield and cumulative precipitation were 4 41 t ha 1 and 192 mm respectively the maximum 8 day average et was 5 64 mm d 1 with a daily average et of 4 30 mm d 1 and cumulative et of 152 mm table 1 in comparison the maximum 8 day average et was 4 36 mm d 1 with a daily average et of 3 53 mm d 1 and cumulative et of 106 mm during the may 18 june 17 period of 2016 when hay yield and cumulative precipitation were 2 37 t ha 1 and 27 mm respectively higher precipitation and resultant higher forage production generated higher cumulative et during the main growing season april october in 2017 734 mm than 2016 652 mm cumulative et was 1 3 and 0 79 times of cumulative precipitation during the 2016 and 2017 main growing seasons respectively deep root systems allow alfalfa to draw water from a greater depth of the soil profile in dry conditions annual et in 2017 wet year was 901 mm 81 of the total annual precipitation in comparison annual et values in irrigated alfalfa fields were up to 1557 mm semi arid climate in turkey benli et al 2006 and 1381 mm mediterranean climate in california hanson et al 2007 substantially higher et in those studies as compared to our study can be attributed to irrigation and higher forage yields annual et of 900 mm for alfalfa in 2017 wet year in our study was similar to the annual et 920 mm reported for native tallgrass prairie in a wet year 2015 at the same location bajgain et al 2018 3 4 response of et to ppfd ta and vpd the et fluxes increased linearly with increasing ppfd with no sign of saturation even beyond 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 2 the fluxes increased rapidly with increasing ta up to 30 c and declined thereafter fig 2 the et fluxes increased rapidly with increasing vpd up to 3 kpa and then plateaued beyond certain thresholds of ta and vpd partial closure of stomata decreases canopy conductance to et fluxes and avoids further loss of water in terms of transpiration monteith 1995 however et are affected less than co2 fluxes wagle et al 2018a b because non stomatal effects such as increased photorespiration or heterotrophic respiration also suppress co2 fluxes at higher ta and vpd long 1991 morison and gifford 1983 as a result optimum ta and vpd were 25 c and 2 2 kpa respectively for alfalfa nee and approximately 26 c and 2 7 kpa respectively for alfalfa gpp for the same site years wagle et al 2019 as compared to approximately 30 c of ta and 3 kpa of vpd for et in this study 3 5 seasonal dynamics of ewue comparison of seasonal patterns of ewue evimod and laimod between 2016 and 2017 growing seasons showed that they were mostly higher during 2017 wet year than 2016 dry year fig 3 the magnitude of 8 day composite ewue was 4 g c mm 1 et seasonal april october sums of laimod were 47 4 and 52 m2 m 2 and seasonal sums of evimod were 11 and 12 in 2016 and 2017 respectively higher forage production and canopy coverage were associated with a greater increase in gpp 22 than et 13 in 2017 wet year as compared to 2016 dry year higher canopy coverage increases light use efficiency for greater carbon uptake but decreases soil evaporation by attenuating radiation transmitted to the soil surface consequently ewue at the seasonal scale seasonal sums of gpp to et was 2 38 and 2 57 g c mm 1 et in 2016 and 2017 respectively similarly if ewue was considered as the ratio of cumulative dry forage yield to seasonal et then it was 11 5 and 13 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 et in 2016 and 2017 respectively this result supports the findings of previous studies hu et al 2008 wagle et al 2015b that ewue is low during years or on sites with low productivity compared to years or sites with high productivity these findings illustrate a pronounced effect of vegetation productivity on ewue by altering carbon uptake and water loss differently 3 6 comparison between ec measured et and etmod16 the maximum 8 day composite daily value of etmod16 during the 2016 growing season was 3 32 mm d 1 fig 4 while the maximum 8 day composite daily value of ec measured et was 4 78 m d 1 on the same day april 30 the maximum 8 day composite daily value of ec measured et was 5 64 mm d 1 on may 25 2017 while etmod16 observations were missing from april 7 to july 12 2017 in 2018 the maximum 8 day composite daily value of ec measured et was 3 64 mm d 1 at the end of april when etmod was 2 2 mm d 1 a linear regression of 8 day composite ec measured et and etmod16 showed they were strongly correlated r2 0 73 due to similar seasonal annual patterns fig 4 however the slope without intercept was only 0 64 indicating etmod16 underestimated et by 36 compared to ec measured et the rmse was 1 06 mm d 1 cv ratio was 1 09 histogram match was 0 64 and spaef was 0 6 while optimal spaef value equals to 1 previous studies have reported substantial underestimation of actual et by the etmod16 product in semi arid and arid climates hu et al 2015 ramoelo et al 2014 but better performance of the etmod16 product in humid climates hu et al 2015 in addition previous studies have reported different performances of the etmod16 product for different biomes the etmod16 product underestimated actual et in croplands bhattarai et al 2017 kim et al 2012 velpuri et al 2013 but performed better in forests bhattarai et al 2017 kim et al 2012 thus substantial underestimation of actual et for non irrigated alfalfa in this study is consistent with the underestimation of et by the etmod16 product in croplands under dry conditions substantially lower magnitudes of etmod16 could arise from uncertainties related to several factors such as parameterizing soil moisture content and precipitation using meteorological factors overestimating environmental stresses on canopy conductance and coarser resolution of meteorological data used in the etmod16 algorithm yang et al 2015 environmental stresses on canopy conductance could be lower than estimated by the model due to greater root zone depth commonly 1 m or more and soil water availability of alfalfa as compared to most croplands thus it is necessary to validate the etmod16 product and parameterize at additional sites for specific biomes for its further improvement 3 7 relationships of et with satellite remote sensing products the relationship between et and several vegetation indices derived from the viirs and modis are presented in table 2 the laiviirs showed a stronger relationship r2 0 68 with et than did ndviviirs eviviirs and fparviirs similarly laimod also showed a stronger relationship r2 0 74 with et than did other modis products ndvi evi and fpar the et laimod relationship was slightly improved when laimod was integrated with ta adj r2 0 78 and par adj r2 0 79 in comparison the evimod explained only 62 r2 0 62 and rmse 0 86 mm d 1 of variations in et however the et evimod relationship was substantially improved when evimod was integrated with ta adj r2 0 76 and rmse 0 68 mm d 1 and par adj r2 0 83 and rmse 0 57 mm d 1 the results showed that evi and par could explain 83 of variations in alfalfa et which was consistent with the findings of previous studies that et was jointly controlled by interaction between biological and climatic variables brümmer et al 2012 wagle et al 2017b a strong correspondence of vegetation indices with et indicated the potential to upscale site level alfalfa et to large spatial scales by integrating remote sensing observations and climate developing such an empirical or statistical approach using a few easily acquired variables is necessary for each biome or crop type since more complex models often require several and not readily available variables for large areas to produce reliable et estimates liou and kar 2014 the empirical statistical approach based on few readily available variables can be more robust and applicable than solving complex physical models with limited data glenn et al 2008 4 conclusions annual dynamics of et followed growth patterns and status of alfalfa higher forage production and precipitation caused higher cumulative et during the main growing season april october in 2017 734 mm than 2016 652 mm annual et in 2017 wet year was 901 mm which was 0 81 time i e 81 of total annual precipitation the 8 day composite values of et and ewue the ratio of gpp to et reached about 5 6 mm d 1 and 4 g c mm 1 et respectively as compared to ec measured et the magnitudes of etmod16 failed to capture daily peaks resulting in underestimation of actual et by 36 the results indicated the necessity to validate the etmod16 product and parameterize at additional sites for specific biomes for further improvement our results illustrate that a simple statistical model which integrates readily available remote sensing and climate data e g evi and par can provide reliable estimates of alfalfa et offering the potential of upscaling site level et measurements to large areas however long term measurements of et across multiple locations are necessary to provide more insights into water dynamics of alfalfa and to develop test robust statistical et models for alfalfa

and enhance fruit quality under continuous saline water irrigation keywords saline water irrigation gypsum straw compost soil properties tomato growth fruit quality 1 introduction freshwater resources are essential for both agricultural production and human health although there is approximately 35 million cubic kilometers of freshwater around the world only a small fraction is available for humans because most freshwater is locked up in glaciers permanent snow cover or deep groundwater gleick and palaniappan 2010 as a result freshwater shortage is common in most areas of the world especially in arid and semiarid regions grafton et al 2013 azarnivand and chitsaz 2015 in many countries the freshwater shortage is getting worse mainly due to the rapidly increasing population elliott et al 2014 hutchins et al 2018 freshwater is often preferentially allocated to urban demands leading to a reduced supply for agricultural production systems since agricultural water accounts for the largest proportion 70 of global water withdrawals haddeland et al 2014 it is important to look for alternative water resources that can be used for irrigation saline water is a common alternative to freshwater for agricultural production to date saline water has been used for irrigation in many crops such as maize feng et al 2017 cucumber wang et al 2017 lettuce di mola et al 2017 and alfalfa díaz et al 2018 generally saline water irrigation can meet most water requirements of crops and maintain crop productivity beltrán 1999 however continuous irrigation with saline water often leads to adverse effects on crop growth because salts may gradually accumulate in the rootzone resulting in soil salinization cao et al 2016 baath et al 2017 it is well known that soil salinization may restrict water and nutrient absorption by roots thereby limiting shoot growth and leaf photosynthesis deinlein et al 2014 de pascale et al 2015 alharby et al 2018 additionally under salinity stress salty ions e g na and cl may accumulate in plant tissues and finally induce ion toxicity and imbalance in cells further restricting crop growth tavakkoli et al 2011 therefore when irrigating crops with saline water efficient methods should be considered to alleviate the adverse effects of saline water application of flue gas desulfurization fgd gypsum caso4 2h2o is an efficient agricultural practice used to reduce salt stress and improve crop growth in salt affected areas watts and dick 2014 zhao et al 2018 the fgd gypsum is a by product of scrubbing sulfur dioxide so2 from combustion gases at coal burning power plants watts and dick 2014 a large amount of fgd gypsum is produced annually worldwide and has been widely used as a soil amendment chen and dick 2011 gypsum is a quality source of the essential plant nutrients calcium ca and sulfur s and has a number of beneficial functions such as amelioration of sodic soils by displacing sodium na with ca under saline water irrigation the fgd gypsum application may benefit soil quality and crop production because caso4 can react rapidly with sodium salts e g nacl na2co3 and nahco3 to generate naso4 which can effectively be leached from soils mao et al 2014 mckenna et al 2019 in addition to fgd gypsum straw compost sc made of plant straws and animal manure is another soil amendment that has been widely used to alleviate salt stress in plants lakhdar et al 2011 chaganti et al 2015 leogrande et al 2016 as an efficient soil conditioner sc has been widely applied to agricultural soils for hundreds of years because it improves soil physical and chemical properties and introduces beneficial microorganisms into the soil roca pérez et al 2009 tian et al 2016 under salt stress the sc application can reduce the abundance of exchangeable sodium in the rootzone by enhancing water infiltration and salt leaching lakhdar et al 2009 leogrande and vitti 2019 in addition the sc can improve soil fertility by supplying nutrients into the soil and thereby contribute to enhancing plant growth because the availability of nutrients is relatively low in salt affected soils mullen 2005 walker and bernal 2008 although both fgd gypsum and sc can have positive effects on plant growth under salt stress they have different working mechanisms hence we hypothesize that these two soil amendments may have different efficiencies in improving plant growth under saline water irrigation if this is the case we further hypothesize that the combination of two soil amendments may be more efficient than each one alone in alleviating plant salt stress to test the two hypotheses we investigated the effects of fgd gypsum sc and their combinations the sc mixed with fgd gypsum on site and fgd gypsum co composted with sc on soil properties root nutrient uptake shoot growth plant biomass fruit yield and tomato quality under saline water irrigation the objectives of this study were 1 to compare the different efficiencies of fgd gypsum and sc if used as soil amendments under saline water irrigation and 2 to examine whether these two soil amendments have additive effects 2 materials and methods 2

significantly affected soil na and k at the 0 40 cm depth and ca2 at the 20 40 cm depth while g application influenced soil na k and ca2 at the 0 40 cm depth and mg2 at the 0 20 cm depth under saline

soil k as compared to other treatments except the sw g treatment in the autumn winter season fig 1d a significant increase in soil ca2 was found with the application of g at the 0 20 cm depth compared

was found for soil hco3 co3 2 table 2 3 4 plant cations cation ratios and essential elements saline water significantly increased na but decreased k and ca2 in plant tissues resulting in overall reductions in both k na and ca2 na ratios compare sw vs the control fig 2 despite this these negative effects of saline water were generally alleviated by c and or g application compare all c and g related treatments vs sw fig 2 reflecting the distinct influence of c and g on plant cations and cation ratios under saline water irrigation table s4 particularly the application of c co composted with g led to the lowest na but the highest k na and ca2 na ratios when plants were irrigated with saline water compare sw gc vs other sw related treatments fig 2 within plant macronutrients only total n p and ca were significantly influenced by c and g application under saline water table s4 although these macronutrients showed overall decreased trends under saline water irrigation compare sw

significantly higher total n and ca than the control in most situations except for total n in leaves in the autumn winter season and total ca in stems in the winter spring season effects of saline water on plant micronutrients were generally not obvious except for reduced total zn in leaves in the winter spring season compare sw vs the control table s5 similarly in most situations plant micronutrients were not statistically influenced by salinity alleviation treatments as compared to the sw treatment table s5 3 5 photosynthetic indexes and chlorophyll among photosynthetic indexes photosynthesis rate showed significant reductions in both cropping seasons while intercellular co2 showed an increase in the winter spring season under saline water irrigation compare sw vs the

respect to intercellular co2 it was decreased by the sw c treatment but was increased by the sw g treatment as compared to the sw treatment in both cropping seasons table 3 a significant enhancement

winter season table 3 chlorophyll was reduced by saline water compare sw vs the control but was increased by the application of c combined with g compare sw c g and sw gc vs sw table 3 3 6 plant growth rate and biomass and fruit yield and blossom end rot the rgrs of both plant height and leaf area were generally decreased by saline water leading to overall reductions of plant biomass compare sw vs the control fig 3 however these adverse effects of saline water were generally attenuated by c and or g application especially by the c plus g combination compare sw c g and sw gc vs sw fig 3 similar trends among treatments were observed for individual fruit weight and fruit yield whereas reverse trends were found for blossom end rot fig 4 the highest fruit number was found in the sw gc treatment in both copping seasons fig 4 4 discussion generally saline water irrigation is a double edged sword for crop production because it can meet the water requirement of crops and thereby maintain crop growth di mola et al 2017 feng et al 2017 díaz et al 2018 but may also lead to reduced crop productivity after continuous application de pascale et al 2015 baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 although both fgd gypsum and straw compost have the potential to reduce salt stress and improve crop growth in salt affected soils lakhdar et al 2011 chaganti et al 2015 leogrande et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 little information is available regarding their efficiency and effectiveness under continuous saline water irrigation as we hypothesized fgd gypsum and straw compost had different efficiencies in alleviating plant salt stress moreover the combination of fgd gypsum and straw compost was more efficient than each single soil conditioner if used to enhance plant growth and crop yield under continuous saline water irrigation continuous saline water irrigation resulted in obvious adverse effects on tomato growth such as the reduction of photosynthesis rate table 3 rgr fig 3 plant biomass fig 3 and fruit yield fig 4 and the enhancement of ber fig 4 high salinity can inhibit plant growth through inducing ion toxicity osmotic stress or both zhu 2016 in general under soil conditions with ec less than 3 0 ms cm 1 ion toxicity induced mainly by na cl and so4 2 rather than osmotic stress was the predominant factor resulting in crop susceptibility to salinity chinnusamy et al 2005 in the present study therefore ion toxicity was the major factor causing salt stress in tomato plants because soil ec in the rootzone was less than 1 5 ms cm 1 during the growing period fig 1b obviously na and cl were the two major salt ions inducing ion toxicity for tomato plants under continuous saline water irrigation compare sw vs the control fig 1c and table 2 due to the significantly higher na and cl concentrations in irrigation water under the sw treatment as compared to the control similar trends were observed by several previous studies valdés et al 2014 cao et al 2016 however under continuous saline water irrigation salt ions na in particular in the active rootzone 0 20 cm were significantly decreased by fgd gypsum and or straw compost application especially by the combined treatments fig 1c this could be because the fgd gypsum caso4 can react rapidly with nacl to generate naso4 which can effectively leach from soils mao et al 2014 yu et al 2014 while straw compost can reduce the abundance of exchangeable na in the rootzone by enhancing water infiltration and salt leaching lakhdar et al 2009 leogrande and vitti 2019 this explanation is partly supported by the fact that under continuous saline water irrigation na in plant tissues was generally reduced by fgd gypsum and or straw compost application especially by the application of co composted fgd gypsum straw compare all c and g related treatments vs sw fig 2 in addition to na sar is also an important factor used to evaluate potential salinity hazard to crop growth and the sodicity hazard to soil permeability sposito and mattigod 1977 callaghana et al 2016 sattari et al 2018 since higher sar generally results in lower soil infiltration rate and thereby inhibits the leaching of salts ganjegunte et al 2017 continuous saline water irrigation can easily lead to salinity stress in plants through enhancing sar this phenomenon has been demonstrated in most crops such as potato sunﬂower sesbania maize wheat and tomato chauhan et al 2007 lashari et al 2015 soleimani et al 2017 li et al 2019 similarly in this study the sar was significantly increased by continuous saline water irrigation in both cropping seasons fig s1a despite this under continuous saline water irrigation sar in the active rootzone 0 20 cm was significantly reduced by fgd gypsum and or straw compost application fig s1a this is consistent with the results reported by mckenna et al 2019 who observed that the gypsum application could maintain a relatively low level of sar in soil solution because of the displacement of sodium by calcium our results also agree with chaganti et al 2015 who reported that compost application reduced the sar in saline sodic soils due to the enhancement of soil aggregate stability and na removal facilitated by leaching it was noted that the combination of fgd gypsum and straw compost was more efficient than each single soil conditioner in reducing soil sar fig s1a this could be due to leaching of naso4 created by the reaction between gypsum and nacl mao et al 2014 that was enhanced by increased soil water infiltration that was induced by straw compost addition lakhdar et al 2009 the improvement of soil properties e g the reduction of na and sar generally leads to the enhancement of plant growth in salt affected soils chauhan et al 2007 soleimani et al 2017 generally plant response to reduced soil na and sar is mainly reflected in the reduction of na absorption by plant tissues lashari et al 2015 li et al 2019 leading to increased k na and ca2 na ratios since both k and ca2 are required to maintain the integrity and functioning of cell membranes high k na and ca2 na ratios in plants have been suggested as two important physiological selection criteria for plant salt tolerance porcelli et al 1995 wei et al 2003 ashraf 2004 in the present study under continuous saline water irrigation the k na ratio in plant tissues was increased by both fgd gypsum and straw compost applications while the ca2 na ratio was mainly enhanced by fgd gypsum application fig 2 this fact comes as no surprise since the uptake of k and ca2 by plants is considerably reduced under soil conditions with high amounts of na ashraf 2004 which means that this adverse effect can be reversed by agricultural practices that have the potential to reduce soil na in the rootzone e g fgd gypsum and straw compost applications in this study fig 1c moreover the efficiency of gypsum in enhancing plant ca2 absorption has been sufficiently proven viator et al 2002 favaretto et al 2008 pavla et al 2017 since ca is known to play a crucial role in maintaining the stabilization of cell wall and in regulating ion transport ashraf 2004 the high ca2 na ratio plays a significant role in plant growth maintenance under salinity conditions in regard to k it was noted that straw composts gypsum or their mixtures influenced k content in both soils fig 1d and tomato plants fig 2 under saline water irrigation conditions alrajhi et al 2017 suggested that the changes in soil k could be partly attributed to the tomato crop removal of k arienzo et al 2009 showed that tomato plants have high rates of k removal about 170 kg ha 1 indicating high content of k in tomato plants in addition to k na and ca2 na ratios photosynthesis is also a major adaptive component of salt tolerance in plants ashraf 2004 under salt stress plants generally exhibit low levels of net photosynthetic rate negrão et al 2017 as expected continuous saline water irrigation resulted in significantly decreased photosynthetic rate compare sw vs the control table 3 however this adverse effect was significantly reversed by straw compost application compare c related treatments vs sw table 3 one possible explanation for this finding is that straw compost improved photosynthesis by alleviating na toxicity through the inhibition of na uptake and the maintenance of adequate k na ratios rodrigues et al 2013 additionally straw compost might also improve photosynthesis by enhancing plant growth through its beneficial effects on soil physical chemical properties e g aggregate stability porosity hydraulic conductivity and nutrient availability and biological characteristics e g microbial communities and biochemical processes leogrande and vitti 2019 there is clear evidence that soils with serious salinity problems often exhibit degraded quality e g reduced aggregate stability and decreased microbial diversity cao et al 2016 leogrande and vitti 2019 and reduced fertility e g low p availability mullen 2005 singh et al 2011 consequently under continuous saline water irrigation the application of straw compost had obvious benefits for tomato growth e g enhanced rgr and increased plant biomass and fruit yield figs 3 and 4 through enhancing overall soil properties it was noted that the incidence of ber was efficiently inhibited by the application of fgd gypsum and or straw compost especially by the combined treatments fig 4 the ber is a common physiological disorder that occurs in all the tomato producing areas of the world taylor and locascio 2004 generally ber is considered as a classic symptom of ca deficiency taylor et al 2004 since the uptake of ca2 by plants was considerably reduced under soil conditions with high amounts of na fig 2 ashraf 2004 ber was strongly enhanced under continuous saline water irrigation compare sw vs the control fig 4 as expected the total ca in plant tissues was increased by fgd gypsum related treatments fig 2 due to high contents of ca in gypsum with respect to straw compost it reduced ber fig 4 probably through decreasing the uptake of na by plants fig 2 since fgd gypsum and straw compost had different efficiencies in alleviating plant salt stress the application of co composted fgd gypsum straw resulted in the lowest ber but the highest fruit yield under saline water irrigation fig 4 5 conclusions the fgd gypsum and straw compost and could be used to alleviate plant salt stress under continuous saline water irrigation the combination of fgd gypsum and straw compost was more efficient than each single soil conditioner if used to enhance plant growth and crop yield the application of co composted fgd gypsum straw resulted in the highest fruit yield and the lowest ber under continuous saline water irrigation the enhancements of crop yield and fruit quality were closely associated with the improvement of soil quality as well as plant growth which was induced by the application of fgd gypsum and straw compost plant straw co composted with fgd gypsum can be used as an efficient soil conditioner to enhance tomato yield under continuous saline water irrigation conditions acknowledgments we are

and enhance fruit quality under continuous saline water irrigation keywords saline water irrigation gypsum straw compost soil properties tomato growth fruit quality 1 introduction freshwater resources are essential for both agricultural production and human health although there is approximately 35 million cubic kilometers of freshwater around the world only a small fraction is available for humans because most freshwater is locked up in glaciers permanent snow cover or deep groundwater gleick and palaniappan 2010 as a result freshwater shortage is common in most areas of the world especially in arid and semiarid regions grafton et al 2013 azarnivand and chitsaz 2015 in many countries the freshwater shortage is getting worse mainly due to the rapidly increasing population elliott et al 2014 hutchins et al 2018 freshwater is often preferentially allocated to urban demands leading to a reduced supply for agricultural production systems since agricultural water accounts for the largest proportion 70 of global water withdrawals haddeland et al 2014 it is important to look for alternative water resources that can be used for irrigation saline water is a common alternative to freshwater for agricultural production to date saline water has been used for irrigation in many crops such as maize feng et al 2017 cucumber wang et al 2017 lettuce di mola et al 2017 and alfalfa díaz et al 2018 generally saline water irrigation can meet most water requirements of crops and maintain crop productivity beltrán 1999 however continuous irrigation with saline water often leads to adverse effects on crop growth because salts may gradually accumulate in the rootzone resulting in soil salinization cao et al 2016 baath et al 2017 it is well known that soil salinization may restrict water and nutrient absorption by roots thereby limiting shoot growth and leaf photosynthesis deinlein et al 2014 de pascale et al 2015 alharby et al 2018 additionally under salinity stress salty ions e g na and cl may accumulate in plant tissues and finally induce ion toxicity and imbalance in cells further restricting crop growth tavakkoli et al 2011 therefore when irrigating crops with saline water efficient methods should be considered to alleviate the adverse effects of saline water application of flue gas desulfurization fgd gypsum caso4 2h2o is an efficient agricultural practice used to reduce salt stress and improve crop growth in salt affected areas watts and dick 2014 zhao et al 2018 the fgd gypsum is a by product of scrubbing sulfur dioxide so2 from combustion gases at coal burning power plants watts and dick 2014 a large amount of fgd gypsum is produced annually worldwide and has been widely used as a soil amendment chen and dick 2011 gypsum is a quality source of the essential plant nutrients calcium ca and sulfur s and has a number of beneficial functions such as amelioration of sodic soils by displacing sodium na with ca under saline water irrigation the fgd gypsum application may benefit soil quality and crop production because caso4 can react rapidly with sodium salts e g nacl na2co3 and nahco3 to generate naso4 which can effectively be leached from soils mao et al 2014 mckenna et al 2019 in addition to fgd gypsum straw compost sc made of plant straws and animal manure is another soil amendment that has been widely used to alleviate salt stress in plants lakhdar et al 2011 chaganti et al 2015 leogrande et al 2016 as an efficient soil conditioner sc has been widely applied to agricultural soils for hundreds of years because it improves soil physical and chemical properties and introduces beneficial microorganisms into the soil roca pérez et al 2009 tian et al 2016 under salt stress the sc application can reduce the abundance of exchangeable sodium in the rootzone by enhancing water infiltration and salt leaching lakhdar et al 2009 leogrande and vitti 2019 in addition the sc can improve soil fertility by supplying nutrients into the soil and thereby contribute to enhancing plant growth because the availability of nutrients is relatively low in salt affected soils mullen 2005 walker and bernal 2008 although both fgd gypsum and sc can have positive effects on plant growth under salt stress they have different working mechanisms hence we hypothesize that these two soil amendments may have different efficiencies in improving plant growth under saline water irrigation if this is the case we further hypothesize that the combination of two soil amendments may be more efficient than each one alone in alleviating plant salt stress to test the two hypotheses we investigated the effects of fgd gypsum sc and their combinations the sc mixed with fgd gypsum on site and fgd gypsum co composted with sc on soil properties root nutrient uptake shoot growth plant biomass fruit yield and tomato quality under saline water irrigation the objectives of this study were 1 to compare the different efficiencies of fgd gypsum and sc if used as soil amendments under saline water irrigation and 2 to examine whether these two soil amendments have additive effects 2 materials and methods 2

significantly affected soil na and k at the 0 40 cm depth and ca2 at the 20 40 cm depth while g application influenced soil na k and ca2 at the 0 40 cm depth and mg2 at the 0 20 cm depth under saline

application under saline water irrigation especially by the combined treatments compare sw c g and sw gc vs sw fig 1c interestingly at the 0 20 cm depth the sw treatment showed significantly higher soil k as compared to other treatments except the sw g treatment in the autumn winter season fig 1d a significant increase in soil ca2 was found with the application of g at the 0 20 cm depth compared sw g sw c g and sw gc vs other treatments fig 1e although soil mg2 was not affected by saline water compare sw vs the control it was increased by the sw g and sw c g treatments compared to the sw treatment at the 0 20 cm depth in the autumn winter season fig 1f similar to soil na fig 1c the sar and esp in the active root zone 0 40 cm were also significantly enhanced by saline water compare sw

was found for soil hco3 co3 2 table 2 3 4 plant cations cation ratios and essential elements saline water significantly increased na but decreased k and ca2 in plant tissues resulting in overall reductions in both k na and ca2 na ratios compare sw vs the control fig 2 despite this these negative effects of saline water were generally alleviated by c and or g application compare all c and g related treatments vs sw fig 2 reflecting the distinct influence of c and g on plant cations and cation ratios under saline water irrigation table s4 particularly the application of c co composted with g led to the lowest na but the highest k na and ca2 na ratios when plants were irrigated with saline water compare sw gc vs other sw related treatments fig 2 within plant macronutrients only total n p and ca were significantly influenced by c and g application under saline water table s4 although these macronutrients showed overall decreased trends under saline water irrigation compare sw vs the control fig s2 these trends were generally reversed by c and g application compare all c and g related treatments vs sw fig s2 it is noteworthy that the cw gc treatment even showed significantly higher total n and ca than the control in most situations except for total n in leaves in the autumn winter season and total ca in stems in the winter spring season effects of saline water on plant micronutrients were generally not obvious except for reduced total zn in leaves in the winter spring season compare sw vs the control table s5 similarly in most situations plant micronutrients were not statistically influenced by salinity alleviation treatments as compared to the sw treatment table s5 3 5 photosynthetic indexes and chlorophyll among photosynthetic indexes photosynthesis rate showed significant reductions in both cropping seasons while intercellular co2 showed an increase in the winter spring season under saline water irrigation compare sw vs the

respect to intercellular co2 it was decreased by the sw c treatment but was increased by the sw g treatment as compared to the sw treatment in both cropping seasons table 3 a significant enhancement of stomatal conductance was found under the sw c sw g and sw gc treatments whereas a reduction of transpiration rate was found under the sw c treatment as compared to the sw treatment in the autumn winter season table 3 chlorophyll was reduced by saline water compare sw vs the control but was increased by the application of c combined with g compare sw c g and sw gc vs sw table 3 3 6 plant growth rate and biomass and fruit yield and blossom end rot the rgrs of both plant height and leaf area were generally decreased by saline water leading to overall reductions of plant biomass compare sw vs the control fig 3 however these adverse effects of saline water were generally attenuated by c and or g application especially by the c plus g combination compare sw c g and sw gc vs sw fig 3 similar trends among treatments were observed for individual fruit weight and fruit yield whereas reverse trends were found for blossom end rot fig 4 the highest fruit number was found in the sw gc treatment in both copping seasons fig 4 4 discussion generally saline water irrigation is a double edged sword for crop production because it can meet the water requirement of crops and thereby maintain crop growth di mola et al 2017 feng et al 2017 díaz et al 2018 but may also lead to reduced crop productivity after continuous application de pascale et al 2015 baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 although both fgd gypsum and straw compost have the potential to reduce salt stress and improve crop growth in salt affected soils lakhdar et al 2011 chaganti et al 2015 leogrande et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 little information is available regarding their efficiency and effectiveness under continuous saline water irrigation as we hypothesized fgd gypsum and straw compost had different efficiencies in alleviating plant salt stress moreover the combination of fgd gypsum and straw compost was more efficient than each single soil conditioner if used to enhance plant growth and crop yield under continuous saline water irrigation continuous saline water irrigation resulted in obvious adverse effects on tomato growth such as the reduction of photosynthesis rate table 3 rgr fig 3 plant biomass fig 3 and fruit yield fig 4 and the enhancement of ber fig 4 high salinity can inhibit plant growth through inducing ion toxicity osmotic stress or both zhu 2016 in general under soil conditions with ec less than 3 0 ms cm 1 ion toxicity induced mainly by na cl and so4 2 rather than osmotic stress was the predominant factor resulting in crop susceptibility to salinity chinnusamy et al 2005 in the present study therefore ion toxicity was the major factor causing salt stress in tomato plants because soil ec in the rootzone was less than 1 5 ms cm 1 during the growing period fig 1b obviously na and cl were the two major salt ions inducing ion toxicity for tomato plants under continuous saline water irrigation compare sw vs the control fig 1c and table 2 due to the significantly higher na and cl concentrations in irrigation water under the sw treatment as compared to the control similar trends were observed by several previous studies valdés et al 2014 cao et al 2016 however under continuous saline water irrigation salt ions na in particular in the active rootzone 0 20 cm were significantly decreased by fgd gypsum and or straw compost application especially by the combined treatments fig 1c this could be because the fgd gypsum caso4 can react rapidly with nacl to generate naso4 which can effectively leach from soils mao et al 2014 yu et al 2014 while straw compost can reduce the abundance of exchangeable na in the rootzone by enhancing water infiltration and salt leaching lakhdar et al 2009 leogrande and vitti 2019 this explanation is partly supported by the fact that under continuous saline water irrigation na in plant tissues was generally reduced by fgd gypsum and or straw compost application especially by the application of co composted fgd gypsum straw compare all c and g related treatments vs sw fig 2 in addition to na sar is also an important factor used to evaluate potential salinity hazard to crop growth and the sodicity hazard to soil permeability sposito and mattigod 1977 callaghana et al 2016 sattari et al 2018 since higher sar generally results in lower soil infiltration rate and thereby inhibits the leaching of salts ganjegunte et al 2017 continuous saline water irrigation can easily lead to salinity stress in plants through enhancing sar this phenomenon has been demonstrated in most crops such as potato sunﬂower sesbania maize wheat and tomato chauhan et al 2007 lashari et al 2015 soleimani et al 2017 li et al 2019 similarly in this study the sar was significantly increased by continuous saline water irrigation in both cropping seasons fig s1a despite this under continuous saline water irrigation sar in the active rootzone 0 20 cm was significantly reduced by fgd gypsum and or straw compost application fig s1a this is consistent with the results reported by mckenna et al 2019 who observed that the gypsum application could maintain a relatively low level of sar in soil solution because of the displacement of sodium by calcium our results also agree with chaganti et al 2015 who reported that compost application reduced the sar in saline sodic soils due to the enhancement of soil aggregate stability and na removal facilitated by leaching it was noted that the combination of fgd gypsum and straw compost was more efficient than each single soil conditioner in reducing soil sar fig s1a this could be due to leaching of naso4 created by the reaction between gypsum and nacl mao et al 2014 that was enhanced by increased soil water infiltration that was induced by straw compost addition lakhdar et al 2009 the improvement of soil properties e g the reduction of na and sar generally leads to the enhancement of plant growth in salt affected soils chauhan et al 2007 soleimani et al 2017 generally plant response to reduced soil na and sar is mainly reflected in the reduction of na absorption by plant tissues lashari et al 2015 li et al 2019 leading to increased k na and ca2 na ratios since both k and ca2 are required to maintain the integrity and functioning of cell membranes high k na and ca2 na ratios in plants have been suggested as two important physiological selection criteria for plant salt tolerance porcelli et al 1995 wei et al 2003 ashraf 2004 in the present study under continuous saline water irrigation the k na ratio in plant tissues was increased by both fgd gypsum and straw compost applications while the ca2 na ratio was mainly enhanced by fgd gypsum application fig 2 this fact comes as no surprise since the uptake of k and ca2 by plants is considerably reduced under soil conditions with high amounts of na ashraf 2004 which means that this adverse effect can be reversed by agricultural practices that have the potential to reduce soil na in the rootzone e g fgd gypsum and straw compost applications in this study fig 1c moreover the efficiency of gypsum in enhancing plant ca2 absorption has been sufficiently proven viator et al 2002 favaretto et al 2008 pavla et al 2017 since ca is known to play a crucial role in maintaining the stabilization of cell wall and in regulating ion transport ashraf 2004 the high ca2 na ratio plays a significant role in plant growth maintenance under salinity conditions in regard to k it was noted that straw composts gypsum or their mixtures influenced k content in both soils fig 1d and tomato plants fig 2 under saline water irrigation conditions alrajhi et al 2017 suggested that the changes in soil k could be partly attributed to the tomato crop removal of k arienzo et al 2009 showed that tomato plants have high rates of k removal about 170 kg ha 1 indicating high content of k in tomato plants in addition to k na and ca2 na ratios photosynthesis is also a major adaptive component of salt tolerance in plants ashraf 2004 under salt stress plants generally exhibit low levels of net photosynthetic rate negrão et al 2017 as expected continuous saline water irrigation resulted in significantly decreased photosynthetic rate compare sw vs the control table 3 however this adverse effect was significantly reversed by straw compost application compare c related treatments vs sw table 3 one possible explanation for this finding is that straw compost improved photosynthesis by alleviating na toxicity through the inhibition of na uptake and the maintenance of adequate k na ratios rodrigues et al 2013 additionally straw compost might also improve photosynthesis by enhancing plant growth through its beneficial effects on soil physical chemical properties e g aggregate stability porosity hydraulic conductivity and nutrient availability and biological characteristics e g microbial communities and biochemical processes leogrande and vitti 2019 there is clear evidence that soils with serious salinity problems often exhibit degraded quality e g reduced aggregate stability and decreased microbial diversity cao et al 2016 leogrande and vitti 2019 and reduced fertility e g low p availability mullen 2005 singh et al 2011 consequently under continuous saline water irrigation the application of straw compost had obvious benefits for tomato growth e g enhanced rgr and increased plant biomass and fruit yield figs 3 and 4 through enhancing overall soil properties it was noted that the incidence of ber was efficiently inhibited by the application of fgd gypsum and or straw compost especially by the combined treatments fig 4 the ber is a common physiological disorder that occurs in all the tomato producing areas of the world taylor and locascio 2004 generally ber is considered as a classic symptom of ca deficiency taylor et al 2004 since the uptake of ca2 by plants was considerably reduced under soil conditions with high amounts of na fig 2 ashraf 2004 ber was strongly enhanced under continuous saline water irrigation compare sw vs the control fig 4 as expected the total ca in plant tissues was increased by fgd gypsum related treatments fig 2 due to high contents of ca in gypsum with respect to straw compost it reduced ber fig 4 probably through decreasing the uptake of na by plants fig 2 since fgd gypsum and straw compost had different efficiencies in alleviating plant salt stress the application of co composted fgd gypsum straw resulted in the lowest ber but the highest fruit yield under saline water irrigation fig 4 5 conclusions the fgd gypsum and straw compost and could be used to alleviate plant salt stress under continuous saline water irrigation the combination of fgd gypsum and straw compost was more efficient than each single soil conditioner if used to enhance plant growth and crop yield the application of co composted fgd gypsum straw resulted in the highest fruit yield and the lowest ber under continuous saline water irrigation the enhancements of crop yield and fruit quality were closely associated with the improvement of soil quality as well as plant growth which was induced by the application of fgd gypsum and straw compost plant straw co composted with fgd gypsum can be used as an efficient soil conditioner to enhance tomato yield under continuous saline water irrigation conditions acknowledgments we are

10939,over the last two decades signs of precipitation irregularity were frequently reported across the southeastern united states us even though the region receives a relatively high annual precipitation the precipitation events are not equally distributed in the time and space hence rainfed agriculture a common practice in the region is threatened by changes in precipitation frequencies during the crop growing seasons with this situation a better understanding of the actual patterns of precipitation irregularity is needed to support the local agriculture this study uses a spatial regionalization approach to delineate precipitation regions for an area spanning the states of south carolina north carolina and georgia the data used include time series of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal numbers of precipitation events 5 mm over the period 1960 2017 a regionalization method which combines principal components and cluster analyses was applied to 208 precipitation stations selected across the study region finally three precipitation regions were delineated based on statistics and similarity criteria a comparative analysis of these three regions shows significant differences in the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal number of precipitation events in addition the differences were examined using a probabilistic approach as a result tables of probabilities and seasonal precipitation characteristics precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm were generated for each region these tables could provide information about the chances of precipitation deficits or excesses relatively to a crop and henceforth be useful for agricultural water use planning keywords agriculture precipitation irregularity regionalization probabilities climate variability 1 introduction worldwide rainfed agriculture is a very common practice which plays an important role in food and livestock production rockström et al 2010 rainfed agriculture generally depends on crops soils environment and most importantly seasonal precipitation totals and their distribution over the crop growing season however rainfed agriculture is vulnerable to climate hazards and its practice does not ensure crop yield stability rockström et al 2010 for instance when precipitation events are irregular crops are often subjected to short term water deficits which cause crop yield losses kistner et al 2018 indeed several studies reported the negative impact of short term water deficit on annual crops yields bauer et al 2009 particularly under rainfed conditions substantial yield gap values i e difference between average and yield potential are often reported as the consequence of water stress lobell et al 2009 in humid regions such as the southeastern united states us the cumulative annual precipitation totals are relatively high and virtually sufficient to grow a wide range of crops under rainfed conditions yet the sole consideration of annual precipitation amounts may shade critical patterns of precipitation irregularity during the crop growing seasons this is particularly true in the southeastern us where short term precipitation deficits are usual during the crop season mo and schemm 2008 these short term precipitation deficits are not necessarily a consequence of a decrease of the total annual or seasonal precipitation as they also seem to be a result of changes in the timely distribution of precipitation events kistner et al 2018 studies evidenced that changes of precipitation frequency and the subsequent short term water deficits reduce biomass production shorten grain filling periods and lower crop yields högy et al 2013 katerji et al 2004 therefore an understanding of precipitation patterns total amount and frequency is useful for the decision making toward crops management and yields stability the frequency of precipitation is critical in rainfed agriculture because it indicates how often the soil water is replenished by natural precipitation events during a given time slice e g month season year in general the number of precipitation events is assimilated to the number of wet days which can be defined based on a precipitation threshold unfortunately not all precipitation amounts are effective for crops rockström et al 2003 dastane 1974 hence it is important to define the frequency of precipitation events by referring to daily total thresholds for instance the threshold of 5 mm day 0 2 inch day was used in different irrigation scheduling manuals as a minimal daily water need even though the actual need depends on the crop growth stage the atmospheric water demand and the antecedent soil moisture condition curwen and massie 1994 nevertheless the 5 mm threshold has been consistently used to study the trend and effects of precipitation events goswami et al 2006 sala and lauenroth 1982 as an example mulhouse et al 2017 considered daily precipitation events of 5 mm to address vegetation response to precipitation timing our study also uses the 5 mm threshold to define and address the seasonal number of precipitation events in the southeastern us the climate of the southeastern us is humid and the region receives an annual precipitation above 1200 mm historically farmers in the southeastern us relied on natural precipitations to grow annual crops such as corn cotton soybean peanut etc however the absolute reliance on natural precipitations is nowadays threatened by cases of short term precipitation deficits occurring during crop growing seasons although these precipitation deficits often cause a decrease in crop yield rockström et al 2010 their occurrence is still very unpredictable and therefore needs research attention to improve the understanding of the occurrence and severity of short term precipitation deficits our study had the following three objectives i propose a coherent precipitation regionalization for the southeastern us ii examine the long term patterns of precipitation and iii establish a probabilistic framework to support agricultural water management 2 data and method 2 1 data the study addresses the part of the southeastern us encompassing the states of georgia ga north carolina nc and south carolina sc the study aims to regionalize the southeastern us based on the long term patterns of precipitations hence data were collected from a total of 422 land based weather stations distributed across the southeastern us fig 1 for the 422 stations all the available daily precipitation records over the period 1960 to 2017 were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s global historical climatology network noaa ghcn database menne et al 2012 it is important to note that the period 1960 to 2017 satisfies the minimum of 30 years recommended for climate studies sohoulande and singh 2016 however not all of the 422 stations have a continuous long term precipitation record out of these stations 208 stations have less than 10 data gap over the study period as shown by fig 1 the 208 stations are well distributed across the study region average 0 13 decimal degree between neighboring stations and will therefore be used in the spatial regionalization for each of the 208 stations data gaps i e missing values in daily precipitation were filled using the inversed distance weight idw average of daily precipitation data from the neighboring stations preferentially the neighboring stations used to fill data gaps for the 208 stations are stations with gaps 10 i e 214 stations in total this allowed data consistency since many of the 214 stations with gaps 10 are located at the vicinity of the stations with gaps 10 fig 1 hence 208 gap free time series of daily precipitation over the entire period 1960 to 2017 were obtained each time series was later processed to generate time series of seasonal precipitation totals and number of precipitation events 5 mm the four seasons of the year were targeted including the winter season december to february djf the spring season march to may mam the summer season june to august jja and the fall season september to november son for each station the gap free precipitation time series was used to generate separate time series of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal numbers of precipitation events 5 mm as mentioned earlier in the introduction the 5 mm threshold was used to define the seasonal number of precipitation events mulhouse et al 2017 goswami et al 2006 curwen and massie 1994 fig 2 presents the following two correlations the average annual precipitation total versus the annual frequency of precipitation events 0 mm r2 0 29 and the average annual precipitation total versus the annual frequency of precipitation events 5 mm r2 0 74 for the 208 stations the analysis of fig 2 confirms the importance of the 5 mm threshold as the frequency of the events 5 mm explains 74 of the variance of precipitation total across the southeastern us 2 2 method 2 2 1 spatial regionalization the objective of the spatial regionalization is to subdivide the southeastern us into homogeneous regions based on the long term precipitation patterns to achieve that objective the study used a regionalization method which combines principal component analysis pca with a k means cluster analysis raziei 2018 sohoulande 2018 worldwide variants of pca and cluster analysis have been developed as spatial regionalization technics for instance comrie and glenn 1998 successfully used a pca based spatial regionalization to determine precipitation regions for the southwest united states baeriswyl and rebetez 1997 used the pca technic with a varimax rotation to delineate homogenous climate regions for switzerland raziei 2018 used pca along with a cluster analysis to regionalize precipitation across iran the present study used a similar method by combining a varimax rotated pca and a k means clustering the approach is developed to identify regions based on the variability of seasonal precipitation total and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm as the number of regions to identify is initially unknown k mean clustering was appropriate because it offers the flexibility to group elements into different numbers k of clusters however for the k mean clustering to capture well the spatial variability pca is used to reduce the precipitation time series size note in this paper the term seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm refers to the absolute frequency which is also the seasonal number of precipitation events 5 mm fig 3 illustrates the spatial regionalization procedure which was applied separately to the time series of seasonal total precipitation and seasonal frequency of precipitations events 5 mm the procedure consists of two stages including the pca analysis followed with the k means clustering as mentioned in section 2 1 each of the 208 selected precipitation stations is associated with 58 years i e 232 seasons time series of seasonal precipitation total and seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm hence the precipitation data are represented as an m by n matrix where m is the number of stations m 208 and n is the size of the time series of seasonal precipitation total or frequency n 232 seasons the finality of the spatial regionalization procedure fig 3 is to group the m stations into k subsets i e cluster such that each subset corresponds to a spatial domain of high similarity of precipitation patterns i e seasonal total precipitation and number of events distinctly note the m by n matrix is two dimensional i e space and time the varimax rotated pca baeriswyl and rebetez 1997 is applied to reduce the time dimension by capturing the essential variability contained in the n seasonal observations into a fewer n number of principal components pcs the n pcs are those having their eigenvalues greater than one jolliffe 2011 kaiser 1960 each of the stations is henceforth associated with n pcs loading values and a new two dimensional m by n matrix is generated fig 3 the cluster analysis is thereafter conducted to group the m stations into k distinct subsets based on the stations pc loading values indeed cluster algorithms generally perform better when the variance contained in a large time series is captured into fewer components especially the k means clustering method is used in the study for its consistency to capture meaningful spatial patterns sohoulande 2018 however one challenge that comes out with the cluster analysis is to determine the adequate number k of subsets that express the variability of both seasonal precipitation total and frequency to overcome this challenge the cluster analysis was conducted with different values of k i e 2 3 12 for each value of k subsets of precipitation stations were identified separately based on seasonal precipitation total and frequency variability a jaccard similarity index real and vargas 1996 was estimated between the subsets resulting from the seasonal precipitation total variability and the subsets resulting from the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm the formulation of the jaccard index employed is presented by eq 1 the k corresponding to the highest similarity is retained and the related subsets of precipitation stations were considered to delineate k precipitation regions within the southeastern us 1 j a c c a r d i n d e x a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a k b k a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a k b k where a1 a2 ak stands for the k subsets of precipitation stations identified based on seasonal precipitation totals b1 b2 bk represents the k subsets of precipitation stations identified based on seasonal frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm 2 2 2 statistics and probability analyses statistics and probability analyses were used to examine the physical meaning of the outcomes of the spatial regionalization for each of the k delineated regions the encompassed precipitation stations were considered and the time series of their seasonal precipitation characteristics i e total precipitation and frequency of precipitation events 5 mm were analyzed a pair wise student s t test was conducted to compare the average values of precipitation characteristics among the delineated regions especially for the average values comparison the raw precipitation data were first normalized and for each seasonal precipitation value x k i a z score jain et al 2005 was calculated using the eq 2 where μ and σ are respectively the pooled mean and standard deviation of the study region in lieu of the raw precipitation data the z scores were used to conduct the pair wise student s t test 2 z s c o r e x k i x k i μ σ a mann kendall trend analysis yue et al 2002 was also conducted on the seasonal precipitation time series and the kendall s τ statistics were evaluated given the seasonal or annual precipitation

precipitation and time respectively ties are any set of identical values in the time series uλ and vθ are respectively the numbers of elements in the λ tie of precipitation variable and θ tie in the time variable a probabilistic assessment was conducted to determine the probability of occurrence of different ranges of precipitation totals and frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm the probability analyses focused on each of the delineated precipitation regions the weather stations encompassed by each region were pooled in the same group then the seasonal precipitation data i e precipitation totals and number of precipitation events 5 mm were addressed separately the analyses were also conducted on the annual time scale ann for each delineated precipitation region and each season the corresponding precipitation data were fitted to a probability distribution model the probability density function pdf of seasonal precipitation total data were found to follow the gamma distribution see eq 6 while the pdf of annual precipitation total followed the lognormal distribution see eq 7 however the pdf of seasonal and annual number of precipitation events 5 mm fitted the normal distribution see eq 8 6 f x α β 1 β α γ α x α 1 exp x β 7 f y 1 σ y 2 π exp 1 2 y μ y σ y 2 w i t h y ln x 8 f x 1 σ x 2 π exp 1 2 y μ x σ x 2 where x is a random precipitation value i e

normal pdf are μx and σx which equal respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the precipitation data the lognormal pdf parameters μy and σy which equal respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the logarithmic transformation of precipitation data 3 results 3 1 principal components and cluster analysis the pca conducted on the seasonal precipitation total and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm yielded respectively 19 pcs and 15 pcs with an eigen value greater than one after the varimax rotation the 19 pcs obtained from the seasonal precipitation total captured 84 of the total variability in the time series while the 15 pcs obtained from the seasonal number of precipitation events 5 mm captured 80 of the variability the original m by n i e 208 232 matrix of precipitation data yielded respectively a 208 19 and a 208 15 matrix of pcs loading values the k means clustering was carried out on each of these matrixes using successively k 2 k 3 k 12 the clusters obtained with the different k values were considered to compute the jaccard index the results of the cluster analysis and the jaccard similarity evaluation is reported by table 1 with k 3 the jaccard index indicates a 90 similarity between the clusters i e groups of precipitation stations obtained based on seasonal precipitation total and the clusters obtained based on seasonal precipitation events 5 mm the high similarity value suggests the consistency of the clusters to represents both the seasonal precipitation total and the frequency of precipitation events within the studied region in the southeastern us 3 2 delineated precipitation regions and land resources areas fig 4 a presents the distribution of the precipitation stations associated with each of the 3 clusters for individual clusters the corresponding stations virtually span a continuous spatial domain hence three major precipitation regions were delineated including region 1 based on cluster 1 region 2 based on cluster 2 and region 3 based on cluster 3 the three precipitations regions cover distinctly the southern area region 1 the northwest area region 2 and the northeast area of the southeastern us fig 4b presents an overlay of the delineated precipitation regions on the land resources area of the southeastern us as developed by the natural resources conservation service of the u s department of agriculture usda nrcs 2006 the land resource areas of the southeastern us vary from the coast to the inland hence region 1 and region 3 share similar land resource areas including the tidewater area the atlantic coast flatwoods the southern coastal plain the sand hills and a part of the southern piedmont however region 2 spans a different configuration of land resources as it encompasses the southern piedmont the southern blue ridge the appalachian ridges and valleys and accessorily the sand mountain in the southeastern us precipitations are influenced by factors such as the north atlantic subtropical high the el niño southern oscillation topography wind circulations etc li et al 2012 dixon and mote 2003 the presence of the blue ridge mountains in the northwest area is likely to affect precipitation in region 2 see southern blue ridge s land resource area in fig 4b virtually the results of the spatial regionalization have somewhat captured the complexity of the factors affecting precipitation variability in the southeastern us engström and waylen 2018 li et al 2012 thus next section will provide further insights into the delineated precipitation regions 3 3 interregional analysis of precipitation patterns fig 5 presents the variability of the annual precipitation total and the annual frequency of precipitation events 5 mm across the southeastern us a comparison of both fig 5a and 5b shows a clear differentiation between region 2 on one side region 1 and 3 on the other side compared to region 1 and region 3 region 2 is relatively moist the high precipitation observed in region 2 may be attributed in part to the presence of the blue ridge mountains in the northwest area see fig 4b analyses were performed on the time series of the seasonal precipitation totals and the frequency of events 5 mm for each delineated region the seasonal precipitation data of the corresponding stations were equally averaged for individual years over the period 1960 2017 the 58 years time series of djf mam jja son and annual precipitation total and frequency of precipitation events 5 mm were obtained for each region table 2 reports the pair wise student s t test of the mean of the z scores of precipitation characteristics the results of the t statistics indicate that the annual values of precipitation in region 2 is significantly higher than the values in region 1 and 3 this confirms the patterns described in fig 5 however an analysis of the seasonal precipitation data shows that region 1 and 3 are moister than region 2 during jja yet the tendency is different during mam as region 2 receives a higher amount of precipitation compared to region 1 and 2 this contrast within seasons may find an explanation in the mechanisms controlling moisture circulation in the southeastern us table 3 reports the mann kendall trend analysis of seasonal precipitation total and frequency of events 5 mm even though few of the computed kendall s τ statistics were significant at p value 0 05 it is difficult to establish a coherent connection between the trend of seasonal precipitation total and the trend of the seasonal number of precipitation events 5 mm however the weakness of these trend does not rule out the consistency of the student s t statistics reported in table 2 yet the physical meaning of these statistics may be relevant to include the delineated precipitation regions in decision making for a better agricultural water management 3 4 precipitation regions and rain fed agriculture despite the high variability of precipitations in the southeastern us li et al 2012 and the related risks of yields instability the transition from rainfed to a water controlled agriculture is still slow across the region indeed the usda s national agricultural statistics services reported that the total irrigated lands in north carolina south carolina and georgia during 2012 represented respectively 2 9 6 8 and 28 6 of the total croplands across each of the listed state usda nass 2014 even though the percentage of irrigated lands differs state wise north carolina south carolina and georgia have in common a certain number of crops with similar agricultural calendars table 4 illustrates the extended growing season for different crops including corn cotton peanuts and soybean as reported by usda nass 2010 for each of these crops the regularity of precipitations during spring mam summer jja and fall son is desirable to ensure a stable yield fig 6 illustrates the contrasts of seasonal precipitation patterns among region 1 2 and 3 note fig 6 presents the average values of the seasonal precipitation totals and the frequency of precipitation events 5 mm as reported in table 3 in practice the use of average tendencies in decision making is often considered as a default especially in agricultural water management making decisions on a crop calendar based on average precipitation values may sound superficial due to the lack of information on the risk level instead the use a probabilistic information on seasonal precipitation patterns seems more comprehensive as it informs decision makers on the different risk levels 3 5 probability of seasonal precipitation probability analyses of the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm were conducted separately for the seasons djf mam jja and son the analyses were based on the procedure described in section 2 2 2 for individual precipitation region the 58 years of precipitation data from the corresponding stations were pooled and fitted to a probability density function table 5 and 6 report the pdf of the seasonal precipitation totals and frequencies in each of the delineated precipitation regions i e region 1 2 and 3 fig 7 and 8 portray the pdf of seasonal and annual precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm note the graphs in fig 7 and 8 are created using estimates of discrete probabilities for increments of 10 mm within the range of total precipitation and 1 event within the range of the number of precipitation events 5 mm the disparity of shape of the graphs in fig 7 suggests significant inequalities of the probabilities of seasonal precipitation patterns within the precipitation regions from fig 8a one may notice that pdf of the annual precipitation total in region 1 and 3 are similar however this similitude does not mean that the seasonal precipitation patterns are alike for these two precipitation regions indeed the pdf of seasonal precipitation fig 7 shows critical discrepancies between region 1 and region 3 fig 7 this example of contrast reinforces the importance of the consideration of the seasonal patterns in this study using the inverse cumulative probability density functions seasonal precipitation values were estimated for different values of probability of exceedance table 7 and 8 summarize the probabilities of receiving annually a certain minimum of seasonal precipitation at any given location of each precipitation region an example for reading the values in table 7 and 8 is provided as a footnote for each region table 7 and 8 report precipitation values along with their probability of exceedance compare to the simple average value the inclusion of the values reports in table 7 and 8 could help improve decision making for agricultural water management in each precipitation region 4 synthesis discussion and application the study analyzed precipitation patterns across the southeastern us of the united states and outlined implications for agricultural water management the analyses used 58 years i e period 1960 to 2017 daily precipitation data obtained from 208 synoptic stations distributed across the southeastern us the yearly seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son were considered to generate time series of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal numbers of precipitation events 5 mm a spatial regionalization method was developed to identify precipitation regions with high similarity the regionalization method uses pca with a varimax rotation in combination with a k means cluster analysis the spatial regionalization was distinctly conducted on the precipitation totals data and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm data an analysis of jaccard similarity index was considered to identify the configuration of clusters which reflects at the same time the variability of the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm in total three precipitation regions were delineated across the southeastern us region 1 spans the south part of the southeastern us while region 2 and region 3 span respectively the northwest and the northeast parts a statistical analysis of the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm shows significant differences between the three regions especially based on the annual precipitation analysis region 2 is found more humid compared to region 1 and 3 however this difference does not reflect likewise during the different seasons of the year as region 1 and 3 appeared more humid than region 2 during the summer season jja whereas region 2 receives more precipitation during the spring season mam this contrast of precipitation patterns may be partially explained by the diverse mechanisms controlling precipitation in the southeastern us li et al 2012 dixon and mote 2003 for instance the fact that region 2 receives more precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm can be somewhat linked to the orographic influence of the blue ridge mountains konrad 1996 beside this orographic effect precipitation in the southeastern us is highly influenced by complex mechanisms which take place seasonally katz et al 2003 this is true with the north atlantic subtropical high which is the main driver of summer jja precipitation in the southeastern us li et al 2012 the north atlantic subtropical high is a system of fronts cold polar air colliding with warm subtropical air which moves northward during jja at its landfall the north atlantic subtropical high landfalls brings precipitations which decrease as it extends from the coast toward the continent this explains the disparity observed during jja as the region 1 and 3 which are coastal receives higher amounts of precipitation compared to region 2 however the orographic influence on precipitation in region 2 is relatively more perceptible during the spring season mam regardless of these differences among the precipitation regions the southeastern us encompasses various land resources which annually receives enough precipitation to grow different types of crops under a rainfed condition crop yields are often affected by the seasonal variability of precipitation rockström et al 2010 in the southeastern us the practice of rainfed agriculture is very common but recent signals of precipitation irregularity have raised the debate on transiting toward a water controlled agriculture system indeed it is difficult to maintain stable crop yields in a situation of precipitation irregularity kistner et al 2018 lobell et al 2009 instead the inclusion of irrigation system is likely to suppress potential yield decreases caused by water stress however irrigation systems represent an important financial investment and many farmers are doubtful on the related opportunity cost this context probably justifies the low rates of irrigated crop lands particularly in north and south carolina 2 9 and 6 8 based on usda nass 2013 statistics however it is evident that changes in precipitation patterns exposes the rainfed agriculture to significant yield losses the probability assessment conducted in this study is a timely contribution as it provides insights into the exceedance probabilities for different values of seasonal total precipitation and seasonal frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm in each of the precipitation regions of the southeastern us indeed decision making based on probabilistic values are more effective than a simple consideration of average tendencies this tables of probabilities generated in this study may help water resources managers and farmers to better understands precipitation patterns in their regions and probably consider the information to enhance their water management practices in this paragraph we provide an example to illustrate the applicability of the probability tables the example uses data from a water use efficiency study conducted by stone et al 2016 as they grew corn zea mays under a conservation tillage in florence south carolina corn was grown for three consecutive years i e 2012 to 2014 however this example emphasizes data for year 2014 which showed an average water use efficiency of 24 kg grain ha mm for corn dekalb dkc66 97 grown in a condition where a supplement irrigation was applied based on measurements of soil water potential indicated stone et al 2016 the experimental conditions and the management practices associated with the example are explicitly reported by stone et al 2016 an average grain yield of 13 5 tons ha was obtained while the crop received during jja a total water of 394 6 mm rainfall 242 2 mm irrigation 152 4 mm assuming in this case the total jja water supply being the limiting factor for the corn yield the probability to maintain that level of corn yield while relying on rainfall only would be 0 45 in region 1 0 32 in region 2 and 0 43 in region 3 however these probabilities would increase to 0 89 in region 1 0 77 in region 2 and 0 88 in region 3 when one considers applying a supplement irrigation of 152 4 mm to compensate the moisture deficit this type of interpretation may be used by crops advisors and extension services to apprehend the exposure of rainfed crops to water stress and the relevance of opting for a supplement irrigation yet an extensive crop database is needed to envision a broad use of such probabilistic tool hence future studies are encouraged to build on the present results by developing a convenient gis based crop advisory tool which would integrate precipitation probabilities and crops databases for the southeastern region of the us 5 conclusion under rainfed systems lobell et al 2009 indicated that crop yields are in average 50 or less below yield potentials due to water stress although this tendency is global it presumes room for improving yields in regions dominated by rainfed agriculture practices such as the southeastern us indeed several studies supported the possibility of ceiling yield potential with supplement irrigation van ittersum et al 2013 grassini et al 2011 however yield gaps vary consistently from one region to another same as the precipitation patterns suggesting potential time space scale effects sohoulande et al 2019 lobell 2013 therefore an understanding of the regional precipitation patterns is needed to envision better rainfed agricultural practices this study used 58 years precipitation data from 208 stations across the southeastern us and providing the following three major key findings i three precipitation regions are delineated for the southeastern us each precipitation region encompasses locations with high similarity of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm over the period 1960 2017 ii statistics on precipitation characteristics confirmed the spatial variability of precipitation across the southeastern us for the three regions delineated in the study iii probability tables were developed for seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm potential uses of these outcomes in the decision making for agricultural water management were discussed for instance the probability analysis reported different values of seasonal precipitation values and their probabilities of exceedance in each of the three precipitation regions however the spatial area covered by each precipitation region is relatively large to miss local climate variability hence this research may be extended by developing a comprehensive and site specific assessment of seasonal precipitation in the southeastern us further research is needed to create a gis interface which provides point based values of season precipitation totals seasonal number of precipitation events and the related probabilities of occurrence having these values at a given location can help to make the decision on whether to grow a specific crop under a rainfed condition or consider a water controlled option such as a supplement irrigation stone et al 2015 disclaimer mention of trade names or

10939,over the last two decades signs of precipitation irregularity were frequently reported across the southeastern united states us even though the region receives a relatively high annual precipitation the precipitation events are not equally distributed in the time and space hence rainfed agriculture a common practice in the region is threatened by changes in precipitation frequencies during the crop growing seasons with this situation a better understanding of the actual patterns of precipitation irregularity is needed to support the local agriculture this study uses a spatial regionalization approach to delineate precipitation regions for an area spanning the states of south carolina north carolina and georgia the data used include time series of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal numbers of precipitation events 5 mm over the period 1960 2017 a regionalization method which combines principal components and cluster analyses was applied to 208 precipitation stations selected across the study region finally three precipitation regions were delineated based on statistics and similarity criteria a comparative analysis of these three regions shows significant differences in the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal number of precipitation events in addition the differences were examined using a probabilistic approach as a result tables of probabilities and seasonal precipitation characteristics precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm were generated for each region these tables could provide information about the chances of precipitation deficits or excesses relatively to a crop and henceforth be useful for agricultural water use planning keywords agriculture precipitation irregularity regionalization probabilities climate variability 1 introduction worldwide rainfed agriculture is a very common practice which plays an important role in food and livestock production rockström et al 2010 rainfed agriculture generally depends on crops soils environment and most importantly seasonal precipitation totals and their distribution over the crop growing season however rainfed agriculture is vulnerable to climate hazards and its practice does not ensure crop yield stability rockström et al 2010 for instance when precipitation events are irregular crops are often subjected to short term water deficits which cause crop yield losses kistner et al 2018 indeed several studies reported the negative impact of short term water deficit on annual crops yields bauer et al 2009 particularly under rainfed conditions substantial yield gap values i e difference between average and yield potential are often reported as the consequence of water stress lobell et al 2009 in humid regions such as the southeastern united states us the cumulative annual precipitation totals are relatively high and virtually sufficient to grow a wide range of crops under rainfed conditions yet the sole consideration of annual precipitation amounts may shade critical patterns of precipitation irregularity during the crop growing seasons this is particularly true in the southeastern us where short term precipitation deficits are usual during the crop season mo and schemm 2008 these short term precipitation deficits are not necessarily a consequence of a decrease of the total annual or seasonal precipitation as they also seem to be a result of changes in the timely distribution of precipitation events kistner et al 2018 studies evidenced that changes of precipitation frequency and the subsequent short term water deficits reduce biomass production shorten grain filling periods and lower crop yields högy et al 2013 katerji et al 2004 therefore an understanding of precipitation patterns total amount and frequency is useful for the decision making toward crops management and yields stability the frequency of precipitation is critical in rainfed agriculture because it indicates how often the soil water is replenished by natural precipitation events during a given time slice e g month season year in general the number of precipitation events is assimilated to the number of wet days which can be defined based on a precipitation threshold unfortunately not all precipitation amounts are effective for crops rockström et al 2003 dastane 1974 hence it is important to define the frequency of precipitation events by referring to daily total thresholds for instance the threshold of 5 mm day 0 2 inch day was used in different irrigation scheduling manuals as a minimal daily water need even though the actual need depends on the crop growth stage the atmospheric water demand and the antecedent soil moisture condition curwen and massie 1994 nevertheless the 5 mm threshold has been consistently used to study the trend and effects of precipitation events goswami et al 2006 sala and lauenroth 1982 as an example mulhouse et al 2017 considered daily precipitation events of 5 mm to address vegetation response to precipitation timing our study also uses the 5 mm threshold to define and address the seasonal number of precipitation events in the southeastern us the climate of the southeastern us is humid and the region receives an annual precipitation above 1200 mm historically farmers in the southeastern us relied on natural precipitations to grow annual crops such as corn cotton soybean peanut etc however the absolute reliance on natural precipitations is nowadays threatened by cases of short term precipitation deficits occurring during crop growing seasons although these precipitation deficits often cause a decrease in crop yield rockström et al 2010 their occurrence is still very unpredictable and therefore needs research attention to improve the understanding of the occurrence and severity of short term precipitation deficits our study had the following three objectives i propose a coherent precipitation regionalization for the southeastern us ii examine the long term patterns of precipitation and iii establish a probabilistic framework to support agricultural water management 2 data and method 2 1 data the study addresses the part of the southeastern us encompassing the states of georgia ga north carolina nc and south carolina sc the study aims to regionalize the southeastern us based on the long term patterns of precipitations hence data were collected from a total of 422 land based weather stations distributed across the southeastern us fig 1 for the 422 stations all the available daily precipitation records over the period 1960 to 2017 were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s global historical climatology network noaa ghcn database menne et al 2012 it is important to note that the period 1960 to 2017 satisfies the minimum of 30 years recommended for climate studies sohoulande and singh 2016 however not all of the 422 stations have a continuous long term precipitation record out of these stations 208 stations have less than 10 data gap over the study period as shown by fig 1 the 208 stations are well distributed across the study region average 0 13 decimal degree between neighboring stations and will therefore be used in the spatial regionalization for each of the 208 stations data gaps i e missing values in daily precipitation were filled using the inversed distance weight idw average of daily precipitation data from the neighboring stations preferentially the neighboring stations used to fill data gaps for the 208 stations are stations with gaps 10 i e 214 stations in total this allowed data consistency since many of the 214 stations with gaps 10 are located at the vicinity of the stations with gaps 10 fig 1 hence 208 gap free time series of daily precipitation over the entire period 1960 to 2017 were obtained each time series was later processed to generate time series of seasonal precipitation totals and number of precipitation events 5 mm the four seasons of the year were targeted including the winter season december to february djf the spring season march to may mam the summer season june to august jja and the fall season september to november son for each station the gap free precipitation time series was used to generate separate time series of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal numbers of precipitation events 5 mm as mentioned earlier in the introduction the 5 mm threshold was used to define the seasonal number of precipitation events mulhouse et al 2017 goswami et al 2006 curwen and massie 1994 fig 2 presents the following two correlations the average annual precipitation total versus the annual frequency of precipitation events 0 mm r2 0 29 and the average annual precipitation total versus the annual frequency of precipitation events 5 mm r2 0 74 for the 208 stations the analysis of fig 2 confirms the importance of the 5 mm threshold as the frequency of the events 5 mm explains 74 of the variance of precipitation total across the southeastern us 2 2 method 2 2 1 spatial regionalization the objective of the spatial regionalization is to subdivide the southeastern us into homogeneous regions based on the long term precipitation patterns to achieve that objective the study used a regionalization method which combines principal component analysis pca with a k means cluster analysis raziei 2018 sohoulande 2018 worldwide variants of pca and cluster analysis have been developed as spatial regionalization technics for instance comrie and glenn 1998 successfully used a pca based spatial regionalization to determine precipitation regions for the southwest united states baeriswyl and rebetez 1997 used the pca technic with a varimax rotation to delineate homogenous climate regions for switzerland raziei 2018 used pca along with a cluster analysis to regionalize precipitation across iran the present study used a similar method by combining a varimax rotated pca and a k means clustering the approach is developed to identify regions based on the variability of seasonal precipitation total and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm as the number of regions to identify is initially unknown k mean clustering was appropriate because it offers the flexibility to group elements into different numbers k of clusters however for the k mean clustering to capture well the spatial variability pca is used to reduce the precipitation time series size note in this paper the term seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm refers to the absolute frequency which is also the seasonal number of precipitation events 5 mm fig 3 illustrates the spatial regionalization procedure which was applied separately to the time series of seasonal total precipitation and seasonal frequency of precipitations events 5 mm the procedure consists of two stages including the pca analysis followed with the k means clustering as mentioned in section 2 1 each of the 208 selected precipitation stations is associated with 58 years i e 232 seasons time series of seasonal precipitation total and seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm hence the precipitation data are represented as an m by n matrix where m is the number of stations m 208 and n is the size of the time series of seasonal precipitation total or frequency n 232 seasons the finality of the spatial regionalization procedure fig 3 is to group the m stations into k subsets i e cluster such that each subset corresponds to a spatial domain of high similarity of precipitation patterns i e seasonal total precipitation and number of events distinctly note the m by n matrix is two dimensional i e space and time the varimax rotated pca baeriswyl and rebetez 1997 is applied to reduce the time dimension by capturing the essential variability contained in the n seasonal observations into a fewer n number of principal components pcs the n pcs are those having their eigenvalues greater than one jolliffe 2011 kaiser 1960 each of the stations is henceforth associated with n pcs loading values and a new two dimensional m by n matrix is generated fig 3 the cluster analysis is thereafter conducted to group the m stations into k distinct subsets based on the stations pc loading values indeed cluster algorithms generally perform better when the variance contained in a large time series is captured into fewer components especially the k means clustering method is used in the study for its consistency to capture meaningful spatial patterns sohoulande 2018 however one challenge that comes out with the cluster analysis is to determine the adequate number k of subsets that express the variability of both seasonal precipitation total and frequency to overcome this challenge the cluster analysis was conducted with different values of k i e 2 3 12 for each value of k subsets of precipitation stations were identified separately based on seasonal precipitation total and frequency variability a jaccard similarity index real and vargas 1996 was estimated between the subsets resulting from the seasonal precipitation total variability and the subsets resulting from the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm the formulation of the jaccard index employed is presented by eq 1 the k corresponding to the highest similarity is retained and the related subsets of precipitation stations were considered to delineate k precipitation regions within the southeastern us 1 j a c c a r d i n d e x a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a k b k a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a k b k where a1 a2 ak stands for the k subsets of precipitation stations identified based on seasonal precipitation totals b1 b2 bk represents the k subsets of precipitation stations identified based on seasonal frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm 2 2 2 statistics and probability analyses statistics and probability analyses were used to examine the physical meaning of the outcomes of the spatial regionalization for each of the k delineated regions the encompassed precipitation stations were considered and the time series of their seasonal precipitation characteristics i e total precipitation and frequency of precipitation events 5 mm were analyzed a pair wise student s t test was conducted to compare the average values of precipitation characteristics among the delineated regions especially for the average values comparison the raw precipitation data were first normalized and for each seasonal precipitation value x k i a z score jain et al 2005 was calculated using the eq 2 where μ and σ are respectively the pooled mean and standard deviation of the study region in lieu of the raw precipitation data the z scores were used to conduct the pair wise student s t test 2 z s c o r e x k i x k i μ σ a mann kendall trend analysis yue et al 2002 was also conducted on the seasonal precipitation time series and the kendall s τ statistics were evaluated given the seasonal or annual precipitation

precipitation and time respectively ties are any set of identical values in the time series uλ and vθ are respectively the numbers of elements in the λ tie of precipitation variable and θ tie in the time variable a probabilistic assessment was conducted to determine the probability of occurrence of different ranges of precipitation totals and frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm the probability analyses focused on each of the delineated precipitation regions the weather stations encompassed by each region were pooled in the same group then the seasonal precipitation data i e precipitation totals and number of precipitation events 5 mm were addressed separately the analyses were also conducted on the annual time scale ann for each delineated precipitation region and each season the corresponding precipitation data were fitted to a probability distribution model the probability density function pdf of seasonal precipitation total data were found to follow the gamma distribution see eq 6 while the pdf of annual precipitation total followed the lognormal distribution see eq 7 however the pdf of seasonal and annual number of precipitation events 5 mm fitted the normal distribution see eq 8 6 f x α β 1 β α γ α x α 1 exp x β 7 f y 1 σ y 2 π exp 1 2 y μ y σ y 2 w i t h y ln x 8 f x 1 σ x 2 π exp 1 2 y μ x σ x 2 where x is a random precipitation value i e

normal pdf are μx and σx which equal respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the precipitation data the lognormal pdf parameters μy and σy which equal respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the logarithmic transformation of precipitation data 3 results 3 1 principal components and cluster analysis the pca conducted on the seasonal precipitation total and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm yielded respectively 19 pcs and 15 pcs with an eigen value greater than one after the varimax rotation the 19 pcs obtained from the seasonal precipitation total captured 84 of the total variability in the time series while the 15 pcs obtained from the seasonal number of precipitation events 5 mm captured 80 of the variability the original m by n i e 208 232 matrix of precipitation data yielded respectively a 208 19 and a 208 15 matrix of pcs loading values the k means clustering was carried out on each of these matrixes using successively k 2 k 3 k 12 the clusters obtained with the different k values were considered to compute the jaccard index the results of the cluster analysis and the jaccard similarity evaluation is reported by table 1 with k 3 the jaccard index indicates a 90 similarity between the clusters i e groups of precipitation stations obtained based on seasonal precipitation total and the clusters obtained based on seasonal precipitation events 5 mm the high similarity value suggests the consistency of the clusters to represents both the seasonal precipitation total and the frequency of precipitation events within the studied region in the southeastern us 3 2 delineated precipitation regions and land resources areas fig 4 a presents the distribution of the precipitation stations associated with each of the 3 clusters for individual clusters the corresponding stations virtually span a continuous spatial domain hence three major precipitation regions were delineated including region 1 based on cluster 1 region 2 based on cluster 2 and region 3 based on cluster 3 the three precipitations regions cover distinctly the southern area region 1 the northwest area region 2 and the northeast area of the southeastern us fig 4b presents an overlay of the delineated precipitation regions on the land resources area of the southeastern us as developed by the natural resources conservation service of the u s department of agriculture usda nrcs 2006 the land resource areas of the southeastern us vary from the coast to the inland hence region 1 and region 3 share similar land resource areas including the tidewater area the atlantic coast flatwoods the southern coastal plain the sand hills and a part of the southern piedmont however region 2 spans a different configuration of land resources as it encompasses the southern piedmont the southern blue ridge the appalachian ridges and valleys and accessorily the sand mountain in the southeastern us precipitations are influenced by factors such as the north atlantic subtropical high the el niño southern oscillation topography wind circulations etc li et al 2012 dixon and mote 2003 the presence of the blue ridge mountains in the northwest area is likely to affect precipitation in region 2 see southern blue ridge s land resource area in fig 4b virtually the results of the spatial regionalization have somewhat captured the complexity of the factors affecting precipitation variability in the southeastern us engström and waylen 2018 li et al 2012 thus next section will provide further insights into the delineated precipitation regions 3 3 interregional analysis of precipitation patterns fig 5 presents the variability of the annual precipitation total and the annual frequency of precipitation events 5 mm across the southeastern us a comparison of both fig 5a and 5b shows a clear differentiation between region 2 on one side region 1 and 3 on the other side compared to region 1 and region 3 region 2 is relatively moist the high precipitation observed in region 2 may be attributed in part to the presence of the blue ridge mountains in the northwest area see fig 4b analyses were performed on the time series of the seasonal precipitation totals and the frequency of events 5 mm for each delineated region the seasonal precipitation data of the corresponding stations were equally averaged for individual years over the period 1960 2017 the 58 years time series of djf mam jja son and annual precipitation total and frequency of precipitation events 5 mm were obtained for each region table 2 reports the pair wise student s t test of the mean of the z scores of precipitation characteristics the results of the t statistics indicate that the annual values of precipitation in region 2 is significantly higher than the values in region 1 and 3 this confirms the patterns described in fig 5 however an analysis of the seasonal precipitation data shows that region 1 and 3 are moister than region 2 during jja yet the tendency is different during mam as region 2 receives a higher amount of precipitation compared to region 1 and 2 this contrast within seasons may find an explanation in the mechanisms controlling moisture circulation in the southeastern us table 3 reports the mann kendall trend analysis of seasonal precipitation total and frequency of events 5 mm even though few of the computed kendall s τ statistics were significant at p value 0 05 it is difficult to establish a coherent connection between the trend of seasonal precipitation total and the trend of the seasonal number of precipitation events 5 mm however the weakness of these trend does not rule out the consistency of the student s t statistics reported in table 2 yet the physical meaning of these statistics may be relevant to include the delineated precipitation regions in decision making for a better agricultural water management 3 4 precipitation regions and rain fed agriculture despite the high variability of precipitations in the southeastern us li et al 2012 and the related risks of yields instability the transition from rainfed to a water controlled agriculture is still slow across the region indeed the usda s national agricultural statistics services reported that the total irrigated lands in north carolina south carolina and georgia during 2012 represented respectively 2 9 6 8 and 28 6 of the total croplands across each of the listed state usda nass 2014 even though the percentage of irrigated lands differs state wise north carolina south carolina and georgia have in common a certain number of crops with similar agricultural calendars table 4 illustrates the extended growing season for different crops including corn cotton peanuts and soybean as reported by usda nass 2010 for each of these crops the regularity of precipitations during spring mam summer jja and fall son is desirable to ensure a stable yield fig 6 illustrates the contrasts of seasonal precipitation patterns among region 1 2 and 3 note fig 6 presents the average values of the seasonal precipitation totals and the frequency of precipitation events 5 mm as reported in table 3 in practice the use of average tendencies in decision making is often considered as a default especially in agricultural water management making decisions on a crop calendar based on average precipitation values may sound superficial due to the lack of information on the risk level instead the use a probabilistic information on seasonal precipitation patterns seems more comprehensive as it informs decision makers on the different risk levels 3 5 probability of seasonal precipitation probability analyses of the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm were conducted separately for the seasons djf mam jja and son the analyses were based on the procedure described in section 2 2 2 for individual precipitation region the 58 years of precipitation data from the corresponding stations were pooled and fitted to a probability density function table 5 and 6 report the pdf of the seasonal precipitation totals and frequencies in each of the delineated precipitation regions i e region 1 2 and 3 fig 7 and 8 portray the pdf of seasonal and annual precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm note the graphs in fig 7 and 8 are created using estimates of discrete probabilities for increments of 10 mm within the range of total precipitation and 1 event within the range of the number of precipitation events 5 mm the disparity of shape of the graphs in fig 7 suggests significant inequalities of the probabilities of seasonal precipitation patterns within the precipitation regions from fig 8a one may notice that pdf of the annual precipitation total in region 1 and 3 are similar however this similitude does not mean that the seasonal precipitation patterns are alike for these two precipitation regions indeed the pdf of seasonal precipitation fig 7 shows critical discrepancies between region 1 and region 3 fig 7 this example of contrast reinforces the importance of the consideration of the seasonal patterns in this study using the inverse cumulative probability density functions seasonal precipitation values were estimated for different values of probability of exceedance table 7 and 8 summarize the probabilities of receiving annually a certain minimum of seasonal precipitation at any given location of each precipitation region an example for reading the values in table 7 and 8 is provided as a footnote for each region table 7 and 8 report precipitation values along with their probability of exceedance compare to the simple average value the inclusion of the values reports in table 7 and 8 could help improve decision making for agricultural water management in each precipitation region 4 synthesis discussion and application the study analyzed precipitation patterns across the southeastern us of the united states and outlined implications for agricultural water management the analyses used 58 years i e period 1960 to 2017 daily precipitation data obtained from 208 synoptic stations distributed across the southeastern us the yearly seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son were considered to generate time series of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal numbers of precipitation events 5 mm a spatial regionalization method was developed to identify precipitation regions with high similarity the regionalization method uses pca with a varimax rotation in combination with a k means cluster analysis the spatial regionalization was distinctly conducted on the precipitation totals data and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm data an analysis of jaccard similarity index was considered to identify the configuration of clusters which reflects at the same time the variability of the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm in total three precipitation regions were delineated across the southeastern us region 1 spans the south part of the southeastern us while region 2 and region 3 span respectively the northwest and the northeast parts a statistical analysis of the seasonal precipitation totals and the seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm shows significant differences between the three regions especially based on the annual precipitation analysis region 2 is found more humid compared to region 1 and 3 however this difference does not reflect likewise during the different seasons of the year as region 1 and 3 appeared more humid than region 2 during the summer season jja whereas region 2 receives more precipitation during the spring season mam this contrast of precipitation patterns may be partially explained by the diverse mechanisms controlling precipitation in the southeastern us li et al 2012 dixon and mote 2003 for instance the fact that region 2 receives more precipitation totals and number of events 5 mm can be somewhat linked to the orographic influence of the blue ridge mountains konrad 1996 beside this orographic effect precipitation in the southeastern us is highly influenced by complex mechanisms which take place seasonally katz et al 2003 this is true with the north atlantic subtropical high which is the main driver of summer jja precipitation in the southeastern us li et al 2012 the north atlantic subtropical high is a system of fronts cold polar air colliding with warm subtropical air which moves northward during jja at its landfall the north atlantic subtropical high landfalls brings precipitations which decrease as it extends from the coast toward the continent this explains the disparity observed during jja as the region 1 and 3 which are coastal receives higher amounts of precipitation compared to region 2 however the orographic influence on precipitation in region 2 is relatively more perceptible during the spring season mam regardless of these differences among the precipitation regions the southeastern us encompasses various land resources which annually receives enough precipitation to grow different types of crops under a rainfed condition crop yields are often affected by the seasonal variability of precipitation rockström et al 2010 in the southeastern us the practice of rainfed agriculture is very common but recent signals of precipitation irregularity have raised the debate on transiting toward a water controlled agriculture system indeed it is difficult to maintain stable crop yields in a situation of precipitation irregularity kistner et al 2018 lobell et al 2009 instead the inclusion of irrigation system is likely to suppress potential yield decreases caused by water stress however irrigation systems represent an important financial investment and many farmers are doubtful on the related opportunity cost this context probably justifies the low rates of irrigated crop lands particularly in north and south carolina 2 9 and 6 8 based on usda nass 2013 statistics however it is evident that changes in precipitation patterns exposes the rainfed agriculture to significant yield losses the probability assessment conducted in this study is a timely contribution as it provides insights into the exceedance probabilities for different values of seasonal total precipitation and seasonal frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm in each of the precipitation regions of the southeastern us indeed decision making based on probabilistic values are more effective than a simple consideration of average tendencies this tables of probabilities generated in this study may help water resources managers and farmers to better understands precipitation patterns in their regions and probably consider the information to enhance their water management practices in this paragraph we provide an example to illustrate the applicability of the probability tables the example uses data from a water use efficiency study conducted by stone et al 2016 as they grew corn zea mays under a conservation tillage in florence south carolina corn was grown for three consecutive years i e 2012 to 2014 however this example emphasizes data for year 2014 which showed an average water use efficiency of 24 kg grain ha mm for corn dekalb dkc66 97 grown in a condition where a supplement irrigation was applied based on measurements of soil water potential indicated stone et al 2016 the experimental conditions and the management practices associated with the example are explicitly reported by stone et al 2016 an average grain yield of 13 5 tons ha was obtained while the crop received during jja a total water of 394 6 mm rainfall 242 2 mm irrigation 152 4 mm assuming in this case the total jja water supply being the limiting factor for the corn yield the probability to maintain that level of corn yield while relying on rainfall only would be 0 45 in region 1 0 32 in region 2 and 0 43 in region 3 however these probabilities would increase to 0 89 in region 1 0 77 in region 2 and 0 88 in region 3 when one considers applying a supplement irrigation of 152 4 mm to compensate the moisture deficit this type of interpretation may be used by crops advisors and extension services to apprehend the exposure of rainfed crops to water stress and the relevance of opting for a supplement irrigation yet an extensive crop database is needed to envision a broad use of such probabilistic tool hence future studies are encouraged to build on the present results by developing a convenient gis based crop advisory tool which would integrate precipitation probabilities and crops databases for the southeastern region of the us 5 conclusion under rainfed systems lobell et al 2009 indicated that crop yields are in average 50 or less below yield potentials due to water stress although this tendency is global it presumes room for improving yields in regions dominated by rainfed agriculture practices such as the southeastern us indeed several studies supported the possibility of ceiling yield potential with supplement irrigation van ittersum et al 2013 grassini et al 2011 however yield gaps vary consistently from one region to another same as the precipitation patterns suggesting potential time space scale effects sohoulande et al 2019 lobell 2013 therefore an understanding of the regional precipitation patterns is needed to envision better rainfed agricultural practices this study used 58 years precipitation data from 208 stations across the southeastern us and providing the following three major key findings i three precipitation regions are delineated for the southeastern us each precipitation region encompasses locations with high similarity of seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal frequency of precipitation events 5 mm over the period 1960 2017 ii statistics on precipitation characteristics confirmed the spatial variability of precipitation across the southeastern us for the three regions delineated in the study iii probability tables were developed for seasonal precipitation totals and seasonal frequencies of precipitation events 5 mm potential uses of these outcomes in the decision making for agricultural water management were discussed for instance the probability analysis reported different values of seasonal precipitation values and their probabilities of exceedance in each of the three precipitation regions however the spatial area covered by each precipitation region is relatively large to miss local climate variability hence this research may be extended by developing a comprehensive and site specific assessment of seasonal precipitation in the southeastern us further research is needed to create a gis interface which provides point based values of season precipitation totals seasonal number of precipitation events and the related probabilities of occurrence having these values at a given location can help to make the decision on whether to grow a specific crop under a rainfed condition or consider a water controlled option such as a supplement irrigation stone et al 2015 disclaimer mention of trade names or
