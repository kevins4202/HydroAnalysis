17175,optimization of acetic acid and formic acid production efficient methanogenesis is always the research hot spot in anaerobic digestion it is a promising approach to adjust the operation parameters to influence the functional microorganisms for better acetic acid and formic acid production in acidogenesis herein the effects of ph oxidation reduction potential orp and carbon nitrogen c n ratio were determined in batch experiments to probe acetic and formic acids production and were further verified in continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the results revealed that the content of volatile fatty acids vfas reached to maximum at ph 6 0 or orp 350 mv while the production of acetic and formic acids was the highest at ph 7 0 or orp 450 mv in 9 h fermentation also fermentation products dominated by acetic and formic acids were adjusted in the cstr under the operating conditions of ph 7 0 and orp 450 mv microbiological analysis from batch test showed that fermentation at ph value of 7 0 enriched the diversity of microorganism and provided a niche for microbes petrimonas norank f synergistaceae vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group and trichococcus to produce acetic and formic acids correspondingly 78 70 of the carbon was converted to acetic and formic acids in ph 7 0 this study provides a promising strategy for the targeted regulation of acetic and formic acids production in acidogenesis of anaerobic digestion graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords optimization acetic acid formic acid anaerobic digestion continuous stirred tank reactor 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has attracted widespread attention due to the generation of renewable energy during the processing of organic waste such as wastewater waste sludge or food waste garcia aguirre et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 ad generally involves the steps of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis by hydrolytic bacteria acidogens acetogens and methanogens respectively li et al 2019 among these steps slow syntrophic metabolism of fermentative intermediates by acetogens can cause accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas mainly propionic and butyric acids appels et al 2011 boe and angelidaki 2012 in addition the imbalance between acetogen and methanogen can result in low methane yield there are limited substrates for direct metabolism via methanogen i e acetic acid formic acid and h2 co2 which can be produced by acidogens degrading organic matter or by acetogens metabolizing propionic acid and butyric acid however the degradation process of propionic and butyric acids into acetic and formic acids by acetogens is limited by thermodynamics while it is easier for acidogens to directly metabolize organic matter into acetic and formic acids sieber et al 2012 leng et al 2017 in addition pan et al 2016 reported that formic acid was more easily used by methanogens than h2 in granular sludge furthermore acetic and formic acids as the liquid phase products in the acidification reactor were more easily to flow into the methanogenic reactor than h2 in two phase anaerobic digestion thus if the carbon in the substrate flows more to acetic and formic acids in the acidogenesis the metabolism of methanogens can be accelerated and the energy limitation of the acetogens can be also alleviated for more efficient ad previous studied revealed that the content and composition of fermentation products in the acidogenesis is diverse and affected by different environmental parameters such as the ph value oxidation reduction potential orp temperature hydraulic retention time hrt and organic loading rate olr garcia aguirre et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 jiang et al 2013 among them ph and orp are always the key factors to control the production of vfas in the acidification process the ph value affects many aspects of anaerobic fermentation such as microbial community and metabolic pathways so it is one of the most important parameters influencing organic hydrolysis and acidogenesis yang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 according to liu et al 2012 the ph value in the system affects the activity of microorganisms because most enzymes lose their activity under acidic ph 3 0 or alkaline ph 12 0 conditions the optimum ph range of acid producing bacteria is 4 0 7 0 it is known that ph affects the composition of fermentation products the lactic acid has higher percent at ph lower than 4 0 propionic acid dominates at ph 5 0 5 5 butyric acid at ph 5 0 6 5 while mixed vfas occurs in neutral or weakly alkalinity environments chen et al 2015 feng et al 2018 additionally orp as another key factor in determining the production efficiency and quality of vfas is usually closely related to the ph in the system it is an indicator of the net result of intracellular metabolism which is mainly based on electron transfer and redox balance liu et al 2013 according to du et al 2006 orp affected the distribution of cell metabolism by changing the ratio of nad nadh thereby changing the distribution of fermentation end products xu et al 2014 reported that the optimal orp range for acid producing fermentation was between 100 mv and 300 mv kukec et al 2002 found that propionic acid fermentation occurred more easily at orp range of 200 to 100 mv and butyric acid dominated when the orp was between 350 and 200 mv in addition the initial c n ratio of the substrate plays an important role in anaerobic acidification of organic matters lin et al 2004 according to ren et al 1997 the ratio of nadh nad in microbial cells was an important factor affecting the type of fermentation and acetic acid was always produced along with various amounts of propionic acid butyric acid and ethanol to maintain a proper nadh nad ratio in cell however the ratio of nadh nadph nad nadp could be affected by the initial c n ratio thereby affecting the type of fermentation the higher c n ratio accelerates the rate of cell anabolism and nadh nadph produced during the decomposition of organic matter can be quickly consumed therefore butyric acid type fermentation is dominated in higher c n ratio however the lower c n ratio can maintain the stability of nadh nad leading to forming propionic acid type fermentation liu et al 2008 reported that propionic acid gradually increased from 20 4 to 52 1 while acetic acid gradually decreased from 72 0 to 41 2 when the initial c n ratio increased from 5 to 30 in the anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludge however most studies tried to regulate acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid while there were few studies on the acetic and formic acids controlling under anaerobic condition hence the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of various factors such as ph orp and initial c n ratio on the production of acetic and formic acids in anaerobic fermentation this study was divided into batch tests and continuous flow experiment firstly the effect of ph orp and initial c n ratio on the concentration and yield of acetic and formic acids were optimized in batch experiments afterwards the best parameters were used and verified in the acidification reactor for better acetic and formic acids generation finally the microbial community was characterized to reveal the role of specific microorganism under optimized conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate in this study the seed sludge for the inoculation of ad was obtained from the starch wastewater treatment company of xuzhou green environmental technology company to enhance the acidification the sludge was pretreated using heat treatment to kill methanogens for their consuming vfas mainly acetic acid and formic acid logan et al 2002 firstly the granular sludge was crushed with a grinder and then passed through a 50 mesh sieve to remove impurities after that the sludge was heated at 100 c for 2 h before use the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of the seed sludge were 32 34 g l and 20 94 g l respectively the artificial wastewater was used as substrate with chemical oxygen demand cod of 2000 mg l glucose nh4cl and kh2po4 were added as carbon source nitrogen source and phosphorus source respectively the ratio of cod n p in influent was 800 5 1 1 ml of trace metal solution and mineral elements per liter was added to the reaction system to ensure the growth condition of microorganism the composition was as follows mg l trace metal solution mg l fecl2 4h2o 2 h3bo3 0 05 zncl2 0 05 cucl2 2h2o 0 038 mncl2

cstr was constructed in this study to perform long term acid production regulation the reactor was made up of borosilicate glass with total and effective volume of 4 0 l and 3 6 l respectively fig 1 furthermore a vertical flow sedimentation tank was connected outside the cstr to settle the discharged sludge a water bath with temperature control device was used to keep the temperature at 37 1 c a peristaltic pump was used to feed and stir the reactor 2 3 effect of environmental parameters on the production of acetic and formic acids in batch anaerobic fermentation more organic matter in the ad process can be converted into the vfas by suppressing the methane production process in order to investigate the effect of ph orp and initial c n ratio on the production of acetic and formic acids a series of batch experiments were conducted the parameter settings are shown in table 1 2 3 1 effect of ph anaerobic serum bottle with a total and working volume of 120 4 ml and 50 ml was used to explore the effect of different ph on production of formic acid and acetic acid in acidogenesis the initial ph in reactor was respectively adjusted at 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 by hcl and naoh and the ph was not controlled during anaerobic fermentation process 10 ml of inoculated sludge and 40 ml of glucose medium were added to triplicate bottle of each condition to maintain anaerobic condition pure nitrogen 99 99 was flushed into the reactor for 15 min before sealing with rubber stopper according to wang et al 2021 the content of formic acid was the highest at 9 h therefore the reaction bottles were incubated in a water bath shaker at 37 c and 160 rpm for 9 h ph orp and vfas were measured at the end of experiment 2 3 2 effect of orp the investigation of orp on acidogenic end products was consistent with that of ph the orp value was adjusted by adding oxidizing agent fecl3 and reducing agent dithiothreitol dtt to 250 mv 350 mv 450 mv respectively 2 3 3 effect of initial c n ratio the influence of initial c n ratio on the production of acetic acid and formic acid during acidification process was similar with that in the effect of ph and orp by adding different amounts of nh4cl to the system the initial c n ratio was set to 4 12 56 156 respectively 2 4 the operation of cstr the cstr was start up with increasing olr from 1 5 to 6 kg cod m3 d at a constant hrt of 8 h according to the batch result above the maximum acetic and formic acids production was achieved with neutral ph and orp at 450 mv the ph in the reactor was controlled at 7 0 by adding nahco3 and the temperature was controlled at 37 1 c the ph orp alkalinity cod and vfas were monitored every day 2 5 analytical methods the mlss mlvss alkalinity and cod were determined according to standard methods apha et al 2012 the ph and orp were measured using ph and orp meter leici 501 china for the measurement of vfas samples from reactors were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min then filtered through a 0 22 µm filter and the supernatant was acidified with 2 m hcl to ph below 2 0 finally ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex usa equipped with anion exchange column dionex ionpactm as11 including analytical column dionex ionpactm as11 hc 4 mm 250 mm and protect column dionex ionpactm ag11 hc 4 mm 50 mm were used for vfas measurement including acetic acid formic acid propionic acid butyric acid and lactic acid 2 6 microbial community analysis all the sludge samples from batch experiments were refrigerated at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction to analyze microbial community dna was extracted using fast dna spin kit for soli mp usa method the dna concentration was determined by nanodrop2000 thermo scientific usa and the purity was determined by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260 280 nm the extracted dna was stored at 20 c before measurement the microbial communities of the sludge samples were analyzed via high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq platform which was performed by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china for the v4 region of 16s rrna gene in each sludge sample the primers used for pcr amplification of bacteria and archaea were 515fmodf gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806rmodr ggactacnvgggtwtctaat respectively 2 7 calculation acidification efficiency ae was evaluated by the following formula 1 1 a e c o d v f a s c o d i n f l u e n t 100 where codinfluent the

05 indicates statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of batch anaerobic fermentation 3 1 1 the production of vfas fig 2 a presents the vfas production under different environmental parameters in the batch anaerobic fermentation after 9 h of reaction the accumulation of vfas at ph 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 were 215 47 mg l 457 89 mg l 666 38 mg l and 598 12 mg l respectively the lowest vfas concentration was obtained at ph 4 0 due to the dissociation of vfas and inhibition to microbial growth by passing through the cell membrane of microbes at such low ph warnecke and gill 2005 at ph 5 0 the concentration of vfas increased significantly indicating that this ph condition was suitable for the growth of acid producing bacteria nzeteu et al 2018 it was worth noting that the maximum vfas yield was produced in the system at ph 6 0 which was in agreement with the reports of wang et al 2014 and jiang et al 2013 parawira et al 2005 also showed that the optimum hydrolytic enzymes activities were observed at ph 6 0 which resulted in the highest concentration of vfas however the concentration of vfas decreased slightly at ph 7 0 it could speculate that acid producing bacteria prefer to be in an acidic environment apparently ph 6 0 was the optimum ph condition for vfas production in this study as shown in fig 2a orp was also another factor affecting the production of vfas after 9 h of reaction the concentration of vfas at 250 mv 350 mv and 450 mv were 512 20 mg l 527 74 mg l and 403 15 mg l respectively the vfas had the highest yield with orp of 350 mv while vfas had the lowest yield at 450 mv this result was similar with nguyen et al 2019 who reported that the total vfas concentration rapidly decreased with orp dropping to 470 mv it can be speculated that a lower orp is not conducive to the production of vfas jagadabhi et al 2010 and xu et al 2014 reported that the anoxic environment from oxidation to reduction was conducive to the hydrolysis and acidification of organics however compared with ph and orp the initial c n ratio had little effect on vfas generation in this study fig 2a this was different from previous results liu et al 2008 reported that a high c n ratio after 48 h fermentation was beneficial to increase the yield of total vfas and butyric acid however wang et al 2021 reported that the content of formic acid was highest at 9 h and completely consumed after 42 h therefore the fermentation time was controlled at 9 h to achieve the highest production of formic acid in this study thus it could be speculated that the initial c n ratio had little effect on the content and composition of vfas in a short time 9 h 3 1 2 the composition of vfas as shown in fig 2a among the three environmental parameters ph was the most important factor affecting the composition of vfas after anaerobic fermentation the main components of vfas were acetic acid formic acid propionic acid butyric acid and lactic acid at ph 4 0 only a small amount of acetic acid and butyric acid were produced indicating that microbial growth was inhibited ren et al 2011 reported that acid producing bacteria were inhibited when ph 4 0 at ph 5 0 butyric acid was the main acidification product which accounted for 57 08 similarly the concentration of butyric acid in the present study was higher in the ph 5 0 reactor than the other three ph reactors 4 0 6 0 7 0 it was also proved by previous researchs that butyric acid was the main product at ph 5 0 6 5 chen et al 2015 ren et al 2007 the main vfas at ph 6 0 were acetic acid formic acid and butyric acid which accounted for 32 12 34 49 and 25 47 respectively the accumulation of vfas in the system caused the ph value to drop from the initial 6 1 to 5 4 after 9 h of reaction fig 2b which was beneficial for the acidogens to enhance the metabolic rate and improve mixed acids fermentation ren et al 2007 reported that mixed acid type fermentation occurred within ph range of 5 5 6 0 at ph 7 0 acetic and formic acids were the dominant products followed by butyric acid and propionic acid it could be seen that the ph dropped from 7 0 to 6 5 after the reaction whereas acetic acid was favored at ph 6 0 6 5 yu and fang 2002 3 1 3 production of acetic and formic acids as shown in fig 3 the highest ratio of acetic acid and formic acid occurred at ph 7 0 which accounted for 85 34 from fig 2a acetic acid at ph 7 0 263 85 mg l was higher than that of ph 6 0 214 03 mg l ph 5 0 141 42 mg l and ph 4 0 89 21 mg l zhang et al 2010 showed that the content of acetic acid increased with the increase of ph additionally it should be highlighted that formic acid at ph 7 0 246 58 mg l was slightly higher than that at ph 6 0 229 81 mg l and significantly higher than that at ph 5 0 32 91 mg l and ph 4 0 13 09 mg l this result indicated that neutral ph was more favorable for the production of formic acid which might be related to the functional enzyme activity of microorganism pecher et al 1982 reported that the optimum ph for pyruvate formate lyase pfl was 7 2 which was the key enzyme in the conversion from pyruvate to formic acid therefore a neutral ph is more conducive to the expression of pfl thereby increasing the content of formic acid additionally orp also affected the production of acetic and formic acids it could be seen from fig 3 that acetic and formic acids decreased with the increase of orp the content of acetic acid and formic acid were 69 11 50 86 and 40 28 at 450 mv 350 mv and 250 mv respectively acetate producing bacteria is usually strictly anaerobic bacteria so acetic acid is usually a product under lower orp condition in addition orp can influent intracellular nadh nad ratio which in turn affect enzyme activity and metabolites liu et al 2013 according to tian et al 2015 the ratio of nadh nad decreased with the orp decreasing in addition it can be known from wood werkman cycle that produced 1 mole of acetic acid can reduce 1 mole of nad therefore the result of the decrease in orp was to reduce the ratio of nadh nad to increase nad thereby producing more acetic acid meanwhile pfl is a strict anaerobic enzyme which will lose its activity under aerobic condition nolling et al 2001 therefore it could be inferred that the formation of formic acid is more favorable under low orp condition based on the above batch tests it can be concluded that change in ph or orp can directly affect the production and composition of vfas in acidification stage the results indicated that more acetic and formic acids were produced at ph 7 0 or orp 450 mv 3 2 the performance of cstr reactor 3 2 1 ph orp and alkalinity fig 4 a shows the ph orp and alkalinity profiles of effluent in cstr with different substrate concentrations the operation of the reactor was divided into four stages the olr of stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4 were 1 5 kg cod m3 d 3 kg cod m3 d 4 5 kg cod m3 d and 6 kg cod m3 d respectively the ph of the cstr reactor was mainly controlled at neutral by adding nahco3 to regulate the production of acetic and formic acids while orp was not specifically adjusted during the whole period the orp value in the reactor gradually stabilized with fermentation time in stage 1 the orp of the system reduced from 200 mv to 500 mv indicating that the reactor was becoming a better anaerobic reduction environment for anaerobic digestion with further increase of the organic load the orp in the anaerobic system fluctuated between 350 mv and 500 mv and finally stabilized at 450 mv for better formation of acetic and formic acids alkalinity is an important parameter to indicate the stability of anaerobic digester wang et al 2018a as shown in fig 4b the alkalinity kept stable at 1000 mg caco3 l with olr of 1 5 kg cod m3 d at stage 1 at stage 2 to 4 with the increase of olr from 3 0 kg cod m3 d to 6 0 kg cod m3 d the alkalinity showed an increasing tendency with general values of 1000 to 3500 mg caco3 l referring to the typical alkalinity range of 2000 4000 mg caco3 l for mesophilic and thermophilic digesters the alkalinity levels in whole regulation process were suitable for cstr operation chen et al 2008 in brief the high alkalinity level indicated a better buffer capacity and process stability during operation process 3 2 2 vfas conversion the concentration and composition of vfas and acidification efficiency in the cstr reactor during the whole operational process are shown in fig 4c d as shown in fig 4c acetic acid formic acid propionic acid butyric acid and lactic acid were the dominant fermentative products from cstr in stage 1 the acidification efficiency was about 36 fig 4d while the ratio of acetic and formic acids to vfas in effluent increased from 42 23 to 91 93 with the increase of organic load the maximum yield of vfas in stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4 reached to 587 72 mg l 922 26 mg l and 1017 87 mg l respectively and the acidification rate was above 40 among them acetic and formic acids contributed 70 80 of the total vfas acetic acid and formic acid reached to 118 95 and 86 23 mg l 425 96 and 222 26 mg l 582 23 and 262 07 mg l and 675 36 and 320 32 mg l in stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4 respectively interestingly it could be seen from fig 4c that acetic acid and formic acid showed an opposite correlation but the ratio of acetic and formic acid to vfas was about 80 in anaerobic digesters formic acid is very easily utilized by methanogens than acetic acid pan et al 2016 however in this study the methanogenesis was ignored due to the killing methanogen via high temperature pretreatment of inoculated sludge in addition to methanogens for consuming formic acid homoacetogens could also consume formic acid to produce acetic acid crable et al 2011 reported that formic acid was not stable and easily cracked into h2 and co2 by formate dehydrogenase fdh enzymes and then h2 co2 could be converted into acetic acid by homoacetogens wang et al 2021 also reported that formic acid could be converted into acetic acid through the homoacetogenic pathway under the condition of inhibiting methanogenesis therefore it could be concluded from this study that fermentation products dominated by acetic and formic acids could be achieved by adjusting the ph to neutral and orp to 450 mv meanwhile the consumption of formic acid through homoacetogenic pathway could not be ignored 3 3 overall effects of ph on microbial community structure 3 3 1 alpha diversity indices of bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences in this study ph was the key factor affecting the fermentation products therefore 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to compare and explore the microbial community structure from batch digestors with ph of 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 table 2 alpha diversity analysis based on ace shannon simpson chao and coverage indicated the differences under different operation conditions kim et al 2014 the enrichment of certain active microorganism in the digesters showed that the sensitivity of the anaerobic process under different ph condition could directly influence the production of vfas the coverage index was more than 99 80 of all sludge samples suggesting the high quality sequence library constructed from each sample could cover the microbial community effectively various studies also reported that microbial community descriptors are directly related to anaerobic digester functions carballa et al 2011 the diversity of bacteria community was supported by an operational taxonomic unit otu number as shown in table 2 for the five samples obtained from origin ph 4 0 ph 5 0 ph 6 0 and ph 7 0 the total 16s rrna gene sequencing gave the 666 697 720 633 and 712 for bacterial otus respectively based on the ace chao 1 values bacterial richness of ph 7 0 was higher than other groups in addition the lower simpson index and higher shannon index also supported that the diversity of bacterial species significantly increased in ph 7 0 thus the results indicated that in ph 7 0 had the highest richness and higher diversity of bacterial groups 3 3 2 microbial population involved in biological acidification in the anaerobic fermentation process microbial activity would be affected by different processing conditions in order to characterize the difference in functional microbial composition between different ph digesters the microbial population of these fermentation reactors at ph 4 0 ph 5 0 ph 6 0 and ph 7 0 were analyzed at the phylum and genus level fig 5 for phylum level fig 5a the dominant phyla in original sample and ph reactors were firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and synergistetes accounting for 93 04 to 97 90 of the total sequences among them firmicutes were the most predominant phylum in four digesters more than 40 these four phyla are important acid hydrolyzed microorganisms which is found in ad process of solid waste wastewater and sludge zhi et al 2019 in order to further clarify the impact of ph on bacterial microbial community bacteria were analyzed at the genus level the composition and comparison of the main species were shown in table 3 and fig 5b respectively it could be seen from fig 5b that the dominate genera included clostridium sensu stricto 1 petrimonas vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group unclassified f enterobacteriaceae norank f synergistaceae trichococcus clostridium sensu stricto 1 which belonged to firmicutes was identified as the most abundant genus 32 55 58 84 in four digestors after 9 hours of reaction its relative abundance increased from 2 42 in the initial sludge to 39 81 at ph 4 0 54 79 at ph 5 0 58 84 at ph 6 0 and 32 55 at ph 7 0 respectively table 3 as documented in previous study lanjekar et al 2015 clostridium sensu stricto 1 is a genus of bacteria commonly found in anaerobic environments which can use a variety of sugars as carbon sources to generate acetic acid butyric acid and small amount of propionic acid and h2 co2 as shown in fig 5b clostridium sensu stricto 1 had the highest abundance in ph 6 0 which corresponded to the highest butyric acid content petrimonas is fermentative bacteria which can ferment glucose into acetic acid h2 and co2 and grew optimally at ph 7 2 krieg et al 2010 therefore the relative abundance of petrimonas in ph 4 0 3 60 and ph 5 0 3 01 was lower than that in ph 6 0 5 04 and ph 7 0 6 93 additionally norank f synergistaceae decreased significantly in the reactors of ph 4 0 ph 5 0 and ph 6 0 while it increased significantly in ph 7 0 it was reported that norank f synergistaceae can decompose organic acids into acetic acid sousa et al 2007 thus the higher abundances of petrimonas and norank f synergistaceae in the ph 7 0 fermentation reactor could benefit the conversion of glucose and butyric acid into acetic acid consistently the butyric acid content was higher in ph 4 0 ph 5 0 and ph 6 0 while the acetic acid content at ph 7 0 was higher than the other three groups in addition vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group was reported to undertake the anaerobic degradation of carbohydrates to produce acetic acid rautio et al 2003 as shown in table 3 the relative abundance of vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group on ph 7 0 was higher than that of ph 6 0 ph 5 0 and ph 4 0 which indicated that neutral ph was favorable for fermentation to produce acetic acid trichococcus is common acid producing bacteria which mainly use glucose to produce lactic acid formic acid and acetic acid wang et al 2018b it was found to be significantly higher in the ph 6 0 and ph 7 0 digestors than in the ph 5 0 and ph 4 0 digestors which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2018b who reported that trichococcus was common among neutral ph bacteria as a result the abundances of acetic acid and formic acid producing microorganisms increased at ph 7 0 3 4 implication of the present work according to zheng et al 2015 different metabolites could be adjusted by altering process conditions in addition the adjustment of process parameters could change the microbial community and dominant species in the ad process fig 6 in the acidic range the carbon in organic matter mainly converted to acetic and butyric acids however as the ph increased the microorganism in the fermentation system changed significantly and carbon was more prefer to converted to acetic and formic acids as shown in fig 6 more than 50 of the carbon in the substrate was converted to butyric acid in the acidic range which needs to be metabolized by syntrophic bacteria into acetic acid formic acid and h2 co2 for methanogens however this process is limited by thermodynamics which can lead to the imbalance in the growth of syntrophic bacteria and methanogen rajendran et al 2020 in this study ph strongly affected microbial diversity and the diversity was most abundant at ph 7 0 it could be speculated that the neutral ph provided a niche for diverse bacteria that produce acetic and formic acids mainly petrimonas norank f synergistaceae vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group and trichococcus vanwonterghem et al 2014 reported that the assembly of microbial communities is mainly determined by a deterministic process i e substrate availability operating conditions niche differentiation and interaction environmental factors such as ph adjustment played a leading role in guiding the microbial community structure this result was consistent with the report by ma et al 2016 who claimed that using a neutral ph can create a niche for the microbial population involved in acidification in ph 7 0 49 21 and 29 49 of the carbon in the substrate was converted to acetic acid and formic acid respectively which meant that 78 70 of the substrate can be directly used by methanogen moreover the selection of process parameters provided an approach for selecting the distribution of target products in the acidogenesis the crucial factors to control the final vfas production in the fermentation broth is to change the ph and orp ren et al 2007 reported that the ethanol type fermentation with production of mainly acetic acid and ethanol occurred at the ph 4 5 the propionic acid type fermentation with production of mainly acetic acid and propionic acid performed at the ph around 5 5 and orp higher than 280 mv and the butyric acid type fermentation with production of mainly acetic acid and butyric acid dominated at ph around 4 8 5 5 or above 5 8 and orp of 330mv 180mv however in this study the effluent from cstr was dominated by acetic and formic acids under the operating conditions of ph 7 and orp 350mv 500mv in addition it was worth noting that the content of formic acid was the highest at 9 h which is conducive to controlling a shorter hrt to produce formic acid in engineering applications overall this study tested the potential of controlling environmental parameters to increase the production of acetic and formic acids during the acidification phase and investigated the resulting microbial community and carbon conversion the results indicated that adjusting process parameters could offer a strategy to control the formation of terminal vfas and obtain

17175,optimization of acetic acid and formic acid production efficient methanogenesis is always the research hot spot in anaerobic digestion it is a promising approach to adjust the operation parameters to influence the functional microorganisms for better acetic acid and formic acid production in acidogenesis herein the effects of ph oxidation reduction potential orp and carbon nitrogen c n ratio were determined in batch experiments to probe acetic and formic acids production and were further verified in continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the results revealed that the content of volatile fatty acids vfas reached to maximum at ph 6 0 or orp 350 mv while the production of acetic and formic acids was the highest at ph 7 0 or orp 450 mv in 9 h fermentation also fermentation products dominated by acetic and formic acids were adjusted in the cstr under the operating conditions of ph 7 0 and orp 450 mv microbiological analysis from batch test showed that fermentation at ph value of 7 0 enriched the diversity of microorganism and provided a niche for microbes petrimonas norank f synergistaceae vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group and trichococcus to produce acetic and formic acids correspondingly 78 70 of the carbon was converted to acetic and formic acids in ph 7 0 this study provides a promising strategy for the targeted regulation of acetic and formic acids production in acidogenesis of anaerobic digestion graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords optimization acetic acid formic acid anaerobic digestion continuous stirred tank reactor 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has attracted widespread attention due to the generation of renewable energy during the processing of organic waste such as wastewater waste sludge or food waste garcia aguirre et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 ad generally involves the steps of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis by hydrolytic bacteria acidogens acetogens and methanogens respectively li et al 2019 among these steps slow syntrophic metabolism of fermentative intermediates by acetogens can cause accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas mainly propionic and butyric acids appels et al 2011 boe and angelidaki 2012 in addition the imbalance between acetogen and methanogen can result in low methane yield there are limited substrates for direct metabolism via methanogen i e acetic acid formic acid and h2 co2 which can be produced by acidogens degrading organic matter or by acetogens metabolizing propionic acid and butyric acid however the degradation process of propionic and butyric acids into acetic and formic acids by acetogens is limited by thermodynamics while it is easier for acidogens to directly metabolize organic matter into acetic and formic acids sieber et al 2012 leng et al 2017 in addition pan et al 2016 reported that formic acid was more easily used by methanogens than h2 in granular sludge furthermore acetic and formic acids as the liquid phase products in the acidification reactor were more easily to flow into the methanogenic reactor than h2 in two phase anaerobic digestion thus if the carbon in the substrate flows more to acetic and formic acids in the acidogenesis the metabolism of methanogens can be accelerated and the energy limitation of the acetogens can be also alleviated for more efficient ad previous studied revealed that the content and composition of fermentation products in the acidogenesis is diverse and affected by different environmental parameters such as the ph value oxidation reduction potential orp temperature hydraulic retention time hrt and organic loading rate olr garcia aguirre et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 jiang et al 2013 among them ph and orp are always the key factors to control the production of vfas in the acidification process the ph value affects many aspects of anaerobic fermentation such as microbial community and metabolic pathways so it is one of the most important parameters influencing organic hydrolysis and acidogenesis yang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 according to liu et al 2012 the ph value in the system affects the activity of microorganisms because most enzymes lose their activity under acidic ph 3 0 or alkaline ph 12 0 conditions the optimum ph range of acid producing bacteria is 4 0 7 0 it is known that ph affects the composition of fermentation products the lactic acid has higher percent at ph lower than 4 0 propionic acid dominates at ph 5 0 5 5 butyric acid at ph 5 0 6 5 while mixed vfas occurs in neutral or weakly alkalinity environments chen et al 2015 feng et al 2018 additionally orp as another key factor in determining the production efficiency and quality of vfas is usually closely related to the ph in the system it is an indicator of the net result of intracellular metabolism which is mainly based on electron transfer and redox balance liu et al 2013 according to du et al 2006 orp affected the distribution of cell metabolism by changing the ratio of nad nadh thereby changing the distribution of fermentation end products xu et al 2014 reported that the optimal orp range for acid producing fermentation was between 100 mv and 300 mv kukec et al 2002 found that propionic acid fermentation occurred more easily at orp range of 200 to 100 mv and butyric acid dominated when the orp was between 350 and 200 mv in addition the initial c n ratio of the substrate plays an important role in anaerobic acidification of organic matters lin et al 2004 according to ren et al 1997 the ratio of nadh nad in microbial cells was an important factor affecting the type of fermentation and acetic acid was always produced along with various amounts of propionic acid butyric acid and ethanol to maintain a proper nadh nad ratio in cell however the ratio of nadh nadph nad nadp could be affected by the initial c n ratio thereby affecting the type of fermentation the higher c n ratio accelerates the rate of cell anabolism and nadh nadph produced during the decomposition of organic matter can be quickly consumed therefore butyric acid type fermentation is dominated in higher c n ratio however the lower c n ratio can maintain the stability of nadh nad leading to forming propionic acid type fermentation liu et al 2008 reported that propionic acid gradually increased from 20 4 to 52 1 while acetic acid gradually decreased from 72 0 to 41 2 when the initial c n ratio increased from 5 to 30 in the anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludge however most studies tried to regulate acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid while there were few studies on the acetic and formic acids controlling under anaerobic condition hence the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of various factors such as ph orp and initial c n ratio on the production of acetic and formic acids in anaerobic fermentation this study was divided into batch tests and continuous flow experiment firstly the effect of ph orp and initial c n ratio on the concentration and yield of acetic and formic acids were optimized in batch experiments afterwards the best parameters were used and verified in the acidification reactor for better acetic and formic acids generation finally the microbial community was characterized to reveal the role of specific microorganism under optimized conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate in this study the seed sludge for the inoculation of ad was obtained from the starch wastewater treatment company of xuzhou green environmental technology company to enhance the acidification the sludge was pretreated using heat treatment to kill methanogens for their consuming vfas mainly acetic acid and formic acid logan et al 2002 firstly the granular sludge was crushed with a grinder and then passed through a 50 mesh sieve to remove impurities after that the sludge was heated at 100 c for 2 h before use the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss of the seed sludge were 32 34 g l and 20 94 g l respectively the artificial wastewater was used as substrate with chemical oxygen demand cod of 2000 mg l glucose nh4cl and kh2po4 were added as carbon source nitrogen source and phosphorus source respectively the ratio of cod n p in influent was 800 5 1 1 ml of trace metal solution and mineral elements per liter was added to the reaction system to ensure the growth condition of microorganism the composition was as follows mg l trace metal solution mg l fecl2 4h2o 2 h3bo3 0 05 zncl2 0 05 cucl2 2h2o 0 038 mncl2

cstr was constructed in this study to perform long term acid production regulation the reactor was made up of borosilicate glass with total and effective volume of 4 0 l and 3 6 l respectively fig 1 furthermore a vertical flow sedimentation tank was connected outside the cstr to settle the discharged sludge a water bath with temperature control device was used to keep the temperature at 37 1 c a peristaltic pump was used to feed and stir the reactor 2 3 effect of environmental parameters on the production of acetic and formic acids in batch anaerobic fermentation more organic matter in the ad process can be converted into the vfas by suppressing the methane production process in order to investigate the effect of ph orp and initial c n ratio on the production of acetic and formic acids a series of batch experiments were conducted the parameter settings are shown in table 1 2 3 1 effect of ph anaerobic serum bottle with a total and working volume of 120 4 ml and 50 ml was used to explore the effect of different ph on production of formic acid and acetic acid in acidogenesis the initial ph in reactor was respectively adjusted at 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 by hcl and naoh and the ph was not controlled during anaerobic fermentation process 10 ml of inoculated sludge and 40 ml of glucose medium were added to triplicate bottle of each condition to maintain anaerobic condition pure nitrogen 99 99 was flushed into the reactor for 15 min before sealing with rubber stopper according to wang et al 2021 the content of formic acid was the highest at 9 h therefore the reaction bottles were incubated in a water bath shaker at 37 c and 160 rpm for 9 h ph orp and vfas were measured at the end of experiment 2 3 2 effect of orp the investigation of orp on acidogenic end products was consistent with that of ph the orp value was adjusted by adding oxidizing agent fecl3 and reducing agent dithiothreitol dtt to 250 mv 350 mv 450 mv respectively 2 3 3 effect of initial c n ratio the influence of initial c n ratio on the production of acetic acid and formic acid during acidification process was similar with that in the effect of ph and orp by adding different amounts of nh4cl to the system the initial c n ratio was set to 4 12 56 156 respectively 2 4 the operation of cstr the cstr was start up with increasing olr from 1 5 to 6 kg cod m3 d at a constant hrt of 8 h according to the batch result above the maximum acetic and formic acids production was achieved with neutral ph and orp at 450 mv the ph in the reactor was controlled at 7 0 by adding nahco3 and the temperature was controlled at 37 1 c the ph orp alkalinity cod and vfas were monitored every day 2 5 analytical methods the mlss mlvss alkalinity and cod were determined according to standard methods apha et al 2012 the ph and orp were measured using ph and orp meter leici 501 china for the measurement of vfas samples from reactors were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min then filtered through a 0 22 µm filter and the supernatant was acidified with 2 m hcl to ph below 2 0 finally ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex usa equipped with anion exchange column dionex ionpactm as11 including analytical column dionex ionpactm as11 hc 4 mm 250 mm and protect column dionex ionpactm ag11 hc 4 mm 50 mm were used for vfas measurement including acetic acid formic acid propionic acid butyric acid and lactic acid 2 6 microbial community analysis all the sludge samples from batch experiments were refrigerated at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction to analyze microbial community dna was extracted using fast dna spin kit for soli mp usa method the dna concentration was determined by nanodrop2000 thermo scientific usa and the purity was determined by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260 280 nm the extracted dna was stored at 20 c before measurement the microbial communities of the sludge samples were analyzed via high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq platform which was performed by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china for the v4 region of 16s rrna gene in each sludge sample the primers used for pcr amplification of bacteria and archaea were 515fmodf gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and 806rmodr ggactacnvgggtwtctaat respectively 2 7 calculation acidification efficiency ae was evaluated by the following formula 1 1 a e c o d v f a s c o d i n f l u e n t 100 where codinfluent the

05 indicates statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of batch anaerobic fermentation 3 1 1 the production of vfas fig 2 a presents the vfas production under different environmental parameters in the batch anaerobic fermentation after 9 h of reaction the accumulation of vfas at ph 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 were 215 47 mg l 457 89 mg l 666 38 mg l and 598 12 mg l respectively the lowest vfas concentration was obtained at ph 4 0 due to the dissociation of vfas and inhibition to microbial growth by passing through the cell membrane of microbes at such low ph warnecke and gill 2005 at ph 5 0 the concentration of vfas increased significantly indicating that this ph condition was suitable for the growth of acid producing bacteria nzeteu et al 2018 it was worth noting that the maximum vfas yield was produced in the system at ph 6 0 which was in agreement with the reports of wang et al 2014 and jiang et al 2013 parawira et al 2005 also showed that the optimum hydrolytic enzymes activities were observed at ph 6 0 which resulted in the highest concentration of vfas however the concentration of vfas decreased slightly at ph 7 0 it could speculate that acid producing bacteria prefer to be in an acidic environment apparently ph 6 0 was the optimum ph condition for vfas production in this study as shown in fig 2a orp was also another factor affecting the production of vfas after 9 h of reaction the concentration of vfas at 250 mv 350 mv and 450 mv were 512 20 mg l 527 74 mg l and 403 15 mg l respectively the vfas had the highest yield with orp of 350 mv while vfas had the lowest yield at 450 mv this result was similar with nguyen et al 2019 who reported that the total vfas concentration rapidly decreased with orp dropping to 470 mv it can be speculated that a lower orp is not conducive to the production of vfas jagadabhi et al 2010 and xu et al 2014 reported that the anoxic environment from oxidation to reduction was conducive to the hydrolysis and acidification of organics however compared with ph and orp the initial c n ratio had little effect on vfas generation in this study fig 2a this was different from previous results liu et al 2008 reported that a high c n ratio after 48 h fermentation was beneficial to increase the yield of total vfas and butyric acid however wang et al 2021 reported that the content of formic acid was highest at 9 h and completely consumed after 42 h therefore the fermentation time was controlled at 9 h to achieve the highest production of formic acid in this study thus it could be speculated that the initial c n ratio had little effect on the content and composition of vfas in a short time 9 h 3 1 2 the composition of vfas as shown in fig 2a among the three environmental parameters ph was the most important factor affecting the composition of vfas after anaerobic fermentation the main components of vfas were acetic acid formic acid propionic acid butyric acid and lactic acid at ph 4 0 only a small amount of acetic acid and butyric acid were produced indicating that microbial growth was inhibited ren et al 2011 reported that acid producing bacteria were inhibited when ph 4 0 at ph 5 0 butyric acid was the main acidification product which accounted for 57 08 similarly the concentration of butyric acid in the present study was higher in the ph 5 0 reactor than the other three ph reactors 4 0 6 0 7 0 it was also proved by previous researchs that butyric acid was the main product at ph 5 0 6 5 chen et al 2015 ren et al 2007 the main vfas at ph 6 0 were acetic acid formic acid and butyric acid which accounted for 32 12 34 49 and 25 47 respectively the accumulation of vfas in the system caused the ph value to drop from the initial 6 1 to 5 4 after 9 h of reaction fig 2b which was beneficial for the acidogens to enhance the metabolic rate and improve mixed acids fermentation ren et al 2007 reported that mixed acid type fermentation occurred within ph range of 5 5 6 0 at ph 7 0 acetic and formic acids were the dominant products followed by butyric acid and propionic acid it could be seen that the ph dropped from 7 0 to 6 5 after the reaction whereas acetic acid was favored at ph 6 0 6 5 yu and fang 2002 3 1 3 production of acetic and formic acids as shown in fig 3 the highest ratio of acetic acid and formic acid occurred at ph 7 0 which accounted for 85 34 from fig 2a acetic acid at ph 7 0 263 85 mg l was higher than that of ph 6 0 214 03 mg l ph 5 0 141 42 mg l and ph 4 0 89 21 mg l zhang et al 2010 showed that the content of acetic acid increased with the increase of ph additionally it should be highlighted that formic acid at ph 7 0 246 58 mg l was slightly higher than that at ph 6 0 229 81 mg l and significantly higher than that at ph 5 0 32 91 mg l and ph 4 0 13 09 mg l this result indicated that neutral ph was more favorable for the production of formic acid which might be related to the functional enzyme activity of microorganism pecher et al 1982 reported that the optimum ph for pyruvate formate lyase pfl was 7 2 which was the key enzyme in the conversion from pyruvate to formic acid therefore a neutral ph is more conducive to the expression of pfl thereby increasing the content of formic acid additionally orp also affected the production of acetic and formic acids it could be seen from fig 3 that acetic and formic acids decreased with the increase of orp the content of acetic acid and formic acid were 69 11 50 86 and 40 28 at 450 mv 350 mv and 250 mv respectively acetate producing bacteria is usually strictly anaerobic bacteria so acetic acid is usually a product under lower orp condition in addition orp can influent intracellular nadh nad ratio which in turn affect enzyme activity and metabolites liu et al 2013 according to tian et al 2015 the ratio of nadh nad decreased with the orp decreasing in addition it can be known from wood werkman cycle that produced 1 mole of acetic acid can reduce 1 mole of nad therefore the result of the decrease in orp was to reduce the ratio of nadh nad to increase nad thereby producing more acetic acid meanwhile pfl is a strict anaerobic enzyme which will lose its activity under aerobic condition nolling et al 2001 therefore it could be inferred that the formation of formic acid is more favorable under low orp condition based on the above batch tests it can be concluded that change in ph or orp can directly affect the production and composition of vfas in acidification stage the results indicated that more acetic and formic acids were produced at ph 7 0 or orp 450 mv 3 2 the performance of cstr reactor 3 2 1 ph orp and alkalinity fig 4 a shows the ph orp and alkalinity profiles of effluent in cstr with different substrate concentrations the operation of the reactor was divided into four stages the olr of stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4 were 1 5 kg cod m3 d 3 kg cod m3 d 4 5 kg cod m3 d and 6 kg cod m3 d respectively the ph of the cstr reactor was mainly controlled at neutral by adding nahco3 to regulate the production of acetic and formic acids while orp was not specifically adjusted during the whole period the orp value in the reactor gradually stabilized with fermentation time in stage 1 the orp of the system reduced from 200 mv to 500 mv indicating that the reactor was becoming a better anaerobic reduction environment for anaerobic digestion with further increase of the organic load the orp in the anaerobic system fluctuated between 350 mv and 500 mv and finally stabilized at 450 mv for better formation of acetic and formic acids alkalinity is an important parameter to indicate the stability of anaerobic digester wang et al 2018a as shown in fig 4b the alkalinity kept stable at 1000 mg caco3 l with olr of 1 5 kg cod m3 d at stage 1 at stage 2 to 4 with the increase of olr from 3 0 kg cod m3 d to 6 0 kg cod m3 d the alkalinity showed an increasing tendency with general values of 1000 to 3500 mg caco3 l referring to the typical alkalinity range of 2000 4000 mg caco3 l for mesophilic and thermophilic digesters the alkalinity levels in whole regulation process were suitable for cstr operation chen et al 2008 in brief the high alkalinity level indicated a better buffer capacity and process stability during operation process 3 2 2 vfas conversion the concentration and composition of vfas and acidification efficiency in the cstr reactor during the whole operational process are shown in fig 4c d as shown in fig 4c acetic acid formic acid propionic acid butyric acid and lactic acid were the dominant fermentative products from cstr in stage 1 the acidification efficiency was about 36 fig 4d while the ratio of acetic and formic acids to vfas in effluent increased from 42 23 to 91 93 with the increase of organic load the maximum yield of vfas in stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4 reached to 587 72 mg l 922 26 mg l and 1017 87 mg l respectively and the acidification rate was above 40 among them acetic and formic acids contributed 70 80 of the total vfas acetic acid and formic acid reached to 118 95 and 86 23 mg l 425 96 and 222 26 mg l 582 23 and 262 07 mg l and 675 36 and 320 32 mg l in stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4 respectively interestingly it could be seen from fig 4c that acetic acid and formic acid showed an opposite correlation but the ratio of acetic and formic acid to vfas was about 80 in anaerobic digesters formic acid is very easily utilized by methanogens than acetic acid pan et al 2016 however in this study the methanogenesis was ignored due to the killing methanogen via high temperature pretreatment of inoculated sludge in addition to methanogens for consuming formic acid homoacetogens could also consume formic acid to produce acetic acid crable et al 2011 reported that formic acid was not stable and easily cracked into h2 and co2 by formate dehydrogenase fdh enzymes and then h2 co2 could be converted into acetic acid by homoacetogens wang et al 2021 also reported that formic acid could be converted into acetic acid through the homoacetogenic pathway under the condition of inhibiting methanogenesis therefore it could be concluded from this study that fermentation products dominated by acetic and formic acids could be achieved by adjusting the ph to neutral and orp to 450 mv meanwhile the consumption of formic acid through homoacetogenic pathway could not be ignored 3 3 overall effects of ph on microbial community structure 3 3 1 alpha diversity indices of bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences in this study ph was the key factor affecting the fermentation products therefore 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to compare and explore the microbial community structure from batch digestors with ph of 4 0 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 table 2 alpha diversity analysis based on ace shannon simpson chao and coverage indicated the differences under different operation conditions kim et al 2014 the enrichment of certain active microorganism in the digesters showed that the sensitivity of the anaerobic process under different ph condition could directly influence the production of vfas the coverage index was more than 99 80 of all sludge samples suggesting the high quality sequence library constructed from each sample could cover the microbial community effectively various studies also reported that microbial community descriptors are directly related to anaerobic digester functions carballa et al 2011 the diversity of bacteria community was supported by an operational taxonomic unit otu number as shown in table 2 for the five samples obtained from origin ph 4 0 ph 5 0 ph 6 0 and ph 7 0 the total 16s rrna gene sequencing gave the 666 697 720 633 and 712 for bacterial otus respectively based on the ace chao 1 values bacterial richness of ph 7 0 was higher than other groups in addition the lower simpson index and higher shannon index also supported that the diversity of bacterial species significantly increased in ph 7 0 thus the results indicated that in ph 7 0 had the highest richness and higher diversity of bacterial groups 3 3 2 microbial population involved in biological acidification in the anaerobic fermentation process microbial activity would be affected by different processing conditions in order to characterize the difference in functional microbial composition between different ph digesters the microbial population of these fermentation reactors at ph 4 0 ph 5 0 ph 6 0 and ph 7 0 were analyzed at the phylum and genus level fig 5 for phylum level fig 5a the dominant phyla in original sample and ph reactors were firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and synergistetes accounting for 93 04 to 97 90 of the total sequences among them firmicutes were the most predominant phylum in four digesters more than 40 these four phyla are important acid hydrolyzed microorganisms which is found in ad process of solid waste wastewater and sludge zhi et al 2019 in order to further clarify the impact of ph on bacterial microbial community bacteria were analyzed at the genus level the composition and comparison of the main species were shown in table 3 and fig 5b respectively it could be seen from fig 5b that the dominate genera included clostridium sensu stricto 1 petrimonas vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group unclassified f enterobacteriaceae norank f synergistaceae trichococcus clostridium sensu stricto 1 which belonged to firmicutes was identified as the most abundant genus 32 55 58 84 in four digestors after 9 hours of reaction its relative abundance increased from 2 42 in the initial sludge to 39 81 at ph 4 0 54 79 at ph 5 0 58 84 at ph 6 0 and 32 55 at ph 7 0 respectively table 3 as documented in previous study lanjekar et al 2015 clostridium sensu stricto 1 is a genus of bacteria commonly found in anaerobic environments which can use a variety of sugars as carbon sources to generate acetic acid butyric acid and small amount of propionic acid and h2 co2 as shown in fig 5b clostridium sensu stricto 1 had the highest abundance in ph 6 0 which corresponded to the highest butyric acid content petrimonas is fermentative bacteria which can ferment glucose into acetic acid h2 and co2 and grew optimally at ph 7 2 krieg et al 2010 therefore the relative abundance of petrimonas in ph 4 0 3 60 and ph 5 0 3 01 was lower than that in ph 6 0 5 04 and ph 7 0 6 93 additionally norank f synergistaceae decreased significantly in the reactors of ph 4 0 ph 5 0 and ph 6 0 while it increased significantly in ph 7 0 it was reported that norank f synergistaceae can decompose organic acids into acetic acid sousa et al 2007 thus the higher abundances of petrimonas and norank f synergistaceae in the ph 7 0 fermentation reactor could benefit the conversion of glucose and butyric acid into acetic acid consistently the butyric acid content was higher in ph 4 0 ph 5 0 and ph 6 0 while the acetic acid content at ph 7 0 was higher than the other three groups in addition vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group was reported to undertake the anaerobic degradation of carbohydrates to produce acetic acid rautio et al 2003 as shown in table 3 the relative abundance of vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group on ph 7 0 was higher than that of ph 6 0 ph 5 0 and ph 4 0 which indicated that neutral ph was favorable for fermentation to produce acetic acid trichococcus is common acid producing bacteria which mainly use glucose to produce lactic acid formic acid and acetic acid wang et al 2018b it was found to be significantly higher in the ph 6 0 and ph 7 0 digestors than in the ph 5 0 and ph 4 0 digestors which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2018b who reported that trichococcus was common among neutral ph bacteria as a result the abundances of acetic acid and formic acid producing microorganisms increased at ph 7 0 3 4 implication of the present work according to zheng et al 2015 different metabolites could be adjusted by altering process conditions in addition the adjustment of process parameters could change the microbial community and dominant species in the ad process fig 6 in the acidic range the carbon in organic matter mainly converted to acetic and butyric acids however as the ph increased the microorganism in the fermentation system changed significantly and carbon was more prefer to converted to acetic and formic acids as shown in fig 6 more than 50 of the carbon in the substrate was converted to butyric acid in the acidic range which needs to be metabolized by syntrophic bacteria into acetic acid formic acid and h2 co2 for methanogens however this process is limited by thermodynamics which can lead to the imbalance in the growth of syntrophic bacteria and methanogen rajendran et al 2020 in this study ph strongly affected microbial diversity and the diversity was most abundant at ph 7 0 it could be speculated that the neutral ph provided a niche for diverse bacteria that produce acetic and formic acids mainly petrimonas norank f synergistaceae vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group and trichococcus vanwonterghem et al 2014 reported that the assembly of microbial communities is mainly determined by a deterministic process i e substrate availability operating conditions niche differentiation and interaction environmental factors such as ph adjustment played a leading role in guiding the microbial community structure this result was consistent with the report by ma et al 2016 who claimed that using a neutral ph can create a niche for the microbial population involved in acidification in ph 7 0 49 21 and 29 49 of the carbon in the substrate was converted to acetic acid and formic acid respectively which meant that 78 70 of the substrate can be directly used by methanogen moreover the selection of process parameters provided an approach for selecting the distribution of target products in the acidogenesis the crucial factors to control the final vfas production in the fermentation broth is to change the ph and orp ren et al 2007 reported that the ethanol type fermentation with production of mainly acetic acid and ethanol occurred at the ph 4 5 the propionic acid type fermentation with production of mainly acetic acid and propionic acid performed at the ph around 5 5 and orp higher than 280 mv and the butyric acid type fermentation with production of mainly acetic acid and butyric acid dominated at ph around 4 8 5 5 or above 5 8 and orp of 330mv 180mv however in this study the effluent from cstr was dominated by acetic and formic acids under the operating conditions of ph 7 and orp 350mv 500mv in addition it was worth noting that the content of formic acid was the highest at 9 h which is conducive to controlling a shorter hrt to produce formic acid in engineering applications overall this study tested the potential of controlling environmental parameters to increase the production of acetic and formic acids during the acidification phase and investigated the resulting microbial community and carbon conversion the results indicated that adjusting process parameters could offer a strategy to control the formation of terminal vfas and obtain target products which might be valuable for future practical engineering application 4 conclusion this present work firstly investigated the influence of environmental factors ph orp and initial c n ratio on the production of acetic and formic acids in acidification process the results showed that ph and orp especially ph significantly affected the production of acetic and formic acids while the initial c n ratio had no effect in a short time fermentation the increase of ph enriched the diversity of microorganisms and provided a niche for microorganisms that produce acetic acid and formic acid also 78 70 of the carbon in the substrate was converted to acetic and formic acids in ph 7 0 additionally fermentation products dominated by acetic and formic acids were adjusted in the cstr after a long period of operation under the operation of ph 7 0 and orp 450 mv the results of this study provide technical support for the realization of regulating acetic and formic acids in the acidogenesis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

the uv exposure bak et al 2010 lakretz et al 2011 said et al 2011 bacteria within preestablished biofilms also show greatly diminished uvc susceptibility upon exposure compared to their planktonic counterparts argyraki et al 2016 bak et al 2009 li et al 2010 for additional discussion of recent literature on the effects of pre growth and post growth irradiation of biofilms we refer the reader to cates and torkzadeh 2020 distinct from these scenarios a concurrent irradiation approach would seek to inactivate cells approaching a submerged surface and during initial stages of attachment to prevent surface colonization altogether and potentially with the use of relatively low power uv sources with the exception of uv opaque liquid food applications direct continuous exposure of an

have previously argued cates and torkzadeh 2020 we hypothesized that the intensities required to prevent surface colonization on a long term basis are order s of magnitude lower than that required for typical disinfection of bulk water streams the exposure time for bacteria that have attached on the targeted surface would be independent of and presumably vastly greater than the hydraulic residence time of the irradiation zone even a low intensity uv source would therefore impart a large cumulative radiation dose to the surface bacteria the objectives of this work were to development an experimental apparatus for quantifying the effects of continuous uv irradiation on biofilm growth to demonstrate that biofilm irradiation experiments and quantitative analyses may be conducted with a functional level of reproducibility to develop a mathematical model which describes the uvc intensity response of surface biofilm growth and to formally establish for the first time the biofilm uvc intensity response for a bacterial strain on a test surface with defined environmental parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 design criteria of biofilm irradiation apparatus and analysis several key functionality criteria of were identified for a laboratory biofilm growth and irradiation setup capable of producing the desired data first the apparatus and methods needed to be capable of growing biofilms on submerged test surfaces at consistent rates in the absence of uvc irradiation in order to establish baseline growth rates for comparison and for serving as experimental controls since our focus was on examining uv intensity response on a fundamental level environmentally relevant conditions i e biofilm establishment occurring over weeks or months were not prioritized instead conditions which resulted in significant biofilm coverage within 1 2 days were employed in order to expedite the experiments second the apparatus needed to achieve irradiation of the test surface with precisely known uvc intensities while holding all other conditions identical to the control experiments the uvc intensity impinging on the test surface also needed to be tunable within a certain range of interest lastly a means of quantifying the resulting biofilm growth was sought specific biovolume sbv was selected as the main quantifiable biofilm parameter herein which is defined as the volume of fluorescing cells µm3 see below per superficial area of the test surface µm2 and is reported in units of µm i e µm3 µm2 since the growth time of our experiments was fixed the final sbvs on the surfaces were also directly proportional to the average biofilm growth rates µm h furthermore because accelerated growth conditions involving injection of a concentrated bacterial suspension were used described below an ability to distinguish between biovolume associated with biofilm growth i e active surface colonization and biovolume attributed simply to colloidal deposition of planktonic cells was deemed useful 2 2 flow cell biofilm growth system biofilms were grown in a two chamber flow cell biosurface technologies corp containing flowing aqueous growth medium with each chamber having volume and depth of 0 131 ml and 0 33 mm respectively the configuration is shown in fig 1 the flow cell was equipped with glass viewing windows over each chamber one of which in this case was replaced with a custom made fused silica glass cover slip which served as an irradiation window 60 240 0 2 mm technical glass products the total uv transmittance of the cover slip glass at 254 nm uvt254 was 99 as determined by a uv vis spectrometer the inner surface of the windows in contact with the solution served as the test surface for biofilm growth we note that this configuration resulted in uv emanating from the surface during irradiation bottom up rather than approaching from the direction of the bulk solution top down while top down irradiation is more pertinent to device applications it requires the uv beam to penetrate the solution which contains solutes and colloidal material therefore bottom up irradiation enabled stricter control of uv intensity directly at the surface for untarnished observation of biofilm intensity response influent solution was pumped into the two chambers simultaneously in parallel using two peristaltic pumps for each irradiation experiment one of the chambers retained its original borosilicate glass window with uvt254 of 0 thus resulting in growth of a non irradiated biofilm for quantitative comparison and to serve as a quality control check trials wherein unusually low growth in the control chamber was observed were excluded from the data further details of the flow cell biofilm growth system are found in the supporting information text s1 2 3 bacteria and growth medium fda strain escherichia coli atcc 25922tm was chosen as a model biofilm forming bacterium for use herein due to its ability to rapidly grow biofilms on surfaces and its nonpathogenic nature ashby et al 1994 naves et al 2008 propagation and preparation of the suspensions used for inoculation of the flow cells is described in text s2 a custom growth medium was also developed for use in the flow cells as part of this work which was optimized to achieve maximal uvt254 while still resulting in rapid e coli growth ultimately a formula comprising m9 media salts tryptic soy broth tsb and glucose was developed with a uvt254 of 68 cm 1 the optimization methods and precise composition are described in text s3 despite the use of a bottom up irradiation approach in this work minimization of uv attenuation by the solution was desired so that suspended bacteria approaching within microns of the surface would encounter uv photons more similarly to in a top down irradiation scenario 2 4 surface irradiation system to irradiate the test surfaces with uv the flow cells were place in a collimated beam apparatus constructed according to bolton and linden 2003 and kuo et al 2003 with the irradiation windows oriented toward the beam fig 1 the apparatus comprised a low pressure mercury lamp blackened collimating tube and exposure platform to achieve variable uvc intensities one of two lamps was employed 4 w or 15 w while additionally adjusting the distance of the lamp from the tube entrance and placing fused silica glass plates at the tube entrance to serve as mild attenuating filters for each lamp configuration uvc intensity µw cm2 was determined systematically at the location of the flow cell window along the vertical axis using a radiometer with germicidal detector head solar light co and protocol provided by bolton et al 2015 full details are provided in text s4 temperature of the irradiation chamber was maintained at 28 1 c using a small space heater which also circulated air around the flow cells 2 5 biofilm growth and irradiation experimental procedure all system components which contacted the solutions including the flow cell were autoclaved before each experiment biofilm growth experiments began by filling the flow cell with tsb solution via the injection ports and waiting 1 h followed by injection of 2 ml of stationary phase e coli suspension 109 cfu ml then allowing to sit for another 1 h pumping of sterilized growth media through the flow cell at 0 25 ml min was then initiated and the uv lamp was engaged biofilms were allowed to grow for 48 h before both pumping and irradiation were ceased this approach thus simulated device application scenarios wherein the surface of interest initially contains no established biofilm coverage but is already contaminated with some bacteria when the uv source is initiated biofilm analysis methods immediately following the growth procedure the flow cell was perfused with a 0 85 nacl rinse solution and disconnected from the tubing and the growth surfaces were analyzed via confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm nikon eclipse ti a custom built mounting stage was employed that allowed positioning of the entire flow cell over the microscope objective lens and for laser excitation and imaging of the growth surface to be conducted through the irradiation window hence disturbance and manipulation of the biofilms was minimized and full hydration was preserved prior to imaging the flow cell contents were stained by injecting fluorescent dyes including syto9 and propidium iodide pi nucleic acid stains in order to contrast live dead cells and dead cells respectively live dead baclighttm invitrogen usa ben sasson et al 2014 additionally concavalin a cona cf 405s biotium inc fermont california was used to stain and image extracellular polymeric substances eps cslm images were captured at different depths in the middle of the flow cell scanning a total area of 0 41 mm2 of the biofilm three such scans were performed at random points within each biofilm sample and averaged to obtain one result experiments at each intensity were further performed in triplicate to yield a total of 9 datapoints for each intensity condition scanning and processing of the data using the comstat plug in for imagej software enabled determination of the live cell dead cell and eps associated sbvs for each biofilm sample heydorn et al 2000 while absolute experimental sbv values are somewhat subjective and influenced by imaging parameters e g excitation intensity detector gain etc our results and discussion focus on relative values of sbv as compared to the control biofilms complete details of staining procedure microscope configuration and analyses are provided in text s5 2 6 planktonic cell dose response the uvc dose response of planktonic stationary phase e coli was determined using collimated beam experiments and spread plate assays described further in text s6 a delayed chick watson model rennecker et al 1999 was fit to the inactivation data 2 7 data analysis and modeling the results and discussion presented below focus primarily on the dataset comprising experimental values of sbv following a fixed growth period as a function of uvc intensity following data collection models were developed that related sbv to uvc intensity under a fixed set of growth conditions referred to hereafter as intensity response models model development and parameters are discussed in the results and discussion model fits pseudo r2 standard error and p values of model parameters were determined using nonlinear regression in r software r core team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of method assessment representative cslm images of control and irradiated e coli biofilms using live dead and eps staining are shown in figs 2 a and b as evidenced by the dense coverage of green stained cells on the control sample fig 2a the biofilm growth methods resulted in successful surface colonization on the test surface within 48 h the surface irradiated at maximum uv intensity 351 µw cm2 however showed much less coverage with only scattered and seemingly individual cells that exhibited both live and dead red fluorescence as is evident from the additional data discussed below such bacteria coverage constituted a minimum threshold of biovolume that appeared even at prohibitively high uv intensities we attribute this behavior not to biofilm establishment but to colloidal adsorption of cells contained in the original inoculum injection additionally biofilm growth was visually observed in the flow cell entrance port upstream of the irradiated zone as a result of incidental inoculation during the initial injection of bacteria this biofilm presence contributed to cells and biofilm particles entering the flow cell chambers throughout the growth period regardless of uv intensity while the irradiated surface had a higher proportion of red dead cells compared to the control significant numbers of green fluorescing cells were also observed this was a result of the mode of action of the live dead stain being incongruous with the mechanism of uv inactivation cates et al 2011 craik et al 2000 the employed fluorescent stains only allowed differentiation between cells with ruptured membranes and those with intact membranes however since uv inactivation acts via dna mutagenesis and does not directly affect membrane integrity many inactivated bacteria on the surface did not express red fluorescence as their membranes were still intact live dead fraction was thus found to be an uninformative metric for this effort and we relied primarily on total cell sbv live dead derived from the syto9 signal for the remaining analyses finally both the biofilm growth method and sbv analysis method showed sufficient reproducibility that allowed for modeling of the data discussed below to further confirm that the type of surface bacteria coverage observed at high uv intensities fig 2b did not qualify as active biofilm growth eps imaging was conducted representative control and irradiated surfaces showing only eps fluorescence are seen in figs 2c and 2d respectively the selected images depict the same biofilms as shown in figs 2a and b respectively cona staining yielded semi continuous regions of distinct blue fluorescence in the denser portions of the control biofilms consistent with development of protective slime layers and three dimensional structures as biofilm establishment proceeded for surfaces irradiated at relatively high uv intensity only scattered discrete points of eps were observed which did not correlate strictly with the locations of live cells based on visual assessment since no regions of continuous eps coverage were observed in the controls the images indicate that this biovolume comprised only deposited planktonic cells most of which were likely inactivated and deposited eps particles which had sloughed off of or were excreted from biofilms upstream of the irradiation zone a similar pre biofilm presence of deposited eps was observed by yuan et al in a membrane bioreactor system yuan et al 2015 a comparison of eps biovolume data shown in fig 3 a showed a significant reduction in eps coverage upon uv irradiation because cona fluorescence was less intense than the live dead dyes higher laser power and detector gain were used during cslm analysis hence greater background fluorescence may have registered as biovolume to some extent and absolute eps and total cell sbv values were not directly comparable overall while cona fluorescence provided a useful qualitative means of distinguishing biofilm indicative structures from deposited bacteria it was not a reliable quantitative metric of the effect of uv irradiation on biofilm establishment when 9 sample points were used total cell biovolume live dead was therefore used for the intensity response analyses below 3 2 biofilm intensity response and modeling escherichia coli biofilms were grown for 48 h during exposure to continuous uv irradiation intensities ranging from 0 control to 351 µw cm2 the biofilm intensity response data are displayed in fig 3b and show a distinct inhibitory effect of uvc as expected the sbv data and thus average biofilm growth rates exhibited an exponential correlation to uv intensity our motivations and hypotheses presented in the introduction refer to a desire to determine minimum uv intensities for prevention of biofilm growth on surfaces in theory such minimum intensities could be obtained by fitting an intensity response model to the experimental sbv data and determining the minimum intensity at which sbv 0 in which case biofilm growth was fully prevented in practice however the sbv data in fig 3b exhibited asymptotic behavior at higher intensities and never reached zero value sbvs for the two highest irradiation intensities of 120 4 and 350 9 µw cm2 were 0 17 and 0 23 µm respectively therefore a wide range of uv intensities could result in near zero sbv values making such a minimum preventative intensity difficult to pinpoint precisely and overall less meaningful instead we defined an alternative parameter i5 for use as the primary metric of biofilm uv intensity response the i5 is defined as the uv intensity that results in a 48 h biofilm sbv that is 5 of what it would be under the same conditions without uv irradiation accordingly it is the intensity that results in a 95 reduction in average surface growth rate over 48 h the value of 5 was arbitrarily chosen as a value greater than 0 and where a model output of corresponding intensity would be less sensitive to the effects of biomass deposition from upstream of the flow cell to model the sbv data as a function of uv intensity and determine the i5 of e coli biofilms subject to the growth conditions used in this work the monod microbial kinetics equation was first modified to reflect biofilm surface growth 1 r d x d t μ 0 x where r is the biofilm specific volumetric growth rate µm h x is the sbv µm and µ0 is the specific growth rate constant in the absence of uv irradiation h 1 during exposure to uv irradiation under the same conditions the apparent specific growth rate constant is reduced proportionally to the uv intensity 2 μ i μ 0 k λ i where µi is the apparent irradiated specific growth rate constant h 1 kλ is a wavelength dependent intensity response factor cm2µw 1h 1 and i is the uv intensity µw cm2 thus for an irradiated surface 3 d x d t μ 0 k λ i x integrating this expression yields x f x 0 e x p μ 0 k λ i t model 1 where x0 reflects the initial biovolume present from the inoculation procedure prior to nutrient media flow and uv irradiation and xf is the final surface sbv nonlinear regression analysis was used to fit the model to our intensity response data and estimate the x0 and k254 parameters using the method of least squares the fit is shown in fig 4 a and the estimated parameters corresponding standard errors and nagelkerke pseudo r2 are shown in table 1 while the r2 is relatively high this model does not accurately reflect our data conceptually at higher uv intensities according to model 1 as i 0 µi µ0 and xf approaches the sbv of the control surface which is accurate however as i xf 0 since the net specific growth rate constant μ 0 k λ i can reach negative values the model thus approached a zero value of sbv at high intensity while the experimental data showed nonzero values in this range we therefore concluded that model 1 is appropriate only for a method wherein uv inactivated cells can be accurately distinguished and excluded from the biovolume measurement which is not the case with our data as they include inactivated cells in the biovolume measurement the assumption that virtually all cells present on the test surface under high intensity irradiation were inactivated and thus had no viable biovolume also must hold true for model 1 to be accurate to fit a more appropriate model to the intensity response data the modification of µ0 by uv irradiation previously equ 2 was replaced with the following 4 μ i μ 0 1 α λ i where αλ is a new form of intensity response factor with units of cm2 µw in this form as i 0 µi µ0 as before however as i µi 0 and does not reach negative values which better reflects our experimental findings the resulting model thus outputs a minimum residual x0 even at high uv intensities x f x 0 e x p μ 0 t 1 α λ i model 2 therein x0 may be considered a residual biovolume that indicates a minimum steady state presence of colloidal biomass on the surface which remains even when biofilm growth does not occur results of fitting model 2 using nonlinear regression analysis are shown in fig 4b resulting in an r2 of 0 97 and a better overall fit to the intensity response curve compared to model 1 estimated values and standard errors of the parameters α254 and x0 were determined using the method of least squares and shown in table 1 for determination of i5 for these growth conditions the sbv of the control sample xi 0 was corrected for x0 since x0 was also independent of uv irradiation thus the model 2 equation was solved for i while inputting an xf value of x f 0 05 x i 0 x 0 the i5 254 nm was determined to be 50 5 µw cm2 for e coli biofilms under these growth conditions the α254 value obtained by fitting this model may also serve as a parameter that reflects biofilm uv intensity response under a defined set of conditions though we consider i5 to have a more intuitive significance 3 3 implications herein for the first time the response of biofilm growth rates to continuous uv irradiation was elucidated explicitly and quantitatively our hypothesis which stated that the uv intensity required for biofilm prevention is orders of magnitude lower than what is needed for bulk stream disinfection did not prove to be accurate first the i5 of 50 5 µw cm2 was higher than anticipated surface deposited planktonic bacteria experiencing this intensity would receive a cumulative uvc dose of 20 mj cm2 in less than 7 min based on the uv dose response of the bacterial strain employed see text s6 and figure s3 a 20 mj cm2 dose results in approximately 5 log inactivation of planktonic e coli furthermore since growth occurred over 48 h most bacteria on the surface received much greater doses if no attenuation is assumed but were still able to form biofilms at intensities approximately less than or equal to 50 5 µw cm2 it is therefore evident that some of the deposited bacteria were substantially shielded from the uv photons and were able to propagate this shielding effect as the biofilms grew previous research has reported shielding and greatly diminished uv susceptibility of bacteria existing within interiors of biofilm matrices and suspended bacterial flocs argyraki et al 2016 bak et al 2009 kollu and örmeci 2012 li et al 2010 though further investigation is needed using more relevant slower growth conditions these results suggest that continuous uv irradiation of surfaces may not be capable of fully preventing biofilm establishment over long periods of time unless paired with some physical cleaning we also note that our experimental methods resulted in unwanted growth of biofilms upstream of the irradiation zone which acted to continually inoculate the flow cell with new biomass while exaggerated in this case actual uv device application in plumbing fixtures or liquid food processing streams are likely to experience a similar influx from upstream microbial activity further research is needed to determine if irradiation at levels close to or greater than the i5 can deter biofilm formation over longer time periods or if surface colonization eventually reaches a breakthrough point due to the accumulation of colloidal foulants future investigation of any correlations between key environmental parameters such as temperature or nutrients and the model parameters herein may also aid in rational design of uv equipped devices finally these findings may indicate that photocatalytic materials can contribute to biofilm prevention even though the biocidal actions of materials such as tio2 are much weaker compared to the direct mutagenic effects of uvc cho et al 2004 catalysts can assist in preventing adsorption of foulants and degrading polymeric substances and uv attenuating colloids at the surface li and logan 2005 a combined uv inactivation and photocatalytic anti fouling strategy may therefore act synergistically to delay or prevent biofilm establishment looking forward the study of biofilm uv intensity response could benefit from alternative biofilm analyses methods that in contrast to dye staining and cslm imaging provide a nondestructive and real time means of quantification for this work each intensity response data point required three 48 h experiments followed by time consuming analysis of the biofilm samples while this study resulted in generation of one intensity response curve hypotheses related to the effect of environmental or irradiation parameters on intensity response would require many such datasets e g modeling the effect of water nutrient contents on i5 or αλ faster and more indirect means of quantifying biofilm growth would benefit these efforts additionally biofilm quantification after a fixed growth period e g 48 h provides only a snapshot of the growth behavior biofilms are known to follow s shaped growth kinetics wherein µ0 changes over time to reflect lag exponential and stationary phases jopia et al 2010 verotta et al 2017 future intensity response studies might benefit from analyzing this kinetic behavior during uv irradiation which would require methods for monitoring biofilm growth without the influential effects of dye staining 4 conclusion an experimental method and model that allow quantification of the response of biofilm growth to uv irradiation were successfully developed e coli biofilm intensity response at 254 nm was lower than anticipated considering the planktonic cell dose response and cumulative surfaces doses delivered the previously known shielding effects associated with biofilm materials appear to impart substantial protection even when biofilm growth is initiated during

functionality criteria of were identified for a laboratory biofilm growth and irradiation setup capable of producing the desired data first the apparatus and methods needed to be capable of growing biofilms on submerged test surfaces at consistent rates in the absence of uvc irradiation in order to establish baseline growth rates for comparison and for serving as experimental controls since our focus was on examining uv intensity response on a fundamental level environmentally relevant conditions i e biofilm establishment occurring over weeks or months were not prioritized instead conditions which resulted in significant biofilm coverage within 1 2 days were employed in order to expedite the experiments second the apparatus needed to achieve irradiation of the test surface with precisely known uvc intensities while holding all other conditions identical to the control experiments the uvc intensity impinging on the test surface also needed to be tunable within a certain range of interest lastly a means of quantifying the resulting biofilm growth was sought specific biovolume sbv was selected as the main quantifiable biofilm parameter herein which is defined as the volume of fluorescing cells µm3 see below per superficial area of the test surface µm2 and is reported in units of µm i e µm3 µm2 since the growth time of our experiments was fixed the final sbvs on the surfaces were also directly proportional to the average biofilm growth rates µm h furthermore because accelerated growth conditions involving injection of a concentrated bacterial suspension were used described below an ability to distinguish between biovolume associated with biofilm growth i e active surface colonization and biovolume attributed simply to colloidal deposition of planktonic cells was deemed useful 2 2 flow cell biofilm growth system biofilms were grown in a two chamber flow cell biosurface technologies corp containing flowing aqueous growth medium with each chamber having volume and depth of 0 131 ml and 0 33 mm respectively the configuration is shown in fig 1 the flow cell was equipped with glass viewing windows over each chamber one of which in this case was replaced with a custom made fused silica glass cover slip which served as an irradiation window 60 240 0 2 mm technical glass products the total uv transmittance of the cover slip glass at 254 nm uvt254 was 99 as determined by a uv vis spectrometer the inner surface of the windows in contact with the solution served as the test surface for biofilm growth we note that this configuration resulted in uv emanating from the surface during irradiation bottom up rather than approaching from the direction of the bulk solution top down while top down irradiation is more pertinent to device applications it requires the uv beam to penetrate the solution which contains solutes and colloidal material therefore bottom up irradiation enabled stricter control of uv intensity directly at the surface for untarnished observation of biofilm intensity response influent solution was pumped into the two chambers simultaneously in parallel using two peristaltic pumps for each irradiation experiment one of the chambers retained its original borosilicate glass window with uvt254 of 0 thus resulting in growth of a non irradiated biofilm for quantitative comparison and to serve as a quality control check trials wherein unusually low growth in the control chamber was observed were excluded from the data further details of the flow cell biofilm growth system are found in the supporting information text s1 2 3 bacteria and growth medium fda strain escherichia coli atcc 25922tm was chosen as a model biofilm forming bacterium for use herein due to its ability to rapidly grow biofilms on surfaces and its nonpathogenic nature ashby et al 1994 naves et al 2008 propagation and preparation of the suspensions used for inoculation of the flow cells is described in text s2 a custom growth medium was also developed for use in the flow cells as part of this work which was optimized to achieve maximal uvt254 while still resulting in rapid e coli growth ultimately a formula comprising m9 media salts tryptic soy broth tsb and glucose was developed with a uvt254 of 68 cm 1 the optimization methods and precise composition are described in text s3 despite the use of a bottom up irradiation approach in this work minimization of uv attenuation by the solution was desired so that suspended bacteria approaching within microns of the surface would encounter uv photons more similarly to in a top down irradiation scenario 2 4 surface irradiation system to irradiate the test surfaces with uv the flow cells were place in a collimated beam apparatus constructed according to bolton and linden 2003 and kuo et al 2003 with the irradiation windows oriented toward the beam fig 1 the apparatus comprised a low pressure mercury lamp blackened collimating tube and exposure platform to achieve variable uvc intensities one of two lamps was employed 4 w or 15 w while additionally adjusting the distance of the lamp from the tube entrance and placing fused silica glass plates at the tube entrance to serve as mild attenuating filters for each lamp configuration uvc intensity µw cm2 was determined systematically at the location of the flow cell window along the vertical axis using a radiometer with germicidal detector head solar light co and protocol provided by bolton et al 2015 full details are provided in text s4 temperature of the irradiation chamber was maintained at 28 1 c using a small space heater which also circulated air around the flow cells 2 5 biofilm growth and irradiation experimental procedure all system components which contacted the solutions including the flow cell were autoclaved before each experiment biofilm growth experiments began by filling the flow cell with tsb solution via the injection ports and waiting 1 h followed by injection of 2 ml of stationary phase e coli suspension 109 cfu ml then allowing to sit for another 1 h pumping of sterilized growth media through the flow cell at 0 25 ml min was then initiated and the uv lamp was engaged biofilms were allowed to grow for 48 h before both pumping and irradiation were ceased this approach thus simulated device application scenarios wherein the surface of interest initially contains no established biofilm coverage but is already contaminated with some bacteria when the uv source is initiated biofilm analysis methods immediately following the growth procedure the flow cell was perfused with a 0 85 nacl rinse solution and disconnected from the tubing and the growth surfaces were analyzed via confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm nikon eclipse ti a custom built mounting stage was employed that allowed positioning of the entire flow cell over the microscope objective lens and for laser excitation and imaging of the growth surface to be conducted through the irradiation window hence disturbance and manipulation of the biofilms was minimized and full hydration was preserved prior to imaging the flow cell contents were stained by injecting fluorescent dyes including syto9 and propidium iodide pi nucleic acid stains in order to contrast live dead cells and dead cells respectively live dead baclighttm invitrogen usa ben sasson et al 2014 additionally concavalin a cona cf 405s biotium inc fermont california was used to stain and image extracellular polymeric substances eps cslm images were captured at different depths in the middle of the flow cell scanning a total area of 0 41 mm2 of the biofilm three such scans were performed at random points within each biofilm sample and averaged to obtain one result experiments at each intensity were further performed in triplicate to yield a total of 9 datapoints for each intensity condition scanning and processing of the data using the comstat plug in for imagej software enabled determination of the live cell dead cell and eps associated sbvs for each biofilm sample heydorn et al 2000 while absolute experimental sbv values are somewhat subjective and influenced by imaging parameters e g excitation intensity detector gain etc our results and discussion focus on relative values of sbv as compared to the control biofilms complete details of staining procedure microscope configuration and analyses are provided in text s5 2 6 planktonic cell dose response the uvc dose response of planktonic stationary phase e coli was determined using collimated beam experiments and spread plate assays described further in text s6 a delayed chick watson model rennecker et al 1999 was fit to the inactivation data 2 7 data analysis and modeling the results and discussion presented below focus primarily on the dataset comprising experimental values of sbv following a fixed growth period as a function of uvc intensity following data collection models were developed that related sbv to uvc intensity under a fixed set of growth conditions referred to hereafter as intensity response models model development and parameters are discussed in the results and discussion model fits pseudo r2 standard error and p values of model parameters were determined using nonlinear regression in r software r core team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of method assessment representative cslm images of control and irradiated e coli biofilms using live dead and eps staining are shown in figs 2 a and b as evidenced by the dense coverage of green stained cells on the control sample fig 2a the biofilm growth methods resulted in successful surface colonization on the test surface within 48 h the surface irradiated at maximum uv intensity 351 µw cm2 however showed much less coverage with only scattered and seemingly individual cells that exhibited both live and dead red fluorescence as is evident from the additional data discussed below such bacteria coverage constituted a minimum threshold of biovolume that appeared even at prohibitively high uv intensities we attribute this behavior not to biofilm establishment but to colloidal adsorption of cells contained in the original inoculum injection additionally biofilm growth was visually observed in the flow cell entrance port upstream of the irradiated zone as a result of incidental inoculation during the initial injection of bacteria this biofilm presence contributed to cells and biofilm particles entering the flow cell chambers throughout the growth period regardless of uv intensity while the irradiated surface had a higher proportion of red dead cells compared to the control significant numbers of green fluorescing cells were also observed this was a result of the mode of action of the live dead stain being incongruous with the mechanism of uv inactivation cates et al 2011 craik et al 2000 the employed fluorescent stains only allowed differentiation between cells with ruptured membranes and those with intact membranes however since uv inactivation acts via dna mutagenesis and does not directly affect membrane integrity many inactivated bacteria on the surface did not express red fluorescence as their membranes were still intact live dead fraction was thus found to be an uninformative metric for this effort and we relied primarily on total cell sbv live dead derived from the syto9 signal for the remaining analyses finally both the biofilm growth method and sbv analysis method showed sufficient reproducibility that allowed for modeling of the data discussed below to further confirm that the type of surface bacteria coverage observed at high uv intensities fig 2b did not qualify as active biofilm growth eps imaging was conducted representative control and irradiated surfaces showing only eps fluorescence are seen in figs 2c and 2d respectively the selected images depict the same biofilms as shown in figs 2a and b respectively cona staining yielded semi continuous regions of distinct blue fluorescence in the denser portions of the control biofilms consistent with development of protective slime layers and three dimensional structures as biofilm establishment proceeded for surfaces irradiated at relatively high uv intensity only scattered discrete points of eps were observed which did not correlate strictly with the locations of live cells based on visual assessment since no regions of continuous eps coverage were observed in the controls the images indicate that this biovolume comprised only deposited planktonic cells most of which were likely inactivated and deposited eps particles which had sloughed off of or were excreted from biofilms upstream of the irradiation zone a similar pre biofilm presence of deposited eps was observed by yuan et al in a membrane bioreactor system yuan et al 2015 a comparison of eps biovolume data shown in fig 3 a showed a significant reduction in eps coverage upon uv irradiation because cona fluorescence was less intense than the live dead dyes higher laser power and detector gain were used during cslm analysis hence greater background fluorescence may have registered as biovolume to some extent and absolute eps and total cell sbv values were not directly comparable overall while cona fluorescence provided a useful qualitative means of distinguishing biofilm indicative structures from deposited bacteria it was not a reliable quantitative metric of the effect of uv irradiation on biofilm establishment when 9 sample points were used total cell biovolume live dead was therefore used for the intensity response analyses below 3 2 biofilm intensity response and modeling escherichia coli biofilms were grown for 48 h during exposure to continuous uv irradiation intensities ranging from 0 control to 351 µw cm2 the biofilm intensity response data are displayed in fig 3b and show a distinct inhibitory effect of uvc as expected the sbv data and thus average biofilm growth rates exhibited an exponential correlation to uv intensity our motivations and hypotheses presented in the introduction refer to a desire to determine minimum uv intensities for prevention of biofilm growth on surfaces in theory such minimum intensities could be obtained by fitting an intensity response model to the experimental sbv data and determining the minimum intensity at which sbv 0 in which case biofilm growth was fully prevented in practice however the sbv data in fig 3b exhibited asymptotic behavior at higher intensities and never reached zero value sbvs for the two highest irradiation intensities of 120 4 and 350 9 µw cm2 were 0 17 and 0 23 µm respectively therefore a wide range of uv intensities could result in near zero sbv values making such a minimum preventative intensity difficult to pinpoint precisely and overall less meaningful instead we defined an alternative parameter i5 for use as the primary metric of biofilm uv intensity response the i5 is defined as the uv intensity that results in a 48 h biofilm sbv that is 5 of what it would be under the same conditions without uv irradiation accordingly it is the intensity that results in a 95 reduction in average surface growth rate over 48 h the value of 5 was arbitrarily chosen as a value greater than 0 and where a model output of corresponding intensity would be less sensitive to the effects of biomass deposition from upstream of the flow cell to model the sbv data as a function of uv intensity and determine the i5 of e coli biofilms subject to the growth conditions used in this work the monod microbial kinetics equation was first modified to reflect biofilm surface growth 1 r d x d t μ 0 x where r is the biofilm specific volumetric growth rate µm h x is the sbv µm and µ0 is the specific growth rate constant in the absence of uv irradiation h 1 during exposure to uv irradiation under the same conditions the apparent specific growth rate constant is reduced proportionally to the uv intensity 2 μ i μ 0 k λ i where µi is the apparent irradiated specific growth rate constant h 1 kλ is a wavelength dependent intensity response factor cm2µw 1h 1 and i is the uv intensity µw cm2 thus for an irradiated surface 3 d x d t μ 0 k λ i x integrating this expression yields x f x 0 e x p μ 0 k λ i t model 1 where x0 reflects the initial biovolume present from the inoculation procedure prior to nutrient media flow and uv irradiation and xf is the final surface sbv nonlinear regression analysis was used to fit the model to our intensity response data and estimate the x0 and k254 parameters using the method of least squares the fit is shown in fig 4 a and the estimated parameters corresponding standard errors and nagelkerke pseudo r2 are shown in table 1 while the r2 is relatively high this model does not accurately reflect our data conceptually at higher uv intensities according to model 1 as i 0 µi µ0 and xf approaches the sbv of the control surface which is accurate however as i xf 0 since the net specific growth rate constant μ 0 k λ i can reach negative values the model thus approached a zero value of sbv at high intensity while the experimental data showed nonzero values in this range we therefore concluded that model 1 is appropriate only for a method wherein uv inactivated cells can be accurately distinguished and excluded from the biovolume measurement which is not the case with our data as they include inactivated cells in the biovolume measurement the assumption that virtually all cells present on the test surface under high intensity irradiation were inactivated and thus had no viable biovolume also must hold true for model 1 to be accurate to fit a more appropriate model to the intensity response data the modification of µ0 by uv irradiation previously equ 2 was replaced with the following 4 μ i μ 0 1 α λ i where αλ is a new form of intensity response factor with units of cm2 µw in this form as i 0 µi µ0 as before however as i µi 0 and does not reach negative values which better reflects our experimental findings the resulting model thus outputs a minimum residual x0 even at high uv intensities x f x 0 e x p μ 0 t 1 α λ i model 2 therein x0 may be considered a residual biovolume that indicates a minimum steady state presence of colloidal biomass on the surface which remains even when biofilm growth does not occur results of fitting model 2 using nonlinear regression analysis are shown in fig 4b resulting in an r2 of 0 97 and a better overall fit to the intensity response curve compared to model 1 estimated values and standard errors of the parameters α254 and x0 were determined using the method of least squares and shown in table 1 for determination of i5 for these growth conditions the sbv of the control sample xi 0 was corrected for x0 since x0 was also independent of uv irradiation thus the model 2 equation was solved for i while inputting an xf value of x f 0 05 x i 0 x 0 the i5 254 nm was determined to be 50 5 µw cm2 for e coli biofilms under these growth conditions the α254 value obtained by fitting this model may also serve as a parameter that reflects biofilm uv intensity response under a defined set of conditions though we consider i5 to have a more intuitive significance 3 3 implications herein for the first time the response of biofilm growth rates to continuous uv irradiation was elucidated explicitly and quantitatively our hypothesis which stated that the uv intensity required for biofilm prevention is orders of magnitude lower than what is needed for bulk stream disinfection did not prove to be accurate first the i5 of 50 5 µw cm2 was higher than anticipated surface deposited planktonic bacteria experiencing this intensity would receive a cumulative uvc dose of 20 mj cm2 in less than 7 min based on the uv dose response of the bacterial strain employed see text s6 and figure s3 a 20 mj cm2 dose results in approximately 5 log inactivation of planktonic e coli furthermore since growth occurred over 48 h most bacteria on the surface received much greater doses if no attenuation is assumed but were still able to form biofilms at intensities approximately less than or equal to 50 5 µw cm2 it is therefore evident that some of the deposited bacteria were substantially shielded from the uv photons and were able to propagate this shielding effect as the biofilms grew previous research has reported shielding and greatly diminished uv susceptibility of bacteria existing within interiors of biofilm matrices and suspended bacterial flocs argyraki et al 2016 bak et al 2009 kollu and örmeci 2012 li et al 2010 though further investigation is needed using more relevant slower growth conditions these results suggest that continuous uv irradiation of surfaces may not be capable of fully preventing biofilm establishment over long periods of time unless paired with some physical cleaning we also note that our experimental methods resulted in unwanted growth of biofilms upstream of the irradiation zone which acted to continually inoculate the flow cell with new biomass while exaggerated in this case actual uv device application in plumbing fixtures or liquid food processing streams are likely to experience a similar influx from upstream microbial activity further research is needed to determine if irradiation at levels close to or greater than the i5 can deter biofilm formation over longer time periods or if surface colonization eventually reaches a breakthrough point due to the accumulation of colloidal foulants future investigation of any correlations between key environmental parameters such as temperature or nutrients and the model parameters herein may also aid in rational design of uv equipped devices finally these findings may indicate that photocatalytic materials can contribute to biofilm prevention even though the biocidal actions of materials such as tio2 are much weaker compared to the direct mutagenic effects of uvc cho et al 2004 catalysts can assist in preventing adsorption of foulants and degrading polymeric substances and uv attenuating colloids at the surface li and logan 2005 a combined uv inactivation and photocatalytic anti fouling strategy may therefore act synergistically to delay or prevent biofilm establishment looking forward the study of biofilm uv intensity response could benefit from alternative biofilm analyses methods that in contrast to dye staining and cslm imaging provide a nondestructive and real time means of quantification for this work each intensity response data point required three 48 h experiments followed by time consuming analysis of the biofilm samples while this study resulted in generation of one intensity response curve hypotheses related to the effect of environmental or irradiation parameters on intensity response would require many such datasets e g modeling the effect of water nutrient contents on i5 or αλ faster and more indirect means of quantifying biofilm growth would benefit these efforts additionally biofilm quantification after a fixed growth period e g 48 h provides only a snapshot of the growth behavior biofilms are known to follow s shaped growth kinetics wherein µ0 changes over time to reflect lag exponential and stationary phases jopia et al 2010 verotta et al 2017 future intensity response studies might benefit from analyzing this kinetic behavior during uv irradiation which would require methods for monitoring biofilm growth without the influential effects of dye staining 4 conclusion an experimental method and model that allow quantification of the response of biofilm growth to uv irradiation were successfully developed e coli biofilm intensity response at 254 nm was lower than anticipated considering the planktonic cell dose response and cumulative surfaces doses delivered the previously known shielding effects associated with biofilm materials appear to impart substantial protection even when biofilm growth is initiated during

release and other nutrient cycles has been initially investigated and studied in oligo mesotrophic lakes nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration were coupled song et al 2018 while iron fe and p flux from lake sediments can be independent from each other and can be controlled by dissolved organic c in a shallow polymictic reservoir that had not received large amounts of nutrient loading müller et al 2016 in eutrophic lakes it is often suggested that the mechanism underlying oxygen controlled p release is the reduction of fe iii oxyhydroxides that results in the dissolution and release of orthophosphate amirbahman et al 2003 loh et al 2013 chen et al 2019 the mechanisms involved in p cycling are more complex than merely the absence of oxygen and resulting reductive conditions müller et al 2016 the enrichment of nitrogen n and c can result in p release through the formation of anaerobic status and alkaline phosphatase production chlot et al 2013 li et al 2016 in stratified lakes internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than total phosphorus loads zhu et al 2017 and carbon and phosphorus regeneration were coupled song et al 2018 in shallow lakes increasing p loading has often been accompanied by a shift from a clear water macrophyte dominated state to a turbid state featuring phytoplankton dominance klamt et al 2019 different pathways

correlation analysis cca was also performed by r software according to the otu table and some key environmental factors 3 results and discussion serious algal bloom broke out in summer in lake qingling and south basin of lake yandong yd4 6 in term of chl a concentration fig 2 a based on the algae and macrophyte growth as well as trophic state index tsi results table s 1 north basin of lake yandong yd1 2 was defined as macrophyte dominated lake north basin of lake qingling ql4 6 was defined as algal dominated lake south basin of lake yandong yd3 6 and qingling ql1 3 was defined as early and later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae respectively in all studied lakes available inorganic n concentration was very high in surface and interstitial water fig 2c and 3 b which should not be regarded as the limiting factor for phytoplankton 3 1 algal dominance north basin of lake qingling in north basin of lake qingling ql4 6 with algal dominance algal bloom was supported by srp in surface and interstitial water which exhibited the significantly highest level p 0 01 among all studied sampling sites figs 2b and 3a the high concentration of srp was believed to be derived from sediments according to the significantly higher tp p 0 01 fig 4 b fe ooh p and caco3 p p 0 01 fig 5 a as well as epc0 p 0 01 fig 6 a and qmax fig 6b in sediments the high contents of tp and fe ooh p indicated that there was an abundance of bioavailable p in sediments most of which could be easily desorbed fe ooh p has been regarded as the main form of p released in eutrophic water bodies van helmond et al 2020 especially in spring and summer which was regulated by oxygen in bottom layer liu et al 2020 in this study the high dha in sediments fig 7 e suggested the strong microbial activity and oxygen consumption supporting the fe ooh p desorption comparatively tom fig 4c toc fig 4d labile organic matter fig 5b glu and lipase activity fig 7c and 7d were unremarkably high suggesting that organic matter decomposition did not imply oxygen consumption the possible explanation was that microbial respiration fueled the anoxia process hypoxia may increase due to enhanced respiration caused by higher temperatures and dissolved organic matter synergistically nydahl et al 2013 in addition significantly higher epc0 and qmax representing p release potential and capacity respectively facilitated the regenerated p to be quickly released into interstitial and overlying water in regime with algal dominance high and easily degradable organic matter could give rise to the labile species and load of p as well as its sorption capacity in different manners thereby controlling the epc0 li et al 2014 seasonally anoxia triggered the srp regeneration and release according to seasonal variation of fe ooh p epc0 and qmax as well as srp in interstitial water fig 3a 5a and 6 in spring which met p demand for algal bloom in summer on the contrary organic p hydrolysis mediated by alkaline phosphatase produced by opb and caco3 p dissociation mediating by organic acid produced by ipb contributed less significantly to p regeneration based on the apa opb and ipb values figs 7a and 8 hence in eutrophic lake with high n and p strong desorption of fe ooh p driven by anoxia and release potential expressed by epc0 both resulted in the p accumulation in interstitial and surface water inducing algal bloom species to switch from cyanobacteria to chlorophyta 3 2 late period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae south basin of lake qingling in the south basin of lake qingling ql1 3 and lake yandong yd3 6 with algae and macrophyte regime shifting algal bloom and macrophyte coexisted in summer fig 2a however there were a lot of differences in these two basins in lake qingling ql1 3 with later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae the dominant algae and macrophyte were cyanobacteria and lotus respectively abundant lotus detritus deposited over sediments resulting in the significantly higher organic p n and c p 0 05 fig 4 especially labile part p 0 01 fig 5b compared to the other basins the high organic n and c induced the production of lap glu and lipase for organic matter decomposition fig 7b 7c and 7d resulting in anoxia as shown by high dha fig 7e and inorganic n was released as nh4 n form in surface and interstitial water fig 2c and 3b however even if anoxia occurred fe ooh p desorption and release was not the main p source in south basin of lake qingling ql1 3 due to the relatively low fe ooh p and fe3 fig 5a and 5c as well as epc0 fig 6a on the other hand the slightly high apa in sediment fig 7a and significantly higher psb fig 8 coupled with the high tp and caco3 p fig 4b and 5a indicated that organic p hydrolysis and caco3 p dissociation driven by psb contributed greatly to p regeneration due to high phosphorus solubilizing ability and extensive substrate adaptability as well as quick turnover velocity psb have been considered to be very important for p regeneration in biofilms attached on algae yang et al 2017 sediments in lake and wetland qian et al 2010 soils wang et al 2020 especially in water bodies with phosphorus limited and potential risk of eutrophication and algal bloom psb allowed diversification in regeneration pathways and p release liu et al 2017 furthermore on the conditions of limited p pool the high p turnover rate mediated by alkaline phosphatase xiao et al 2018 facilitated the rapid utilization of p and growth of algae that require less p wan et al 2019 such as microcystis bloom in this study expressed by the low srp in surface water and high chl a in summer fig 2a and 2b in south basin of lake qingling ql1 4 hence in lake qingling ql1 3 psb enriched with high available organic carbon drove the main p regeneration pathway through the enzymatic hydrolysis and dissociation in addition nutrients exchange from the north basin of lake qingling due to the demolition of embankment accelerated the regime shifting from macraphytes to algae in the south basin it is predictable that abundant of regenerated and exogenous p jointly supported algal bloom and after collapse the p could be rapidly recycled and utilized finally algae would suppress the macrophyte growth 3 3 early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae south basin of lake yandong in the south basin of lake yandong yd3 6 with early period of regime shifting from macrophytes to algae srp is also limited in surface water fig 2b and interstitial water fig 3a and the dominant algae and macrophytes were cyanobacteria and vallisnerianatans respectively compared to south basin of lake qingling ql1 3 the significantly lower tp p 0 05 fig 4b p fractions p 0 05 fig 5a apa p 0 05 fig 7a and psb p 0 01 fig 8 indicated that p accumulation in sediment was limited and all p regeneration pathways from sediments were blocked in south basin of lake yandong yd3 6 even though the same high glu was observed fig 7c in sediments of lake yandong yd3 6 and lake qingling ql1 3 the significantly lower tom p 0 01 fig 4c toc p 0 01 fig 4d available organic matter p 0 01 fig 5b lipase p 0 05 fig 7d dha p 0 01 fig 7e suggested that organic carbon decomposition did not result in anoxia in sediments of lake yandong yd3 6 all these findings suggested that in lake yandong yd3 6 internal p regeneration and release was not primarily responsible for algal bloom which should be attributed to the exogenous input due to bait feeding and fecal excretion during aquaculture process 3 4 macrophyte dominance north basin of lake yandong in north basin of lake yandong yd1 2 with macrophyte dominance almost all parameters related to p including srp in surface and interstitial water fig 2b 3a tp in sediments fig 4b p fractions fig 5a p sorption fig 6 exhibited the lowest level which indicated the p deficiency finally inducing the similar level apa as the other basins fig 7a however the parameters related to c and n including n forms in surface fig 2c and interstitial water fig 3b tn tom and toc in sediments fig 4a 4c and 4d labile organic matter and fe forms fig 5b 5c enzymatic activities mediating c and n fig 7b 7d did not show the significantly low level all these results suggested the close coupling between c and n cycling which was not associated with p cycling in lake yandong yd1 2 hence algal bloom did not occur due to p limitation in this basin obviously the coupling among c n and p cycling made a positive impact on p regeneration and supply in which process the role of microbes should be addressed 3 5 the role of functional microorganisms and nutrients coupling in this study the relative abundance of the whole bacteria community and p solubilizing microorganisms varied in different basin fig s 1 and s 2 furthermore pcoa revealed that the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing showed the significant heterogeneity in different basins of lake fig 9 the p solubilizing microorganisms abundance based on the heatmap analysis fig s 3 and psb counting fig 8 was consistent indicating the different level in different regime however the sampling sites in south and north basin of lake qingling were distributed in different zone fig 9 suggesting the huge difference of organic p hydrolysis function in algae dominated regime and later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae furthermore the sampling sites in south and north basin of lake yandong were grouped together fig 9 indicating that the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing did not shift in macrophyte dominated regime and early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae all these facts indicated the inconsistency among functional microorganisms abundance community composition and their function which could explain the different p regeneration mode in different regime in addition in the cca analysis the p solubilizing microorganisms were mainly regulated by the parameters related to c cho tom lipid glu chl a n prt tn ammonium nitrate in sediment and water p asop palk fe fe2 tfe and o dha in later period of regime from macrophyte to algae ql2 fig 10 this result further proved the importance of organic p hydrolysis mediated by apa in this regime which maximized its function through coupling to the other nutrient cycling such as n c fe and o in algae dominated regime ql5 the parameters related to p such as different p forms in water and sediment mainly influenced the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing fig 10 indicating that alkaline phosphatase and p relationship was regulated by an inhibition induction mechanism furthermore in macrophyte dominated regime and early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae yd1 and yd5 even though glu and p in water both regulated the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing fig 10 the coupling between c and p did not occur and the pathway of p regeneration was blocked the stoichiometric coupling between growth limiting nutrient and the other nutrients in both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes could exert profound effect on phytoplankton production thingstad et al 2008 in eutrophic lakes enrichment of n and c can result in p release through the formation of anaerobic status and alkaline phosphatase production li et al 2016 internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than phosphorus highlighting the potential importance of nitrogen loads exerting a control over systems that become phosphorus limited zhu et al 2017 hence different p regeneration and supply pathways existed in different regimes and the different levels of coupling with other nutrients determined the pathway and strength of endogenous p regeneration to some extent 4 conclusions taken together in lakes with different regimes the p supply pathways and underlying mechanisms was completely different in lakes with algal dominance the main p regeneration pathway was the release and desorption of fe ooh p driven by anoxia in lakes being later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae organic p hydrolysis and caco3 p dissociation driven by psb contributed greatly to p regeneration in lakes being early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae exogenous p input was the main p supply mode in lakes with macrophyte dominance p supply was insufficient the coupling of multiple nutrient cycles especially c n p o and fe could effectively increase the pathways diversification and the strength of p regeneration declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

enzymatic activities phosphorus sorption abundance of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria psb total and specific containing phosphatase gene microbial community composition in sediments were analyzed in lakes with macrophyte dominance p supply pathway from sediment to water column was blocked in lakes being early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae exogenous p input was the main p supply mode in lakes being later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae organic p hydrolysis and calcium bound p dissociation driven by psb contributed greatly to p regeneration which was continuous and trickling in this process rapid c and n cycles fueled p regeneration in lakes with algal dominance given the significantly higher iron bound p fe ooh p equilibriums phosphorus concentration and dehydrogenase activity the main p regeneration pathway might be the desorption of fe ooh p driven by anoxia showing the seasonal and pulsed characteristics in addition during the process of regime shift from macrophyte to algae the dominant algal species switched from cyanobacteria to chlorophyta p solubilizing microorganisms correlated with environmental factors suggesting

crucial role in health status of aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2019 gu et al 2020 in lacustrine systems a preferential regeneration of p compared to carbon c occurs which may result in a positive feedback among bottom water anoxia enhanced p regeneration and algal bloom chen et al 2019 bioavailable p may be regenerated from seston andersen and jensen 1992 chen et al 2019 algal detritus zhang et al 2018 and sediments solim and wanganeo 2009 li et al 2016 van helmond et al 2020 etc p regeneration and release from lake sediments can be affected by various factors song et al 2019 first it can be induced by organic detritus decomposition solim and wanganeo 2009 hypoxia may increase due to bacterial respiration and algal detritus decomposition huang and chen 2013 harrison et al 2017 as a consequence redox sensitive p fraction especially iron bound p fe ooh p is released from sediments li et al 2016 van helmond et al 2020 furthermore nutrient regeneration mediated by microbial extracellular enzymes is another p release pathway cao et al 2005 zhou et al 2007 arnosti et al 2014 li et al 2016 song et al 2018 the quick turnover rate mediated by microbial extracellular enzymes mainly alkaline phosphatase in p limited conditions xiao et al 2018 results in a rapid p solubilization of organic phosphates with algal growth wan et al 2019 moreover phosphorus solubilizing bacteria psb have been recognized to play an important role in p mineralization in freshwater ecosystems qian et al 2010 singh and tejo 2012 liu et al 2017 a process which could accelerate p regeneration through the enzymatic hydrolysis of organic p and release of inorganically bound p respectively zhou et al 2011 qu et al 2013 maitra et al 2015 liu et al 2017 in sediments relationship between p release and other nutrient cycles has been initially investigated and studied in oligo mesotrophic lakes nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration were coupled song et al 2018 while iron fe and p flux from lake sediments can be independent from each other and can be controlled by dissolved organic c in a shallow polymictic reservoir that had not received large amounts of nutrient loading müller et al 2016 in eutrophic lakes it is often suggested that the mechanism underlying oxygen controlled p release is the reduction of fe iii oxyhydroxides that results in the dissolution and release of orthophosphate amirbahman et al 2003 loh et al 2013 chen et al 2019 the mechanisms involved in p cycling are more complex than merely the absence of oxygen and resulting reductive conditions müller et al 2016 the enrichment of nitrogen n and c can result in p release through the formation of anaerobic status and alkaline phosphatase production chlot et al 2013 li et al 2016 in stratified lakes internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than total phosphorus loads zhu et al 2017 and carbon and phosphorus regeneration were coupled song et al 2018 in shallow lakes increasing p loading has often been accompanied by a shift from a clear water macrophyte dominated state to a turbid state featuring phytoplankton dominance klamt et al 2019 different pathways of nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration mediated by extracellular enzymes were observed in temperate lakes under various trophic state song et al 2018 and the amount of p released from dissolved organic phosphorus mediated by phosphatase was compared to that of p excretion by zooplankton in hardwater lakes of different trophic level birte et al 1996 however the pathways and mechanisms of p regeneration under different regimes are still relatively poorly studied to fill this gap two lakes representing algal and macrophyte dominance as well as alternative regimes were chosen as study sites surface water and sediment samples were collected at 12 sites seasonally from october 2017 to july 2018 in a subsection of wuhan city china and analyzed for total organic matter tom and labile

enzymes activities dehydrogenase activity dha abundance of psb ferrous iron fe2 and total iron tfe in sediment n and p compounds in surface and interstitial water and chlorophyll a chl a in the surface were analyzed furthermore in sediments the whole bacterial community and p solubilizing microorganisms were analyzed the objective of this study was to better understand the pathways and mechanisms of p supply under different regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection lake qingling is artificially divided into two parts the north basin ql4 6 serves as a fish farm with severe eutrophication and algal bloom the south basin ql1 3 was covered by macrophytes in 2015 water exchanged between the two basins due to the demolition of embankment and algal bloom began to appear and coexisted with macrophyte in the south basin lake yandong is known to be a classical macrophyte dominated lake in 2000 it was also artificially divided into two parts in south part yd3 6 the water quality gradually deteriorated and an algal bloom appeared and macrophytes declined due to fish culture the north basin yd1 2 was in oligotrophy with macrophytes covering fig 1 surface water samples were taken by an organic glass hydrophore and surface sediments samples were taken using a peterson grab sampler all the samples were immediately stored in cooling boxes for transportation to the laboratory the sediment samples for dna extraction and molecular analysis were frozen at 80 c the interstitial water was separated from the sediment particles by centrifugation

qingling and south basin of lake yandong yd4 6 in term of chl a concentration fig 2 a based on the algae and macrophyte growth as well as trophic state index tsi results table s 1 north basin of lake yandong yd1 2 was defined as macrophyte dominated lake north basin of lake qingling ql4 6 was defined as algal dominated lake south basin of lake yandong yd3 6 and qingling ql1 3 was defined as early and later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae respectively in all studied lakes available inorganic n concentration was very high in surface and interstitial water fig 2c and 3 b which should not be regarded as the limiting factor for phytoplankton 3 1 algal dominance north basin of lake qingling in north basin of lake qingling ql4 6 with algal dominance algal bloom was supported by srp in surface and interstitial water which exhibited the significantly highest level p 0 01 among all studied sampling sites figs 2b and 3a the high concentration of srp was believed to be derived from sediments according to the significantly higher tp p 0 01 fig 4 b fe ooh p and caco3 p p 0 01 fig 5 a as well as epc0 p 0 01 fig 6 a and qmax fig 6b in sediments the high contents of tp and fe ooh p indicated that there was an abundance of bioavailable p in sediments most of which could be easily desorbed fe ooh p has been regarded as the main form of p released in eutrophic water bodies van helmond et al 2020 especially in spring and summer which was regulated by oxygen in bottom layer liu et al 2020 in this study the high dha in sediments fig 7 e suggested the strong microbial activity and oxygen consumption supporting the fe ooh p desorption comparatively tom fig 4c toc fig 4d labile organic matter fig 5b glu and lipase activity fig 7c and 7d were unremarkably high suggesting that organic matter decomposition did not imply oxygen consumption the possible explanation was that microbial respiration fueled the anoxia process hypoxia may increase due to enhanced respiration caused by higher temperatures and dissolved organic matter synergistically nydahl et al 2013 in addition significantly higher epc0 and qmax representing p release potential and capacity respectively facilitated the regenerated p to be quickly released into interstitial and overlying water in regime with algal dominance high and easily degradable organic matter could give rise to the labile species and load of p as well as its sorption capacity in different manners thereby controlling the epc0 li et al 2014 seasonally anoxia triggered the srp regeneration and release according to seasonal variation of fe ooh p epc0 and qmax as well as srp in interstitial water fig 3a 5a and 6 in spring which met p demand for algal bloom in summer on the contrary organic p hydrolysis mediated by alkaline phosphatase produced by opb and caco3 p dissociation mediating by organic acid produced by ipb contributed less significantly to p regeneration based on the apa opb and ipb values figs 7a and 8 hence in eutrophic lake with high n and p strong desorption of fe ooh p driven by anoxia and release potential expressed by epc0 both resulted in the p accumulation in interstitial and surface water inducing algal bloom species to switch from cyanobacteria to chlorophyta 3 2 late period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae south basin of lake qingling in the south basin of lake qingling ql1 3 and lake yandong yd3 6 with algae and macrophyte regime shifting algal bloom and macrophyte coexisted in summer fig 2a however there were a lot of differences in these two basins in lake qingling ql1 3 with later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae the dominant algae and macrophyte were cyanobacteria and lotus respectively abundant lotus detritus deposited over sediments resulting in the significantly higher organic p n and c p 0 05 fig 4 especially labile part p 0 01 fig 5b compared to the other basins the high organic n and c induced the production of lap glu and lipase for organic matter decomposition fig 7b 7c and 7d resulting in anoxia as shown by high dha fig 7e and inorganic n was released as nh4 n form in surface and interstitial water fig 2c and 3b however even if anoxia occurred fe ooh p desorption and release was not the main p source in south basin of lake qingling ql1 3 due to the relatively low fe ooh p and fe3 fig 5a and 5c as well as epc0 fig 6a on the other hand the slightly high apa in sediment fig 7a and significantly higher psb fig 8 coupled with the high tp and caco3 p fig 4b and 5a indicated that organic p hydrolysis and caco3 p dissociation driven by psb contributed greatly to p regeneration due to high phosphorus solubilizing ability and extensive substrate adaptability as well as quick turnover velocity psb have been considered to be very important for p regeneration in biofilms attached on algae yang et al 2017 sediments in lake and wetland qian et al 2010 soils wang et al 2020 especially in water bodies with phosphorus limited and potential risk of eutrophication and algal bloom psb allowed diversification in regeneration pathways and p release liu et al 2017 furthermore on the conditions of limited p pool the high p turnover rate mediated by alkaline phosphatase xiao et al 2018 facilitated the rapid utilization of p and growth of algae that require less p wan et al 2019 such as microcystis bloom in this study expressed by the low srp in surface water and high chl a in summer fig 2a and 2b in south basin of lake qingling ql1 4 hence in lake qingling ql1 3 psb enriched with high available organic carbon drove the main p regeneration pathway through the enzymatic hydrolysis and dissociation in addition nutrients exchange from the north basin of lake qingling due to the demolition of embankment accelerated the regime shifting from macraphytes to algae in the south basin it is predictable that abundant of regenerated and exogenous p jointly supported algal bloom and after collapse the p could be rapidly recycled and utilized finally algae would suppress the macrophyte growth 3 3 early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae south basin of lake yandong in the south basin of lake yandong yd3 6 with early period of regime shifting from macrophytes to algae srp is also limited in surface water fig 2b and interstitial water fig 3a and the dominant algae and macrophytes were cyanobacteria and vallisnerianatans respectively compared to south basin of lake qingling ql1 3 the significantly lower tp p 0 05 fig 4b p fractions p 0 05 fig 5a apa p 0 05 fig 7a and psb p 0 01 fig 8 indicated that p accumulation in sediment was limited and all p regeneration pathways from sediments were blocked in south basin of lake yandong yd3 6 even though the same high glu was observed fig 7c in sediments of lake yandong yd3 6 and lake qingling ql1 3 the significantly lower tom p 0 01 fig 4c toc p 0 01 fig 4d available organic matter p 0 01 fig 5b lipase p 0 05 fig 7d dha p 0 01 fig 7e suggested that organic carbon decomposition did not result in anoxia in sediments of lake yandong yd3 6 all these findings suggested that in lake yandong yd3 6 internal p regeneration and release was not primarily responsible for algal bloom which should be attributed to the exogenous input due to bait feeding and fecal excretion during aquaculture process 3 4 macrophyte dominance north basin of lake yandong in north basin of lake yandong yd1 2 with macrophyte dominance almost all parameters related to p including srp in surface and interstitial water fig 2b 3a tp in sediments fig 4b p fractions fig 5a p sorption fig 6 exhibited the lowest level which indicated the p deficiency finally inducing the similar level apa as the other basins fig 7a however the parameters related to c and n including n forms in surface fig 2c and interstitial water fig 3b tn tom and toc in sediments fig 4a 4c and 4d labile organic matter and fe forms fig 5b 5c enzymatic activities mediating c and n fig 7b 7d did not show the significantly low level all these results suggested the close coupling between c and n cycling which was not associated with p cycling in lake yandong yd1 2 hence algal bloom did not occur due to p limitation in this basin obviously the coupling among c n and p cycling made a positive impact on p regeneration and supply in which process the role of microbes should be addressed 3 5 the role of functional microorganisms and nutrients coupling in this study the relative abundance of the whole bacteria community and p solubilizing microorganisms varied in different basin fig s 1 and s 2 furthermore pcoa revealed that the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing showed the significant heterogeneity in different basins of lake fig 9 the p solubilizing microorganisms abundance based on the heatmap analysis fig s 3 and psb counting fig 8 was consistent indicating the different level in different regime however the sampling sites in south and north basin of lake qingling were distributed in different zone fig 9 suggesting the huge difference of organic p hydrolysis function in algae dominated regime and later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae furthermore the sampling sites in south and north basin of lake yandong were grouped together fig 9 indicating that the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing did not shift in macrophyte dominated regime and early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae all these facts indicated the inconsistency among functional microorganisms abundance community composition and their function which could explain the different p regeneration mode in different regime in addition in the cca analysis the p solubilizing microorganisms were mainly regulated by the parameters related to c cho tom lipid glu chl a n prt tn ammonium nitrate in sediment and water p asop palk fe fe2 tfe and o dha in later period of regime from macrophyte to algae ql2 fig 10 this result further proved the importance of organic p hydrolysis mediated by apa in this regime which maximized its function through coupling to the other nutrient cycling such as n c fe and o in algae dominated regime ql5 the parameters related to p such as different p forms in water and sediment mainly influenced the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing fig 10 indicating that alkaline phosphatase and p relationship was regulated by an inhibition induction mechanism furthermore in macrophyte dominated regime and early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae yd1 and yd5 even though glu and p in water both regulated the functional microorganisms related to p solubilizing fig 10 the coupling between c and p did not occur and the pathway of p regeneration was blocked the stoichiometric coupling between growth limiting nutrient and the other nutrients in both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes could exert profound effect on phytoplankton production thingstad et al 2008 in eutrophic lakes enrichment of n and c can result in p release through the formation of anaerobic status and alkaline phosphatase production li et al 2016 internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than phosphorus highlighting the potential importance of nitrogen loads exerting a control over systems that become phosphorus limited zhu et al 2017 hence different p regeneration and supply pathways existed in different regimes and the different levels of coupling with other nutrients determined the pathway and strength of endogenous p regeneration to some extent 4 conclusions taken together in lakes with different regimes the p supply pathways and underlying mechanisms was completely different in lakes with algal dominance the main p regeneration pathway was the release and desorption of fe ooh p driven by anoxia in lakes being later period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae organic p hydrolysis and caco3 p dissociation driven by psb contributed greatly to p regeneration in lakes being early period of regime shifting from macrophyte to algae exogenous p input was the main p supply mode in lakes with macrophyte dominance p supply was insufficient the coupling of multiple nutrient cycles especially c n p o and fe could effectively increase the pathways diversification and the strength of p regeneration declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

17178,anammox biotechnology has been widely applied for its attractive advantages but its application has been seriously limited due to the instinctive drawback of nitrate production in this work a novel sequential anammox and denitrification sad system was developed for the advanced nitrogen removal by using solid carbon source scs and coupling anammox with denitrification the long term operation results demonstrated that the sad system could remove the total nitrogen tn efficiently with the effluent tn concentration of 1 4 0 5 mg n l the tn removal efficiency nre of 99 3 0 2 and the tn removal rate nrr of 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d the determination results showed that scs had a good property for sustained release of cod with a dissolved organic yield by cod of 1 1 g cod g rice when the addition rate was set at 6 g rice 7 days the cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d from scs matched the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d from anammox with consumption ratio of 7 5 the analysis on the microbial community revealed that candidatus brocadia and denitratisoma were the dominant functional bacteria for anammox and denitrification which contributed to about 92 7 and 6 6 of the total nitrogen removal respectively this work is helpful for the innovation and application of anammox based technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox denitrification asymmetrical match solid carbon source advanced nitrogen removal microbial community 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a promising biotechnology for nitrogen removal which is mediated by anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob converting ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas strous et al 1998 compared with conventional nitrification denitrification process anammox process shows great advantages of no requirement for the external electron donor low energy consumption high nitrogen loading rate and low excess sludge production kartal et al 2010 tan et al 2020 in 2007 anammox process was successfully put into full scale use for the nitrogen removal from reject liquor of anaerobic sludge digestion in rotterdam for the first time van der star et al 2007 according to the incomplete survey more than 200 full scale anammox facilities have come into being around the world so far to some extent anammox process has been acknowledged as an updating technology for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters cao et al 2017 lu et al 2019 as shown in the stoichiometric equation of anammox reaction 1 strous et al 1998 the molar ratio of ammonia to nitrite is 1 1 32 and the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn is 89 with the conversion of 11 nitrogen n into nitrate theoretically which leads to the unideal effluent quality with a tn concentration above 10 mg n l lackner et al 2014 since eutrophication occurs once the tn exceeds 0 8 mg n l xu et al 2014 more and more stringent discharge standards have been promulgated regarding tn concentration ji et al 2020a ministry of ecology and environment of china 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop an advanced nitrogen removal process for the further removal of nitrate from anammox process 1 1 n

conversion of nitrate to dinitrogen gas by denitrifying bacteria db with the aid of external carbon source qin et al 2017 it has been reported that the effluent tn could be well eliminated in the two stage process of anammox and denitrification and the liquid carbon sources e g methanol sodium acetate and glucose were routinely supplied as the electron donor of denitrification chu and wang 2011 zhang et al 2019 cao et al 2020 however due to the low nitrate production of anammox process the carbon demand of coupled denitrification is small which frequently causes the overdosage of liquid carbon source and in turn leads to the risk of secondary pollution excessive effluent cod kiani et al 2020 besides the independent denitrifying reactor means the more construction investment and operation cost to deal with the challenge the two stage process of anammox and denitrification has to be innovated due to the low effluent tn concentration of anammox process the volumetric capacity of the coupled denitrification process is not so high theoretically the volumetric capacity can be increased by conducting the anammox process and denitrification process in one reactor lan et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 however previous studies showed that it was difficult to maintain the balance between anaob and db since the latter have much higher growth rates and can compete with anaob for nitrite in the presence of organic matter ni et al 2012 chen et al 2016 arranging the anammox process and denitrification process separately in different parts is a feasible strategy for consuming the nitrate once it is produced and solid carbon sources scs are chosen for the denitrification so that they can be released slowly to match the nitrate production wang and chu 2016 scs can also serve as the carrier for the growth of db limiting them in the upper part of the reactor to play their role and avoiding the cod accumulation to interfere with the metabolism of anaob ashok and hait 2015 currently scs starch polycaprolactone spills etc has been reported to be well applied for the direct nitrate removal with little risk of residual cod in the effluent leverenz et al 2010 so far however little information is available for the application of solid carbon source to the advanced nitrogen removal in the integrative process of anammox and denitrification in order to develop a novel process for the advanced nitrogen removal by integrating anammox and solid phase denitrification in one reactor 1 a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sustained cod release from the solid carbon source scs 2 the performance of sequential anammox and denitrification sad system was evaluated with scs as electron donor 3 the bacterial community in the sad system was analyzed to identify the dominant bacterial populations the results of this study are helpful to develop the innovative anammox based technology for the advanced nitrogen removal from wastewaters 2

parts distribution zone reaction zone and settling zone the synthetic wastewater was continuously pumped to the distribution zone by the peristaltic pump the fluid went upwards through the anammox granular sludge bed in the reaction zone the height of reaction zone was 80 cm with 3 4 of height filled with anammox granular sludge four sampling ports were distributed along the side wall from the bottom to the top of reaction zone sp 1 4 fig 1 the three phase separator was installed in the setting zone to separate the sludge from the mixed liquid releasing supernatant and gas parts of the supernatant were recycled to the distribution zone from the setting zone at a recycle ratio of 8 and scs was provided in a wire cage with pore size around 0 5 mm which was installed at the upper part of reaction zone the reactor was operated at 35 c with a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 h the influent ph was controlled at 7 5 0 2 and the ratio of height to diameter was 20 with superficial velocity in reaction zone was 4 3 m h prior to becoming a part of sad system the anammox granular sludge bed reactor had worked at the steady state for over 1 year the volatile solids vs and vs ts ratio of anammox granular sludge were 24 49 g l and 0 80 respectively kang et al 2019 the vs and vs ts ratio of seed sludge for denitrification from the upper part of anammox reactor were 0

mean diameter vmd of 3 4 mm and the density of 1 36 g cm3 two groups of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the cod release from scs one group the treatment group a was composed of the basic solution the same as section 2 1 without ammonium and nitrite microorganism and nitrate while the other group the control group b was only composed of the basic solution a 1 0 g wet sludge taken from the upper zone of anammox reactor sp 4 fig 1 was washed three times with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 5 0 22 g l kh2po4 1 46 g l k2hpo4 and put into the 350 ml serum bottles with 250 ml basic solution and 0 5 g scs then the serum bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps the headspace and liquid phase of each bottle were sparging with 95 ar 5 co2 for 10 min to remove oxygen the initial nitrate concentration was set at 100 mg n l the serum bottles were placed in a thermostatic shaker at 35 c and 150 rpm samples were taken from the serum bottles each day and the cod and nitrate concentrations were determined nitrate was supplied timely according to the consumption b the operations were the same as those of group a except that the wet sludge and nitrate were not added in the presence of sludge the cod release amount included the cod in the liquor and the cod consumed by microorganism due to the supply of nitrate timely the consumed cod was calculated by the nitrate consumption in denitrification the ratio of cod consumption to nitrate consumption was determined by batch experiments supplementary files 2 4 scanning electron microscopy sem sem was applied to observe the surface microstructure of rice the samples were placed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution and fixed overnight at 4 c after rinsed with 0 1 mol l and ph 7 0 phosphate buffer solution samples

treated with a mixture of ethanol and isoamyl acetate volume ratio 1 1 for 30 min and isoamyl acetate for 1 2 h finally the samples were critical point dried and observed by su8010 field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem hitachi japan yu et al 2019 2 5 determination of specific anammox activity saa batch experiments were conducted to determine the saa of anammox sludge 1 0 g wet sludge was taken from the reactor and washed with 0 1 m phosphate buffer for three times ph 7 5 0 22 g l kh2po4 1 46 g l k2hpo4 then the washed sludge and 50 ml basic solution the same as section 2 1 were added to 75 ml serum bottles which were then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps the headspace and liquid phase of each bottle were sparging with 95 ar 5 co2 for 10 min to remove oxygen the initial ammonia and nitrite concentrations were set at 50 mg n l and 60 mg n l the serum bottles were placed in a thermostatic shaker at 35 c and 150 rpm samples were taken each hour and substrate concentrations were determined after filtration with 0 45 μm the vss of the sludge in the serum bottles were measured at the end of test the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 6 dna

sequenced by illumina miseq pe300 platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china table s1 the reads were further used to calculate the operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 sequence identity threshold the rarefaction curves of each sequencing sample reached the plateau stage and the coverage index was larger than 0 99 indicating the depth and quality met the requirements

prjna670317 2 7 other analysis the concentrations of ammonia nitrite nitrate vss and cod were all determined according to the standard methods apha 2017 the nitrogen content of scs was determined by kjeldahl method and the surface morphology of scs was observed and photographed by a stereoscope discovery v8 zeiss germany the particle size of rice was analyzed by qicpic dynamic image analysis system sympatec gmbh germany t test was conducted on spss 22 0 p 0 05 means 95 significant level while p 0 01 means 99 significant level 3 results 3 1 characterization of cod release from scs nitrate and organic substance by cod are two reactants of denitrification the cod release from scs is closely related to the nitrate removal and the cod accumulation jiang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to characterize the cod release e g cod release rate and cumulative cod from scs for the match between anammox and denitrification as shown in fig 2 the cod release from rice particle in the treatment group in the presence of microorganisms and nitrate was compared with that in the control group in the absence of microorganisms and nitrate the cod release in both groups could be divided into three phases i e increase constant and decrease phase according to the cod release rate crr for the control group the crr increased gradually from 0 to 121 0 mg l d in the first 3 days and stayed at 108 2 12 5 mg l d in the following 4 days and decreased to 22 9 mg l d from 7 days onwards the cod yield was 0 6 g cod g rice for the treatment group the crr rose to 432 7 mg l d in 1 4 days stayed at 370 8 64 6 mg l d in 4 7 days and dropped to 161 7 mg l d in 8 10 days when the rice was completely hydrolyzed the cumulative cod was 2184 7 mg l and the cod yield was 1 1 g cod g rice supplemental files these results indicated that the working sludge functional bacteria and nitrate promoted the crr of rice particle which could be ascribed to the enhanced hydrolysis from hydrolyzing bacteria because rice contains a small amount of proteins the nitrogen content of rice was also determined with the value of 8 9 10 3 g n g rice and the cod n ratio of complete hydrolysis of rice reached 123 6 indicating that the released amount of nitrogen was very small compared with the released cod and accounted for less than 0 5 of the influent nitrogen in sad process which was negligible 3 2 performance of the sad system nitrogen removal was the main functional objective of the sad system as can be seen from fig 3 the performance between 0 and 70 days could be divided into three phases according to the tn concentration in the effluent fig 3 table 1 the details were shown below 3 2 1 performance of sad system in the absence of scs in phase i 1 19 days the influent ammonium nitrite and tn concentrations were set at 88 3 10 4 mg n l 131 4 8 2 mg n l and 221 0 15 8 mg n l the corresponding removal efficiencies reached 99 1 0 5 99 7 0 2 and 92 7 1 1 respectively the effluent ammonium nitrite nitrate and tn concentrations were 0 8 0 5 mg n l 0 4 0 3 mg n l 14 9 2 2 mg n l and 16 1 2 6 mg n l the nitrogen loading rate nlr and the nitrogen removal rate nrr were 1 8 0 1 kg m3 d and 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d fig 3 the cod concentration in the effluent was also at a low level of 42 7 15 6 mg l which was analyzed as the refractory soluble organic matter tryptophan like protein secreted by microorganism fig s2 zeng et al 2017 the results demonstrated that the working performance of anammox system was stable with the statistical standard deviation stdev of nrr at 0 1 kg m3 d and the stdev of ammonium nitrite and tn removal efficiency below 1 1 however the effluent tn concentration was high 15 mg n l with nitrate as the main contributor 92 5 indicating that the nitrate removal was the major bottleneck of sad process before the addition of scs 3 2 2 performance of sad system in the presence of scs 3 2 2 1 addition of scs for the first time in phase ii 20 53 days on day 20 8 g rice was added into the inner component of sad system the stoichiometric c n ratio was shown in supplemental files in 20 25 days the effluent nitrate concentration decreased from 19 2 mg n l to 12 6 mg n l and the effluent tn concentration declined from 20 0 mg n l to 13 8 mg n l the tn removal efficiency increased from 90 8 to 93 0 on day 26 the effluent nitrate and tn concentrations dropped sharply to 1 6 mg n l and 2 2 mg n l respectively in the following days until day 29 the effluent tn concentrations were all below 5 mg n l with the tn removal efficiency over 98 0 however the effluent nitrate concentration started to rise from 7 7 mg n l on day 30 to 15 1 mg n l on day 33 and the effluent tn concentration increased from 8 4 mg n l to 16 6 mg n l with a declined tn removal efficiency on day 33 the added rice was exhausted fig 3a rethink the performance during 20 33 day with the first addition of scs it was found that the nitrate and tn removal was in line with the cod release process from scs in the batch experiments fig 2 indicating cod release from scs might be the rate limiting step of nitrate removal in the sad process therefore it is reasonable to regard the addition frequency and amount of scs as key parameters for regulating the performance of sad process 3 2 2 2 optimization of scs addition frequency on day 34 8 g rice was put into the sad system for the second time in 34 39 days the effluent nitrate concentration gradually decreased from 16 7 mg n l to 10 3 mg n l the effluent tn concentration declined from 17 5 mg n l to 11 5 mg n l and the tn removal efficiency rose from 91 6 to 94 5 on day 40 8 g rice was put into the sad system for the third time the time interval for scs addition was shortened to 7 days in 40 46 days the effluent nitrate concentration dropped from 6 0 mg n l to 1 3 mg n l then stayed at 1 1 1 4 mg n l and the effluent tn concentration fell from 8 3 mg n l to 1 9 mg n l then stabilized at 2 2 1 8 mg n l the tn removal efficiency rose from 96 2 to 99 1 then stayed at 98 9 0 9 fig 3a however a small amount of sludge at the bottom of settling zone was observed to turn from red to black which might be triggered by the reaction of excessive cod release from scs and reduced sulfate to form the black fes kang et al 2018 3 2 2 3 optimization of scs addition amount on day 47 a reduced amount of rice of 6 g was put into the sad system for the fourth time in 47 53 days the effluent nitrate concentration decreased from 9 5 mg n l to 4 0 mg n l then stayed at 0 4 0 6 mg n l the effluent tn concentration declined from 13 1 mg n l to 6 8 mg n l then stabilized at 1 4 1 2 mg n l and the tn removal efficiency improved from 93 3 to 96 6 then stayed at 99 3 0 6 fig 3a the sludge at the bottom of settling zone turned from black to yellowish brown the effluent concentration of ammonium and nitrite in phase ii stayed at a low level of 0 5 0 4 mg n l 0 8 0 7 mg n l respectively and no change was observed for the consumption ratio of nitrite to ammonium the effluent concentration of cod was 46 8 19 4 mg l which showed no significant difference from that in phase i p 0 05 table 1 fig s2 compared with the performance of sad system in phase i it can be concluded that the tn removal efficiency increased by 6 6 when the addition rate was set at 6 g rice 7 days achieving the match between the cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d from scs and the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d from anammox with consumption ratio of cod to nitrate of 7 5 which was close to the value of 7 2 determined in batch experiments in phase iii 54 70 days 6 g rice 7 days was added as scs to the sad system to confirm the performance stability the results showed that the effluent concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and tn were 0 6 0 2 mg n l 0 4 0 3 mg n l 0 5 0 4 mg n l and 1 4 0 5 mg n l and the corresponding removal efficiencies reached up to 99 3 0 3 99 7 0 2 and 99 3 0 2 respectively the effluent cod concentration stayed at 45 7 20 6 mg l fig 3 table 1 it could be concluded the sad system is feasible for the advanced nitrogen removal 3 3 change of scs surface in this study rice was chosen as scs rice is mainly composed of starch which can be hydrolyzed gu et al 2004 to understand the cod release from scs the rice particle was observed under stereoscope and sem within a cycle from day 20 to day 33 as shown in fig 4 initially the rice particle had an ellipsoid shape with a length of about 2 4 mm and a volume surface mean diameter vmd of 3 4 mm its surface was smooth and without adhesion of bacterial cell fig 4a as the time went more and more bacterial cells were found to attach on the surface until fully covered the surface and a layer of yellowish biofilm was gradually formed on the surface of wire cage and scs fig s3 fig 4d the starch on the surface was obviously hydrolyzed leading to local invagination many starch grains with a diameter of about 5 μm exposed to the surface fig 4e f at the end of the cycle 8 days the rice particle shrank with a smaller size of about 1 1 5 mm and vmd of 1 3 mm and its surface became rough and loose fig 4g many holes appeared on the surface with a lot of bacillus on the starch grains fig 4h i with the hydrolysis of scs from the surface to the interior the rice became smaller 3 4 saa of anammox sludge anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob in the form of granular sludge played a key role in the sad system however the specific anammox activity of granular sludge could be disturbed by organic carbon source because the db could compete with anaob for nitrite in the presence of organic matter ni et al 2012 chen et al 2016 the saa of granular sludge before on day 15 and after on day 66 the addition of scs was determined as shown in fig 5 on day 15 the ammonium removal rate nitrite removal rate nitrate generation rate and tn removal rate of anammox sludge were 78 2 5 7 mg n g vss d 122 2 12 2 mg n g vss d 15 9 2 4 mg n g vss d and 216 2 20 2 mg n g vss d respectively on day 66 the ammonium removal rate nitrite removal rate nitrate generation rate and tn removal rate of anammox sludge were 87 2 4 3 mg n g vss d 135 6 8 9 mg n g vss d 18 5 0 8 mg n g vss d and 241 2 13 1 mg n g vss d respectively the results demonstrated that the effect of scs on the anaob was negligible in the sad system 3 5 analysis of microbial community the microbial community is the functional source of nitrogen removal system high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene was used to analyze the microbial community at phylum level fig 6 a the main bacteria were planctomycetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for more than 70 of the total species in s1 anammox sludge before addition of scs s2 anammox sludge after addition of scs and s3 denitrifying floc sludge after addition of scs the abundances of planctomycetes phylum were 40 4 41 4 and 34 7 respectively in s4 denitrifying film on scs and s5 denitrifying film on wire cage the proteobacteria phylum was found as the most dominant bacteria with relative abundance of 41 1 and 35 1 respectively and followed by bacteroidetes it is well accepted that bacteria in proteobacteria phylum have close relationship with the denitrification process lu et al 2014 while bacteroidetes phylum is mainly composed of hydrolyzing bacteria hb cotta et al 2003 at the genus level fig 6b in s1 s2 and s3 the relative abundances of candidatus brocadia were 38 6 36 8 and 29 3 respectively and the relative abundances of olb13 belonging to chloroflexi phylum were 9 6 9 2 and 6 2 respectively which could reinforce the structure of granules in the form of a filamentous biomass xu et al 2020 in s4 and s5 the relative abundance of akyh767 unclassified belonging to bacteroidetes phylum was 9 9 and 6 7 respectively in s4 the relative abundance of denitratisoma and comamonadaceae unclassified was 19 1 and 6 0 respectively in s5 that of dechlorobacter and denitratisoma was 11 1 and 10 8 respectively comparing the bacterial community of s1 and s2 similar component was observed indicating that the addition of scs exerted little effect on microbial communities of anammox sludge however s3 showed a decreased abundance of anaob and increased abundance of db compared with those in s2 s4 and s5 showed a far higher abundance of db than that of s2 and s3 indicating that the abundance of db rose in the upper part of reactor with the addition of scs fig 6 the species diversity of microbial community can be indicated by shannon index the higher the shannon index the higher the community species diversity in this study the shannon indexes of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 were 3 4 3 7 4 0 4 3 and 4 4 respectively comparing shannon index of s1 and s2 it could be found that the species diversity of microbial community in anammox sludge increased moderately with the addition of scs comparing shannon index of s2 s3 s4 and s5 it could be concluded that the species diversity of microbial community increased gradually from the bottom to the top of reactor 4 discussion 4 1 performance of sad process although anammox biotechnology has been widely applied for its attractive advantages lackner et al 2014 its nitrate production hinders the effluent from reaching the discharge standard of tn ji et al 2020b liu et al 2019 since the denitrification process is capable of removing nitrate a new sad system was then developed for the advanced nitrogen removal by using solid carbon source scs and coupling anammox with denitrification the operation of sad system demonstrated that it was successful with the tn removal efficiency nre of 99 3 0 2 tn removal rate nrr of 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d and effluent tn concentration of 1 4 0 5 mg n l the effluent cod concentration could also stay at a low level of 45 7 20 6 mg l fig 3 due to well match between the cod release from scs and nitrate production from anammox the nre of sad process in this study was significantly better than that of similar processes moreover the high nrr of sad process was achieved compared with the counterpart of similar processes therefore the sad process had indeed reached a high level regarding the process performance table 2 4 2 sustained cod release from scs carbon source is vital for denitrification generally the solid carbon sources scs e g rice wheat millet exist in the form of particles wani et al 2012 the starch c6h10o5 n inside scs particles needs to be firstly hydrolyzed into glucose c6h10o6 and then used as electron donor for denitrification jiang et al 2020 since the starch arrangement is compact in rice it is not easy for hydrolyzing bacteria via amylase to directly penetrate the rice particle and the starch is expected to be released as soluble organics from the rice surface layer by layer fig 4 the rice particles in millimeter dimension can provide a large surface for functional bacteria in micron dimension to live however the exposed surface of rice particles is limited and so it controls the release rate of starchy substance by cod in other words the cod release from scs is the surface controlled process in which the exposed surface of rice particle finally decides the hydrolyzing rate of rice starch in this study the cod release rate crr from rice particle demonstrated a pattern of three phases increase constant and decrease phase this pattern can be explained with the hypothesis of surface controlled release in the first increase phase bacillus which was included in bacteroidetes phylum and was mainly composed of hydrolyzing bacteria hb increased gradually on the surface of rice particle the migration and colonization of hb on the surface of rice particle led to the increase of glucose dissolving rate or cod release rate until the hb cover the whole surface in the second constant phase the exposed surface of rice particle keeps relatively constant because the decrease of surface area is not so large per starch layer in the outside leading to the constant of cod release rate in the third decrease phase the exposed surface of rice particle becomes significantly less leading to the decrease of cod release rate and eventually the complete stop figs 2 3 following the pattern of cod release the cod could be supplied on the denitrification demand with proper addition amount and frequency of scs when the addition rate was set at 6 g rice 7 days the cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d from scs matched the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d from anammox with the consumption ratio of cod to nitrate of 7 5 achieving high efficient nitrogen removal without excessive effluent cod 4 3 location of functional bacteria in sad system anaob and db are the functional microorganisms of sad system zhang et al 2017 however they have different respiratory characteristics e g anaob are autotrophic bacteria which do not need organic matter as carbon source while db are heterotrophic bacteria which need organic matter as carbon source cao et al 2020 in the presence of organic matter db can eliminate the nitrate produced by anaob and can also compete with anaob for nitrite interfering with anammox chamchoi et al 2008 qin et al 2017 therefore the db was located separately from the anaob in the sad system in this study an inner component was introduced into the upper part of sad system the scs was filled into the inner component to colonize db thus separating db from anaob in the lower part of sad system the nitrate from anammox in the lower part can be eliminated in the upper part with the aid of scs the consumption of cod from scs is closely related with the production of nitrate from anammox in a sense the nitrate production by anaob auto regulated the nitrate removal by db via the cod consumption by hb forming a fit community for db hb and anaob as shown in fig 7 in the sad system candidatus brocadia were identified as the dominant anaob which lived in the form of granular sludge denitratisoma were identified as the dominant db which lived in the form of biofilm and suspended sludge fig 6 because the scs like rice particle becomes smaller with the cod release fig 4 the functional bacteria on the scs will be gradually washed out the db amount can well match the anaob amount with a proper allocation of reactor volume and a good cooperation between two bacterial groups although db grow far more fast than anaob in such a case the microbial community was stable and robust giving a strong support to the sad system 5 conclusion 1 a novel sad process was developed for the advanced nitrogen removal by coupling anammox with solid phase denitrification in one reactor a good performance was achieved with low effluent tn concentration of 1 4 0 5 mg n l high tn removal efficiency of 99 3 0 2 and high tn removal rate of 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d 2 the pattern of sustained cod release from scs was revealed the average cod yield was 1 1 g cod g rice the average cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d matched the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d with the addition rate of 6 g rice 7 days 3 candidatus brocadia and denitratisoma were identified to be the dominant anaob and db respectively they located separately and worked synergistically in the sad system contributing the nitrogen removal of 92 7 anammox and 6

17178,anammox biotechnology has been widely applied for its attractive advantages but its application has been seriously limited due to the instinctive drawback of nitrate production in this work a novel sequential anammox and denitrification sad system was developed for the advanced nitrogen removal by using solid carbon source scs and coupling anammox with denitrification the long term operation results demonstrated that the sad system could remove the total nitrogen tn efficiently with the effluent tn concentration of 1 4 0 5 mg n l the tn removal efficiency nre of 99 3 0 2 and the tn removal rate nrr of 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d the determination results showed that scs had a good property for sustained release of cod with a dissolved organic yield by cod of 1 1 g cod g rice when the addition rate was set at 6 g rice 7 days the cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d from scs matched the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d from anammox with consumption ratio of 7 5 the analysis on the microbial community revealed that candidatus brocadia and denitratisoma were the dominant functional bacteria for anammox and denitrification which contributed to about 92 7 and 6 6 of the total nitrogen removal respectively this work is helpful for the innovation and application of anammox based technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox denitrification asymmetrical match solid carbon source advanced nitrogen removal microbial community 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a promising biotechnology for nitrogen removal which is mediated by anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob converting ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas strous et al 1998 compared with conventional nitrification denitrification process anammox process shows great advantages of no requirement for the external electron donor low energy consumption high nitrogen loading rate and low excess sludge production kartal et al 2010 tan et al 2020 in 2007 anammox process was successfully put into full scale use for the nitrogen removal from reject liquor of anaerobic sludge digestion in rotterdam for the first time van der star et al 2007 according to the incomplete survey more than 200 full scale anammox facilities have come into being around the world so far to some extent anammox process has been acknowledged as an updating technology for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters cao et al 2017 lu et al 2019 as shown in the stoichiometric equation of anammox reaction 1 strous et al 1998 the molar ratio of ammonia to nitrite is 1 1 32 and the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn is 89 with the conversion of 11 nitrogen n into nitrate theoretically which leads to the unideal effluent quality with a tn concentration above 10 mg n l lackner et al 2014 since eutrophication occurs once the tn exceeds 0 8 mg n l xu et al 2014 more and more stringent discharge standards have been promulgated regarding tn concentration ji et al 2020a ministry of ecology and environment of china 2020 therefore it is necessary to develop an advanced nitrogen removal process for the further removal of nitrate from anammox process 1 1 n

conversion of nitrate to dinitrogen gas by denitrifying bacteria db with the aid of external carbon source qin et al 2017 it has been reported that the effluent tn could be well eliminated in the two stage process of anammox and denitrification and the liquid carbon sources e g methanol sodium acetate and glucose were routinely supplied as the electron donor of denitrification chu and wang 2011 zhang et al 2019 cao et al 2020 however due to the low nitrate production of anammox process the carbon demand of coupled denitrification is small which frequently causes the overdosage of liquid carbon source and in turn leads to the risk of secondary pollution excessive effluent cod kiani et al 2020 besides the independent denitrifying reactor means the more construction investment and operation cost to deal with the challenge the two stage process of anammox and denitrification has to be innovated due to the low effluent tn concentration of anammox process the volumetric capacity of the coupled denitrification process is not so high theoretically the volumetric capacity can be increased by conducting the anammox process and denitrification process in one reactor lan et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 however previous studies showed that it was difficult to maintain the balance between anaob and db since the latter have much higher growth rates and can compete with anaob for nitrite in the presence of organic matter ni et al 2012 chen et al 2016 arranging the anammox process and denitrification process separately in different parts is a feasible strategy for consuming the nitrate once it is produced and solid carbon sources scs are chosen for the denitrification so that they can be released slowly to match the nitrate production wang and chu 2016 scs can also serve as the carrier for the growth of db limiting them in the upper part of the reactor to play their role and avoiding the cod accumulation to interfere with the metabolism of anaob ashok and hait 2015 currently scs starch polycaprolactone spills etc has been reported to be well applied for the direct nitrate removal with little risk of residual cod in the effluent leverenz et al 2010 so far however little information is available for the application of solid carbon source to the advanced nitrogen removal in the integrative process of anammox and denitrification in order to develop a novel process for the advanced nitrogen removal by integrating anammox and solid phase denitrification in one reactor 1 a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the sustained cod release from the solid carbon source scs 2 the performance of sequential anammox and denitrification sad system was evaluated with scs as electron donor 3 the bacterial community in the sad system was analyzed to identify the dominant bacterial populations the results of this study are helpful to develop the innovative anammox based technology for the advanced nitrogen removal from wastewaters 2

parts distribution zone reaction zone and settling zone the synthetic wastewater was continuously pumped to the distribution zone by the peristaltic pump the fluid went upwards through the anammox granular sludge bed in the reaction zone the height of reaction zone was 80 cm with 3 4 of height filled with anammox granular sludge four sampling ports were distributed along the side wall from the bottom to the top of reaction zone sp 1 4 fig 1 the three phase separator was installed in the setting zone to separate the sludge from the mixed liquid releasing supernatant and gas parts of the supernatant were recycled to the distribution zone from the setting zone at a recycle ratio of 8 and scs was provided in a wire cage with pore size around 0 5 mm which was installed at the upper part of reaction zone the reactor was operated at 35 c with a constant hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 h the influent ph was controlled at 7 5 0 2 and the ratio of height to diameter was 20 with superficial velocity in reaction zone was 4 3 m h prior to becoming a part of sad system the anammox granular sludge bed reactor had worked at the steady state for over 1 year the volatile solids vs and vs ts ratio of anammox granular sludge were 24 49 g l and 0 80 respectively kang et al 2019 the vs and vs ts ratio of seed sludge for denitrification from the upper part of anammox reactor were 0 03 g g wet sludge and 0 70 respectively 2 3 characterization of cod release from scs in this study raw rice was chosen as the solid carbon source scs which had the length of 2 4 mm the volume surface mean diameter vmd of 3 4 mm and the density of 1 36 g cm3 two groups of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the cod release from scs one group the treatment group a was composed of the basic solution the same as section 2 1 without ammonium and nitrite microorganism and nitrate while the other group the control group b was only composed of the basic solution a 1 0 g wet sludge taken from the upper zone of anammox reactor sp 4 fig 1 was washed three times with 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 5 0 22 g l kh2po4 1 46 g l k2hpo4 and put into the 350 ml serum bottles with 250 ml basic solution and 0 5 g scs then the serum bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps the headspace and liquid phase of each bottle were sparging with 95 ar 5 co2 for 10 min to remove oxygen the initial nitrate concentration was set at 100 mg n l the serum bottles were placed in a thermostatic shaker at 35 c and 150 rpm samples were taken from the serum bottles each day and the cod and nitrate concentrations were determined nitrate was supplied timely according to the consumption b the operations were the same as those of group a except that the wet sludge and nitrate were not added in the presence of sludge the cod release amount included the cod in the liquor and the cod consumed by microorganism due to the supply of nitrate timely the consumed cod was calculated by the nitrate consumption in denitrification the ratio of cod consumption to nitrate consumption was determined by batch experiments supplementary files 2 4 scanning electron microscopy sem sem was applied to observe the surface microstructure of rice the samples were placed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution and fixed overnight at 4 c after rinsed with 0 1 mol l and ph 7 0 phosphate buffer solution samples

sludge was taken from the reactor and washed with 0 1 m phosphate buffer for three times ph 7 5 0 22 g l kh2po4 1 46 g l k2hpo4 then the washed sludge and 50 ml basic solution the same as section 2 1 were added to 75 ml serum bottles which were then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps the headspace and liquid phase of each bottle were sparging with 95 ar 5 co2 for 10 min to remove oxygen the initial ammonia and nitrite concentrations were set at 50 mg n l and 60 mg n l the serum bottles were placed in a thermostatic shaker at 35 c and 150 rpm samples were taken each hour and

kjeldahl method and the surface morphology of scs was observed and photographed by a stereoscope discovery v8 zeiss germany the particle size of rice was analyzed by qicpic dynamic image analysis system sympatec gmbh germany t test was conducted on spss 22 0 p 0 05 means 95 significant level while p 0 01 means 99 significant level 3 results 3 1 characterization of cod release from scs nitrate and organic substance by cod are two reactants of denitrification the cod release from scs is closely related to the nitrate removal and the cod accumulation jiang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to characterize the cod release e g cod release rate and cumulative cod from scs for the match between anammox and denitrification as shown in fig 2 the cod release from rice particle in the treatment group in the presence of microorganisms and nitrate was compared with that in the control group in the absence of microorganisms and nitrate the cod release in both groups could be divided into three phases i e increase constant and decrease phase according to the cod release rate crr for the control group the crr increased gradually from 0 to 121 0 mg l d in the first 3 days and stayed at 108 2 12 5 mg l d in the following 4 days and decreased to 22 9 mg l d from 7 days onwards the cod yield was 0 6 g cod g rice for the treatment group the crr rose to 432 7 mg l d in 1 4 days stayed at 370 8 64 6 mg l d in 4 7 days and dropped to 161 7 mg l d in 8 10 days when the rice was completely hydrolyzed the cumulative cod was 2184 7 mg l and the cod yield was 1 1 g cod g rice supplemental files these results indicated that the working sludge functional bacteria and nitrate promoted the crr of rice particle which could be ascribed to the enhanced hydrolysis from hydrolyzing bacteria because rice contains a small amount of proteins the nitrogen content of rice was also determined with the value of 8 9 10 3 g n g rice and the cod n ratio of complete hydrolysis of rice reached 123 6 indicating that the released amount of nitrogen was very small compared with the released cod and accounted for less than 0 5 of the influent nitrogen in sad process which was negligible 3 2 performance of the sad system nitrogen removal was the main functional objective of the sad system as can be seen from fig 3 the performance between 0 and 70 days could be divided into three phases according to the tn concentration in the effluent fig 3 table 1 the details were shown below 3 2 1 performance of sad system in the absence of scs in phase i 1 19 days the influent ammonium nitrite and tn concentrations were set at 88 3 10 4 mg n l 131 4 8 2 mg n l and 221 0 15 8 mg n l the corresponding removal efficiencies reached 99 1 0 5 99 7 0 2 and 92 7 1 1 respectively the effluent ammonium nitrite nitrate and tn concentrations were 0 8 0 5 mg n l 0 4 0 3 mg n l 14 9 2 2 mg n l and 16 1 2 6 mg n l the nitrogen loading rate nlr and the nitrogen removal rate nrr were 1 8 0 1 kg m3 d and 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d fig 3 the cod concentration in the effluent was also at a low level of 42 7 15 6 mg l which was analyzed as the refractory soluble organic matter tryptophan like protein secreted by microorganism fig s2 zeng et al 2017 the results demonstrated that the working performance of anammox system was stable with the statistical standard deviation stdev of nrr at 0 1 kg m3 d and the stdev of ammonium nitrite and tn removal efficiency below 1 1 however the effluent tn concentration was high 15 mg n l with nitrate as the main contributor 92 5 indicating that the nitrate removal was the major bottleneck of sad process before the addition of scs 3 2 2 performance of sad system in the presence of scs 3 2 2 1 addition of scs for the first time in phase ii 20 53 days on day 20 8 g rice was added into the inner component of sad system the stoichiometric c n ratio was shown in supplemental files in 20 25 days the effluent nitrate concentration decreased from 19 2 mg n l to 12 6 mg n l and the effluent tn concentration declined from 20 0 mg n l to 13 8 mg n l the tn removal efficiency increased from 90 8 to 93 0 on day 26 the effluent nitrate and tn concentrations dropped sharply to 1 6 mg n l and 2 2 mg n l respectively in the following days until day 29 the effluent tn concentrations were all below 5 mg n l with the tn removal efficiency over 98 0 however the effluent nitrate concentration started to rise from 7 7 mg n l on day 30 to 15 1 mg n l on day 33 and the effluent tn concentration increased from 8 4 mg n l to 16 6 mg n l with a declined tn removal efficiency on day 33 the added rice was exhausted fig 3a rethink the performance during 20 33 day with the first addition of scs it was found that the nitrate and tn removal was in line with the cod release process from scs in the batch experiments fig 2 indicating cod release from scs might be the rate limiting step of nitrate removal in the sad process therefore it is reasonable to regard the addition frequency and amount of scs as key parameters for regulating the performance of sad process 3 2 2 2 optimization of scs addition frequency on day 34 8 g rice was put into the sad system for the second time in 34 39 days the effluent nitrate concentration gradually decreased from 16 7 mg n l to 10 3 mg n l the effluent tn concentration declined from 17 5 mg n l to 11 5 mg n l and the tn removal efficiency rose from 91 6 to 94 5 on day 40 8 g rice was put into the sad system for the third time the time interval for scs addition was shortened to 7 days in 40 46 days the effluent nitrate concentration dropped from 6 0 mg n l to 1 3 mg n l then stayed at 1 1 1 4 mg n l and the effluent tn concentration fell from 8 3 mg n l to 1 9 mg n l then stabilized at 2 2 1 8 mg n l the tn removal efficiency rose from 96 2 to 99 1 then stayed at 98 9 0 9 fig 3a however a small amount of sludge at the bottom of settling zone was observed to turn from red to black which might be triggered by the reaction of excessive cod release from scs and reduced sulfate to form the black fes kang et al 2018 3 2 2 3 optimization of scs addition amount on day 47 a reduced amount of rice of 6 g was put into the sad system for the fourth time in 47 53 days the effluent nitrate concentration decreased from 9 5 mg n l to 4 0 mg n l then stayed at 0 4 0 6 mg n l the effluent tn concentration declined from 13 1 mg n l to 6 8 mg n l then stabilized at 1 4 1 2 mg n l and the tn removal efficiency improved from 93 3 to 96 6 then stayed at 99 3 0 6 fig 3a the sludge at the bottom of settling zone turned from black to yellowish brown the effluent concentration of ammonium and nitrite in phase ii stayed at a low level of 0 5 0 4 mg n l 0 8 0 7 mg n l respectively and no change was observed for the consumption ratio of nitrite to ammonium the effluent concentration of cod was 46 8 19 4 mg l which showed no significant difference from that in phase i p 0 05 table 1 fig s2 compared with the performance of sad system in phase i it can be concluded that the tn removal efficiency increased by 6 6 when the addition rate was set at 6 g rice 7 days achieving the match between the cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d from scs and the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d from anammox with consumption ratio of cod to nitrate of 7 5 which was close to the value of 7 2 determined in batch experiments in phase iii 54 70 days 6 g rice 7 days was added as scs to the sad system to confirm the performance stability the results showed that the effluent concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and tn were 0 6 0 2 mg n l 0 4 0 3 mg n l 0 5 0 4 mg n l and 1 4 0 5 mg n l and the corresponding removal efficiencies reached up to 99 3 0 3 99 7 0 2 and 99 3 0 2 respectively the effluent cod concentration stayed at 45 7 20 6 mg l fig 3 table 1 it could be concluded the sad system is feasible for the advanced nitrogen removal 3 3 change of scs surface in this study rice was chosen as scs rice is mainly composed of starch which can be hydrolyzed gu et al 2004 to understand the cod release from scs the rice particle was observed under stereoscope and sem within a cycle from day 20 to day 33 as shown in fig 4 initially the rice particle had an ellipsoid shape with a length of about 2 4 mm and a volume surface mean diameter vmd of 3 4 mm its surface was smooth and without adhesion of bacterial cell fig 4a as the time went more and more bacterial cells were found to attach on the surface until fully covered the surface and a layer of yellowish biofilm was gradually formed on the surface of wire cage and scs fig s3 fig 4d the starch on the surface was obviously hydrolyzed leading to local invagination many starch grains with a diameter of about 5 μm exposed to the surface fig 4e f at the end of the cycle 8 days the rice particle shrank with a smaller size of about 1 1 5 mm and vmd of 1 3 mm and its surface became rough and loose fig 4g many holes appeared on the surface with a lot of bacillus on the starch grains fig 4h i with the hydrolysis of scs from the surface to the interior the rice became smaller 3 4 saa of anammox sludge anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob in the form of granular sludge played a key role in the sad system however the specific anammox activity of granular sludge could be disturbed by organic carbon source because the db could compete with anaob for nitrite in the presence of organic matter ni et al 2012 chen et al 2016 the saa of granular sludge before on day 15 and after on day 66 the addition of scs was determined as shown in fig 5 on day 15 the ammonium removal rate nitrite removal rate nitrate generation rate and tn removal rate of anammox sludge were 78 2 5 7 mg n g vss d 122 2 12 2 mg n g vss d 15 9 2 4 mg n g vss d and 216 2 20 2 mg n g vss d respectively on day 66 the ammonium removal rate nitrite removal rate nitrate generation rate and tn removal rate of anammox sludge were 87 2 4 3 mg n g vss d 135 6 8 9 mg n g vss d 18 5 0 8 mg n g vss d and 241 2 13 1 mg n g vss d respectively the results demonstrated that the effect of scs on the anaob was negligible in the sad system 3 5 analysis of microbial community the microbial community is the functional source of nitrogen removal system high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene was used to analyze the microbial community at phylum level fig 6 a the main bacteria were planctomycetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for more than 70 of the total species in s1 anammox sludge before addition of scs s2 anammox sludge after addition of scs and s3 denitrifying floc sludge after addition of scs the abundances of planctomycetes phylum were 40 4 41 4 and 34 7 respectively in s4 denitrifying film on scs and s5 denitrifying film on wire cage the proteobacteria phylum was found as the most dominant bacteria with relative abundance of 41 1 and 35 1 respectively and followed by bacteroidetes it is well accepted that bacteria in proteobacteria phylum have close relationship with the denitrification process lu et al 2014 while bacteroidetes phylum is mainly composed of hydrolyzing bacteria hb cotta et al 2003 at the genus level fig 6b in s1 s2 and s3 the relative abundances of candidatus brocadia were 38 6 36 8 and 29 3 respectively and the relative abundances of olb13 belonging to chloroflexi phylum were 9 6 9 2 and 6 2 respectively which could reinforce the structure of granules in the form of a filamentous biomass xu et al 2020 in s4 and s5 the relative abundance of akyh767 unclassified belonging to bacteroidetes phylum was 9 9 and 6 7 respectively in s4 the relative abundance of denitratisoma and comamonadaceae unclassified was 19 1 and 6 0 respectively in s5 that of dechlorobacter and denitratisoma was 11 1 and 10 8 respectively comparing the bacterial community of s1 and s2 similar component was observed indicating that the addition of scs exerted little effect on microbial communities of anammox sludge however s3 showed a decreased abundance of anaob and increased abundance of db compared with those in s2 s4 and s5 showed a far higher abundance of db than that of s2 and s3 indicating that the abundance of db rose in the upper part of reactor with the addition of scs fig 6 the species diversity of microbial community can be indicated by shannon index the higher the shannon index the higher the community species diversity in this study the shannon indexes of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 were 3 4 3 7 4 0 4 3 and 4 4 respectively comparing shannon index of s1 and s2 it could be found that the species diversity of microbial community in anammox sludge increased moderately with the addition of scs comparing shannon index of s2 s3 s4 and s5 it could be concluded that the species diversity of microbial community increased gradually from the bottom to the top of reactor 4 discussion 4 1 performance of sad process although anammox biotechnology has been widely applied for its attractive advantages lackner et al 2014 its nitrate production hinders the effluent from reaching the discharge standard of tn ji et al 2020b liu et al 2019 since the denitrification process is capable of removing nitrate a new sad system was then developed for the advanced nitrogen removal by using solid carbon source scs and coupling anammox with denitrification the operation of sad system demonstrated that it was successful with the tn removal efficiency nre of 99 3 0 2 tn removal rate nrr of 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d and effluent tn concentration of 1 4 0 5 mg n l the effluent cod concentration could also stay at a low level of 45 7 20 6 mg l fig 3 due to well match between the cod release from scs and nitrate production from anammox the nre of sad process in this study was significantly better than that of similar processes moreover the high nrr of sad process was achieved compared with the counterpart of similar processes therefore the sad process had indeed reached a high level regarding the process performance table 2 4 2 sustained cod release from scs carbon source is vital for denitrification generally the solid carbon sources scs e g rice wheat millet exist in the form of particles wani et al 2012 the starch c6h10o5 n inside scs particles needs to be firstly hydrolyzed into glucose c6h10o6 and then used as electron donor for denitrification jiang et al 2020 since the starch arrangement is compact in rice it is not easy for hydrolyzing bacteria via amylase to directly penetrate the rice particle and the starch is expected to be released as soluble organics from the rice surface layer by layer fig 4 the rice particles in millimeter dimension can provide a large surface for functional bacteria in micron dimension to live however the exposed surface of rice particles is limited and so it controls the release rate of starchy substance by cod in other words the cod release from scs is the surface controlled process in which the exposed surface of rice particle finally decides the hydrolyzing rate of rice starch in this study the cod release rate crr from rice particle demonstrated a pattern of three phases increase constant and decrease phase this pattern can be explained with the hypothesis of surface controlled release in the first increase phase bacillus which was included in bacteroidetes phylum and was mainly composed of hydrolyzing bacteria hb increased gradually on the surface of rice particle the migration and colonization of hb on the surface of rice particle led to the increase of glucose dissolving rate or cod release rate until the hb cover the whole surface in the second constant phase the exposed surface of rice particle keeps relatively constant because the decrease of surface area is not so large per starch layer in the outside leading to the constant of cod release rate in the third decrease phase the exposed surface of rice particle becomes significantly less leading to the decrease of cod release rate and eventually the complete stop figs 2 3 following the pattern of cod release the cod could be supplied on the denitrification demand with proper addition amount and frequency of scs when the addition rate was set at 6 g rice 7 days the cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d from scs matched the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d from anammox with the consumption ratio of cod to nitrate of 7 5 achieving high efficient nitrogen removal without excessive effluent cod 4 3 location of functional bacteria in sad system anaob and db are the functional microorganisms of sad system zhang et al 2017 however they have different respiratory characteristics e g anaob are autotrophic bacteria which do not need organic matter as carbon source while db are heterotrophic bacteria which need organic matter as carbon source cao et al 2020 in the presence of organic matter db can eliminate the nitrate produced by anaob and can also compete with anaob for nitrite interfering with anammox chamchoi et al 2008 qin et al 2017 therefore the db was located separately from the anaob in the sad system in this study an inner component was introduced into the upper part of sad system the scs was filled into the inner component to colonize db thus separating db from anaob in the lower part of sad system the nitrate from anammox in the lower part can be eliminated in the upper part with the aid of scs the consumption of cod from scs is closely related with the production of nitrate from anammox in a sense the nitrate production by anaob auto regulated the nitrate removal by db via the cod consumption by hb forming a fit community for db hb and anaob as shown in fig 7 in the sad system candidatus brocadia were identified as the dominant anaob which lived in the form of granular sludge denitratisoma were identified as the dominant db which lived in the form of biofilm and suspended sludge fig 6 because the scs like rice particle becomes smaller with the cod release fig 4 the functional bacteria on the scs will be gradually washed out the db amount can well match the anaob amount with a proper allocation of reactor volume and a good cooperation between two bacterial groups although db grow far more fast than anaob in such a case the microbial community was stable and robust giving a strong support to the sad system 5 conclusion 1 a novel sad process was developed for the advanced nitrogen removal by coupling anammox with solid phase denitrification in one reactor a good performance was achieved with low effluent tn concentration of 1 4 0 5 mg n l high tn removal efficiency of 99 3 0 2 and high tn removal rate of 1 7 0 1 kg m3 d 2 the pattern of sustained cod release from scs was revealed the average cod yield was 1 1 g cod g rice the average cod release rate of 0 9 kg cod m3 d matched the nitrate production rate of 1 2 10 1 kg n m3 d with the addition rate of 6 g rice 7 days 3 candidatus brocadia and denitratisoma were identified to be the dominant anaob and db respectively they located separately and worked synergistically in the sad system contributing the nitrogen removal of 92 7 anammox and 6

17179,oxidation ditches ods are often used for wastewater treatment however limitations of ods like high energy expenditure and increased sludge sedimentation hinder its wide application in this study the computational fluid dynamics cfd model integrated with activated sludge model no 2 asm2 was proposed and applied in a full scale od the integrated model provided heterogeneous information on the characteristics of hydrodynamics and biokinetics of od especially with respect to the simulation of total phosphorus removal by cfd asm2 integration model for the first time the simulated values of flow velocities suspended solids ss dissolved oxygen chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were well validated with the measured results with the standard deviation errors of less than 5 56 0 28 0 74 7 39 3 17 5 27 and 7 40 respectively based on the integrated model four different operational strategies were simulated the proposed operational strategy of operating 7 surface aerators and 10 submerged impellers not only met the standard discharge requirements gb 18918 2002 but also consumed less energy by 22 3 compared with the original strategy of operating 9 surface aerators and 13 submerged impellers meanwhile this proposed operational strategy also reduced the ss concentrations in the second and fourth channels which was beneficial to elimination of sludge sedimentation moreover the proposed operational strategy was successfully applied and validated in full scale od the foregoing results collectively suggest that the

often used for wastewater treatment because of the high tolerance to shock loading and hydraulic fluctuations and small sludge production guo et al 2013a jin et al 2015 luo et al 2020 however ods are also susceptible to limitations like high energy consumption and increased sludge sedimentation at the bottom of ditch due to the improper design and management liu et al 2013 tao and chengwen 2012 particularly caused by its complex ditch structure and the biochemical reactions thereinto littleton et al 2007b mathematical modelling offers an effective tool to investigate the hydrodynamics related with physical chemical and biological processes in ods guo et al 2013a liu et al 2014 xu et al 2018 in modelling of wastewater treatment plants wwtps a simplified tool of tanks in series tis model was developed by levenspiel 1962 which was classified as systematic modelling approach however the tis approach easily leads to inaccurate predictions since the systematic modelling has its limitation because of its incapability to take heterogeneities of flow behavior xie et al 2011 therefore the wide application of computational fluid dynamics cfd in simulating hydrodynamics in wastewater processes like ods have been reported due to its high prediction accuracy and relatively low expense lei and ni 2014 xu et al 2020 cfd can efficiently simulate fluid dynamics and mass transference in od model littleton et al 2007a yang et al 2011 moreover by means of the integration of activated sludge model asm into cfd models the analyses of both hydrodynamics and biokinetics were possible for a more comprehensive understanding of wastewater treatment process in ods like the influence of air diffuser layout and aeration regime on wastewater treatment fayolle et al 2007 sánchez et al 2018 however a complete cfd simulation of hydrodynamics in ods combined with biokinetic reactions is difficult mainly due to the complex models applied requirements for major random access memory and long time computation karpinska et al 2015 climent et al 2018 successfully combined cfd with asm no 1 asm1 to simulate nitrification and denitrification processes and residence time distribution in the anoxic tank lei and ni 2014 used a three phase cfd model combined with asm1 to investigate organic carbon degradation and nitrogen transformation processes in od currently phosphorus removal is the most important part for wwtps and the phosphorus discharge standards are becoming strict worldwide arnaldos and pagilla 2010 remy et al 2014 however all the foregoing mentioned models like the combination of cfd and asm1 failed to simulate the biological phosphorus removal process activated sludge model no 2 asm2 is an extension of the asm1 in terms of biological phosphorus removal however it remains unclear about the simulation of hydrodynamics biokinetics and variations of total phosphorus in od using the integrated cfd asm2 model meanwhile the energy consumption of the aeration in wwtps accounts for more than 60 of the total energy expenditure gude 2015 for od operation surface aerators and submerged impellers consume most of energy expenditure of the whole wwtps therefore the optimization of models related to od operational strategies with lower energy expenditure is always an inherent driving force for modelling in wwtps xie et al 2011 qiu et al 2018 climent et al 2019 more energy consumption is needed to meet the lower phosphorus discharge limit in the effluent of wwtps currently few integrated cfd asm2 models have been proposed to optimize the operational strategy in a full scale od i e treatment capacity of 50 000 m3 per day in terms of both energy expenditure and all the discharge characteristics of effluent including suspended solids ss dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and particularly total phosphorus tp the aim of this study is to develop an integrated cfd asm2 model to simulate both hydrodynamics and biokinetics for wastewater treatment processes in a full scale od the cfd asm2 model was testified with experimental results of flow velocity ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations relying on the developed model the simulation results of the original strategy and four proposed different simulation scenarios after modification in a full scale od were comparatively analyzed the suitable operational strategy which both meets the standards for effluent discharge gb 18 918 2002 and achieves economic benefits was proposed and the simulation results were validated in a full scale operation details can be found in the schematic diagram of this study fig s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the full scale od the full scale carrousel 2000 od of 50 000 m3 wastewater treatment capacity per day was studied in wuhan china namely the nantaizi lake wwtp fig s2 the total area is 156 90 m 41 00 m and the height of the od is 5 30 m a total working volume of the od is 31 620 m3 a schematic showing the od and test locations is presented in fig 1 the full scale carrousel 2000 od is a four channel circular ditch water depth 4 50 m straight portion 126 40 m in length and 10 00 m in width for each channel equipped with rotating disc surface aerators 13 sets and paddle type submerged impellers 14 sets the radii of inner and outer semi circle are 10 20 m and 20 50 m respectively the internal wall is 0 10 m in thickness all the surface aerators of a1 to a13 are located in the aerobic zone each surface aerator is equipped with 33 groups of rotation discs along the rotating shaft with a size of 10 0 m in length and 1 50 m in diameter the submerged depth of all the rotation discs is 0 60 m the schematic diagram of the vertical section of od and the vertical position of the surface aerator in the od are presented in fig s3 and s4 respectively the rotational speed and the oxygen injection rate of each surface aerator are 6 rad s 1 and 75 kg oxygen per hour respectively moreover the five submerged impellers of b1 to b5 are in the anoxic zone while b6 to b14 are in the aerobic zone fig 1 the diameter of each submerged impeller is 2 50 m 2 2 numerical description 2 2 1 geometry and grid generation the three dimensional 3d model of the full scale od in nantaizi lake wwtp is established by the gambit 2 4 6 ansys inc pennsylvania usa as shown in fig s5 the meshes of tetrahedrons are composed by gambit 2 4 6 the tetrahedral cells of 658 967 1186 220 and 2328 622 are investigated and compared the simulated velocities on a transversal line for three different grid sizes in the od are shown in fig s6 at last the grid with 1186 220 cells is chosen for subsequent section by the trade off between precision and computational requirements all simulations were calculated on the dell precision t5820 equipped with an intel xeon 3 7 ghz processor and 32 gb ram for about 3 h of each run 2 2 2 governing equations for the prediction of the flow field ss concentration and water qualities a 3d cfd model is established thereof a commercial cfd code fluent 13 0 ansys inc pennsylvania usa was used for development of cfd model due to the complicated interactions between gas phase liquid phase and solid phase the three phase flow simulation would be difficult to be converged the workload of computational requirement would be huge when the cfd model is integrated with biochemical model due to the complexity of asm2 in order to reduce the workload of computation the two stage method including the resolution of the fluid dynamic and the biochemical reaction equations was proposed climent et al 2018 sánchez et al 2018 therefore the two phase water and ss user defined solid phase flow simulation of flow field and ss concentration distributions were carried out at the first stage according to the simulation results of the distributions of flow field and ss concentration the mass fraction of each component in asm2 at the inlet and the oxygen gas injection rate at the operating surface aerators region were set at the second stage the details of governing equations for the two phase cfd model can be found in text s1 in the supporting information the species transport model is applied for simulation of biochemical reactions lei and ni 2014 in order to get a comprehensive simulation of biochemical reactions in a full scale od the asm2 which contained carbon oxidation nitrification denitrification and biological phosphorus removal processes was used in this integrated model the mass fraction of each component in asm2 is calculated for each species in the integrated model the conservation equation for species is expressed in eq 1 1 t ρ y i ρ ν y i j i s i where ρ kg m 3 denotes the mean density for each component y i wt denotes the mass fraction for each component i j i kg m 3 s 1 denotes the diffusion flux for each component i s i kg m 3 s 1 denotes the rate of creation by addition from the user defined sources the first term in eq 1 is the unsteady term which is zero due to the steady state simulations the components and corresponding processes in asm2 are added as user defined sources s i of species transport model by user defined function udf in fluent the total number of species is 19 compared with 13 in asm1 model henze et al 2000 the 19 process rate equations in asm2 are listed in table s1 the species concentrations are calculated by the combination of process rate equations and stoichiometric coefficients matrix zhao et al 1999 the diffusion flux j i is calculated as eq 2 2 j i ρ d i m μ t s c t y i where d i m m2 s 1 denotes the mass diffusion coefficient for species i in the mixture μ t kg m 1 s 1 is the turbulent viscosity s c t denotes the turbulent schmidt number 2 2 3 boundary conditions and solver settings for boundary conditions of the full scale od simulation the moving wall model and fan model are used as simulations of surface aerator and submerged impeller respectively xie et al 2014 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2011 the details of simulations of surface aerator and submerged impeller can be found in text s2 in the supporting information the rotational speed of rotation discs is set as the same as operating surface aerators the roughness height of the moving wall is 0 02 m along with the roughness constant of 1 yang et al 2010 the dissolved oxygen concentrations were simulated as species and input into the two phase model for calculation the mass flow inlet is introduced for the operating surface aerator and its value is set to the oxygen injection rate velocity inlet 0 2 m s 1 and pressure outlet atmospheric pressure are applied for the od the mass fraction of each component in asm2 is set at the inlet of the od and its value is based on the measurement results of ss cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations in the influent since the wastewater of the nantaizi lake wwtp was mainly municipal wastewater and the water temperature during the field test was also in acceptable range of about 20 c therefore the values for the kinetic parameters and the stoichiometric coefficients used in the typical asm2 model were adopted herein in brief the default parameters of a typical asm2 model provided by henze et al 2000 were used as the kinetic parameters as listed in table s2 supporting information the major processes included hydrolysis phosphorus and nitrogen removal and further precipitation zhao et al 1999 henze et al 2000 the microorganisms like heterotrophic organisms phosphorus accumulating organisms and nitrifiers were involved in process dynamics table s2 while the stoichiometric coefficients together with their definitions are shown in table s3 and all stoichiometric coefficients were set at default from literature references given climent et al 2018 henze et al 2000 and none of them were newly calibrated moreover the good agreement between the simulated and measured results also indicated that the kinetic parameters and the stoichiometric coefficients used in the integrated model were acceptable the typical values for the kinetic parameters table s2 and the stoichiometric coefficients table s3 of asm2 were used in this model the water and ss user defined solid phase are chosen for the simulation of two phase flow based on the preliminary study the density of the solid phase is assumed to be 1 03 103 kg m 3 xie et al 2014 the slip velocity of takács equation is used to simulate the settling behavior of ss by user defined function takács et al 1991 xu et al 2020 therefore the slip velocity is expressed as eq 3 3 v s 0 004 e 0 43 x e 1 89 x where vs m s 1 denotes the settling velocity of ss x mg l 1 denotes the concentration of ss for the solving process the workload of computational requirement would be huge when the cfd model is integrated with biochemical model due to the complexity of asm2 the two stage method including the resolution of the fluid dynamic and the biochemical reaction equations was proposed by some researchers to reduce the workload of computation climent et al 2018 sánchez et al 2018 therefore the two phase flow simulation of flow field and ss concentration distributions were carried out at the first stage according to the simulation results of the distributions of flow field and ss concentration the mass fraction of each component in asm2 at the inlet and the oxygen injection rate at the operating surface aerators region were set at the second stage then all 19 reaction processes of the asm2 table s1 were imported for the resolution of the species transport model by udf to calculate the biochemical reactions in the integrated cfd asm2 model 2 2 4 different operational strategies the operational strategies for the surface aerators 13 sets and the submerged impellers 14 sets of the full scale od are determined by many parameters such as facilities integrity do concentrations and effluent quality at the outlet in brief as shown in fig 2 a the original strategy of wwtp was characterized with surface aerators with a number of 9 sets and submerged impellers with a number of 13 sets in order to get an optimized operational strategy which can both meet the standards for effluent discharge gb 18918 2002 and reduce energy expenditure four operational strategies were simulated by the integrated cfd asm2 model fig 2b e these four simulation scenarios i iv showed less surface aerators or submerged impellers than the original strategy since the full scale od showed a surplus amount in the design of the aeration rate the adjacent surface aerators were discontinuously operated in order to optimize the operational strategies the arrangement of the operating submerged impellers was set correspondingly according to the operation of the surface aerators and the overall flow field needed to be considered when the flow velocity in the ditch was not lower than the limit of 0 30 m s 1 liu et al 2014 the occurrence of sludge sedimentation can be eliminated meanwhile reduction of energy expenditure was also considered thus the optimized operational strategy to both reduce energy expenditure and simultaneously ensure the quality of effluent was expected to be achieved therefore the simulation scenarios i iv with 8 7 6 and 5 sets of operating non adjacent surface aerators and 10 10 11 and 14 sets of operating submerged impellers were designed fig 2b e all of the 14 sets of submerged impellers were operated for simulation scenario iv 2 3 experimental analyses 2 3 1 the measurement of flow velocity and dissolved oxygen for the validation of the integrated model six typical test locations referred to as tl 1 to 6 and four test lines one for do test three for ss test were set due to real operating conditions and the restrictions of measurement equipment fig 1 specifically the tl 1 is in the anoxic zone and the tl 2 to 6 are in the aerobic zone the schematic locations of sampling points for every test location are shown in fig s7 the layout of the typical test locations was determined by comprehensively considering the operating conditions of surface aerators submerged impellers and the site available for measurement the details of flow velocity and do measurements are shown in text s3 in the supporting information 2 3 2 water samples measurement samples for the measurements of ss cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were withdrawn with a plexiglass water sampler volume of 2 5 l and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c with all measurements finished within two days the details of ss cod tn nh4 n and tp measurements are shown in text s4 in the supporting information the water temperature during the field test is about 20 c 2 4 statistical analysis the comparisons of the simulated results and the measured data were analyzed by the normalized standard error as shown in eq 4 lei and ni 2014 4 nse 1 n n 1 i 1 n x si x mi 2 1 n i 1 n x mi where nse denotes the normalized standard error n denotes the number of measured data xsi denotes the simulated result of the i th parameter xmi denotes the measured data of the i th parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation and validation of the original strategy a total of 9 surface aerators and 13 submerged impellers of the original strategy were operated as shown in fig 2a the hydrodynamics and biochemical reactions of the original strategy were simulated by the integrated cfd asm2 model 3 1 1 simulation of hydrodynamics the hydrodynamic characteristics were important for od in terms of the analysis of sludge sedimentation wei et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the distributions of flow velocities and ss concentrations of the original strategy are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the overall flow velocities were relatively higher due to the increased numbers of surface aerators and submerged impellers however the flow velocity distribution in the cross section of the channel was extremely uneven due to the excessive flow velocity in some curved areas in fig 3 for instance the flow velocity was only about 0 2 m s 1 at the side closer to the internal wall while the flow velocity was more than 0 8 m s 1 at the side farther from the internal wall in the area near the test locations of tl 3 fig s8 the ss sedimentation tended to occur in areas where the flow velocity was low particularly on the side where the flow velocity was not uniform in the cross section of channel xu et al 2018 the above mentioned results were further confirmed by results shown in fig 4 it indicated that ss concentration was lower in areas with higher flow velocity while the ss concentration was higher in areas with lower flow velocity the ss concentration was inversely related to the flow velocity xie et al 2014 the ss sedimentation was prone to occur in areas with large differences in flow velocity such as the areas near surface aerators of a2 a9 and a11 fig 4c therefore the test locations of ss concentration were particularly set in these three areas for the comparisons of the original strategy and simulation scenarios i iv 3 1 2 simulation of biochemical reactions the distributions of do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations of the original strategy are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a c it was noted that the do concentrations were higher in areas where the surface aerator operated in the aerobic zone than those of other areas as the distance from the surface aerators increased the do concentration decreased there were do concentration gradients among the operating surface aerators the average do concentrations in the top middle and down layers were 2 57 2 19 and 1 94 mg l 1 respectively the overall do concentration also decreased with the decrease of the distance above the bottom of the ditch from fig 5a to c the simulated overall do concentration distribution was similar to those in other literatures which focused on the ods with surface aerators guo et al 2013b lei and ni 2014 because the number of surface aerators operating in the original strategy was relatively high hence do concentration of the original strategy exceeded 2 mg l 1 in most of the aerobic zones on the contrary the do concentration in the anoxic zone was close to zero due to the absence of operating aeration facility the good separation between the anoxic zone and the aerobic zone might be beneficial for the nitrification and denitrification processes zhou et al 2015 as shown in fig 5d f the distribution of cod concentration showed an opposite trend to that of do concentration it was noted that there was a large difference in cod distribution between the aerobic zone and the anoxic zone moreover the cod concentration increased as the height above the bottom of the ditch decreased from fig 5d to f the average cod concentrations in the top middle and down layers were 58 2 61 1 and 70 5 mg l 1 respectively in areas with high do concentrations the microbial activities may be enhanced to degrade cod thus resulting in decreased concentrations meanwhile the influent and effluent of the od were at the lower and the upper layer positions respectively therefore the cod concentration of the lower layer was higher than that of the upper layer moreover the cod concentration in the anoxic zone was about 200 mg l 1 which was lower than the influent 271 mg l 1 it is deduced that some organic matter can be removed under anaerobic conditions comeau et al 1986 somiya et al 1988 as shown in fig 5g i the tn concentration of the influent was about 27 mg l 1 moreover the overall tn concentration quickly decreased to about 17 mg l 1 in the anoxic zone since the do concentration in this zone was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 the organic matters could be degraded by the denitrifying bacteria in wastewater for denitrification to convert nitrate nitrite to nitrogen gas in this zone in the aerobic zone simultaneous nitrification and denitrification might occur in some areas due to the do concentration gradients guo et al 2013b zhou et al 2015 meanwhile the generated nitrate by nitrification in the aerobic zone was returned to the anoxic zone by the internal flow recycle figs 5j l show that the nh4 n concentration in the aerobic zone was significantly lower than that in the anoxic zone the good nitrification was performed under aerobic conditions because of high do concentration similar to the cod distribution the nh4 n concentration increased as the height above the bottom of the ditch decreased from fig 5j to l the average nh4 n concentrations in the top middle and down layers were 4 5 4 7 and 4 8 mg l 1 respectively due to the surface aerators a lower nh4 n concentration area was formed near the outlet with the aid of cfd asm2 the variations of tp concentrations were revealed in od as shown in fig 5m o the tp concentration in the anoxic zone was higher and the tp concentration in the aerobic zone was significantly lower the tp concentration was influenced by the inlet and was not removed in the anoxic zone under aerobic conditions polyphosphate accumulating organisms are able to accumulate excessive quantities of phosphorus into cells to obtain energy as is known the polyphosphate accumulating organisms accumulate carbon sources by using energy generated from hydrolysis of polyphosphate shen et al 2017 thereby the variations of tp concentration in the aerobic zone were related with the changes of do concentration in the area where the surface aerators were operating the tp concentrations were lower fig 5m some researchers have also reported that the phosphorus accumulation by polyphosphate accumulating organisms was significant related to the do concentration higher do concentration enhanced the activities of polyphosphate accumulating organisms and the related phosphorus accumulation process coma et al 2012 shen et al 2017 since the environmental requirement of the phosphorus discharge is becoming more and more strict the cfd integrated with asm2 model proposed in this study is meaningful to simulate the variations of total phosphorus concentrations in wwtps in summary of the simulation results of the original strategy the overall do concentration in the aerobic zone was also high thus resulting in higher energy expenditure meanwhile due to the continuous operation of the adjacent surface aerators and submerged impellers ss concentrations in some areas were relatively higher thus causing the possible ss sedimentation due to the uneven distribution of the flow field therefore it is necessary to optimize the original strategy 3 1 3 validation of the integrated cfd asm2 model the simulation results of flow velocities and the corresponding measured data under the original strategy were compared and validated fig 6 according to eq 4 the normalized standard error of flow velocities was less than 5 56 which fulfilled the requirement for a good agreement with the standard error of less than 10 littleton et al 2007a figure s9 compares the ss concentrations both from simulation and measurement for the original strategy at the different test locations in the different sections the simulated results of ss concentration were consistent with the standard error less than 0 28 it was noted that the concentrations of ss at the down layer was slightly higher than those at the top layer at the same test locations for instance the measured ss concentrations of top and down layers were 4562 7 and 4844 0 mg l at tl 2 respectively fig 7 compares the dissolved oxygen concentrations both from simulation and measurement for the original strategy at five test locations do concentration in the top middle and down layers of most areas decreased sequentially due to the oxygen input by the surface aerator fig 7 meanwhile the do concentration in the aerobic area was higher because of the presence of more surface aerators fig 8 compares the dissolved oxygen concentrations both from simulation and measurement along the line of dissolved oxygen test as the distance from surface aerators increased the do concentration gradually decreased the simulation for do results was statistically significant with the normalized standard error less than 0 74 the error results of do simulation in this study were smaller than those reported in other previous studies littleton et al 2007a lei and ni 2014 comparisons of the simulated and measured cod tn nh4 n and tp of the original strategy at eight test locations are shown in fig s10 the cod tn nh4 n and tp of influent were measured as 271 06 32 51 17 67 and 2 72 mg l 1 respectively these measured data were used as input parameters in the integrated cfd asm2 model as such the cod tn nh4 n and tp distributions were obtained through the calculation of the integrated model as a result the integrated model had good simulation accurancy for cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations with the normalized standard errors of less than 7 39 3 17 5 27 and 7 40 respectively fig s10 3 2 comparisons between the original strategy and simulation scenarios of four different operational strategies in full scale operation 3 2 1 comparison of the do distribution based on the developed and validated cfd asm2 integration model four simulation scenarios of different operational strategies were predicted in the full scale od from the analyses of simulation results for the original strategy the do distribution was the determining factor for the simulation result which significantly affected the distributions of cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations the comparisons of contour profiles of do concentrations under different operational strategies at the top layer are shown in fig 9 a e the overall do concentration in the aerobic zone showed a downward trend as the number of operating surface aerators decreased from fig 9a to e the do distributions were more uniform in simulation scenarios i and ii fig 9b and c than others due to the uniform distribution of operating surface aerators however the do concentrations were low below 0 5 mg l 1 in the areas near the guiding wall or curve bend in simulation scenarios iii and iv fig 9d and e due to the limited number of operating surface aerators and oxygen was not provided sufficiently thus failing to achieve a do concentration of less than 2 mg l 1 in the aerobic zone for simulation scenarios iii and iv the overall aeration capacity might be not enough to meet the needs of aerobic treatment arnaldos et al 2015 3 2 2 comparison of the ss distribution the comparisons of contour profiles of ss concentrations in the down layer under different operational strategies are shown in fig 9f j in the anoxic zone the original strategy and the simulation scenario iv were both equipped with five operating impellers while the other three operational strategies were carried out without the impeller b1 the results showed that there was no much difference in the ss distributions in the anoxic zone among the five operational strategies the impeller b1 was near to the inlet of the od so the driving force of impeller b1 was affected by the flow momentum of the inlet xie et al 2014 as such the operational status of the impeller b1 showed indiscernible effects on the ss concentration distribution in the anoxic zone at the first channel of aerobic zone the ss concentration was higher due to insufficient driving force for the simulation scenario iv which was the only one without operating surface aerators in this channel at the second channel of aerobic zone the original strategy had two adjacent operating surface aerators before the curve which caused uneven flow field by a strong driving force in addition only one surface aerator was operated in the simulation scenarios iii and iv which presented a weak driving force for the distribution of flow field therefore the simulation scenarios i and ii with two non adjacent operating surface aerators showed lower ss concentrations than the other three operational strategies at the second channel at the fourth channel the ss concentration near the surface aerator a2 were obviously decreased by turning on a2 the reason for this result may be due to the operation of surface aerator a2 which was at the downstream position of curve could effectively supplement the kinetic energy loss of the fluid through the curve by collision meanwhile the original strategy and the simulation scenario i with both the two operating surface aerators and one operating impeller before curve at the fourth channel required too much energy expenditure to eliminate the uneven flow field the simulation scenario iv without operating surface aerators before and after the curve required less energy expenditure to prevent the ss accumulation therefore the simulation scenarios ii and iii with operating surface aerator after the curve rather than before the curve showed better ss distributions than other operational strategies in the fourth channel for a more straightforward comparison comparisons of simulated ss concentrations in different operational strategies at the down layer of three test locations line 1 at a9 line 2 at a2 and line 3 at a11 in fig 1 are shown in fig 10 it was noted that the simulation scenario ii was a relatively advantageous operational strategy with the lowest ss concentration at these three typical test locations among all the operational strategies therefore the simulation scenario ii reduced the ss concentrations in the second and fourth channels which was beneficial to eliminate sludge sedimentation 3 2 3 comparison of the water quality comparisons of cod tn nh4 n tp and average do concentrations in different operational strategies are shown in fig 11 the cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were the average values of the simulated results in effluent the average do concentration was based on the whole computed volume the effluent of wwtp should meet cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations of below 50 15 5 0 5 mg l 1 in china gb 18918 2002 respectively ministry of environmental protection of china 2002 therefore the simulation scenarios iii and iv failed to meet the discharge standard of effluent although the original strategy could get the best water quality in effluent the simulation scenarios i and ii with less operating surface aerators and impellers also met the standard furthermore the average do concentration of simulation scenario ii was the lowest one among these three operational strategies in which the effluent could meet the discharge standard therefore the simulation scenario ii showed the highest aeration efficiency among all the five operational strategies 3 2 4 comparison of the energy expenditure the comparisons of energy expenditure in the different operational strategies are summarized in table 1 among the three operational strategies in which the effluent met the discharge standard the original strategy was the highest 4060 260 kw h in the total energy expenditure per year and comparatively the simulation scenario ii was the lowest 3153 600 kw h the electricity cost was 0 09 dollar per kw h in nantaizi lake wwtp under the operational strategy of the simulation scenario ii in the wwtp 906 660 kw h or 22 3 of energy expenditure was reduced per year along with the saving of 78 92 thousand dollars per year for single ditch compared with the original strategy furthermore the simulation scenario ii also facilitated the extension of dredging cycle thus reducing unnecessary dredging costs therefore the simulation scenario ii was the proposed operational strategy that balanced the energy expenditure and quality of effluent 3 3 validation of the operational strategy of simulation scenario ii according to the above simulation results the operational strategy of simulation scenario ii was applied in nantaizi lake wwtp the distributions of flow velocities ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations of simulation scenario ii are shown in figs s11 s13 the simulated and measured flow velocities ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were compared figs s14 s18 with the normalized standard errors of less than 4 34 0 23 0 57 5 32 3 32 3 20 and 5 09 respectively the results indicated that the agreement of the simulated and measured results under the simulation scenario ii was acceptable furthermore the comparisons of ss concentrations of the original strategy and the simulation scenario ii at three lines of ss test are shown in fig s19 the ss concentrations at the areas near surface aerators a2 a9 and a11 obviously decreased comparing with the original strategy it further indicated that the simulation scenario ii was beneficial for prevention of ss sedimentation comparing with the original strategy in summary beyond the limitations of the cfd model integrated with asm1 the cfd model integrated with asm2 in this study was capable to simulate the whole biochemical reactions particularly for the biological phosphorus removal process different from previous studies the results of this study further provide implications on the removal of total phosphorus in the wwtps by the cfd integrated with asm2 hydrodynamic biokinetic model which helps to meet the stringent effluent standard requirements for phosphorus discharge worldwide 4 conclusions this study investigated simulation of a full scale od with surface aerators and submerged impellers by cfd model integrated with asm2 the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the cfd model integrated with asm2 was successfully developed and applied in a full scale od by species transport model and oxygen injection inlet the model provided heterogeneous information on hydrodynamics and biokinetics of od especially with respect to the simulation of total phosphorus removal by the integrated cfd asm2 model for the first time the simulation of flow velocities ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were statistically significant with the normalized standard deviation errors of less than 5 56 0 28 0 74 7 39 3 17 5 27 and 7 40 under the original strategy respectively 2 based on the developed cfd asm2 integration model the simulation scenarios i iv with 8 7 6 and 5 sets of non adjacent operating surface aerators and 10 10 11 and 14 sets of operating impellers were simulated and compared with the original strategy which had 9 sets of operating surface aerators and 13 sets of operating impellers the simulation scenario ii with 7 sets of non adjacent operating surface aerators and 10 sets of operating impellers was proved to be an optimized operational strategy that met both the requirements of the standard gb 18918 2002 and low energy expenditure with the operational strategy of the simulation scenario ii in the wwtp 906 660 kw h or 22 3 of energy expenditure was reduced per year along with the saving of 78 92 thousand dollars per year for single ditch compared with the original strategy the simulation scenario ii was also validated in full scale successfully 3 compared with the original strategy the simulation scenario ii effectively reduced the ss concentrations in the second and fourth channels the simulation scenario ii decreased the possibility of ss sedimentation and further reduced dredging costs 4 the developed cfd asm2 integration model is a useful numerical tool for the optimization of operational strategies of ods and to save energy expenditure and operational costs implications can

17179,oxidation ditches ods are often used for wastewater treatment however limitations of ods like high energy expenditure and increased sludge sedimentation hinder its wide application in this study the computational fluid dynamics cfd model integrated with activated sludge model no 2 asm2 was proposed and applied in a full scale od the integrated model provided heterogeneous information on the characteristics of hydrodynamics and biokinetics of od especially with respect to the simulation of total phosphorus removal by cfd asm2 integration model for the first time the simulated values of flow velocities suspended solids ss dissolved oxygen chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were well validated with the measured results with the standard deviation errors of less than 5 56 0 28 0 74 7 39 3 17 5 27 and 7 40 respectively based on the integrated model four different operational strategies were simulated the proposed operational strategy of operating 7 surface aerators and 10 submerged impellers not only met the standard discharge requirements gb 18918 2002 but also consumed less energy by 22 3 compared with the original strategy of operating 9 surface aerators and 13 submerged impellers meanwhile this proposed operational strategy also reduced the ss concentrations in the second and fourth channels which was beneficial to elimination of sludge sedimentation moreover the proposed operational strategy was successfully applied and validated in full scale od the foregoing results collectively suggest that the

often used for wastewater treatment because of the high tolerance to shock loading and hydraulic fluctuations and small sludge production guo et al 2013a jin et al 2015 luo et al 2020 however ods are also susceptible to limitations like high energy consumption and increased sludge sedimentation at the bottom of ditch due to the improper design and management liu et al 2013 tao and chengwen 2012 particularly caused by its complex ditch structure and the biochemical reactions thereinto littleton et al 2007b mathematical modelling offers an effective tool to investigate the hydrodynamics related with physical chemical and biological processes in ods guo et al 2013a liu et al 2014 xu et al 2018 in modelling of wastewater treatment plants wwtps a simplified tool of tanks in series tis model was developed by levenspiel 1962 which was classified as systematic modelling approach however the tis approach easily leads to inaccurate predictions since the systematic modelling has its limitation because of its incapability to take heterogeneities of flow behavior xie et al 2011 therefore the wide application of computational fluid dynamics cfd in simulating hydrodynamics in wastewater processes like ods have been reported due to its high prediction accuracy and relatively low expense lei and ni 2014 xu et al 2020 cfd can efficiently simulate fluid dynamics and mass transference in od model littleton et al 2007a yang et al 2011 moreover by means of the integration of activated sludge model asm into cfd models the analyses of both hydrodynamics and biokinetics were possible for a more comprehensive understanding of wastewater treatment process in ods like the influence of air diffuser layout and aeration regime on wastewater treatment fayolle et al 2007 sánchez et al 2018 however a complete cfd simulation of hydrodynamics in ods combined with biokinetic reactions is difficult mainly due to the complex models applied requirements for major random access memory and long time computation karpinska et al 2015 climent et al 2018 successfully combined cfd with asm no 1 asm1 to simulate nitrification and denitrification processes and residence time distribution in the anoxic tank lei and ni 2014 used a three phase cfd model combined with asm1 to investigate organic carbon degradation and nitrogen transformation processes in od currently phosphorus removal is the most important part for wwtps and the phosphorus discharge standards are becoming strict worldwide arnaldos and pagilla 2010 remy et al 2014 however all the foregoing mentioned models like the combination of cfd and asm1 failed to simulate the biological phosphorus removal process activated sludge model no 2 asm2 is an extension of the asm1 in terms of biological phosphorus removal however it remains unclear about the simulation of hydrodynamics biokinetics and variations of total phosphorus in od using the integrated cfd asm2 model meanwhile the energy consumption of the aeration in wwtps accounts for more than 60 of the total energy expenditure gude 2015 for od operation surface aerators and submerged impellers consume most of energy expenditure of the whole wwtps therefore the optimization of models related to od operational strategies with lower energy expenditure is always an inherent driving force for modelling in wwtps xie et al 2011 qiu et al 2018 climent et al 2019 more energy consumption is needed to meet the lower phosphorus discharge limit in the effluent of wwtps currently few integrated cfd asm2 models have been proposed to optimize the operational strategy in a full scale od i e treatment capacity of 50 000 m3 per day in terms of both energy expenditure and all the discharge characteristics of effluent including suspended solids ss dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and particularly total phosphorus tp the aim of this study is to develop an integrated cfd asm2 model to simulate both hydrodynamics and biokinetics for wastewater treatment processes in a full scale od the cfd asm2 model was testified with experimental results of flow velocity ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations relying on the developed model the simulation results of the original strategy and four proposed different simulation scenarios after modification in a full scale od were comparatively analyzed the suitable operational strategy which both meets the standards for effluent discharge gb 18 918 2002 and achieves economic benefits was proposed and the simulation results were validated in a full scale operation details can be found in the schematic diagram of this study fig s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the full scale od the full scale carrousel 2000 od of 50 000 m3 wastewater treatment capacity per day was studied in wuhan china namely the nantaizi lake wwtp fig s2 the total area is 156 90 m 41 00 m and the height of the od is 5 30 m a total working volume of the od is 31 620 m3 a schematic showing the od and test locations is presented in fig 1 the full scale carrousel 2000 od is a four channel circular ditch water depth 4 50 m straight portion 126 40 m in length and 10 00 m in width for each channel equipped with rotating disc surface aerators 13 sets and paddle type submerged impellers 14 sets the radii of inner and outer semi circle are 10 20 m and 20 50 m respectively the internal wall is 0 10 m in thickness all the surface aerators of a1 to a13 are located in the aerobic zone each surface aerator is equipped with 33 groups of rotation discs along the rotating shaft with a size of 10 0 m in length and 1 50 m in diameter the submerged depth of all the rotation discs is 0 60 m the schematic diagram of the vertical section of od and the vertical position of the surface aerator in the od are presented in fig s3 and s4 respectively the rotational speed and the oxygen injection rate of each surface aerator are 6 rad s 1 and 75 kg oxygen per hour respectively moreover the five submerged impellers of b1 to b5 are in the anoxic zone while b6 to b14 are in the aerobic zone fig 1 the diameter of each submerged impeller is 2 50 m 2 2 numerical description 2 2 1 geometry and grid generation the three dimensional 3d model of the full scale od in nantaizi lake wwtp is established by the gambit 2 4 6 ansys inc pennsylvania usa as shown in fig s5 the meshes of tetrahedrons are composed by gambit 2 4 6 the tetrahedral cells of 658 967 1186 220 and 2328 622 are investigated and compared the simulated velocities on a transversal line for three different grid sizes in the od are shown in fig s6 at last the grid with 1186 220 cells is chosen for subsequent section by the trade off between precision and computational requirements all simulations were calculated on the dell precision t5820 equipped with an intel xeon 3 7 ghz processor and 32 gb ram for about 3 h of each run 2 2 2 governing equations for the prediction of the flow field ss concentration and water qualities a 3d cfd model is established thereof a commercial cfd code fluent 13 0 ansys inc pennsylvania usa was used for development of cfd model due to the complicated interactions between gas phase liquid phase and solid phase the three phase flow simulation would be difficult to be converged the workload of computational requirement would be huge when the cfd model is integrated with biochemical model due to the complexity of asm2 in order to reduce the workload of computation the two stage method including the resolution of the fluid dynamic and the biochemical reaction equations was proposed climent et al 2018 sánchez et al 2018 therefore the two phase water and ss user defined solid phase flow simulation of flow field and ss concentration distributions were carried out at the first stage according to the simulation results of the distributions of flow field and ss concentration the mass fraction of each component in asm2 at the inlet and the oxygen gas injection rate at the operating surface aerators region were set at the second stage the details of governing equations for the two phase cfd model can be found in text s1 in the supporting information the species transport model is applied for simulation of biochemical reactions lei and ni 2014 in order to get a comprehensive simulation of biochemical reactions in a full scale od the asm2 which contained carbon oxidation nitrification denitrification and biological phosphorus removal processes was used in this integrated model the mass fraction of each component in asm2 is calculated for each species in the integrated model the conservation equation for species is expressed in eq 1 1 t ρ y i ρ ν y i j i s i where ρ kg m 3 denotes the mean density for each component y i wt denotes the mass fraction for each component i j i kg m 3 s 1 denotes the diffusion flux for each component i s i kg m 3 s 1 denotes the rate of creation by addition from the user defined sources the first term in eq 1 is the unsteady term which is zero due to the steady state simulations the components and corresponding processes in asm2 are added as user defined sources s i of species transport model by user defined function udf in fluent the total number of species is 19 compared with 13 in asm1 model henze et al 2000 the 19 process rate equations in asm2 are listed in table s1 the species concentrations are calculated by the combination of process rate equations and stoichiometric coefficients matrix zhao et al 1999 the diffusion flux j i is calculated as eq 2 2 j i ρ d i m μ t s c t y i where d i m m2 s 1 denotes the mass diffusion coefficient for species i in the mixture μ t kg m 1 s 1 is the turbulent viscosity s c t denotes the turbulent schmidt number 2 2 3 boundary conditions and solver settings for boundary conditions of the full scale od simulation the moving wall model and fan model are used as simulations of surface aerator and submerged impeller respectively xie et al 2014 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2011 the details of simulations of surface aerator and submerged impeller can be found in text s2 in the supporting information the rotational speed of rotation discs is set as the same as operating surface aerators the roughness height of the moving wall is 0 02 m along with the roughness constant of 1 yang et al 2010 the dissolved oxygen concentrations were simulated as species and input into the two phase model for calculation the mass flow inlet is introduced for the operating surface aerator and its value is set to the oxygen injection rate velocity inlet 0 2 m s 1 and pressure outlet atmospheric pressure are applied for the od the mass fraction of each component in asm2 is set at the inlet of the od and its value is based on the measurement results of ss cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations in the influent since the wastewater of the nantaizi lake wwtp was mainly municipal wastewater and the water temperature during the field test was also in acceptable range of about 20 c therefore the values for the kinetic parameters and the stoichiometric coefficients used in the typical asm2 model were adopted herein in brief the default parameters of a typical asm2 model provided by henze et al 2000 were used as the kinetic parameters as listed in table s2 supporting information the major processes included hydrolysis phosphorus and nitrogen removal and further precipitation zhao et al 1999 henze et al 2000 the microorganisms like heterotrophic organisms phosphorus accumulating organisms and nitrifiers were involved in process dynamics table s2 while the stoichiometric coefficients together with their definitions are shown in table s3 and all stoichiometric coefficients were set at default from literature references given climent et al 2018 henze et al 2000 and none of them were newly calibrated moreover the good agreement between the simulated and measured results also indicated that the kinetic parameters and the stoichiometric coefficients used in the integrated model were acceptable the typical values for the kinetic parameters table s2 and the stoichiometric coefficients table s3 of asm2 were used in this model the water and ss user defined solid phase are chosen for the simulation of two phase flow based on the preliminary study the density of the solid phase is assumed to be 1 03 103 kg m 3 xie et al 2014 the slip velocity of takács equation is used to simulate the settling behavior of ss by user defined function takács et al 1991 xu et al 2020 therefore the slip velocity is expressed as eq 3 3 v s 0 004 e 0 43 x e 1 89 x where vs m s 1 denotes the settling velocity of ss x mg l 1 denotes the concentration of ss for the solving process the workload of computational requirement would be huge when the cfd model is integrated with biochemical model due to the complexity of asm2 the two stage method including the resolution of the fluid dynamic and the biochemical reaction equations was proposed by some researchers to reduce the workload of computation climent et al 2018 sánchez et al 2018 therefore the two phase flow simulation of flow field and ss concentration distributions were carried out at the first stage according to the simulation results of the distributions of flow field and ss concentration the mass fraction of each component in asm2 at the inlet and the oxygen injection rate at the operating surface aerators region were set at the second stage then all 19 reaction processes of the asm2 table s1 were imported for the resolution of the species transport model by udf to calculate the biochemical reactions in the integrated cfd asm2 model 2 2 4 different operational strategies the operational strategies for the surface aerators 13 sets and the submerged impellers 14 sets of the full scale od are determined by many parameters such as facilities integrity do concentrations and effluent quality at the outlet in brief as shown in fig 2 a the original strategy of wwtp was characterized with surface aerators with a number of 9 sets and submerged impellers with a number of 13 sets in order to get an optimized operational strategy which can both meet the standards for effluent discharge gb 18918 2002 and reduce energy expenditure four operational strategies were simulated by the integrated cfd asm2 model fig 2b e these four simulation scenarios i iv showed less surface aerators or submerged impellers than the original strategy since the full scale od showed a surplus amount in the design of the aeration rate the adjacent surface aerators were discontinuously operated in order to optimize the operational strategies the arrangement of the operating submerged impellers was set correspondingly according to the operation of the surface aerators and the overall flow field needed to be considered when the flow velocity in the ditch was not lower than the limit of 0 30 m s 1 liu et al 2014 the occurrence of sludge sedimentation can be eliminated meanwhile reduction of energy expenditure was also considered thus the optimized operational strategy to both reduce energy expenditure and simultaneously ensure the quality of effluent was expected to be achieved therefore the simulation scenarios i iv with 8 7 6 and 5 sets of operating non adjacent surface aerators and 10 10 11 and 14 sets of operating submerged impellers were designed fig 2b e all of the 14 sets of submerged impellers were operated for simulation scenario iv 2 3 experimental analyses 2 3 1 the measurement of flow velocity and dissolved oxygen for the validation of the integrated model six typical test locations referred to as tl 1 to 6 and four test lines one for do test three for ss test were set due to real operating conditions and the restrictions of measurement equipment fig 1 specifically the tl 1 is in the anoxic zone and the tl 2 to 6 are in the aerobic zone the schematic locations of sampling points for every test location are shown in fig s7 the layout of the typical test locations was determined by comprehensively considering the operating conditions of surface aerators submerged impellers and the site available for measurement the details of flow velocity and do measurements are shown in text s3 in the supporting information 2 3 2 water samples measurement samples for the measurements of ss cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were withdrawn with a plexiglass water sampler volume of 2 5 l and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c with all measurements finished within two days the details of ss cod tn nh4 n and tp measurements are shown in text s4 in the supporting information the water temperature during the field test is about 20 c 2 4 statistical analysis the comparisons of the simulated results and the measured data were analyzed by the normalized standard error as shown in eq 4 lei and ni 2014 4 nse 1 n n 1 i 1 n x si x mi 2 1 n i 1 n x mi where nse denotes the normalized standard error n denotes the number of measured data xsi denotes the simulated result of the i th parameter xmi denotes the measured data of the i th parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation and validation of the original strategy a total of 9 surface aerators and 13 submerged impellers of the original strategy were operated as shown in fig 2a the hydrodynamics and biochemical reactions of the original strategy were simulated by the integrated cfd asm2 model 3 1 1 simulation of hydrodynamics the hydrodynamic characteristics were important for od in terms of the analysis of sludge sedimentation wei et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the distributions of flow velocities and ss concentrations of the original strategy are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the overall flow velocities were relatively higher due to the increased numbers of surface aerators and submerged impellers however the flow velocity distribution in the cross section of the channel was extremely uneven due to the excessive flow velocity in some curved areas in fig 3 for instance the flow velocity was only about 0 2 m s 1 at the side closer to the internal wall while the flow velocity was more than 0 8 m s 1 at the side farther from the internal wall in the area near the test locations of tl 3 fig s8 the ss sedimentation tended to occur in areas where the flow velocity was low particularly on the side where the flow velocity was not uniform in the cross section of channel xu et al 2018 the above mentioned results were further confirmed by results shown in fig 4 it indicated that ss concentration was lower in areas with higher flow velocity while the ss concentration was higher in areas with lower flow velocity the ss concentration was inversely related to the flow velocity xie et al 2014 the ss sedimentation was prone to occur in areas with large differences in flow velocity such as the areas near surface aerators of a2 a9 and a11 fig 4c therefore the test locations of ss concentration were particularly set in these three areas for the comparisons of the original strategy and simulation scenarios i iv 3 1 2 simulation of biochemical reactions the distributions of do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations of the original strategy are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a c it was noted that the do concentrations were higher in areas where the surface aerator operated in the aerobic zone than those of other areas as the distance from the surface aerators increased the do concentration decreased there were do concentration gradients among the operating surface aerators the average do concentrations in the top middle and down layers were 2 57 2 19 and 1 94 mg l 1 respectively the overall do concentration also decreased with the decrease of the distance above the bottom of the ditch from fig 5a to c the simulated overall do concentration distribution was similar to those in other literatures which focused on the ods with surface aerators guo et al 2013b lei and ni 2014 because the number of surface aerators operating in the original strategy was relatively high hence do concentration of the original strategy exceeded 2 mg l 1 in most of the aerobic zones on the contrary the do concentration in the anoxic zone was close to zero due to the absence of operating aeration facility the good separation between the anoxic zone and the aerobic zone might be beneficial for the nitrification and denitrification processes zhou et al 2015 as shown in fig 5d f the distribution of cod concentration showed an opposite trend to that of do concentration it was noted that there was a large difference in cod distribution between the aerobic zone and the anoxic zone moreover the cod concentration increased as the height above the bottom of the ditch decreased from fig 5d to f the average cod concentrations in the top middle and down layers were 58 2 61 1 and 70 5 mg l 1 respectively in areas with high do concentrations the microbial activities may be enhanced to degrade cod thus resulting in decreased concentrations meanwhile the influent and effluent of the od were at the lower and the upper layer positions respectively therefore the cod concentration of the lower layer was higher than that of the upper layer moreover the cod concentration in the anoxic zone was about 200 mg l 1 which was lower than the influent 271 mg l 1 it is deduced that some organic matter can be removed under anaerobic conditions comeau et al 1986 somiya et al 1988 as shown in fig 5g i the tn concentration of the influent was about 27 mg l 1 moreover the overall tn concentration quickly decreased to about 17 mg l 1 in the anoxic zone since the do concentration in this zone was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 the organic matters could be degraded by the denitrifying bacteria in wastewater for denitrification to convert nitrate nitrite to nitrogen gas in this zone in the aerobic zone simultaneous nitrification and denitrification might occur in some areas due to the do concentration gradients guo et al 2013b zhou et al 2015 meanwhile the generated nitrate by nitrification in the aerobic zone was returned to the anoxic zone by the internal flow recycle figs 5j l show that the nh4 n concentration in the aerobic zone was significantly lower than that in the anoxic zone the good nitrification was performed under aerobic conditions because of high do concentration similar to the cod distribution the nh4 n concentration increased as the height above the bottom of the ditch decreased from fig 5j to l the average nh4 n concentrations in the top middle and down layers were 4 5 4 7 and 4 8 mg l 1 respectively due to the surface aerators a lower nh4 n concentration area was formed near the outlet with the aid of cfd asm2 the variations of tp concentrations were revealed in od as shown in fig 5m o the tp concentration in the anoxic zone was higher and the tp concentration in the aerobic zone was significantly lower the tp concentration was influenced by the inlet and was not removed in the anoxic zone under aerobic conditions polyphosphate accumulating organisms are able to accumulate excessive quantities of phosphorus into cells to obtain energy as is known the polyphosphate accumulating organisms accumulate carbon sources by using energy generated from hydrolysis of polyphosphate shen et al 2017 thereby the variations of tp concentration in the aerobic zone were related with the changes of do concentration in the area where the surface aerators were operating the tp concentrations were lower fig 5m some researchers have also reported that the phosphorus accumulation by polyphosphate accumulating organisms was significant related to the do concentration higher do concentration enhanced the activities of polyphosphate accumulating organisms and the related phosphorus accumulation process coma et al 2012 shen et al 2017 since the environmental requirement of the phosphorus discharge is becoming more and more strict the cfd integrated with asm2 model proposed in this study is meaningful to simulate the variations of total phosphorus concentrations in wwtps in summary of the simulation results of the original strategy the overall do concentration in the aerobic zone was also high thus resulting in higher energy expenditure meanwhile due to the continuous operation of the adjacent surface aerators and submerged impellers ss concentrations in some areas were relatively higher thus causing the possible ss sedimentation due to the uneven distribution of the flow field therefore it is necessary to optimize the original strategy 3 1 3 validation of the integrated cfd asm2 model the simulation results of flow velocities and the corresponding measured data under the original strategy were compared and validated fig 6 according to eq 4 the normalized standard error of flow velocities was less than 5 56 which fulfilled the requirement for a good agreement with the standard error of less than 10 littleton et al 2007a figure s9 compares the ss concentrations both from simulation and measurement for the original strategy at the different test locations in the different sections the simulated results of ss concentration were consistent with the standard error less than 0 28 it was noted that the concentrations of ss at the down layer was slightly higher than those at the top layer at the same test locations for instance the measured ss concentrations of top and down layers were 4562 7 and 4844 0 mg l at tl 2 respectively fig 7 compares the dissolved oxygen concentrations both from simulation and measurement for the original strategy at five test locations do concentration in the top middle and down layers of most areas decreased sequentially due to the oxygen input by the surface aerator fig 7 meanwhile the do concentration in the aerobic area was higher because of the presence of more surface aerators fig 8 compares the dissolved oxygen concentrations both from simulation and measurement along the line of dissolved oxygen test as the distance from surface aerators increased the do concentration gradually decreased the simulation for do results was statistically significant with the normalized standard error less than 0 74 the error results of do simulation in this study were smaller than those reported in other previous studies littleton et al 2007a lei and ni 2014 comparisons of the simulated and measured cod tn nh4 n and tp of the original strategy at eight test locations are shown in fig s10 the cod tn nh4 n and tp of influent were measured as 271 06 32 51 17 67 and 2 72 mg l 1 respectively these measured data were used as input parameters in the integrated cfd asm2 model as such the cod tn nh4 n and tp distributions were obtained through the calculation of the integrated model as a result the integrated model had good simulation accurancy for cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations with the normalized standard errors of less than 7 39 3 17 5 27 and 7 40 respectively fig s10 3 2 comparisons between the original strategy and simulation scenarios of four different operational strategies in full scale operation 3 2 1 comparison of the do distribution based on the developed and validated cfd asm2 integration model four simulation scenarios of different operational strategies were predicted in the full scale od from the analyses of simulation results for the original strategy the do distribution was the determining factor for the simulation result which significantly affected the distributions of cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations the comparisons of contour profiles of do concentrations under different operational strategies at the top layer are shown in fig 9 a e the overall do concentration in the aerobic zone showed a downward trend as the number of operating surface aerators decreased from fig 9a to e the do distributions were more uniform in simulation scenarios i and ii fig 9b and c than others due to the uniform distribution of operating surface aerators however the do concentrations were low below 0 5 mg l 1 in the areas near the guiding wall or curve bend in simulation scenarios iii and iv fig 9d and e due to the limited number of operating surface aerators and oxygen was not provided sufficiently thus failing to achieve a do concentration of less than 2 mg l 1 in the aerobic zone for simulation scenarios iii and iv the overall aeration capacity might be not enough to meet the needs of aerobic treatment arnaldos et al 2015 3 2 2 comparison of the ss distribution the comparisons of contour profiles of ss concentrations in the down layer under different operational strategies are shown in fig 9f j in the anoxic zone the original strategy and the simulation scenario iv were both equipped with five operating impellers while the other three operational strategies were carried out without the impeller b1 the results showed that there was no much difference in the ss distributions in the anoxic zone among the five operational strategies the impeller b1 was near to the inlet of the od so the driving force of impeller b1 was affected by the flow momentum of the inlet xie et al 2014 as such the operational status of the impeller b1 showed indiscernible effects on the ss concentration distribution in the anoxic zone at the first channel of aerobic zone the ss concentration was higher due to insufficient driving force for the simulation scenario iv which was the only one without operating surface aerators in this channel at the second channel of aerobic zone the original strategy had two adjacent operating surface aerators before the curve which caused uneven flow field by a strong driving force in addition only one surface aerator was operated in the simulation scenarios iii and iv which presented a weak driving force for the distribution of flow field therefore the simulation scenarios i and ii with two non adjacent operating surface aerators showed lower ss concentrations than the other three operational strategies at the second channel at the fourth channel the ss concentration near the surface aerator a2 were obviously decreased by turning on a2 the reason for this result may be due to the operation of surface aerator a2 which was at the downstream position of curve could effectively supplement the kinetic energy loss of the fluid through the curve by collision meanwhile the original strategy and the simulation scenario i with both the two operating surface aerators and one operating impeller before curve at the fourth channel required too much energy expenditure to eliminate the uneven flow field the simulation scenario iv without operating surface aerators before and after the curve required less energy expenditure to prevent the ss accumulation therefore the simulation scenarios ii and iii with operating surface aerator after the curve rather than before the curve showed better ss distributions than other operational strategies in the fourth channel for a more straightforward comparison comparisons of simulated ss concentrations in different operational strategies at the down layer of three test locations line 1 at a9 line 2 at a2 and line 3 at a11 in fig 1 are shown in fig 10 it was noted that the simulation scenario ii was a relatively advantageous operational strategy with the lowest ss concentration at these three typical test locations among all the operational strategies therefore the simulation scenario ii reduced the ss concentrations in the second and fourth channels which was beneficial to eliminate sludge sedimentation 3 2 3 comparison of the water quality comparisons of cod tn nh4 n tp and average do concentrations in different operational strategies are shown in fig 11 the cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were the average values of the simulated results in effluent the average do concentration was based on the whole computed volume the effluent of wwtp should meet cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations of below 50 15 5 0 5 mg l 1 in china gb 18918 2002 respectively ministry of environmental protection of china 2002 therefore the simulation scenarios iii and iv failed to meet the discharge standard of effluent although the original strategy could get the best water quality in effluent the simulation scenarios i and ii with less operating surface aerators and impellers also met the standard furthermore the average do concentration of simulation scenario ii was the lowest one among these three operational strategies in which the effluent could meet the discharge standard therefore the simulation scenario ii showed the highest aeration efficiency among all the five operational strategies 3 2 4 comparison of the energy expenditure the comparisons of energy expenditure in the different operational strategies are summarized in table 1 among the three operational strategies in which the effluent met the discharge standard the original strategy was the highest 4060 260 kw h in the total energy expenditure per year and comparatively the simulation scenario ii was the lowest 3153 600 kw h the electricity cost was 0 09 dollar per kw h in nantaizi lake wwtp under the operational strategy of the simulation scenario ii in the wwtp 906 660 kw h or 22 3 of energy expenditure was reduced per year along with the saving of 78 92 thousand dollars per year for single ditch compared with the original strategy furthermore the simulation scenario ii also facilitated the extension of dredging cycle thus reducing unnecessary dredging costs therefore the simulation scenario ii was the proposed operational strategy that balanced the energy expenditure and quality of effluent 3 3 validation of the operational strategy of simulation scenario ii according to the above simulation results the operational strategy of simulation scenario ii was applied in nantaizi lake wwtp the distributions of flow velocities ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations of simulation scenario ii are shown in figs s11 s13 the simulated and measured flow velocities ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were compared figs s14 s18 with the normalized standard errors of less than 4 34 0 23 0 57 5 32 3 32 3 20 and 5 09 respectively the results indicated that the agreement of the simulated and measured results under the simulation scenario ii was acceptable furthermore the comparisons of ss concentrations of the original strategy and the simulation scenario ii at three lines of ss test are shown in fig s19 the ss concentrations at the areas near surface aerators a2 a9 and a11 obviously decreased comparing with the original strategy it further indicated that the simulation scenario ii was beneficial for prevention of ss sedimentation comparing with the original strategy in summary beyond the limitations of the cfd model integrated with asm1 the cfd model integrated with asm2 in this study was capable to simulate the whole biochemical reactions particularly for the biological phosphorus removal process different from previous studies the results of this study further provide implications on the removal of total phosphorus in the wwtps by the cfd integrated with asm2 hydrodynamic biokinetic model which helps to meet the stringent effluent standard requirements for phosphorus discharge worldwide 4 conclusions this study investigated simulation of a full scale od with surface aerators and submerged impellers by cfd model integrated with asm2 the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the cfd model integrated with asm2 was successfully developed and applied in a full scale od by species transport model and oxygen injection inlet the model provided heterogeneous information on hydrodynamics and biokinetics of od especially with respect to the simulation of total phosphorus removal by the integrated cfd asm2 model for the first time the simulation of flow velocities ss do cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations were statistically significant with the normalized standard deviation errors of less than 5 56 0 28 0 74 7 39 3 17 5 27 and 7 40 under the original strategy respectively 2 based on the developed cfd asm2 integration model the simulation scenarios i iv with 8 7 6 and 5 sets of non adjacent operating surface aerators and 10 10 11 and 14 sets of operating impellers were simulated and compared with the original strategy which had 9 sets of operating surface aerators and 13 sets of operating impellers the simulation scenario ii with 7 sets of non adjacent operating surface aerators and 10 sets of operating impellers was proved to be an optimized operational strategy that met both the requirements of the standard gb 18918 2002 and low energy expenditure with the operational strategy of the simulation scenario ii in the wwtp 906 660 kw h or 22 3 of energy expenditure was reduced per year along with the saving of 78 92 thousand dollars per year for single ditch compared with the original strategy the simulation scenario ii was also validated in full scale successfully 3 compared with the original strategy the simulation scenario ii effectively reduced the ss concentrations in the second and fourth channels the simulation scenario ii decreased the possibility of ss sedimentation and further reduced dredging costs 4 the developed cfd asm2 integration model is a useful numerical tool for the optimization of operational strategies of ods and to save energy expenditure and operational costs implications can
