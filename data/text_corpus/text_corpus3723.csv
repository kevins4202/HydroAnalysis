18615,drinking water discoloration is one of the most common customer complaints the accumulation of residual manganese mn in drinking water distribution systems dwds accounts for part of the discolored water that reaches household taps field studies were conducted at seven full scale dwds to investigate the deposition and release behaviors of mn in different forms and at different concentrations in finished water the results show that particulate mn tended to accumulate in dwds even at concentrations as low as 10 μg l the oxidation of soluble mn ii ions in dwds was highly affected by water chemistries as well as water age 10 μg l of soluble mn could still transform into particulate mn under suitable conditions when total mn concentration in finished water was below 5 μg l erosion of mn deposits occurred in dwds with a mn deposit inventory soluble mn release was observed when chlorine or chlorine dioxide concentration was lower than 0 1 mg l and the release was speculated to be a result of microbial reductive dissolution of mn oxides ensuring the total mn concentration is below 10 μg l and decreasing the particulate mn concentration to 5 μg l in finished water are both recommended to minimize mn accumulation risk in dwds enhanced oxidation and filtration for mn removal during water treatment processes are proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords

systems dwds is a common issue regardless of the pipe materials liu et al 2014 2017 mussared et al 2018 poças et al 2013 previous studies from different regions revealed that manganese mn is one of the major elements in loose deposits other elements include aluminum iron and silica peng and korshin 2011 rubulis et al 2008 sly et al 1990b especially the deposits formed in nonmetallic pipes that have been increasingly installed worldwide to overcome corrosion problems cerrato et al 2006 li et al 2018 murdoch and smith 1999 2000 mn release into bulk water can cause discoloration problems which is responsible for a large proportion of customer complaints regarding drinking water quality ginige et al 2011 husband and boxall 2011 schlenker et al 2008 vreeburg and boxall 2007 in addition many kinds of trace metals trace anionic compounds e g arsenate and chromate and radionuclides have been found to accompany mn in loose deposits or bulk water and consequently pose toxicological risks to public health friedman 2009 gerke et al 2016 lytle et al 2014 schock et al 2008 2014 mn accumulated in dwds is mainly from source water that contains various concentrations of mn without sufficient removal residual mn in finished water can undergo further transformation and mobilization processes in dwds prasad and danso amoako 2014 the formation of particulate mn oxides in bulk water can very easily lead to visually detectable color sain et al 2014 and the accumulation of mn deposits on pipe surfaces soluble mn ii species entering distribution systems can also be oxidized to form particulate mn oxides by either chlorine or chlorine dioxide that are used for disinfection processes sly et al 1989 microbial oxidation of mn ii also occurs in dwds especially in areas with insufficient disinfectant residual ginige et al 2011 murdoch and smith 1999 sly and arunpairojana 1987 sly et al 1988 1990a the deposition of particulate matter from bulk water to form loose deposits is considerably affected by flow velocity poças 2014 poças et al 2013 a flow velocity that is neither too high nor too low is thought to be necessary for the buildup of mn deposits on pipe surfaces in addition to the oxidation of mn ii reductive dissolution of mn oxides occurs under anoxic conditions which is often observed in natural water bodies or sediments myers and nealson 1988 nealson et al 2002 in real chlorinated distribution systems mn related bacteria have been isolated and can oxidize mn ii reduce mn oxides or both depending on the specific conditions cerrato et al 2006 however the release of soluble mn resulting from microbial reduction of mn oxides has not been verified in real dwds to control mn deposition in dwds there can be two practical strategies controlling the residual mn concentration in finished water and minimizing the transformation of soluble mn ii species into particulate mn oxides in dwds khoe and waite 1989 sly et al 1990b although drinking water standards for mn vary among different countries a guideline level of 50 μg l or 100 μg l is typically adopted worldwide sain and dietrich 2014 however neither of these two values is sufficient for eliminating mn discoloration problems in dwds dietrich and burlingame 2015 dietrich and burlingame 2015 yellow water has been observed even when the concentration of mn entering the distribution system was 20 μg l sly et al 1989 1990b waite et al 1989 it is estimated that approximately 40 of the public water supplies in the us contain more than 50 μg l mn robinson et al 1992 in china no exact data are available regarding the nationwide mn concentrations in finished water but according to reports from water utilities and yellow water publications chen et al 2018 xu et al 2017 it can be reasonably concluded that mn related discoloration is fairly common under the current regulation standard 100 μg l however the effects of mn concentration and species soluble or particulate on its behavior i e oxidation reduction deposition and release under different dwds conditions are not clear the present work provides data from field monitoring studies with the aims of 1 revealing the behaviors of both soluble and particulate mn under different water quality conditions and 2 providing evidence for practical measures to minimize mn deposition in dwds 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites in this field study water samples were taken from seven full scale distribution systems in three different regions i e gy yx and sy in eastern china these systems were chosen because of the different mn concentrations and species in their finished water which allow different mn behaviors to be studied the relevant information about the study sites the service areas sas of each water treatment plant wtp and sample types are listed in table 1 among all the sampling areas the service areas with histories of water discoloration were regarded as research areas while the other areas were seen as control areas that were fed by finished water containing very low levels of mn typically 5 μg l for a long time as shown in table 1 relatively small amounts of water were supplied by the listed wtps because all wtps were in service for rural towns where the residents were dispersed and the water demand was relatively low it should be mentioned that each of the study distribution areas was fed by only one wtp allowing the tap water quality to be compared with that of the finished water in the areas studied cement mortar lined ductile iron pipes and high density polyethylene pipes hdpe were primarily used in the laying of distribution mains typically 400 1200 mm in diameter that carried water from wtps to service lines the pipe materials of the service lines and household plumbing systems mainly included polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride 2 2 water sampling and analysis all the water sampling sites in gy and sy were close to distribution mains refer to the map of sa st in supporting information si fig s1 as an example to reflect the water quality in the main pipes in yx the sampling sites were close to both the distribution mains refer to the sketch map in fig s2a and service lines refer to the sketch map in fig s2b distributed water was sampled from the household taps that were most commonly used by residents to avoid the collection of stagnant water inside a building the initial water flow after opening the faucet was discarded typically a sample was taken after allowing the water to flow for one to 2 min the water discharge time was not fixed because at each site the amount of stagnant water in the plumbing pipes varied and could not be accurately determined tap water turbidity and ph were measured in situ using a portable turbidimeter hach 2100q and a ph meter hach hq40d respectively residual chlorine or chlorine dioxide was detected by the dpd method using a hach pocket colorimeter ii a 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube was used to collect water for the total mn concentration analysis an additional water sample was filtered in the field through a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone membrane for the analysis of soluble mn because colloidal mn 0 22 μm in drinking water systems is not common and is usually only associated with ozonation kohl and medlar 2006 0 22 μm filtration as an operational standard procedure was the best choice to define the soluble metal fraction in the field studies and has been used in many published studies clark et al 2014 gregory 2005 lytle et al 2010 for some water samples a 1 0 μm membrane was also used to filter raw tap water to determine whether particulate mn determined by 0 22 μm filtration was greater than that by 1 0 μm in size then all the water samples were acidified in the laboratory by nitric acid to obtain solution ph 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry thermo icap q icp ms was used to analyze metal concentration for data quality control at least one of the blanks or standard sample of known concentration was measured every ten water samples particulate mn concentration was the calculated concentration difference between total mn and soluble mn 2 3 microbe sampling and analysis microbe sampling was performed in two distribution systems sa st and sa js in gy to investigate the possible microbial difference related to various mn concentrations in finished water the two areas were selected because sa st was continuously fed with water containing relatively high level of mn 20 70 μg l from wtp st while sa js received water from wtp js with very low mn residual 2 μg l table s1 suggesting that the microbial communities in their pipe wall biofilms could be different and thus suitable for the comparative study to collect microbial samples for molecular biological analysis flushing water was collected during water discharge from the distribution main outlets which are similar to urban fire hydrants then 2 l of water was filtered through a 0 20 μm polycarbonate gttp membrane millipore to collect materials for dna extraction using fastdna spin kits mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s instructions the bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified through a polymerase chain reaction with the detailed conditions and primers presented in the si sequencing 2 250 was performed on the illumina miseq platform majorbio co ltd shanghai china the generated sequences were then processed i e filtered clustered and taxonomically assigned and aligned using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 0 97 sequence similarity thresholds with usearch the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed by the rdp classifier against the silva ssu128 database using a confidence threshold of 70 to identify possible microbial activities associated with mn metabolism in dwds potential metabolic function profiles of the bacterial communities were predicted with picrust phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states http picrust github com version 1 1 3 using the rarefied otu data with the copy number of the marker genes in the microbial genomes removed langille et al 2013 functional genes were classified into clusters of orthologous groups cogs by picrust 2 4 pipe deposit collection pipe segments were exhumed from two distribution systems to provide direct evidence for mn deposition on the pipe surfaces of distribution mains in two planned exhuming projects they were harvested by cold sawing from a ductile iron pipe 800 mm in diameter in the service area of wtp zz and a ductile iron pipe 1000 mm in diameter in the service area of wtp jb after these segments were transported to the lab the surface deposits were gently scraped off with a spatula and collected for vacuum freeze drying prior to further analysis x ray fluorescence thermo arl advant xp was used for the elemental composition analysis 2 5 statistical analysis this study utilized some basic assumptions about the change in particulate or soluble mn concentrations in dwds 1 the finished water sampled at a wtp and the distributed water sampled from dwds were from the same package of water and they were comparable to each other more details related to hypothesis 1 were provided in the si 2 after the water entered dwds a decrease in the particulate mn concentration reflected deposition 3 an increase in the particulate mn concentration indicated a release from mn deposits or the formation of particulate mn through mn ii oxidation 4 a decrease in the soluble mn concentration suggested the oxidation of mn ii ions 5 an increase in the soluble mn concentration indicated reductive dissolution of mn oxides that had accumulated on the interior of pipes and 6 the change in the total mn concentration indicated the net accumulation or net release of mn in dwds a one sample t test was carried out using spss statistics version 22 to determine whether there was a significant difference between mn concentrations in finished water and tap water before the t test the normality of the data was tested and the results showed that the variables total mn soluble mn and particulate mn were approximately normally distributed significance 0 05 with no significant outliers which is required for a one sample t test to give a valid result 3 results and discussion 3 1 particulate mn deposition particulates from a wtp are an important external source of loose deposits in dwds vreeburg et al 2008 as shown in fig s3 in the finished water of wtp st there was often a relatively high concentration of particulate mn ranging from 6 to 59 μg l during the whole study period with an average concentration of 18 3 μg l and a proportion of 38 1 this high concentration could be attributed to the poor capacity of the filtration process in the wtp to retain mn particles as a result discolored finished water was observed several times even before it entered the distribution systems as shown in fig 1 a when the total mn concentration in the finished water of wtp st was 63 9 μg l a significant decrease in the total mn concentration was detected in tap water with an average reduction of 23 μg l p 0 000 indicating a significant net accumulation of mn in dwds furthermore we found that particulate mn mainly contributed to the decrease in the total mn in tap water after entering the distribution systems particulate mn with a concentration of 58 1 μ l in finished water experienced a nearly 50 decrease in dwds with an average reduction of 28 μg l p 0 000 as shown in fig 1b the total mn concentration in the finished water of wtp jb was less than 10 μg l and the particulate mn concentration was approximately 5 5 μg l in sa yx compared with the finished water the total mn concentration decreased by 3 9 μg l p 0 000 and the particulate mn concentration decreased by 2 2 μg l p 0 003 on average these results indicated that if the particulate form of mn accounted for the main proportion of mn mn deposition could still occur in dwds even when the total mn concentration was as low as approximately 10 μg l it should be noted that the sampling sites in sa yx were close to service lines with slow flow velocities and long hydraulic residence times which might be beneficial for particle deposition fig s4 shows a comparison of particulate mn in tap water in sa st with particle sizes 1 0 μm and 0 22 μm most of the particulate mn identified by 0 22 μm filtration was larger than 1 0 μm in diameter with only an average difference of 5 0 μg l because particles larger than 1 0 μm are thought to more easily settle gregory 2005 residual particulate mn in finished water could have a high potential to accumulate on pipe surfaces decreasing the load of mn particles in finished water as much as possible is necessary to minimize mn deposition 3 2 stable transport of soluble mn when the disinfectant concentration and ph were relatively low when mn in finished water is mainly in a soluble form then mn behavior in dwds can be affected by water chemistry parameters such as the ph and disinfectant concentration sampling was performed in sa st when the soluble mn fraction accounted for a large proportion 75 of mn in finished water as shown in fig 2 a the soluble mn concentration did not apparently decrease during a 22 km transport the results of the one sample t test table s2 confirmed that the difference between the soluble mn concentration in finished water and tap water p 0 05 was not significant indicating no significant transformation of soluble mn into particulate mn this observation was further confirmed by another sampling and the results are shown in fig 2b these results can be attributed to the low residual disinfectant concentration and low ph of the finished water from wtp st during the above two sampling periods the chlorine dioxide concentration in finished water was maintained at a very low level 0 1 mg l to avoid the occurrence of yellow water consequently the chlorine dioxide residual concentration was quite low in the tap water collected from sa st 0 07 mg l for figs 2a and 0 06 mg l for fig 2b on average at the same time the ph of the source water finished water and tap water was weakly acidic ph 6 6 6 8 which would retard mn ii oxidation by chlorine dioxide in dwds knocke et al 1991 3 3 transformation of soluble mn when the disinfectant concentration and ph were relatively high when the residual disinfectant concentration and ph of finished water are relatively high chemical oxidation of soluble mn ii species can be rapid in dwds as shown in fig 3 a soluble mn at a concentration as low as 6 μg l in finished water still continued to transform into particulates in the distribution process when the soluble mn concentration in finished water reached 20 μg l the soluble mn concentration dropped by approximately 50 in dwds fig 3b for this sampling the residual chlorine and chlorine dioxide concentrations in the finished water from wtp zz and wtp st were 0 35 mg l and 0 23 mg l respectively and the ph values were 7 75 and 8 05 respectively under conditions with high oxidant concentration and ph mn ii ions are kinetically much easier to be oxidized into oxides in particulate form in addition the decrease of soluble mn concentration was overall greater at locations farther from the wtp indicating that water age could also be an important factor affecting mn ii oxidation in dwds consequently although the concentration of particulate mn in finished water was only approximately 5 μg l the mn accumulation risk increased in dwds because of the formation of particulate mn in the distribution process as shown in fig 3 at some of the sampling sites the net accumulation of mn i e the decrease in total mn could exceed 30 thus reducing soluble mn concentrations in finished water is necessary to minimize the formation of particulate mn the observed sporadic release of particulate mn may be explained by the sloughing of mn deposits under sudden hydraulic disturbance during water sampling process site 5 in fig 3b shows an apparently higher concentration of soluble mn than finished water which could be related with the dissolution of mn oxides in dwds this phenomenon will be discussed in detail in the following section 3 4 release of particulate mn from pipe deposits fig 4 a shows an obvious increase in particulate mn in tap water sampled from locations close to the service lines in sa zz fed by wtp zz sampling sites shown in fig s2b indicating a dramatic release of particulate mn from the pipe surface although the total mn concentration in the finished water was as low as 5 μg l the concentration in the tap water could still exceed 50 μg l a typical regulation value for mn as shown in fig 5 the increase in the particulate mn concentration in tap water was found to be significantly correlated with the increase in water turbidity p 0 001 this evidence suggested that mn deposits in dwds are a potential risk to drinking water quality and turbidity could possibly be an indicator of particulate mn increase in dwds compared to fig 4a the tap water sampled near the distribution mains in sa zz see fig s2a showed a much lower release of particulate mn fig 4b two reasons might explain this difference 1 mn was hardly deposited on the inner surface of the distribution mains because the water flow velocity could be relatively high or 2 mn deposition did occur within distribution mains but the formed mn deposits were stable and not likely to be released into bulk water the results of the analysis of the pipe deposits collected from distribution mains excluded the first hypothesis as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b brown pipe scale 2 1 8 5 g dry solids per square meter of pipe surface was present on the surface of the ductile iron pipes the scale was tightly attached to the pipe surface the elemental composition of the scale revealed by xrf analysis showed that mn and aluminum were the most abundant metallic elements followed by iron and silicon because the water flow velocities in distribution mains are relatively high and steady it is reasonable to predict that deposits attached to the pipe surface are relativley stable under the regular shear force caused by water flow in contrast the hydraulic conditions in service lines with smaller diameters could be unstable due to the large variations in water consumption from morning to night in rural areas in conclusion the difference in fig 4a and b can be explained by the stability of both the pipe deposits and hydraulic conditions since the hydraulics in dwds may change greatly at different time of a day for example in the morning peak and in the midafternoon more attention should be paid to the sampling time to obtain more details on hydraulics influenced particulate mn release e g multiple samples could be taken at a single location but over a time span 3 5 release of soluble mn when the disinfectant concentration was low as clearly shown in fig 7 compared to finished water the soluble mn concentration significantly increased in the tap water sampled in sa st which suggested the release of soluble mn during the distribution process in addition the increase in soluble mn was overall consistent with the decrease of residual disinfectant concentration in tap water typically the chlorine dioxide residual was less than 0 1 mg l during the study period the dose of chlorine dioxide was almost always at a very low level typically less than 0 2 mg l to avoid the occurrence of yellow water before the finished water entered dwds however microbial problems occur when the residual disinfectant in distributed water is insufficient in sa st the total bacterial counts in tap water detected through agar cultivation often exceeded 100 colony forming units per milliliter the chinese standard for drinking water quality a similar phenomenon also appeared sporadically at other service areas e g at sampling site no 5 shown in fig 3b and sampling site no 11 shown in fig 4a at the sites where the soluble mn concentration was significantly higher than finished water the tap water often had a lower residual disinfectant concentration typically less than 0 05 mg l chlorine and a higher total bacterial count fig s5 thus the elevated microbial activity was speculated to be responsible for the reductive dissolution of mn oxide deposits that had previously accumulated previous studies have reported the release of soluble mn from full scale filter media in wtps due to the reduction of mn coatings by microorganisms islam 2010 swain et al 2018 the results obtained from dna sequencing and metabolic function predictions are presented to provide some evidence for the above hypothesis as expected the sequencing results show that the bacterial community structures in the flushing water collected from sa st were significantly different from those in the control area sa js at the phylum level fig s6 genus level fig s7 and otu level fig 8 in addition the functional gene prediction results in table 2 show that in sa st the mn related metabolic gene abundance was one or more orders of magnitude higher than that in the control area sa js which partly supports the presence of more active microbes in sa st that are potentially associated with the reductive dissolution and release of mn deposits observed in dwds 3 6 factors influencing the visibility of particulate mn and control strategies for mn deposition in dwds it has been reported that oxidized mn iv at concentrations as low as 5 μg l can be visually detected however the detection of mn iv in a household environment can be affected by other factors such as water depth container size and color sain et al 2014 during this study we did not observe a visible color when the particulate mn concentration exceeded 50 μg l or even 100 μg l in the tap water sampled from sa zz however according to the water utilities surveyed in this and previous studies finished water containing mn at concentrations as low as 30 μg l can be obviously yellowish the size of mn particles may be responsible for these seemingly contradictory observations in the experiment conducted by sain and dietrich 2014 the mn iv synthesized through the oxidation of mn ii by sodium hypochlorite at ph 11 was thought to have a small particle size because the newly formed mn iv particles did not tend to aggregate to form larger particles in the absence of substances that can act as coagulants to enhance particle aggregation huangfu et al 2013 however in finished water the particle size of mn oxides can be larger because there are many kinds of coexisting metal ions such as mg2 and ca2 that can lead to the aggregation of small mn iv particles huangfu et al 2013 liu et al 2009 in regard to the mn iv particles released from mn containing loose deposits their particle size may be large the size of the particles can influence their optical properties including light scattering and adsorption banin and lahav 1968 kelly et al 2003 in addition the number of particles could also vary for different particle sizes at the same mass concentration particulate mn iv oxides with different properties including the particle size could result in different visibility thus there is a possibility that consumers drink the water with a high level of mn when they cannot visually detect the problem mn release in dwds could happen at any time because local shear forces may change due to varying hydraulic conditions which explained some irregular increase of particulate mn concentration the accumulation of mn depends on the net effect of deposition and release mn deposition very easily happens when the concentration of particulate mn in finished water reaches 50 μg l even when particulate mn concentration was as low as 10 μg l the net accumulation of mn was still observed the overall trend of particulate mn change in dwds reversed when its concentration was maintained below 5 μg l in finished water as shown in figs s8a b c particulate mn release occasionally occurred in three sas with mn inventory when particulate mn concentration was below 5 μg l in finished water which was consistent with the observation shown in fig 4a in the control areas where the mn concentration in finished water was always maintained at levels less than 5 μg l and mn related discoloration had never been reported the level of mn concentration in tap water was the same with that in finished water fig s8d indicating no mn deposits were released stable transport of mn in dwds without deposition or release is a desired scenario thus maintaining particulate mn concentration below 5 μg l in finished water is proposed to eliminate the net accumulation risk of mn and gradually decrease the mn deposits already present in dwds improving the efficiency of filtration process to retain particles is critical to achieve the goal of controlling particulate mn in drinking water treatment practice a regular and efficient backwash program can be useful to ensure a stable filtering process considering that soluble mn ii ions in finished water can also transform into particulate mn oxides in dwds simply reducing particulate mn in finished water is not enough a low ph and disinfectant concentration could be beneficial for controlling the formation of particulate mn through a chemical pathway in dwds however microbial concerns arise when the residual disinfectant concentration is insufficient for bacterial inhibition soluble mn should be controlled before it enters the distribution systems to decrease mn deposition in dwds as found in this study soluble mn at concentrations less than 10 μg l can still transform into particulate mn under suitable conditions given the autocatalytic effect of mn ii oxidation increasing soluble mn ii concentration and the presence of particulate mn in finished water would both accelerate the oxidation rate of mn ii in dwds gregory and carlson 2003 hao et al 1991 in addition as the disinfectant dose of the wtps studied in this research was relatively low the formation of mn particles might be much faster in dwds with higher residual disinfectant concentrations considering all the factors controlling the particulate mn concentration below 5 μg l and the total mn concentration below 10 μg l in finished water is recommended to well eliminate the net accumulation of mn in dwds this measure could also bring about gradual erosion of stored mn deposits and alleviate the risk of discoloration caused by mn release in large quantities to minimize mn deposition potential in dwds requires water treatment techniques such as enhanced chemical and biological oxidation technologies that can sufficiently remove mn before it enters distribution systems if the water treatment control of mn fails it can be necessary for water utilities to conduct pipe cleaning including routine flushing unidirectional flushing etc to decrease the inventory of mn deposits in dwds as found by this study and previous survey li et al 2018 large amounts of mn deposits were found in both distribution mains with large pipe diameters and service lines with smaller pipe diameters suggesting the risks of mn deposition existing in the whole dwds hydraulic flushing could start with the distribution mains that have influence on the water quality of the whole distribution systems 4 conclusions this study revealed that particulate mn had the highest potential to accumulate in dwds simply controlling total mn concentration is not effective enough to decrease mn deposition in dwds decreasing particulate mn in finished water is the preferred solution to the control of mn deposition in dwds control of particulate mn concentration below 5 μg l is recommended to achieve this goal the whole water treatment processes particularly the filtration process in wtps must be strengthened to retain particles since soluble mn at a concentration as low as 10 μg l could still form mn particulates in dwds if the conditions of ph and disinfectant e g cl2 clo2 were suitable for mn ii oxidation sufficient removal of soluble mn

study sites in this field study water samples were taken from seven full scale distribution systems in three different regions i e gy yx and sy in eastern china these systems were chosen because of the different mn concentrations and species in their finished water which allow different mn behaviors to be studied the relevant information about the study sites the service areas sas of each water treatment plant wtp and sample types are listed in table 1 among all the sampling areas the service areas with histories of water discoloration were regarded as research areas while the other areas were seen as control areas that were fed by finished water containing very low levels of mn typically 5 μg l for a long time as shown in table 1 relatively small amounts of water were supplied by the listed wtps because all wtps were in service for rural towns where the residents were dispersed and the water demand was relatively low it should be mentioned that each of the study distribution areas was fed by only one wtp allowing the tap water quality to be compared with that of the finished water in the areas studied cement mortar lined ductile iron pipes and high density polyethylene pipes hdpe were primarily used in the laying of distribution mains typically 400 1200 mm in diameter that carried water from wtps to service lines the pipe materials of the service lines and household plumbing systems mainly included polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride 2 2 water sampling and analysis all the water sampling sites in gy and sy were close to distribution mains refer to the map of sa st in supporting information si fig s1 as an example to reflect the water quality in the main pipes in yx the sampling sites were close to both the distribution mains refer to the sketch map in fig s2a and service lines refer to the sketch map in fig s2b distributed water was sampled from the household taps that were most commonly used by residents to avoid the collection of stagnant water inside a building the initial water flow after opening the faucet was discarded typically a sample was taken after allowing the water to flow for one to 2 min the water discharge time was not fixed because at each site the amount of stagnant water in the plumbing pipes varied and could not be accurately determined tap water turbidity and ph were measured in situ using a portable turbidimeter hach 2100q and a ph meter hach hq40d respectively residual chlorine or chlorine dioxide was detected by the dpd method using a hach pocket colorimeter ii a 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube was used to collect water for the total mn concentration analysis an additional water sample was filtered in the field through a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone membrane for the analysis of soluble mn because colloidal mn 0 22 μm in drinking water systems is not common and is usually only associated with ozonation kohl and medlar 2006 0 22 μm filtration as an operational standard procedure was the best choice to define the soluble metal fraction in the field studies and has been used in many published studies clark et al 2014 gregory 2005 lytle et al 2010 for some water samples a 1 0 μm membrane was also used to filter raw tap water to determine whether particulate mn determined by 0 22 μm filtration was greater than that by 1 0 μm in size then all the water samples were acidified in the laboratory by nitric acid to obtain solution ph 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry thermo icap q icp ms was used to analyze metal concentration for data quality control at least one of the blanks or standard sample of known concentration was measured every ten water samples particulate mn concentration was the calculated concentration difference between total mn and soluble mn 2 3 microbe sampling and analysis microbe sampling was performed in two distribution systems sa st and sa js in gy to investigate the possible microbial difference related to various mn concentrations in finished water the two areas were selected because sa st was continuously fed with water containing relatively high level of mn 20 70 μg l from wtp st while sa js received water from wtp js with very low mn residual 2 μg l table s1 suggesting that the microbial communities in their pipe wall biofilms could be different and thus suitable for the comparative study to collect microbial samples for molecular biological analysis flushing water was collected during water discharge from the distribution main outlets which are similar to urban fire hydrants then 2 l of water was filtered through a 0 20 μm polycarbonate gttp membrane millipore to collect materials for dna extraction using fastdna spin kits mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s instructions the bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified through a polymerase chain reaction with the detailed conditions and primers presented in the si sequencing 2 250 was performed on the illumina miseq platform majorbio co ltd shanghai china the generated sequences were then processed i e filtered clustered and taxonomically assigned and aligned using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 0 97 sequence similarity thresholds with usearch the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed by the rdp classifier against the silva ssu128 database using a confidence threshold of 70 to identify possible microbial activities associated with mn metabolism in dwds potential metabolic function profiles of the bacterial communities were predicted with picrust phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states http picrust github com version 1 1 3 using the rarefied otu data with the copy number of the marker genes in the microbial genomes removed langille et al 2013 functional genes were classified into clusters of orthologous groups cogs by picrust 2 4 pipe deposit collection pipe segments were exhumed from two distribution systems to provide direct evidence for mn deposition on the pipe surfaces of distribution mains in two planned exhuming projects they were harvested by cold sawing from a ductile iron pipe 800 mm in diameter in the service area of wtp zz and a ductile iron pipe 1000 mm in diameter in the service area of wtp jb after these segments were transported to the lab the surface deposits were gently scraped off with a spatula and collected for vacuum freeze drying prior to further analysis x ray fluorescence thermo arl advant xp was used for the elemental composition analysis 2 5 statistical analysis this study utilized some basic assumptions about the change in particulate or soluble mn concentrations in dwds 1 the finished water sampled at a wtp and the distributed water sampled from dwds were from the same package of water and they were comparable to each other more details related to hypothesis 1 were provided in the si 2 after the water entered dwds a decrease in the particulate mn concentration reflected deposition 3 an increase in the particulate mn concentration indicated a release from mn deposits or the formation of particulate mn through mn ii oxidation 4 a decrease in the soluble mn concentration suggested the oxidation of mn ii ions 5 an increase in the soluble mn concentration indicated reductive dissolution of mn oxides that had accumulated on the interior of pipes and 6 the change in the total mn concentration indicated the net accumulation or net release of mn in dwds a one sample t test was carried out using spss statistics version 22 to determine whether there was a significant difference between mn concentrations in finished water and tap water before the t test the normality of the data was tested and the results showed that the variables total mn soluble mn and particulate mn were approximately normally distributed significance 0 05 with no significant outliers which is required for a one sample t test to give a valid result 3 results and discussion 3 1 particulate mn deposition particulates from a wtp are an important external source of loose deposits in dwds vreeburg et al 2008 as shown in fig s3 in the finished water of wtp st there was often a relatively high concentration of particulate mn ranging from 6 to 59 μg l during the whole study period with an average concentration of 18 3 μg l and a proportion of 38 1 this high concentration could be attributed to the poor capacity of the filtration process in the wtp to retain mn particles as a result discolored finished water was observed several times even before it entered the distribution systems as shown in fig 1 a when the total mn concentration in the finished water of wtp st was 63 9 μg l a significant decrease in the total mn concentration was detected in tap water with an average reduction of 23 μg l p 0 000 indicating a significant net accumulation of mn in dwds furthermore we found that particulate mn mainly contributed to the decrease in the total mn in tap water after entering the distribution systems particulate mn with a concentration of 58 1 μ l in finished water experienced a nearly 50 decrease in dwds with an average reduction of 28 μg l p 0 000 as shown in fig 1b the total mn concentration in the finished water of wtp jb was less than 10 μg l and the particulate mn concentration was approximately 5 5 μg l in sa yx compared with the finished water the total mn concentration decreased by 3 9 μg l p 0 000 and the particulate mn concentration decreased by 2 2 μg l p 0 003 on average these results indicated that if the particulate form of mn accounted for the main proportion of mn mn deposition could still occur in dwds even when the total mn concentration was as low as approximately 10 μg l it should be noted that the sampling sites in sa yx were close to service lines with slow flow velocities and long hydraulic residence times which might be beneficial for particle deposition fig s4 shows a comparison of particulate mn in tap water in sa st with particle sizes 1 0 μm and 0 22 μm most of the particulate mn identified by 0 22 μm filtration was larger than 1 0 μm in diameter with only an average difference of 5 0 μg l because particles larger than 1 0 μm are thought to more easily settle gregory 2005 residual particulate mn in finished water could have a high potential to accumulate on pipe surfaces decreasing the load of mn particles in finished water as much as possible is necessary to minimize mn deposition 3 2 stable transport of soluble mn when the disinfectant concentration and ph were relatively low when mn in finished water is mainly in a soluble form then mn behavior in dwds can be affected by water chemistry parameters such as the ph and disinfectant concentration sampling was performed in sa st when the soluble mn fraction accounted for a large proportion 75 of mn in finished water as shown in fig 2 a the soluble mn concentration did not apparently decrease during a 22 km transport the results of the one sample t test table s2 confirmed that the difference between the soluble mn concentration in finished water and tap water p 0 05 was not significant indicating no significant transformation of soluble mn into particulate mn this observation was further confirmed by another sampling and the results are shown in fig 2b these results can be attributed to the low residual disinfectant concentration and low ph of the finished water from wtp st during the above two sampling periods the chlorine dioxide concentration in finished water was maintained at a very low level 0 1 mg l to avoid the occurrence of yellow water consequently the chlorine dioxide residual concentration was quite low in the tap water collected from sa st 0 07 mg l for figs 2a and 0 06 mg l for fig 2b on average at the same time the ph of the source water finished water and tap water was weakly acidic ph 6 6 6 8 which would retard mn ii oxidation by chlorine dioxide in dwds knocke et al 1991 3 3 transformation of soluble mn when the disinfectant concentration and ph were relatively high when the residual disinfectant concentration and ph of finished water are relatively high chemical oxidation of soluble mn ii species can be rapid in dwds as shown in fig 3 a soluble mn at a concentration as low as 6 μg l in finished water still continued to transform into particulates in the distribution process when the soluble mn concentration in finished water reached 20 μg l the soluble mn concentration dropped by approximately 50 in dwds fig 3b for this sampling the residual chlorine and chlorine dioxide concentrations in the finished water from wtp zz and wtp st were 0 35 mg l and 0 23 mg l respectively and the ph values were 7 75 and 8 05 respectively under conditions with high oxidant concentration and ph mn ii ions are kinetically much easier to be oxidized into oxides in particulate form in addition the decrease of soluble mn concentration was overall greater at locations farther from the wtp indicating that water age could also be an important factor affecting mn ii oxidation in dwds consequently although the concentration of particulate mn in finished water was only approximately 5 μg l the mn accumulation risk increased in dwds because of the formation of particulate mn in the distribution process as shown in fig 3 at some of the sampling sites the net accumulation of mn i e the decrease in total mn could exceed 30 thus reducing soluble mn concentrations in finished water is necessary to minimize the formation of particulate mn the observed sporadic release of particulate mn may be explained by the sloughing of mn deposits under sudden hydraulic disturbance during water sampling process site 5 in fig 3b shows an apparently higher concentration of soluble mn than finished water which could be related with the dissolution of mn oxides in dwds this phenomenon will be discussed in detail in the following section 3 4 release of particulate mn from pipe deposits fig 4 a shows an obvious increase in particulate mn in tap water sampled from locations close to the service lines in sa zz fed by wtp zz sampling sites shown in fig s2b indicating a dramatic release of particulate mn from the pipe surface although the total mn concentration in the finished water was as low as 5 μg l the concentration in the tap water could still exceed 50 μg l a typical regulation value for mn as shown in fig 5 the increase in the particulate mn concentration in tap water was found to be significantly correlated with the increase in water turbidity p 0 001 this evidence suggested that mn deposits in dwds are a potential risk to drinking water quality and turbidity could possibly be an indicator of particulate mn increase in dwds compared to fig 4a the tap water sampled near the distribution mains in sa zz see fig s2a showed a much lower release of particulate mn fig 4b two reasons might explain this difference 1 mn was hardly deposited on the inner surface of the distribution mains because the water flow velocity could be relatively high or 2 mn deposition did occur within distribution mains but the formed mn deposits were stable and not likely to be released into bulk water the results of the analysis of the pipe deposits collected from distribution mains excluded the first hypothesis as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b brown pipe scale 2 1 8 5 g dry solids per square meter of pipe surface was present on the surface of the ductile iron pipes the scale was tightly attached to the pipe surface the elemental composition of the scale revealed by xrf analysis showed that mn and aluminum were the most abundant metallic elements followed by iron and silicon because the water flow velocities in distribution mains are relatively high and steady it is reasonable to predict that deposits attached to the pipe surface are relativley stable under the regular shear force caused by water flow in contrast the hydraulic conditions in service lines with smaller diameters could be unstable due to the large variations in water consumption from morning to night in rural areas in conclusion the difference in fig 4a and b can be explained by the stability of both the pipe deposits and hydraulic conditions since the hydraulics in dwds may change greatly at different time of a day for example in the morning peak and in the midafternoon more attention should be paid to the sampling time to obtain more details on hydraulics influenced particulate mn release e g multiple samples could be taken at a single location but over a time span 3 5 release of soluble mn when the disinfectant concentration was low as clearly shown in fig 7 compared to finished water the soluble mn concentration significantly increased in the tap water sampled in sa st which suggested the release of soluble mn during the distribution process in addition the increase in soluble mn was overall consistent with the decrease of residual disinfectant concentration in tap water typically the chlorine dioxide residual was less than 0 1 mg l during the study period the dose of chlorine dioxide was almost always at a very low level typically less than 0 2 mg l to avoid the occurrence of yellow water before the finished water entered dwds however microbial problems occur when the residual disinfectant in distributed water is insufficient in sa st the total bacterial counts in tap water detected through agar cultivation often exceeded 100 colony forming units per milliliter the chinese standard for drinking water quality a similar phenomenon also appeared sporadically at other service areas e g at sampling site no 5 shown in fig 3b and sampling site no 11 shown in fig 4a at the sites where the soluble mn concentration was significantly higher than finished water the tap water often had a lower residual disinfectant concentration typically less than 0 05 mg l chlorine and a higher total bacterial count fig s5 thus the elevated microbial activity was speculated to be responsible for the reductive dissolution of mn oxide deposits that had previously accumulated previous studies have reported the release of soluble mn from full scale filter media in wtps due to the reduction of mn coatings by microorganisms islam 2010 swain et al 2018 the results obtained from dna sequencing and metabolic function predictions are presented to provide some evidence for the above hypothesis as expected the sequencing results show that the bacterial community structures in the flushing water collected from sa st were significantly different from those in the control area sa js at the phylum level fig s6 genus level fig s7 and otu level fig 8 in addition the functional gene prediction results in table 2 show that in sa st the mn related metabolic gene abundance was one or more orders of magnitude higher than that in the control area sa js which partly supports the presence of more active microbes in sa st that are potentially associated with the reductive dissolution and release of mn deposits observed in dwds 3 6 factors influencing the visibility of particulate mn and control strategies for mn deposition in dwds it has been reported that oxidized mn iv at concentrations as low as 5 μg l can be visually detected however the detection of mn iv in a household environment can be affected by other factors such as water depth container size and color sain et al 2014 during this study we did not observe a visible color when the particulate mn concentration exceeded 50 μg l or even 100 μg l in the tap water sampled from sa zz however according to the water utilities surveyed in this and previous studies finished water containing mn at concentrations as low as 30 μg l can be obviously yellowish the size of mn particles may be responsible for these seemingly contradictory observations in the experiment conducted by sain and dietrich 2014 the mn iv synthesized through the oxidation of mn ii by sodium hypochlorite at ph 11 was thought to have a small particle size because the newly formed mn iv particles did not tend to aggregate to form larger particles in the absence of substances that can act as coagulants to enhance particle aggregation huangfu et al 2013 however in finished water the particle size of mn oxides can be larger because there are many kinds of coexisting metal ions such as mg2 and ca2 that can lead to the aggregation of small mn iv particles huangfu et al 2013 liu et al 2009 in regard to the mn iv particles released from mn containing loose deposits their particle size may be large the size of the particles can influence their optical properties including light scattering and adsorption banin and lahav 1968 kelly et al 2003 in addition the number of particles could also vary for different particle sizes at the same mass concentration particulate mn iv oxides with different properties including the particle size could result in different visibility thus there is a possibility that consumers drink the water with a high level of mn when they cannot visually detect the problem mn release in dwds could happen at any time because local shear forces may change due to varying hydraulic conditions which explained some irregular increase of particulate mn concentration the accumulation of mn depends on the net effect of deposition and release mn deposition very easily happens when the concentration of particulate mn in finished water reaches 50 μg l even when particulate mn concentration was as low as 10 μg l the net accumulation of mn was still observed the overall trend of particulate mn change in dwds reversed when its concentration was maintained below 5 μg l in finished water as shown in figs s8a b c particulate mn release occasionally occurred in three sas with mn inventory when particulate mn concentration was below 5 μg l in finished water which was consistent with the observation shown in fig 4a in the control areas where the mn concentration in finished water was always maintained at levels less than 5 μg l and mn related discoloration had never been reported the level of mn concentration in tap water was the same with that in finished water fig s8d indicating no mn deposits were released stable transport of mn in dwds without deposition or release is a desired scenario thus maintaining particulate mn concentration below 5 μg l in finished water is proposed to eliminate the net accumulation risk of mn and gradually decrease the mn deposits already present in dwds improving the efficiency of filtration process to retain particles is critical to achieve the goal of controlling particulate mn in drinking water treatment practice a regular and efficient backwash program can be useful to ensure a stable filtering process considering that soluble mn ii ions in finished water can also transform into particulate mn oxides in dwds simply reducing particulate mn in finished water is not enough a low ph and disinfectant concentration could be beneficial for controlling the formation of particulate mn through a chemical pathway in dwds however microbial concerns arise when the residual disinfectant concentration is insufficient for bacterial inhibition soluble mn should be controlled before it enters the distribution systems to decrease mn deposition in dwds as found in this study soluble mn at concentrations less than 10 μg l can still transform into particulate mn under suitable conditions given the autocatalytic effect of mn ii oxidation increasing soluble mn ii concentration and the presence of particulate mn in finished water would both accelerate the oxidation rate of mn ii in dwds gregory and carlson 2003 hao et al 1991 in addition as the disinfectant dose of the wtps studied in this research was relatively low the formation of mn particles might be much faster in dwds with higher residual disinfectant concentrations considering all the factors controlling the particulate mn concentration below 5 μg l and the total mn concentration below 10 μg l in finished water is recommended to well eliminate the net accumulation of mn in dwds this measure could also bring about gradual erosion of stored mn deposits and alleviate the risk of discoloration caused by mn release in large quantities to minimize mn deposition potential in dwds requires water treatment techniques such as enhanced chemical and biological oxidation technologies that can sufficiently remove mn before it enters distribution systems if the water treatment control of mn fails it can be necessary for water utilities to conduct pipe cleaning including routine flushing unidirectional flushing etc to decrease the inventory of mn deposits in dwds as found by this study and previous survey li et al 2018 large amounts of mn deposits were found in both distribution mains with large pipe diameters and service lines with smaller pipe diameters suggesting the risks of mn deposition existing in the whole dwds hydraulic flushing could start with the distribution mains that have influence on the water quality of the whole distribution systems 4 conclusions this study revealed that particulate mn had the highest potential to accumulate in dwds simply controlling total mn concentration is not effective enough to decrease mn deposition in dwds decreasing particulate mn in finished water is the preferred solution to the control of mn deposition in dwds control of particulate mn concentration below 5 μg l is recommended to achieve this goal the whole water treatment processes particularly the filtration process in wtps must be strengthened to retain particles since soluble mn at a concentration as low as 10 μg l could still form mn particulates in dwds if the conditions of ph and disinfectant e g cl2 clo2 were suitable for mn ii oxidation sufficient removal of soluble mn through enhanced oxidation treatment in a wtp might be indispensable for mn deposit control declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgments this

18616,unlike high rate anaerobic digesters that employ some mechanism to retain microbial sludge mass low rate systems use sufficiently long hydraulic retention times to ensure process stability which becomes economically unattractive for treating large quantities of waste this study presents the use of attainable region to develop a new strategy to enhance the stability of low rate digesters by considering three digestion cases diary manure only batch 1 or diary manure with granular batch 2 or lagoon batch sludge as innoculum the following findings were obtained 1 for a given concentration of volatile acids in an anaerobic digester higher concentrations of methanogenic archae can be attained using a digester structure combination of different digesters as opposed to single digester 2 for a given digested substrate a change in the source of inoculum results in a change in the limits of achievability by the system attainable limits for batches 1 2 and 3 were 46 486 g l 2 5 562 g l 2 and 0 551 g l 2 which resulted in performance improvements of 118 604 175 627 and 200 436 respectively and hence optimal digester structure the evidence from this study suggests that the technique can be used to simultaneously improve process stability define performance targets and propose digester structures required to achieve a given target keywords attainable regions low rate digesters performance targets digester structures process stability 1 introduction the anaerobic digestion process for waste treatment and biogas generation has received considerable attention from the scientific community due to rising demand for renewable energy and environmental sanitation as with any other bioprocess central to the operation of the anaerobic treatment process is the anaerobic digester in which microorganisms grow breakdown organic pollutants and produce methane rich biogas alford 2006 unlike aerobic treatment systems in which the loading rate is limited by the supply of a reagent such as o2 the loading rate of anaerobic reactors is limited by the processing capacity of the microorganisms mes et al 2003 these microorganisms generally include two groups acid forming and methane producing microorganisms demirel and yenigun 2002 with the latter having a growth rate five times relatively higher than the former henze et al 2008 therefore the stability of anaerobic digesters is highly dependent on the viability and mass of methanogenic archae retained in the digester with respect to a given substrate concentration the specific growth rate of methanogenic archae increases with concentration of volatile fatty acids until a maximum specific growth rate is reached above which volatile acids turn to inhibit growth rate henze et al 2008 chen et al 2008 2014 hence an optimal archae to acid ratio generally referred to as inoculum to substrate i s ratio is necessary to ensure an optimal efficiency of biogas production from anaerobic digesters this explains why biodigester designs that maximize retention of microbial biomass are crucial to the stability of the anaerobic treatment process and hence its industrial efficiency compared to other biological treatment processes one of the major causes of failure in the anaerobic treatment process is inhibition which depends on the components of the digester byproducts of microbial metabolism as well as a combination of loading rate and retention time which can result in microbial wash out or inhibition from chemical species of the two main type of anaerobic digester systems high rate systems e g contact process anaerobic filter fluidized bed uasb egsb enhance process stability by employing some mechanism either to retain microbial sludge mass in the digester or to separate the sludge from the effluent and return it to the digester mes et al 2003 henze et al 2008 on the other hand low rate systems e g cstr or pfr use sufficiently long hydraulic retention times to ensure process stability which becomes economically unattractive for treating large quantities of waste or requiring large digester volumes if a given quantity of waste must be treated mes et al 2003 hence alternative techniques that maximize process stability in low rate anaerobic digesters will be a major breakthrough in the application of anaerobic treatment process the use of digester networks in which multiple digesters are designed to operate as a single unit is such technology epa 2006 it is well known that each type of anaerobic digester has specific characteristics often making them more appropriate under specific substrate or digester conditions in addition the anaerobic digestion ad process involves multiple reactions each catalyzed by different groups of microorganisms and when operated in a single digester the process conditions are only suitable for all the reactions but not optimal for any particular reaction hence a combination of digesters allows for the flexibility and possibility of improving overall process performance previous experimental studies confirming the efficacy of digester networks have only been limited to series combinations zhang et al 2017 akobi et al 2016 nasr et al 2012 with a lot of empiricism in the design process in particular some of the plants that use the series digester combinations cannot prove whether there exist or not other network configurations that produce better performance in other words there exist the problem of local optimum or multiple solutions existence of other digester combinations that achieve same or improved results in our recent publication abunde et al abunde neba et al 2019 we solved this challenge by developing a novel theoretical framework for optimal synthesis of digester networks based on the concept of attainable regions the attainable region is a collection of all possible output for all possible digester designs by interpreting the anaerobic digestion process as a geometric object that define a region of achievability without having to explicitly enumerate all possible design combinations ming et al 2016 in the previous study we concluded that a change in the type of digested substrate results in a change in the limits of ahievability as well as the optimal combination of digesters while considering the volumetric methane productivity and waste stabilization as design objectives in the current study we aim to illustrate how the attinainable region concept can be used to solve instability problems in low rate anaerobic digesters unlike the previous study that considered different organic substrates this study considers same substrate for different sources of inoculum and uses i s ratio and instantaneous methanogenic yield as design objectives in other words we lay down a theoretical framework to design an optimal digester combination that gives the desired stability parameters i s ratio or instantaneous methanogenic yield based on the concept of attainable regions it is important for readers to note that the attainable region is unique for given reaction kinetics model structure and or parameter values and anaerobic biodegradation kinetics depends on the inhibitory conditions or type of organic substrate in the digester all inhibitory conditions in anaerobic digesters will often upset the balance between acid forming and methane producing microorganisms resulting in accumulation of volatile acids chen et al 2014 different inhibitory conditions and or substrates will result in different kinetic behaviour of volatile acids on methanogenic archae and some of the published inhibitory patterns include competitive non competitive uncompetitive linear or exponential kinetic behaviors kythreotou et al 2014 hence by using attainable regions we can understand how the performance of the digester concentration of methanogens can be enhanced under higher concentration of volatile acids using digester structures as opposed to single digesters the determination of performance targets for anaerobic digestion of different organic substrates has been investigated extensively in the past using either experimental methods such as the biomethane potential test and spectroscopy or theoretical methods based on chemical composition chemical oxygen demand or elemental composition jingura and kamusoko 2017 however these approaches are limited to only methane yield and gives no information about the other states and hence cannot predict exact cause of process failure or inhibition in addition it provides no information with respect to the digester design required to achieve a defined target this paper discusses how the attainable region concept can be used as a technique to define performance targets under different inhibitory conditions as well as model anaerobic digester configurations to optimize process stability 2 process modeling and model identification 2 1 state dynamic model of anaerobic treatment process for synthesis of low rate anaerobic digesters using attainable regions simplified models are considered most appropriate as the geometric and hydrodynamic analysis are relatively more complex the attainable region ar technique is suitable for use because it can solve problems not because of multiple reactors but because of multiple reactions such as the biological reactions in anaerobic digestion involving complex metabolic pathways however for practicality the authors have applied 2 stage lumped reaction models focusing on acid producing bacteria and methanogenic archae to make the problem more tractable our subsequent studies will seek to consider more complex parallel and series reaction set to align more closely with the biochemical pathways i e series of rate equations for hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and parallel reactions for acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the modified hill model finn et al 2013 which was developed for anaerobic digestion of animal manure diary poultry beef and swine wastes has been selected for this study the model presents a compromise between the overly simplistic models capable of predicting only gas production and sometimes substrate consumption and simplistic models such as the am2 bernard et al 2001 that include a hydrolysis step alkalinity cation concentration dissolved carbon dioxide and ammonia these effects are lumped into and become part of the biodegradability constant bo and acidity factor af present in the modified hill model finn et al 2013 the species conservation equations

microorganisms but the methanogenic archae are known to be the most sensitive to inhibition chen et al 2008 as the volatile acid concentration is increased a maximum specific growth rate of methanogenic archae will be reached at a certain concentration a further increase of the substrate concentration results in a decrease of the specific growth rate the kinetic patterns for volatile acid inhibition have been based on modification of the monod model eq 13 for growth of methanogenic archae to include inhibition term 13 μ 2 μ m 2 s 2 k s 2 s 2 the effect of volatile acid on microbial inhibition in anaerobic digestion has generally been modeled through two main approaches the empirical approach which include a linear or exponential inhibition patterns and the enzyme kinetic approach which include a competitive non competitive and uncompetitive inhibition patterns both approaches are lumped into eq 14 by multiplying the monod model with a factor that describe the different inhibition patterns 14 μ 2 μ m 2 s 2 1 k i s 2 a k s 2 1 s 2 k i e s 2 1 s 2 k i d 1 s 2 k i c e k i s 2 b eq 14 presents a generalized modified monod model to describe volatile acid inhibition on methanogenic archae from which the different inhibition cases can be derived as shown in table 1 it should be noted that even though there exist other product inhibition models that have been used to model growth of anaerobic microorganisms we consider the most common ones to illustrate the effect of anaerobic digester conditions on the type of kinetic pattern used to describe the effect of volatile acids on methanogenic archae instead of predefining an inhibition pattern as practiced by modelers of anaerobic digestion the authors of this study present a framework for determining the inhibition patterns before using the model for digester synthesis since it is not feasible to measure the specific growth rate of both microbial populations during the anaerobic treatment process the strategy consist of using the kinetic models in a full dynamic model so that the kinetic constants can be estimated from easily measurable parameters such as volumetric biogas and total volatile fatty acid concentration 2 3 model identification in order to better illustrate the different kinetic patterns and how the patterns will change with characteristics of digestion substrate ad experiment using diary manure 1 7 ts mixed inoculum from different sources was selected for model identification zaher et al 2009 the experiments were conducted in continuously mixed batch reactors at 35 c further details on the experimental study can be obtained from the cited literature in order to identify the model parameters for the different kinetic cases the adjoint based gradient algorithm defined in fig 1 is implemented first the gradient algorithm fits the whole set of model parameters and assesses the variability of the fit using marginal and joint confidence regions of the model parameters second for parameters that show a high correlation one of them is kept constant and a readjustment of the uncorrelated set of parameters is performed using the algorithm this allows a more accurate adjustment of the whole set of model parameters to experimental data as illustrated in subsequent sections the advantage of this procedure is that parameter estimation and variability assessment is performed simultaneously which allows the user to better understand the model s sensitivity to different influences and obtain reliable estimates it is not the intention of this article to go into the mathematical formulations leading to a full description of the adjoint based gradient method for parameter estimation interested readers can find a detailed description of the procedure in the following literature benítez et al 2017 3 attainable region analysis 3 1 brief theoretical overview the ar theory is a technique for process synthesis and optimization which incorporates elements of geometry to understand how networks of chemical reactors can be designed and improved hildebrandt and glasser 1990 hildebrandt et al 1990 the attainable region is defined as the set of all possible output for all possible reactor designs that can be achieved by using the fundamental processes occurring within the system and that satisfies all the constraints placed by the system geometrically the attainable region represents the region bounded by the convex hull for the set of points achievable by the fundamental processes occurring in the system once the ar has been determined the limits of achievability by the system for the given kinetics and feed point is known and the boundary of the ar can then be used to answer different design or optimization questions related to the system ming et al 2016 the theory provides guidelines for construction of attainable regions as well as some necessary conditions to test the results the following requirements are necessary before an ar analysis can be performed glasser et al 1987 1993 choose the fundamental processes occurring in the system choose the state variables define the reaction scheme and process kinetics determine the geometry of the process units define the process conditions determine the objective of the optimization given a set of reactions and associated kinetics the following five key steps need to be performed in order to complete an attainable region analysis define the reaction dimension and feed set generate the ar using combinations of the fundamental processes interpret the ar boundary in terms of reactor equipment define the objective function and overlay this onto the ar to determine point of intersection with the ar boundary determine the specific reactor configuration required to achieve the intersection point some necessary conditions for ar can be summarized as follows the ar includes all feed points to the system the ar is convex no rate vectors point out of the ar boundary backward extension of rate vectors in the complement region do not intersect the ar the following section outlines the methodological flow for ar construction and application for process synthesis and optimization the framework involves five main steps ming et al 2016 3 1 1 step 1 preparation this involves definition of the reaction kinetics ar dimension state variables those used to represent the ar as well as the feed point used to generate the ar the feed point defines the initial value or the concentration of states fed into the reactor 3 1 2 step 2 ar construction this step generates the ar using a combination of pfr cstr and mixing for two dimensional ars or a combination of pfr cstr dsr differential side stream reactor and mixing for higher dimensional constructions this is the most difficult and time consuming step but also provides the most valuable information about the operating limits of the system ar construction typically begins by determining the pfr trajectory and cstr locus from the feed the pfr trajectory is the set of points generated by solving the steady state model of a pfr reactor a set of ordinary differential equations while the cstr locus is the set of points generated by solving the cstr model a set of nonlinear equations 3 1 3 step 3 boundary interpretation this step involves interpretation of the ar boundary into reactor structures based on the fundamental characteristics of the ar boundary the boundary of the ar is composed of reaction and mixing surfaces only reaction surfaces are always convex and the points that form convex sections of the ar boundary arise from effluent concentrations specifically from pfr trajectories for a two dimensional system points on the ar boundary that initiate these convex pfr trajectories arise from specialized cstrs while for a three dimensional system they arise from dsrs the convex hull of the set of points generated by all possible combinations of fundamental reactor types and mixing defines the attainable region 3 1 4 step 4 overlay objective function the objective function is modeled in terms of the variables used to represent the ar and then overlaid onto the ar the points of intersection between the objective function and the ar boundary represent the optimal points of operation 3 1 5 step 5 optimize since the entire boundary of the ar has been interpreted in terms of reactor structures step 3 the particular reactor structure required to achieve the optimal operating points point of intersection is known summarily starting from the feed point the procedure entails finding all possible achievable outputs for the system under consideration from the trajectory of the states of interest describing the system operation these trajectories are convexified to obtain candidate attainable regions which are tested against the necessary conditions and recursively updated so that any violated necessary conditions is eliminated the process continues until no other necessary conditions are violated otherwise a candidate ar subset of the true ar is obtained which can still provide better understanding of the achievable limits of the system it is not the intention of this article to present a detailed explanation of the ar theory interested readers can consult the above sited literature for a more in depth understanding 3 2 application of ar approach to maximize methanogenic activity 3 2 1 reaction scheme and process kinetics using the estimated kinetic constants a stoichiometric scheme of the bioreaction occurring in the anaerobic digester consist of two main reactions catalyzed by acid forming bacteria eq 15 and methane forming bacteria eq 16 15 k 1 s 1 r x 1 x 1 k 2 s 2 16 k 3 s 2 r x 2 x 2 k 4 c h 4 if we assume the specific death rate to be negligible compared to the specific growth rate of both microbial populations the rate expressions for the different reaction species is defined by eqs 17 20 17 r x 1 μ 1 x 1 18 r x 2 μ 2 x 2 19 r s 1 k 1 μ 1 x 1 20 r s 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k 3 μ 2 x 2 3 3 fundamental processes various fundamental processes can occur within a system which for bioreactors may include mass transfer mixing bioreaction biodegradation bioconversion adsorption heat transfer etc the ar approach requires the fundamental processes taking place in the system be identified the following two main fundamental processes are identified to be associated with the anaerobic treatment process biodegradation and mixing the attainable region ar for the anaerobic treatment process therefore represents the set of all possible states that can be achieved by a combination the two fundamental processes biodegradation and mixing in ar theory mixing is performed by a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr while reaction biodegradation is achieved in a plug flow reactor pfr since the operation of both reactors respectively mimic the two fundamental processes at steady state operation the general mathematical representation of a cstr and pfr are given by eqs 21 and 22 respectively 21 c c f τ r c 22 d c d τ r c c is the state vector while r c is the reaction rate vector as shown by eqs 23 and 24 respectively 23 c x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 t 24 r c r x 1 r x 2 r s 1 r s 2 t solving the cstr system to obtain the roots at a given feed point c f and for different residence times τ i f o r i 1 t o n results in a set of points referred to as a cstr locus in the same way integrating the pfr system for a given feed point and residence time results in a set of points referred to as pfr trajectory 3 3 1 dimensionality analysis and model reduction the reaction stoichiometry of the system can be used to determine the dimension of the system the dimension of the ar is determined from the number of independent reactions occurring in the reactor system which defines the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace the rank of the stoichiometric coefficient matrix a in which the ar must reside since there are two independent reactions occurring in the system the set of points generated by the anaerobic treatment process must reside in a two dimensional subspace in r 5 ming et al 2016 before constructing the ar the space wherein the ar must reside by choosing unique species components in the reactions that will represent the ar must first be determined methanogenesis has been known to be the most sensitive step of the anaerobic treatment process and since the volatile fatty acids and methanogenic microorganisms are the key player in this stage it is sensible to generate the candidate ar in s 2 x 2 space which provides information required to maximize gas production as well as process stability however even if only a subset of the states is used to construct the ar candidate ar it can still be transformed in terms of the other variables if required ming et al 2016 the reduced state and reaction rate vectors are therefore presented by eqs 25 and 26 25 c s 2 x 2 t 26 r c r s 2 r x 2 t this reduction in the dimensions of the state and rate vectors is possible because the reaction rate of biodegradable volatile solids r s 1 can be expressed in terms the reaction rate of acidogenic bacteria r x 1 which can in turn be expressed as functions of reaction rates of volatile acids r s 2 and methanogenic archae r x 2 as shown by eqs 27 and 28 27 r s 1 k 1 r x 1 28 r x 1 1 k 2 r s 2 k 3 r x 2 this implies that s 1 can be expressed in terms of x 1 which can in turn be expressed as a function of s 2 and x 2 illustrated by eqs 29 and 30 notice the presence of two new terms in eqs 29 and 30 x 1 i n and x 2 i n which represent the respective feed concentrations of acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archea these terms are absent in eqs 1 5 because the material balance assumes that the concentration of anaerobic microbes in the feed is negligible compared to that inside the digester finn et al 2013 hill 1983 so in eqs 29 and 30 x 1 x 1 i n x 1 and x 2 x 2 i n x 2 29 s 1 s 1 i n k 1 x 1 x 1 i n 30 x 1 x 1 i n 1 k 2 s 2 s 2 i n k 3 x 2 x 2 i n the model reduction assumes that the specific death rates of acidogens and methanogens is negligible compared to their respective specific growth rates 3 3 2 ar construction after stating the process kinetics the ar construction process is initiated by defining feed point and process conditions that influence the system in this study three anaerobic digestion batches diary manure diary manure granular sludge and diary manure lagoon inoculum were considered each with respective feed concentrations c f s 2 f x 2 f t of 1 89 0 84 t 1 89 0 84 t and 1 62 1 53 t the controlled process condition was mainly temperature which was maintained at a constant value of 35 c throughout retention time using the specified feed kinetics and temperature conditions the set of points generated by solving the pfr equation are called the pfr trajectory and those generated by solving the cstr equation are called the cstr locus the convex hull for the set of points generated by all possible combinations of cstr pfr and mixing defines the ar the attainable region is unique for a given kinetics and feed point and process conditions a change in any of these may result in a change in the ar and hence the operating limits of the system 3 4 objective function for optimizing microbial activity since the methanogens are most susceptible to process instabilities we are interested in determining the optimal operating point that ensures stability of methanogenic microorganisms for doing this we define two objective functions which translate the stability of methanogenic archae the inoculum to substrate i s ratio and the instantaneous yield of methanogens from volatile acids the inoculum to substrate ratio describes the concentration of volatile acids that should be maintained in the digester for optimal activity methanogenic archae studies have reported the optimal tolerance range of volatile acids above which the methanogens experience inhibition or toxicity chen et al 2008 the instantaneous yield is defined as the rate of formation of the desired product methanogens divided by the rate of consumtption of the reactant volatile acids the inoculum to substrate ratio i s was modeled using eq 31 while the instantaneous yield of methanogenic archae υ x 2 from volatile acids was modeled by eq 32 31 i s x 2 s 2 32 υ x 2 r x 2 r s 2 μ 2 x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k 3 μ 2 x 2 eqs 31 and 32 can be rearranged to express x 2 as a function of s 2 presented by eqs 33 and 34 respectively it should be noted that the term μ 1 x 1 in eq 34 contains x 2 and the numerical computations additionally made use of eqs 29 and 30 33 x 2 s 2 i s s 2 34 x 2 s 2 υ x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 μ 2 s 2 υ x 2 k 3 1 eqs 33 and 34 can seperately be plotted over the ar boundary as contours to determine the intersection with the boundary sections of the objective function that intersect the ar are optimal points relative to the i s ratio or υ x 2 specified the points of intersection can be interpreted in terms of digester networks depending on the manner in which the ar is constructed ming et al 2016 and the reactor structure corresponding to the i s ratio or υ x 2 of interest is the optimal reactor structure 4 results and discussion 4 1 model fits and estimate of kinetic constants we have explored the capabilities of the different biokinetic models to describe the degradation of organic substrate in the anaerobic digestion process experimental results for three anaerobic digestion batches of diary manure each under different process conditions were considered zaher et al 2009 in batch 1 no external inoculum was added during start up of the digester in batch 2 granular sludge is added into the digester as inoculum while in batch 3 sludge from a lagoon was used as the inoculum fig 2 presents the fitting results for all the 5 biokinetic models with experimental measurements of volatile fatty acids and methane flow rate obtained from batch 1 from the fitting results it can be concluded that the models give a good prediction of the experimental data however the competitive model shows the smallest sse see table 2 and can thus be considered to more closely represent the experimental data hence anaerobic digestion of diary manure with no external inoculum leads to methanogenic inhibition described as being competitive similar fittings were performed for batches 2 and 3 which was observed that the linear model more closely represented the experimental data for both cases figs 3 and 4 present the fitting for the linear model with experimental measurements of volatile acid and methane flow rate obtained from batches 2 and 3 table 2 presents the parameter estimates for all the fitting cases even though batches 1 and two fit well with the linear model the kinetic constants are different and we can thus conclude that inhibition characteristics exerted by volatile acids on methanogenic archae differs based on the conditions in the anaerobic digester this kinetic behaviour of methanogenic archae might be explained in this way the growth kinectis of microorganisms widely depends on nutritional availability as well as operational and environmental conditions which in turn vary for different digester worts the different sources of inoculum results in different wort characteristics which can be measured in terms of nutritional differences presence of different toxicants or other competitive microorganisms in the digester thereby varying the kinetic behaviour of the methanogens the findings of the current study are consistent with those of yang et al ref who studied the effect of temperature and substrate characteristics on kinetic behaviour of anaerobic digestion process the authors considered four different substrates swine wastewater palm oil mill wastewater protein production wastewater synthetic wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater five temperature regimes 10 c 15 c 20 c 25 c 30 c and four kinetic models modified stover kincannon chen and hashimoto deng and modified deng were tested it was observed that changes in substrate and temperature as well as a combination of thereof resulted in different fitting characteristics of the different kinetic models this effect of substrate and operating conditions on the kinetic behaviour of the anaerobic treatment process has very important implications in the concept of attainable regions this is because the attainable region is unique for a given kinetics ming et al 2016 and a change in kinetics therefore results in a change in the limits of achievability by the system what this implies practically is that the reactor structures required to achieve the optimal operating point will differ for each digested substrate which paves the way to use the concept of attainable regions to solve operational challenges for different types of wastewaters in addition the study uses the adjoint method for computing gradient of the parameter estimation objective function before using the conjugate gradient method for model calibration gradient based methods are widely used for calibration of anaerobic digestion models donoso bravo et al 2011 with gradients mostly computed using the finite difference method the adjoint method presents an alternative approach for computing gradients other model calibration methods that have been applied to anaerobic digestion models include the asymptotic state observers lópez and borzacconi 2009 simplex algorithm zaher et al 2009 genetic algorithm combined with the gradient descent method martinez et al 2012 etc even though we have presented the kinetic analysis of anaerobic digestion process using the adjoint based gradient method the emphasis of this paper is not necessarily on the fitting performance of the different biokinetic models but on how we use the models to develop new policies for operation of anaerobic digesters to ensure stability of methanogenic archae 4 2 effects of process kinetics on optimal reactor configuration 4 2 1 attainable regions limits of achievability by the system fig 5 presents the pfr trajectory and cstr locus dubed base trajectories for the anaerobic digestion process in batch 1 while fig 6 presents the two dimensional candidate ar obained from the based trajectories using the specified feed and kinetics employing a cstr gives a maximum attainable methanogenic concentration of 5 01gme l fig 5 a pfr however improves upon this concentration to an attainable value of 24 09gme l at this point the reader can already notice that by using an anaerobic pfr as opposed to a cstr the concentration of methangoneic archae in the biodigester increases by approximately 5 times it can be observed from fig 6 that constructing the attainable region further extends the concentration of methanogenic archae to 37 51 gme l this increase in the concentration of methanogenic archae for the same feed and kinetics is attributed to the fact that a systematic manipulation of the fundamental processs mixing and reaction in this case occurring in a system serves to expand the states that can be achieved by a system which is one of the key strengths of the attainable region theory if more fundamental processes are considered e g seperation the limits of achievabtily by the states of the system can be further improved fig 7 presents the base trajectories for the anaerobic digestion process in batch 2 while fig 8 presents the candidate ar recall that the ar is specific for a given kinetics which explains why the nature of ar for batch 2 is different from that in batch 1 we oberve from the base trajectories that using a cstr will result in higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids in the digester an indication of process instability while a pfr presents a maximum limit of volatile acid concentration that can be attained unlike the case of batch 1 constructing the ar doesn t serve to increase the maximum concentration of methanogenic archae attained compared to the that attained with the base trajectories however in this case the ar analysis shows that higher concentrations of methanogenic arhae can be attained at higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids by running a pfr from a cstr and a bypass valve from feed see mixing line ab on fig 8 practically this implies that using a digester network as opposed to a single digester results in an increased stability of the methananogenic archae fig 9 presents the base trajectories for the anaerobic digestion process in batch 3 while fig 10 presents the candidate ar similar to the case of batch 2 constructing the ar doesn t serve to increase the maximum concentration of methanogenic archae attained but concentrations of methanogenic archae origninally not attainable at higher concentrations of volatile acids now become attainable by using a digester structure indicated by line bc of fig 10 even though we have observed a change in the nature of attainable region for the different kinetics the boundary of ars however have a simple fundamental structure irrespective of the kinetics used this boundary is composed entirely of mixing surfaces straight lines and manifolds convex reaction surfaces ming et al 2016 the points that form the convex reaction surfaces arise from effluent concentrations of the pfr trajectories which are initiated by points from specialized cstrs we will now illustrate how interpret the ar boundary into anaerobic digester strucures by using the fundamental characteristics of the ar boundary the illustration will be done by using the ar for batch 1 presented in fig 6 in fig 6 the point b is the feed point while the region defined by abc is the ar the convex segment ba are trajectories obtained by running pfr from points on cstr locus the point a is therefore obtained by running a cstr from point b followed by a pfr from cstr while the point c is obtained by running a cstr from feed point b the lines ac and bc are the mixing surfaces while ab is the reaction surface concentrations along the line ac c a c can be obtained by mixing points a and c eq 35 the lever arm rule and the digester structure is therefore given by a cstr pfr point a run in parallel with a cstr point c and both contents mixed at the end concentrations on the line bc c b c can be obtained by mixing points b and c eq 36 and the required digester structure is given by a cstr point c with a bypass from feed point b similar digester interpretations were made for batches 2 and 3 as displayed on figs 8 and 10 35 c a c α c a 1 α c c 0 α 1 36 c b c α c b 1 α c c 0 α 1 where α is known as the mixing ratio the results obtained imply practically that a systematic scheduling of the fundamental processes of mixing and reaction occurring in the anaerobic digester can result in an increased stability of methanogenic archae it is interesting to note that for a two dimensional attainable region when mixing and reaction are the only fundamental processes occurring in a system the ar may be constructed by a combination of reactors involving pfrs cstrs and mixing only ming et al 2016 what this means is that there is no need to devise new or perhaps novel types of digesters with the aim of extending the limits of achievability by the system instead it is required to focus attention on optiimally arranging combinations of these two fundamental digester types or researching more fundamental processes to the system table 3 presents a summary of the performance characteristics of limits of achievability of the three batches of anaerobic digestion the limits of achievability by the systems have been measured quantitatively in terms of the area of the convex hull note that the ar is defined by the convex hull of the set of points states generated by the fundamental processes occurring within the system the convex hull represents the smallest subset of a set of points that can be used to generate all other points by reaction and mixing geometrically a convex hull is a finite convex polytope enclosed by a finite number of hyperplanes which is interpreted in a two dimensional space as the smallest polygon enclosed by planar facets such that all of the elements lie on or in the interior of the polygon asiedu et al 2015 from the results in table 3 the following two conclusions can be made 1 the ar analysis serves to improve the peformance of the system measured in thems of states attained by the concenertation of methanogenic archae for all the three batches 2 we observe that the increase in peformance differs for each batch of anaerobic digestion this is because a change in digester characterisitics source of innoculum results in a change in kinetics and the ability of the ar to improve the peformance of the system depends on the process kinetics we can conclude that even if all the necessary conditions of the ar are not met the candidate otherwise true ar still serves to improve the limits of achievabilitity by the system in the next section we will present how the ar has been used to answer few design questions on the anaerobic digesters 4 2 2 digester structures for optimal methanogenic activity the optimal digester structures for the different batches of anaerobic digestion have been obtained from the point of intersection between the objective function and boundary of the ar fig 11 shows a number of contour lines for i s ratio and the instantaneous methanogenic yield for batch 1 recall that in the case of batch one the competitive inhibition model was selected for use in modeling the digester configuration using attainable regions so for optimizing the instantaneous yield we substitute μ 2 s 2 corresponding to competitive inhibition model see table 1 into eq 34 to obtain objective function for competitive model eq 37 since the term μ 1 x 1 in eq 37 contains x 2 the numerical computations additionally made use of eqs 29 and 30 in order to overlay eq 37 onto the ar boundary constructed in the s 2 x 2 space 37 x 2 υ x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k s 2 1 s 2 k i s 2 μ m 2 s 2 υ x 2 k 3 1 observe that the two objective functions intersect the ar boundary at several points the i s ratio becomes smaller while the instantaneous methanogenic yield becomes larger as we move toward the horizontal line x 2 0 this suggests that for a given concentration of methanogens in the digester higher i s ratio corresponds to lower concentration of volatile acids while the instantaneous methanogenic yield corresponds to higher concentration of volatile acids fig 12 shows a number of contour lines for i s ratio and instantaneous yield for batch 2 in the case of batch 2 the linear inhibition model was selected to describe the anaerobic digestion kinetics so for optimizing the instantaneous yield we substitute μ 2 s 2 corresponding to linear inhibition model see table 1 into eq 36 to obtain objective function for the linear inhibition model eq 38 as in the case for batch 1 38 x 2 υ x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k s 2 s 2 μ m 2 s 2 1 k i s 2 υ x 2 k 3 1 similarly to the case of batch 1 the two objective functions intersect the ar boundary at several points and the i s ratio becomes smaller w as we move toward the horizontal line x 2 0 however contrarily to batch 1 the instantaneous methanogenic yield becomes smaller as we move toward the horizontal line x 2 0 this suggests that for a given concentration of methanogens in the digester higher i s ratio and higher instantaneous methanogenic yields corresponds to lower concentration of volatile acids a possible explanation for the reversal of trend observed in instantaneous methanogenic yield can be attributed to the fact that the range of concentrations of volatile acids attained in batch 2 fall within the inhibitory range there by causing inhibition to the growth of methanogenic archae another possible explanation could be that the granular sludge used as inoculum for batch 2 is less adapted to higher concentrations of volatile acids and studies have confirmed that acclimation or adaptation of methanogens greatly influence their ability to withstand higher concentrations of inhibitory substances asiedu et al 2015 chen et al 2008 2014 fig 13 shows a number of contour lines for i s ratio and instantaneous yield for batch 3 contrarily to batches 1 and 2 for some concentrations of methanogenic archae in the digester certain values of instantaneous methanogenic yield correspond to two different concentrations of volatile acids within the limits of achievability by the system multiple points of intersection between objective functions and boundary of the attainable region is an indication of multiple operating points multiple optima for the system if the only criteria for design is the i s ratio and the instantaneous methanogenic yield then the optimal digester structure to achieve a given i s ratio or instantaneous methanogenic yield can be seelected from any of the intersection points however points corresponding to lower concentrations of methanogenic yield points associated with the lower part of the ar are preferable since the growth rate of these microbial population is about 5 times slower that of acidogens henze et al 2008 hence making it difficult to maitain higher concentrations in the digester unless a seperation system is included it is interesting to compare the results of this study with that of abunde et al abunde neba et al 2019 who used attainable regions to compare the limits of achievability of five different digested substrates using volumetric methane productivity and waste stabilization as objective functions the authors concluded that a change in the type of digested substrate results in a change in the limits of ahievability as well as the optimized ar parameter of an anaerobic digestion system in this study the results have demonstrated that for the same digested substrate diary manure different sourcess of inoculum will result in different limits of achievability by system and hence the optimal digester structure using i s ratio and instantaneous methanogenic yield as objective functions the results have shown that using digester structues as opposed to single digesters can improve the viability of methanogenic archae at higher concentrations of volatile fatty and for an anaerobic digestion system a change in digested subtrate and or source of innoculum results in a change in the limits of achievabilty by the system this study therefore lays down the theoretical framework for using attainable regions to define the anaerobic digetion performance targets for a given innoculum and or substrate characteristics therefore unlike the bmp assay and the buxuells technique for defining performance targets limits of achievability the ar approach does not only provide information about the limits of achievabily but it provides the optimal digester structures required to achieve a given target in our previous study abunde neba et al 2019 we considered measurable outputs from the digester volumetric methane productivity and waste stabilization as objectives while the current study we considered parameters directly linked to microbial stability i s ratio and instantaneous methanogenic yield as objectives the combination of results suggest that the ar can be used to answer any design and optimization questions this is possible because for a defined kinetics model structure and or kinetic coefficients the ar is fixed for a given feed point and multiple objective functions and hence multiple optimizations may be formed using a single ar in other words the attainable region represents the solution to several different optimization problems implying several optimization scenarios can be performed without any requirement to perform further optimizations or reconstruct the attainable region when the objective function is changed therefore the design approach presented in this study can be used to optimize any process and design parameter of the anaerobic treatment processes 5 conclusion returning to the problems posed at the beginning of this study it is now possible to state that the use of digester structues as opposed to single digesters can improve process stability and performance for a given concentration of volatile acids in an anaerobic digester higher concentrations of methanogenic archae can be attained using a digester structure network as opposed to single digester this study has shown that a for a given digested substrate a change in the source of innoculum results in a change in the limits of achievabilty by the system and hence the optimal digester structures required to achieve a given objective another major finding was that the attainable region technique can be used as reliable alternatives to the bmp assay and the buxuells technique for defining performance targets limits of achievability because the ar approach does not only provide information about the limits of achievabily but it provides the optimal digester structures required to achieve a given target the design technique presented in this study can be used to answer any design and optimization questions regarding the anaerobic treatment process this concept has been proven by formulating and solving two optimization problems to obtain optimal structures for anaerobic digesters to achieve a given inoculum to substrate ratio as well as instantaneous methanogenic yield the evidence from this study suggests that the technique of using digester structures presents a break through in the application of low rate anaerobic digesters as it can be used to improve upon the process dynamics the current findings add to a growing body of literature on the application of attainable regions for solving operational challenges in processs engineering these findings enhance our understanding of that a systematic manipulation of the fundamental processes mixing and reaction in this case occurring in a system serves to expand the states that can be achieved by a system which is one of the key strengths of the attainable region theory it is highly interesting for readers to note the geometric optimization technique presented in this study can also be to optimize operation of other wastewater treatment processes e g activated sludge treatment coagulation etc the technique is suitable not because of multiple reactors but because of multiple reactions in a process in order to subject the operational technique to actual experimental verification pilot scale studies are currently under design in the mean time interested researchers could consider using economic indicators such as net present value internal rate of returns benefit cost ratio or payback period as objective function for attainable region optimization which would present a key motivation for investors further theoretical study is needed to account for the effect of temperature regimes pychrophillic mesophillic and thermophillic on the limits of avhievabilit by the system in this study the anaerobic digester networks have been staged two stage biochemical kinetics in which acid forming stage is physically separated from the methane gas forming stage other studies could consider applying thermodynamic staging techniques where digester networks are designed based on different temperature regimes in order to take advantage of the higher stability of the

18616,unlike high rate anaerobic digesters that employ some mechanism to retain microbial sludge mass low rate systems use sufficiently long hydraulic retention times to ensure process stability which becomes economically unattractive for treating large quantities of waste this study presents the use of attainable region to develop a new strategy to enhance the stability of low rate digesters by considering three digestion cases diary manure only batch 1 or diary manure with granular batch 2 or lagoon batch sludge as innoculum the following findings were obtained 1 for a given concentration of volatile acids in an anaerobic digester higher concentrations of methanogenic archae can be attained using a digester structure combination of different digesters as opposed to single digester 2 for a given digested substrate a change in the source of inoculum results in a change in the limits of achievability by the system attainable limits for batches 1 2 and 3 were 46 486 g l 2 5 562 g l 2 and 0 551 g l 2 which resulted in performance improvements of 118 604 175 627 and 200 436 respectively and hence optimal digester structure the evidence from this study suggests that the technique can be used to simultaneously improve process stability define performance targets and propose digester structures required to achieve a given target keywords attainable regions low rate digesters performance targets digester structures process stability 1 introduction the anaerobic digestion process for waste treatment and biogas generation has received considerable attention from the scientific community due to rising demand for renewable energy and environmental sanitation as with any other bioprocess central to the operation of the anaerobic treatment process is the anaerobic digester in which microorganisms grow breakdown organic pollutants and produce methane rich biogas alford 2006 unlike aerobic treatment systems in which the loading rate is limited by the supply of a reagent such as o2 the loading rate of anaerobic reactors is limited by the processing capacity of the microorganisms mes et al 2003 these microorganisms generally include two groups acid forming and methane producing microorganisms demirel and yenigun 2002 with the latter having a growth rate five times relatively higher than the former henze et al 2008 therefore the stability of anaerobic digesters is highly dependent on the viability and mass of methanogenic archae retained in the digester with respect to a given substrate concentration the specific growth rate of methanogenic archae increases with concentration of volatile fatty acids until a maximum specific growth rate is reached above which volatile acids turn to inhibit growth rate henze et al 2008 chen et al 2008 2014 hence an optimal archae to acid ratio generally referred to as inoculum to substrate i s ratio is necessary to ensure an optimal efficiency of biogas production from anaerobic digesters this explains why biodigester designs that maximize retention of microbial biomass are crucial to the stability of the anaerobic treatment process and hence its industrial efficiency compared to other biological treatment processes one of the major causes of failure in the anaerobic treatment process is inhibition which depends on the components of the digester byproducts of microbial metabolism as well as a combination of loading rate and retention time which can result in microbial wash out or inhibition from chemical species of the two main type of anaerobic digester systems high rate systems e g contact process anaerobic filter fluidized bed uasb egsb enhance process stability by employing some mechanism either to retain microbial sludge mass in the digester or to separate the sludge from the effluent and return it to the digester mes et al 2003 henze et al 2008 on the other hand low rate systems e g cstr or pfr use sufficiently long hydraulic retention times to ensure process stability which becomes economically unattractive for treating large quantities of waste or requiring large digester volumes if a given quantity of waste must be treated mes et al 2003 hence alternative techniques that maximize process stability in low rate anaerobic digesters will be a major breakthrough in the application of anaerobic treatment process the use of digester networks in which multiple digesters are designed to operate as a single unit is such technology epa 2006 it is well known that each type of anaerobic digester has specific characteristics often making them more appropriate under specific substrate or digester conditions in addition the anaerobic digestion ad process involves multiple reactions each catalyzed by different groups of microorganisms and when operated in a single digester the process conditions are only suitable for all the reactions but not optimal for any particular reaction hence a combination of digesters allows for the flexibility and possibility of improving overall process performance previous experimental studies confirming the efficacy of digester networks have only been limited to series combinations zhang et al 2017 akobi et al 2016 nasr et al 2012 with a lot of empiricism in the design process in particular some of the plants that use the series digester combinations cannot prove whether there exist or not other network configurations that produce better performance in other words there exist the problem of local optimum or multiple solutions existence of other digester combinations that achieve same or improved results in our recent publication abunde et al abunde neba et al 2019 we solved this challenge by developing a novel theoretical framework for optimal synthesis of digester networks based on the concept of attainable regions the attainable region is a collection of all possible output for all possible digester designs by interpreting the anaerobic digestion process as a geometric object that define a region of achievability without having to explicitly enumerate all possible design combinations ming et al 2016 in the previous study we concluded that a change in the type of digested substrate results in a change in the limits of ahievability as well as the optimal combination of digesters while considering the volumetric methane productivity and waste stabilization as design objectives in the current study we aim to illustrate how the attinainable region concept can be used to solve instability problems in low rate anaerobic digesters unlike the previous study that considered different organic substrates this study considers same substrate for different sources of inoculum and uses i s ratio and instantaneous methanogenic yield as design objectives in other words we lay down a theoretical framework to design an optimal digester combination that gives the desired stability parameters i s ratio or instantaneous methanogenic yield based on the concept of attainable regions it is important for readers to note that the attainable region is unique for given reaction kinetics model structure and or parameter values and anaerobic biodegradation kinetics depends on the inhibitory conditions or type of organic substrate in the digester all inhibitory conditions in anaerobic digesters will often upset the balance between acid forming and methane producing microorganisms resulting in accumulation of volatile acids chen et al 2014 different inhibitory conditions and or substrates will result in different kinetic behaviour of volatile acids on methanogenic archae and some of the published inhibitory patterns include competitive non competitive uncompetitive linear or exponential kinetic behaviors kythreotou et al 2014 hence by using attainable regions we can understand how the performance of the digester concentration of methanogens can be enhanced under higher concentration of volatile acids using digester structures as opposed to single digesters the determination of performance targets for anaerobic digestion of different organic substrates has been investigated extensively in the past using either experimental methods such as the biomethane potential test and spectroscopy or theoretical methods based on chemical composition chemical oxygen demand or elemental composition jingura and kamusoko 2017 however these approaches are limited to only methane yield and gives no information about the other states and hence cannot predict exact cause of process failure or inhibition in addition it provides no information with respect to the digester design required to achieve a defined target this paper discusses how the attainable region concept can be used as a technique to define performance targets under different inhibitory conditions as well as model anaerobic digester configurations to optimize process stability 2 process modeling and model identification 2 1 state dynamic model of anaerobic treatment process for synthesis of low rate anaerobic digesters using attainable regions simplified models are considered most appropriate as the geometric and hydrodynamic analysis are relatively more complex the attainable region ar technique is suitable for use because it can solve problems not because of multiple reactors but because of multiple reactions such as the biological reactions in anaerobic digestion involving complex metabolic pathways however for practicality the authors have applied 2 stage lumped reaction models focusing on acid producing bacteria and methanogenic archae to make the problem more tractable our subsequent studies will seek to consider more complex parallel and series reaction set to align more closely with the biochemical pathways i e series of rate equations for hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and parallel reactions for acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the modified hill model finn et al 2013 which was developed for anaerobic digestion of animal manure diary poultry beef and swine wastes has been selected for this study the model presents a compromise between the overly simplistic models capable of predicting only gas production and sometimes substrate consumption and simplistic models such as the am2 bernard et al 2001 that include a hydrolysis step alkalinity cation concentration dissolved carbon dioxide and ammonia these effects are lumped into and become part of the biodegradability constant bo and acidity factor af present in the modified hill model finn et al 2013 the species conservation equations for the modified hills model are presented as follows a total biodegradable volatile solids s 1 in the liquid phase of the bioreactor 1 d s 1 d t s 1 i n s 1 d k 1 μ 1 x 1 b volatile fatty acids s 2

eq 6 and acidity a f eq 7 b o measures the ease with which the organic substrate can be broken down and stabilized by anaerobic bacteria while a f of a substrate can be defined as the amount of volatile fatty acids contained in the substrate per unit mass of biodegradable volatile solids 6 s 1 i n b 0 s i n 7 s 2 i n a f s 1 i n the anaerobic biodegradability can be computed via eq 8 while the acidity factor is computed using eq 19 8 b 0 g v s d e s t r o y e d g v s a d d e d a s h r t 9 a f v f a i n b 0 v s l the modified hill s model considers temperature dependence of the anaerobic treatment process through an empirical model eq 10 and since the death rates are set to one tenth of the maximum reaction rates eq 11 they are also show temperature dependent 10 μ 1 m t μ 2 m t 0 012 t 0 086 11 k d 1 k d 2 0 1 μ 1 m 10 c t 60 c for the purpose of our study the model is adapted as follows the monod function used to describe the growth rates of acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms in the original model will be used only for acidogenic bacteria eq 12 the growth model for methanogenic archae will vary depending on the cases presented in table 1 12 μ 1 μ m 1 s 1 k s 1 s 1 in addition a new parameter known as the acidogenic fraction in inoculum ϑ is however included to characterize the inoculum the value of this parameter is lies in the range 0 ϑ 1 and is selected to give the best fit between model and experimental predictions 2 2 kinetic patterns of volatile acid inhibition anaerobic digestion involves the complex interaction of different groups of microorganisms but the methanogenic archae are known to be the most sensitive to inhibition chen et al 2008 as the volatile acid concentration is increased a maximum specific growth rate of methanogenic archae will be reached at a certain concentration a further increase of the substrate concentration results in a decrease of the specific growth rate the kinetic patterns for volatile acid inhibition have been based on modification of the monod model eq 13 for growth of methanogenic archae to include inhibition term 13 μ 2 μ m 2 s 2 k s 2 s 2 the effect of volatile acid on microbial inhibition in anaerobic digestion has generally been modeled through two main approaches the empirical approach which include a linear or exponential inhibition patterns and the enzyme kinetic approach which include a competitive non competitive and uncompetitive inhibition patterns both approaches are lumped into eq 14 by multiplying the monod model with a factor that describe the different inhibition patterns 14 μ 2 μ m 2 s 2 1 k i s 2 a k s 2 1 s 2 k i e s 2 1 s 2 k i d 1 s 2 k i c e k i s 2 b eq 14 presents a generalized modified monod model to describe volatile acid inhibition on methanogenic archae from which the different inhibition cases can be derived as shown in table 1 it should be noted that even though there exist other product inhibition models that have been used to model growth of anaerobic microorganisms we consider the most common ones to illustrate the effect of anaerobic digester conditions on the type of kinetic pattern used to describe the effect of volatile acids on methanogenic archae instead of predefining an inhibition pattern as practiced by modelers of anaerobic digestion the authors of this study present a framework for determining the inhibition patterns before using the model for digester synthesis since it is not feasible to measure the specific growth rate of both microbial populations during the anaerobic treatment process the strategy consist of using the kinetic models in a full dynamic model so that the kinetic constants can be estimated from easily measurable parameters such as volumetric biogas and total volatile fatty acid concentration 2 3 model identification in order to better illustrate the different kinetic patterns and how the patterns will change with characteristics of digestion substrate ad experiment using diary manure 1 7 ts mixed inoculum from different sources was selected for model identification zaher et al 2009 the experiments were conducted in continuously mixed batch reactors at 35 c further details on the experimental study can be obtained from the cited literature in order to identify the model parameters for the different kinetic cases the adjoint based gradient algorithm defined in fig 1 is implemented first the gradient algorithm fits the whole set of model parameters and assesses the variability of the fit using marginal and joint confidence regions of the model parameters second for parameters that show a high correlation one of them is kept constant and a readjustment of the uncorrelated set of parameters is performed using the algorithm this allows a more accurate adjustment of the whole set of model parameters to experimental data as illustrated in subsequent sections the advantage of this procedure is that parameter estimation and variability assessment is performed simultaneously which allows the user to better understand the model s sensitivity to different influences and obtain reliable estimates it is not the intention of this article to go into the mathematical formulations leading to a full description of the adjoint based gradient method for parameter estimation interested readers can find a detailed description of the procedure in the following literature benítez et al 2017 3 attainable region analysis 3 1 brief theoretical overview the ar theory is a technique for process synthesis and optimization which incorporates elements of geometry to understand how networks of chemical reactors can be designed and improved hildebrandt and glasser 1990 hildebrandt et al 1990 the attainable region is defined as the set of all possible output for all possible reactor designs that can be achieved by using the fundamental processes occurring within the system and that satisfies all the constraints placed by the system geometrically the attainable region represents the region bounded by the convex hull for the set of points achievable by the fundamental processes occurring in the system once the ar has been determined the limits of achievability by the system for the given kinetics and feed point is known and the boundary of the ar can then be used to answer different design or optimization questions related to the system ming et al 2016 the theory provides guidelines for construction of attainable regions as well as some necessary conditions to test the results the following requirements are necessary before an ar analysis can be performed glasser et al 1987 1993 choose the fundamental processes occurring in the system choose the state variables define the reaction scheme and process kinetics determine the geometry of the process units define the process conditions determine the objective of the optimization given a set of reactions and associated kinetics the following five key steps need to be performed in order to complete an attainable region analysis define the reaction dimension and feed set generate the ar using combinations of the fundamental processes interpret the ar boundary in terms of reactor equipment define the objective function and overlay this onto the ar to determine point of intersection with the ar boundary determine the specific reactor configuration required to achieve the intersection point some necessary conditions for ar can be summarized as follows the ar includes all feed points to the system the ar is convex no rate vectors point out of the ar boundary backward extension of rate vectors in the complement region do not intersect the ar the following section outlines the methodological flow for ar construction and application for process synthesis and optimization the framework involves five main steps ming et al 2016 3 1 1 step 1 preparation this involves definition of the reaction kinetics ar dimension state variables those used to represent the ar as well as the feed point used to generate the ar the feed point defines the initial value or the concentration of states fed into the reactor 3 1 2 step 2 ar construction this step generates the ar using a combination of pfr cstr and mixing for two dimensional ars or a combination of pfr cstr dsr differential side stream reactor and mixing for higher dimensional constructions this is the most difficult and time consuming step but also provides the most valuable information about the operating limits of the system ar construction typically begins by determining the pfr trajectory and cstr locus from the feed the pfr trajectory is the set of points generated by solving the steady state model of a pfr reactor a set of ordinary differential equations while the cstr locus is the set of points generated by solving the cstr model a set of nonlinear equations 3 1 3 step 3 boundary interpretation this step involves interpretation of the ar boundary into reactor structures based on the fundamental characteristics of the ar boundary the boundary of the ar is composed of reaction and mixing surfaces only reaction surfaces are always convex and the points that form convex sections of the ar boundary arise from effluent concentrations specifically from pfr trajectories for a two dimensional system points on the ar boundary that initiate these convex pfr trajectories arise from specialized cstrs while for a three dimensional system they arise from dsrs the convex hull of the set of points generated by all possible combinations of fundamental reactor types and mixing defines the attainable region 3 1 4 step 4 overlay objective function the objective function is modeled in terms of the variables used to represent the ar and then overlaid onto the ar the points of intersection between the objective function and the ar boundary represent the optimal points of operation 3 1 5 step 5 optimize since the entire boundary of the ar has been interpreted in terms of reactor structures step 3 the particular reactor structure required to achieve the optimal operating points point of intersection is known summarily starting from the feed point the procedure entails finding all possible achievable outputs for the system under consideration from the trajectory of the states of interest describing the system operation these trajectories are convexified to obtain candidate attainable regions which are tested against the necessary conditions and recursively updated so that any violated necessary conditions is eliminated the process continues until no other necessary conditions are violated otherwise a candidate ar subset of the true ar is obtained which can still provide better understanding of the achievable limits of the system it is not the intention of this article to present a detailed explanation of the ar theory interested readers can consult the above sited literature for a more in depth understanding 3 2 application of ar approach to maximize methanogenic activity 3 2 1 reaction scheme and process kinetics using the estimated kinetic constants a stoichiometric scheme of the bioreaction occurring in the anaerobic digester consist of two main reactions catalyzed by acid forming bacteria eq 15 and methane forming bacteria eq 16 15 k 1 s 1 r x 1 x 1 k 2 s 2 16 k 3 s 2 r x 2 x 2 k 4 c h 4 if we assume the specific death rate to be negligible compared to the specific growth rate of both microbial populations the rate expressions for the different reaction species is defined by eqs 17 20 17 r x 1 μ 1 x 1 18 r x 2 μ 2 x 2 19 r s 1 k 1 μ 1 x 1 20 r s 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k 3 μ 2 x 2 3 3 fundamental processes various fundamental processes can occur within a system which for bioreactors may include mass transfer mixing bioreaction biodegradation bioconversion adsorption heat transfer etc the ar approach requires the fundamental processes taking place in the system be identified the following two main fundamental processes are identified to be associated with the anaerobic treatment process biodegradation and mixing the attainable region ar for the anaerobic treatment process therefore represents the set of all possible states that can be achieved by a combination the two fundamental processes biodegradation and mixing in ar theory mixing is performed by a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr while reaction biodegradation is achieved in a plug flow reactor pfr since the operation of both reactors respectively mimic the two fundamental processes at steady state operation the general mathematical representation of a cstr and pfr are given by eqs 21 and 22 respectively 21 c c f τ r c 22 d c d τ r c c is the state vector while r c is the reaction rate vector as shown by eqs 23 and 24 respectively 23 c x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 t 24 r c r x 1 r x 2 r s 1 r s 2 t solving the cstr system to obtain the roots at a given feed point c f and for different residence times τ i f o r i 1 t o n results in a set of points referred to as a cstr locus in the same way integrating the pfr system for a given feed point and residence time results in a set of points referred to as pfr trajectory 3 3 1 dimensionality analysis and model reduction the reaction stoichiometry of the system can be used to determine the dimension of the system the dimension of the ar is determined from the number of independent reactions occurring in the reactor system which defines the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace the rank of the stoichiometric coefficient matrix a in which the ar must reside since there are two independent reactions occurring in the system the set of points generated by the anaerobic treatment process must reside in a two dimensional subspace in r 5 ming et al 2016 before constructing the ar the space wherein the ar must reside by choosing unique species components in the reactions that will represent the ar must first be determined methanogenesis has been known to be the most sensitive step of the anaerobic treatment process and since the volatile fatty acids and methanogenic microorganisms are the key player in this stage it is sensible to generate the candidate ar in s 2 x 2 space which provides information required to maximize gas production as well as process stability however even if only a subset of the states is used to construct the ar candidate ar it can still be transformed in terms of the other variables if required ming et al 2016 the reduced state and reaction rate vectors are therefore presented by eqs 25 and 26 25 c s 2 x 2 t 26 r c r s 2 r x 2 t this reduction in the dimensions of the state and rate vectors is possible because the reaction rate of biodegradable volatile solids r s 1 can be expressed in terms the reaction rate of acidogenic bacteria r x 1 which can in turn be expressed as functions of reaction rates of volatile acids r s 2 and methanogenic archae r x 2 as shown by eqs 27 and 28 27 r s 1 k 1 r x 1 28 r x 1 1 k 2 r s 2 k 3 r x 2 this implies that s 1 can be expressed in terms of x 1 which can in turn be expressed as a function of s 2 and x 2 illustrated by eqs 29 and 30 notice the presence of two new terms in eqs 29 and 30 x 1 i n and x 2 i n which represent the respective feed concentrations of acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archea these terms are absent in eqs 1 5 because the material balance assumes that the concentration of anaerobic microbes in the feed is negligible compared to that inside the digester finn et al 2013 hill 1983 so in eqs 29 and 30 x 1 x 1 i n x 1 and x 2 x 2 i n x 2 29 s 1 s 1 i n k 1 x 1 x 1 i n 30 x 1 x 1 i n 1 k 2 s 2 s 2 i n k 3 x 2 x 2 i n the model reduction assumes that the specific death rates of acidogens and methanogens is negligible compared to their respective specific growth rates 3 3 2 ar construction after stating the process kinetics the ar construction process is initiated by defining feed point and process conditions that influence the system in this study three anaerobic digestion batches diary manure diary manure granular sludge and diary manure lagoon inoculum were considered each with respective feed concentrations c f s 2 f x 2 f t of 1 89 0 84 t 1 89 0 84 t and 1 62 1 53 t the controlled process condition was mainly temperature which was maintained at a constant value of 35 c throughout retention time using the specified feed kinetics and temperature conditions the set of points generated by solving the pfr equation are called the pfr trajectory and those generated by solving the cstr equation are called the cstr locus the convex hull for the set of points generated by all possible combinations of cstr pfr and mixing defines the ar the attainable region is unique for a given kinetics and feed point and process conditions a change in any of these may result in a change in the ar and hence the operating limits of the system 3 4 objective function for optimizing microbial activity since the methanogens are most susceptible to process instabilities we are interested in determining the optimal operating point that ensures stability of methanogenic microorganisms for doing this we define two objective functions which translate the stability of methanogenic archae the inoculum to substrate i s ratio and the instantaneous yield of methanogens from volatile acids the inoculum to substrate ratio describes the concentration of volatile acids that should be maintained in the digester for optimal activity methanogenic archae studies have reported the optimal tolerance range of volatile acids above which the methanogens experience inhibition or toxicity chen et al 2008 the instantaneous yield is defined as the rate of formation of the desired product methanogens divided by the rate of consumtption of the reactant volatile acids the inoculum to substrate ratio i s was modeled using eq 31 while the instantaneous yield of methanogenic archae υ x 2 from volatile acids was modeled by eq 32 31 i s x 2 s 2 32 υ x 2 r x 2 r s 2 μ 2 x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k 3 μ 2 x 2 eqs 31 and 32 can be rearranged to express x 2 as a function of s 2 presented by eqs 33 and 34 respectively it should be noted that the term μ 1 x 1 in eq 34 contains x 2 and the numerical computations additionally made use of eqs 29 and 30 33 x 2 s 2 i s s 2 34 x 2 s 2 υ x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 μ 2 s 2 υ x 2 k 3 1 eqs 33 and 34 can seperately be plotted over the ar boundary as contours to determine the intersection with the boundary sections of the objective function that intersect the ar are optimal points relative to the i s ratio or υ x 2 specified the points of intersection can be interpreted in terms of digester networks depending on the manner in which the ar is constructed ming et al 2016 and the reactor structure corresponding to the i s ratio or υ x 2 of interest is the optimal reactor structure 4 results and discussion 4 1 model fits and estimate of kinetic constants we have explored the capabilities of the different biokinetic models to describe the degradation of organic substrate in the anaerobic digestion process experimental results for three anaerobic digestion batches of diary manure each under different process conditions were considered zaher et al 2009 in batch 1 no external inoculum was added during start up of the digester in batch 2 granular sludge is added into the digester as inoculum while in batch 3 sludge from a lagoon was used as the inoculum fig 2 presents the fitting results for all the 5 biokinetic models with experimental measurements of volatile fatty acids and methane flow rate obtained from batch 1 from the fitting results it can be concluded that the models give a good prediction of the experimental data however the competitive model shows the smallest sse see table 2 and can thus be considered to more closely represent the experimental data hence anaerobic digestion of diary manure with no external inoculum leads to methanogenic inhibition described as being competitive similar fittings were performed for batches 2 and 3 which was observed that the linear model more closely represented the experimental data for both cases figs 3 and 4 present the fitting for the linear model with experimental measurements of volatile acid and methane flow rate obtained from batches 2 and 3 table 2 presents the parameter estimates for all the fitting cases even though batches 1 and two fit well with the linear model the kinetic constants are different and we can thus conclude that inhibition characteristics exerted by volatile acids on methanogenic archae differs based on the conditions in the anaerobic digester this kinetic behaviour of methanogenic archae might be explained in this way the growth kinectis of microorganisms widely depends on nutritional availability as well as operational and environmental conditions which in turn vary for different digester worts the different sources of inoculum results in different wort characteristics which can be measured in terms of nutritional differences presence of different toxicants or other competitive microorganisms in the digester thereby varying the kinetic behaviour of the methanogens the findings of the current study are consistent with those of yang et al ref who studied the effect of temperature and substrate characteristics on kinetic behaviour of anaerobic digestion process the authors considered four different substrates swine wastewater palm oil mill wastewater protein production wastewater synthetic wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater five temperature regimes 10 c 15 c 20 c 25 c 30 c and four kinetic models modified stover kincannon chen and hashimoto deng and modified deng were tested it was observed that changes in substrate and temperature as well as a combination of thereof resulted in different fitting characteristics of the different kinetic models this effect of substrate and operating conditions on the kinetic behaviour of the anaerobic treatment process has very important implications in the concept of attainable regions this is because the attainable region is unique for a given kinetics ming et al 2016 and a change in kinetics therefore results in a change in the limits of achievability by the system what this implies practically is that the reactor structures required to achieve the optimal operating point will differ for each digested substrate which paves the way to use the concept of attainable regions to solve operational challenges for different types of wastewaters in addition the study uses the adjoint method for computing gradient of the parameter estimation objective function before using the conjugate gradient method for model calibration gradient based methods are widely used for calibration of anaerobic digestion models donoso bravo et al 2011 with gradients mostly computed using the finite difference method the adjoint method presents an alternative approach for computing gradients other model calibration methods that have been applied to anaerobic digestion models include the asymptotic state observers lópez and borzacconi 2009 simplex algorithm zaher et al 2009 genetic algorithm combined with the gradient descent method martinez et al 2012 etc even though we have presented the kinetic analysis of anaerobic digestion process using the adjoint based gradient method the emphasis of this paper is not necessarily on the fitting performance of the different biokinetic models but on how we use the models to develop new policies for operation of anaerobic digesters to ensure stability of methanogenic archae 4 2 effects of process kinetics on optimal reactor configuration 4 2 1 attainable regions limits of achievability by the system fig 5 presents the pfr trajectory and cstr locus dubed base trajectories for the anaerobic digestion process in batch 1 while fig 6 presents the two dimensional candidate ar obained from the based trajectories using the specified feed and kinetics employing a cstr gives a maximum attainable methanogenic concentration of 5 01gme l fig 5 a pfr however improves upon this concentration to an attainable value of 24 09gme l at this point the reader can already notice that by using an anaerobic pfr as opposed to a cstr the concentration of methangoneic archae in the biodigester increases by approximately 5 times it can be observed from fig 6 that constructing the attainable region further extends the concentration of methanogenic archae to 37 51 gme l this increase in the concentration of methanogenic archae for the same feed and kinetics is attributed to the fact that a systematic manipulation of the fundamental processs mixing and reaction in this case occurring in a system serves to expand the states that can be achieved by a system which is one of the key strengths of the attainable region theory if more fundamental processes are considered e g seperation the limits of achievabtily by the states of the system can be further improved fig 7 presents the base trajectories for the anaerobic digestion process in batch 2 while fig 8 presents the candidate ar recall that the ar is specific for a given kinetics which explains why the nature of ar for batch 2 is different from that in batch 1 we oberve from the base trajectories that using a cstr will result in higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids in the digester an indication of process instability while a pfr presents a maximum limit of volatile acid concentration that can be attained unlike the case of batch 1 constructing the ar doesn t serve to increase the maximum concentration of methanogenic archae attained compared to the that attained with the base trajectories however in this case the ar analysis shows that higher concentrations of methanogenic arhae can be attained at higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids by running a pfr from a cstr and a bypass valve from feed see mixing line ab on fig 8 practically this implies that using a digester network as opposed to a single digester results in an increased stability of the methananogenic archae fig 9 presents the base trajectories for the anaerobic digestion process in batch 3 while fig 10 presents the candidate ar similar to the case of batch 2 constructing the ar doesn t serve to increase the maximum concentration of methanogenic archae attained but concentrations of methanogenic archae origninally not attainable at higher concentrations of volatile acids now become attainable by using a digester structure indicated by line bc of fig 10 even though we have observed a change in the nature of attainable region for the different kinetics the boundary of ars however have a simple fundamental structure irrespective of the kinetics used this boundary is composed entirely of mixing surfaces straight lines and manifolds convex reaction surfaces ming et al 2016 the points that form the convex reaction surfaces arise from effluent concentrations of the pfr trajectories which are initiated by points from specialized cstrs we will now illustrate how interpret the ar boundary into anaerobic digester strucures by using the fundamental characteristics of the ar boundary the illustration will be done by using the ar for batch 1 presented in fig 6 in fig 6 the point b is the feed point while the region defined by abc is the ar the convex segment ba are trajectories obtained by running pfr from points on cstr locus the point a is therefore obtained by running a cstr from point b followed by a pfr from cstr while the point c is obtained by running a cstr from feed point b the lines ac and bc are the mixing surfaces while ab is the reaction surface concentrations along the line ac c a c can be obtained by mixing points a and c eq 35 the lever arm rule and the digester structure is therefore given by a cstr pfr point a run in parallel with a cstr point c and both contents mixed at the end concentrations on the line bc c b c can be obtained by mixing points b and c eq 36 and the required digester structure is given by a cstr point c with a bypass from feed point b similar digester interpretations were made for batches 2 and 3 as displayed on figs 8 and 10 35 c a c α c a 1 α c c 0 α 1 36 c b c α c b 1 α c c 0 α 1 where α is known as the mixing ratio the results obtained imply practically that a systematic scheduling of the fundamental processes of mixing and reaction occurring in the anaerobic digester can result in an increased stability of methanogenic archae it is interesting to note that for a two dimensional attainable region when mixing and reaction are the only fundamental processes occurring in a system the ar may be constructed by a combination of reactors involving pfrs cstrs and mixing only ming et al 2016 what this means is that there is no need to devise new or perhaps novel types of digesters with the aim of extending the limits of achievability by the system instead it is required to focus attention on optiimally arranging combinations of these two fundamental digester types or researching more fundamental processes to the system table 3 presents a summary of the performance characteristics of limits of achievability of the three batches of anaerobic digestion the limits of achievability by the systems have been measured quantitatively in terms of the area of the convex hull note that the ar is defined by the convex hull of the set of points states generated by the fundamental processes occurring within the system the convex hull represents the smallest subset of a set of points that can be used to generate all other points by reaction and mixing geometrically a convex hull is a finite convex polytope enclosed by a finite number of hyperplanes which is interpreted in a two dimensional space as the smallest polygon enclosed by planar facets such that all of the elements lie on or in the interior of the polygon asiedu et al 2015 from the results in table 3 the following two conclusions can be made 1 the ar analysis serves to improve the peformance of the system measured in thems of states attained by the concenertation of methanogenic archae for all the three batches 2 we observe that the increase in peformance differs for each batch of anaerobic digestion this is because a change in digester characterisitics source of innoculum results in a change in kinetics and the ability of the ar to improve the peformance of the system depends on the process kinetics we can conclude that even if all the necessary conditions of the ar are not met the candidate otherwise true ar still serves to improve the limits of achievabilitity by the system in the next section we will present how the ar has been used to answer few design questions on the anaerobic digesters 4 2 2 digester structures for optimal methanogenic activity the optimal digester structures for the different batches of anaerobic digestion have been obtained from the point of intersection between the objective function and boundary of the ar fig 11 shows a number of contour lines for i s ratio and the instantaneous methanogenic yield for batch 1 recall that in the case of batch one the competitive inhibition model was selected for use in modeling the digester configuration using attainable regions so for optimizing the instantaneous yield we substitute μ 2 s 2 corresponding to competitive inhibition model see table 1 into eq 34 to obtain objective function for competitive model eq 37 since the term μ 1 x 1 in eq 37 contains x 2 the numerical computations additionally made use of eqs 29 and 30 in order to overlay eq 37 onto the ar boundary constructed in the s 2 x 2 space 37 x 2 υ x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k s 2 1 s 2 k i s 2 μ m 2 s 2 υ x 2 k 3 1 observe that the two objective functions intersect the ar boundary at several points the i s ratio becomes smaller while the instantaneous methanogenic yield becomes larger as we move toward the horizontal line x 2 0 this suggests that for a given concentration of methanogens in the digester higher i s ratio corresponds to lower concentration of volatile acids while the instantaneous methanogenic yield corresponds to higher concentration of volatile acids fig 12 shows a number of contour lines for i s ratio and instantaneous yield for batch 2 in the case of batch 2 the linear inhibition model was selected to describe the anaerobic digestion kinetics so for optimizing the instantaneous yield we substitute μ 2 s 2 corresponding to linear inhibition model see table 1 into eq 36 to obtain objective function for the linear inhibition model eq 38 as in the case for batch 1 38 x 2 υ x 2 k 2 μ 1 x 1 k s 2 s 2 μ m 2 s 2 1 k i s 2 υ x 2 k 3 1 similarly to the case of batch 1 the two objective functions intersect the ar boundary at several points and the i s ratio becomes smaller w as we move toward the horizontal line x 2 0 however contrarily to batch 1 the instantaneous methanogenic yield becomes smaller as we move toward the horizontal line x 2 0 this suggests that for a given concentration of methanogens in the digester higher i s ratio and higher instantaneous methanogenic yields corresponds to lower concentration of volatile acids a possible explanation for the reversal of trend observed in instantaneous methanogenic yield can be attributed to the fact that the range of concentrations of volatile acids attained in batch 2 fall within the inhibitory range there by causing inhibition to the growth of methanogenic archae another possible explanation could be that the granular sludge used as inoculum for batch 2 is less adapted to higher concentrations of volatile acids and studies have confirmed that acclimation or adaptation of methanogens greatly influence their ability to withstand higher concentrations of inhibitory substances asiedu et al 2015 chen et al 2008 2014 fig 13 shows a number of contour lines for i s ratio and instantaneous yield for batch 3 contrarily to batches 1 and 2 for some concentrations of methanogenic archae in the digester certain values of instantaneous methanogenic yield correspond to two different concentrations of volatile acids within the limits of achievability by the system multiple points of intersection between objective functions and boundary of the attainable region is an indication of multiple operating points multiple optima for the system if the only criteria for design is the i s ratio and the instantaneous methanogenic yield then the optimal digester structure to achieve a given i s ratio or instantaneous methanogenic yield can be seelected from any of the intersection points however points corresponding to lower concentrations of methanogenic yield points associated with the lower part of the ar are preferable since the growth rate of these microbial population is about 5 times slower that of acidogens henze et al 2008 hence making it difficult to maitain higher concentrations in the digester unless a seperation system is included it is interesting to compare the results of this study with that of abunde et al abunde neba et al 2019 who used attainable regions to compare the limits of achievability of five different digested substrates using volumetric methane productivity and waste stabilization as objective functions the authors concluded that a change in the type of digested substrate results in a change in the limits of ahievability as well as the optimized ar parameter of an anaerobic digestion system in this study the results have demonstrated that for the same digested substrate diary manure different sourcess of inoculum will result in different limits of achievability by system and hence the optimal digester structure using i s ratio and instantaneous methanogenic yield as objective functions the results have shown that using digester structues as opposed to single digesters can improve the viability of methanogenic archae at higher concentrations of volatile fatty and for an anaerobic digestion system a change in digested subtrate and or source of innoculum results in a change in the limits of achievabilty by the system this study therefore lays down the theoretical framework for using attainable regions to define the anaerobic digetion performance targets for a given innoculum and or substrate characteristics therefore unlike the bmp assay and the buxuells technique for defining performance targets limits of achievability the ar approach does not only provide information about the limits of achievabily but it provides the optimal digester structures required to achieve a given target in our previous study abunde neba et al 2019 we considered measurable outputs from the digester volumetric methane productivity and waste stabilization as objectives while the current study we considered parameters directly linked to microbial stability i s ratio and instantaneous methanogenic yield as objectives the combination of results suggest that the ar can be used to answer any design and optimization questions this is possible because for a defined kinetics model structure and or kinetic coefficients the ar is fixed for a given feed point and multiple objective functions and hence multiple optimizations may be formed using a single ar in other words the attainable region represents the solution to several different optimization problems implying several optimization scenarios can be performed without any requirement to perform further optimizations or reconstruct the attainable region when the objective function is changed therefore the design approach presented in this study can be used to optimize any process and design parameter of the anaerobic treatment processes 5 conclusion returning to the problems posed at the beginning of this study it is now possible to state that the use of digester structues as opposed to single digesters can improve process stability and performance for a given concentration of volatile acids in an anaerobic digester higher concentrations of methanogenic archae can be attained using a digester structure network as opposed to single digester this study has shown that a for a given digested substrate a change in the source of innoculum results in a change in the limits of achievabilty by the system and hence the optimal digester structures required to achieve a given objective another major finding was that the attainable region technique can be used as reliable alternatives to the bmp assay and the buxuells technique for defining performance targets limits of achievability because the ar approach does not only provide information about the limits of achievabily but it provides the optimal digester structures required to achieve a given target the design technique presented in this study can be used to answer any design and optimization questions regarding the anaerobic treatment process this concept has been proven by formulating and solving two optimization problems to obtain optimal structures for anaerobic digesters to achieve a given inoculum to substrate ratio as well as instantaneous methanogenic yield the evidence from this study suggests that the technique of using digester structures presents a break through in the application of low rate anaerobic digesters as it can be used to improve upon the process dynamics the current findings add to a growing body of literature on the application of attainable regions for solving operational challenges in processs engineering these findings enhance our understanding of that a systematic manipulation of the fundamental processes mixing and reaction in this case occurring in a system serves to expand the states that can be achieved by a system which is one of the key strengths of the attainable region theory it is highly interesting for readers to note the geometric optimization technique presented in this study can also be to optimize operation of other wastewater treatment processes e g activated sludge treatment coagulation etc the technique is suitable not because of multiple reactors but because of multiple reactions in a process in order to subject the operational technique to actual experimental verification pilot scale studies are currently under design in the mean time interested researchers could consider using economic indicators such as net present value internal rate of returns benefit cost ratio or payback period as objective function for attainable region optimization which would present a key motivation for investors further theoretical study is needed to account for the effect of temperature regimes pychrophillic mesophillic and thermophillic on the limits of avhievabilit by the system in this study the anaerobic digester networks have been staged two stage biochemical kinetics in which acid forming stage is physically separated from the methane gas forming stage other studies could consider applying thermodynamic staging techniques where digester networks are designed based on different temperature regimes in order to take advantage of the higher stability of the

18617,zero valent iron zvi activating peroxydisulfate pds was demonstrated to be effective in improving the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge ads however details of how zvi pds enhances the dewaterability remain largely unknown this work therefore aims to reveal the facts of what happen in zvi pds involved ads systems experimental results showed that zvi pds treatment remarkably improved the dewaterability of ads with the minimal normalized capillary suction time of 8 6 0 5 s l g vss being obtained at the dosages of 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds which was 42 5 of that in the control in this case 71 2 1 8 of water content press filtration was measured which was 16 9 lower than that determined in the control the mechanism investigations showed that zvi activating pds produced substantially reactive species i e so4 and oh and these strong oxidative radicals decreased surface negative charges of ads flocs caused disruption of extracellular polymeric substances eps and release of intracellular substances and changed the secondary structure of proteins additionally the products of zvi oxidation i e fe2 and fe3 were effective flocculants thus their generation benefited the coagulation of ads flocs through compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charges of sludge colloidal particles as a result the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability of ads were enhanced but the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads were decreased which were responsible for the improvement of dewaterability further analyses exhibited that the contributions of these major contributors were different and their contributions to the dewaterability improvement were in the order of so4 oh fe2 fe3 it was also found that zvi pds treatment enhanced the degradation of recalcitrant organics inactivation of the fecal coliforms and mitigation of the toxicity of heavy metals in the dewatered sludge which were beneficial to its land application graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron peroxydisulfate anaerobically digested sludge extracellular polymeric substance dewaterability 1 introduction the increasing amount of waste activated sludge was generated from activated sludge processing is one of the major challenges faced by wastewater treatment plants wwtps hua et al 2018 li et al 2016 2019 liu et al 2019b 2019c 2019a wei et al 2018 xu et al 2018a b 2019 annual production of sludge cake with moisture content of 80 exceeded 30 million tons in china in 2015 and was expected to reach 50 million tons by 2020 wang et al 2018a b the management of was consumes substantial costs which accounts for 30 60 of the total operation cost of a wwtp hua et al 2018 wang et al 2018a b therefore there is a strong economic incentive for water utilities to reduce was volume was is normally subjected to anaerobic digestion for sludge reduction and stabilization and energy recovery concurrently song et al 2016 this process is capable to reduce sludge volume stabilize organics fractions in sludge and produce biogas in the form of methane wang et al 2018a b after anaerobic digestion the anaerobically digested sludge ads needs to be dewatered before final disposal therefore intensive studies focusing on the enhancement of ads dewatering were conducted in the past various treatment methods such as physical chemical and biological methods were developed to improve ads dewaterability masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 wang et al 2018a b zhang et al 2017 among them advanced oxidation processes have attracted increasing interests due to its high performance this method is based on the in situ generation of strong oxidants for the oxidation of organic compounds to date hydroxyl radical oh based fenton ultrasonic fenton electro fenton techniques have been widely applied in sludge dewatering hua et al 2018 masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 pham et al 2010 recently a novel fenton like advanced oxidation process based on peroxydisulfate pds which is extensively used in numerous industrial processes such as bleaching agent disinfectant and oxidant in organic synthesis has attracted much attention liu et al 2019 wei et al 2016 weng and tsai 2016 yang et al 2019a sulfate radical so4 which is commonly produced via activating pds with transition metal has a greater oxidation capacity e0 2 65 3 1 v wider operative ph range and longer half life than oh yang et al 2019a in the past great efforts were made to activate pds to produce so4 for removing organic pollutants from

these applications song and his coworkers 2016b recently pointed out another new direction being an additive to pretreat ads for the enhancement of its dewaterability it was observed that when ads was pretreated with zero valent iron zvi 2 0 g g tss activating pds 0 5 g g tss the capillary suction time cst of ads decreased by approximately 90 they also observed that most of zvi used could be recycled by magnetic force this excellent attempt opens a new door for the application of zvi pds and provides an attractive technology for ads dewatering by simply adding certain amounts of zvi and pds into ads treatment unit simultaneously ads dewaterability could be improved largely despite the useful information details of how zvi pds treatment affects ads dewatering have not been illuminated so far it is known that sludge dewaterability is mainly related to physicochemical properties e g bound water content flocculability fractal dimension hydrophobicity and viscosity and eps characteristics of sludge hua et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 to date however it is unknown whether and how zvi pds treatment affects these properties of ads several intermediates such as so4 oh and dissolved iron i e fe2 and fe3 would be formed during the process of zvi activating pds song et al 2016 wei et al 2016 but their potential contributions to ads dewatering have not been differentiated as well besides the contents of recalcitrant organics pathogens and heavy metals in dewatered ads are closely relevant to its final disposal such as agricultural utilization it also remains unknown whether these characteristics of the dewatered ads are affected by zvi pds treatment based on the questions above this work aims to deeply understand how zvi pds treatment affects ads dewatering to obtain comprehensive information the normalized cst of ads treated by different dosages of zvi activated pds 0 0 5 g g tss was first compared then the mechanisms of how zvi pds improves ads dewatering were explored through analyzing the effect of zvi pds on the physiochemical properties relevant to sludge dewatering and the eps characteristics of ads flocs thirdly the effect of zvi pds treatment on the contents of recalcitrant organics fecal coliforms and heavy metals in dewatered ads was also evaluated finally the recycle of zvi used for activating pds was confirmed through a three cycle dewatering test to the best of our knowledge this is the first study revealing the relevant mechanism of zvi pds affecting ads dewaterability the findings achieved in this work not only provide insights into zvi pds based sludge dewatering process but also may guide engineers to develop effective strategies to better manipulate ads dewatering in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources

treatment fig 1 a exhibits the ads dewatering performance after being treated by different dosages of zvi activated pds for 1 h it was observed that zvi or pds treatment alone did not improve the dewaterability of ads for example when ads was treated by 2 g g tss zvi or 0 5 g g tss pds alone no significant variation p 0 05 was found in wcsc under both vacuum filtration and press filtration as compared with those in the control without any chemical addition fig 1b these results were in accordance with the report of zhou et al 2015 who found that the cst slightly reduced by 4 2 or 11 4 after was was treated by 4 g l pds or 15 g l zvi however when ads was treated by the combination of zvi with pds the dewaterability was largely improved in p0 1 group with an increase of zvi addition from 0 to 2 g g tss the normalized cst decreased from 21 5 0 5 to 13 8 0 8 s l g vss in p0 5 group the normalized cst decreased from 22 3 0 5 to 8 6 0 5 s l g vss with zvi addition increasing from 0 to 2 g g tss fig 1a it can be seen that the minimal normalized cst of 8 6 0 5 s l g vss was obtained at the dosages of 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds which was 42 5 of that in the control this result indicated that the optimal dewaterability was attained under this dose combination of zvi and pds therefore the control 2 g g tss zvi treated sludge 0 5 g g tss pds treated sludge and combination of 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds treated sludge were selected as representative samples for further dewatering by press filtration in the scenario of zvi pds treatment 71 2 1 8 of wcsc after press filtration was measured which was 16 9 lower than that determined in the control similar observation was also made on wcsc after vacuum filtration fig 1b through the complete phase of press filtration sludge cake with zvi pds treatment was more rigid than that without any treatment or with zvi or pds treatment fig s2 sem image further showed that the surface of sludge cake in the control after vacuum filtration was highly compact without large openings fig 2 after zvi pds treatment the surface of ads cake presented flake like and or block like structure and substantial channels and openings were found to be distributed on the surface which could act as a drainage for the outflow of water dai et al 2018 all the results demonstrated that the dewaterability of ads could be enhanced by zvi pds treatment the mechanisms of how zvi pds treatment affects the dewaterability of ads were excavated in the following text 3 2 effect of zvi pds treatment on physicochemical properties related to ads dewatering sludge dewatering performance is known to be closely relevant to some key physico chemical properties of sludge such as bound water floc size relative hydrophobicity and rheological property guo et al 2017 jin et al 2003 li and yang 2007 liu et al 2016 wilén et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 zhen et al 2012b thus the effect of zvi pds treatment on these physicochemical characteristics was first examined sludge water can be categorized into four types i e free water interstitial water surface water and hydration intracellular water among them bound water is usually thought as the sum of the latter three bound water as we know is difficult to be removed by mechanical force as this type of water is tightly bound to eps or other sludge components through adhesive forces and or chemical bonds cai et al 2018 fig 3a i exhibits the variation of bound water content in ads samples after different treatments it should be noted that the amount of bound water was calculated by the equation please see equation s 1 for details according to the literature guo et al 2017 and h used in the equation was acquired from differential scanning calorimetry measurement fig 3a ii it was found that the bound water content in ads treated by zvi pds was lower than that in ads without treatment or treated by zvi or pds alone for instance 1 85 0 06 g g tss of bound water was determined in the ads sample treated by 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds whereas the corresponding value was 2 45 0 07 g g tss in the control 2 40 0 10 g g tss in the 2 g g tss zvi treated sample and 2 65 0 10 g g tss in the 0 5 g g tss pds treated sample fig 3a i this result suggested that zvi pds treatment caused more interstitial water surface water or hydration water being transformed and released as free water than other treatments this indicated that more easily removable water was obtained in the zvi pds treated ads for subsequent mechanical dewatering process which was one reason for the increased ads dewaterability fig 3 b shows the changes in sludge particle size d0 5 and fractal dimension of ads samples after different treatments compared with the control or their individual treatments zvi pds treatment increased the floc size but decreased the fractal dimension of ads concretely the floc size and the fractal dimension were 40 12 1 60 μm and 2 20 0 01 in the control 43 2 1 50 μm and 2 19 0 01 in the zvi treated sample and 40 0 1 40 μm and 2 22 0 01 in the pds treated sample zvi pds treatment increased the floc size to 45 20 1 30 μm but decreased the fractal dimension to 2 17 0 01 it is documented that an increase of floc size reduces the exposure of sludge surface weakens the hydrophilicity of sludge and prevents the tiny ads particles from blocking filter medium and cake layer during filtration zhen et al 2012b while fractal dimension reflects the morphology of sludge flocs and reduction of fractal dimension indicates a decrease of compact and dense surface structure dai et al 2018 the results indicated that zvi pds treatment led to ads flocs larger and looser than their initial state contributing to the improvement of dewatering performance it was further observed that zvi pds treatment increased the relative hydrophobicity of ads from 63 4 1 3 70 5 1 97 fig 3c which showed a significant difference p 0 0045 0 05 sludge flocculability is known to be mainly affected by hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging wilén et al 2003 the enhancement of ads hydrophobicity could induce a decrease of water binding which thereby promotes the flocculability sludge viscosity indicating the deformation of flocs is another important parameter related to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016 it can be found that the relationship between shear rate and shear stress in all the ads samples was non liner fig 3d exhibiting a non newtonian behavior liu et al 2016 further investigations showed that the rheological behavior of these ads samples could be well fitted by the herschel bulkley model fig 3d which accorded with our previous publication li et al 2018 according to the calculations based on the model equation s 2 it can be seen that zvi pds treatment increased the value of n i e flow behavior index but decreased the value of k i e consistency of sludge obviously fig 3d an increase of n value indicates that the rheological behavior of the sludge tends to be a newtonian behavior xiao et al 2017 while a decrease of k value indicates a reduction of apparent viscosity xiao et al 2017 some researchers indicated that the decrease of apparent viscosity was mainly derived from the disassembly of sludge colloids which efficiently weakened the resistance of flow and compressive forces during dewatering yuan et al 2011 therefore the reduction of apparent viscosity suggested that the inner structure of ads colloids which was maintained principally by eps matrix was destroyed all these physicochemical properties in fig 3 were in accordance with the normalized cst and wcsc shown in fig 1 3 3 effect of zvi pds treatment on the eps of ads sludge flocs contain a number of microbes embedded in a matrix of eps which mainly derives from microbial metabolism lysis of microorganism or absorption of organics from wastewater sheng et al 2010 eps which commonly consist of several organic and inorganic components such as proteins polysaccharides humic substances lipids and nucleic acids li and yang 2007 sheng et al 2010 have a dynamic double layered structure i e lb eps and tb eps lb eps is diffused from tb eps while tb eps encompasses the sludge cells tightly li and yang 2007 as a pivotal structural material of microbial aggregates eps anchylose cells through complex interactions to form a vast net like structure with plentiful water that protects cells against dewatering and toxicant sheng et al 2010 the changes in surface charge spatial distribution composition and chemical structure of eps could affect sludge physicochemical properties basuvaraj et al 2015 hua et al 2018 jin et al 2003 li and yang 2007 hence the effect of zvi pds treatment on the eps properties was also explored fig 4 a displays the measured zeta potential of ads eps fractions after different treatments it can be seen that the zvi pds treatment increased the zeta potential of lb eps and tb eps to be specific zvi pds treatment increased zeta potential of lb eps and tb eps from 22 2 0 7 mv and 17 5 1 2 mv to 10 4 0 6 mv and 8 4 0 8 mv respectively it is documented that a decrease of negative charge indicates a decrement of electrostatic repulsive interactions which contributes to particle collision of sludge and improvement of sludge flocculability you et al 2017 it was noted that the normalized cst was negatively correlated with zeta potential of lb eps r 0 863 p 0 01 0 05 while no correlation was found between the normalized cst and zeta potential of tb eps p 0 1 this is possibly due to that lb eps which is located in the outer flocs have a greater influence on sludge flocculability than tb eps the increased zeta potential in lb and tb eps may be owing to the decreased content of eps fractions by zvi pds treatment fig 4b it is demonstrated that eps fractions contains plentiful anionic groups such as carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphoric acid groups q xu et al 2018a b thus the removal of these ingredients promoted the reduction of negative charge in eps fractions besides zvi pds treatment caused more dissolved fe ions into eps fractions than other treatments fig s3 this also contributed to elevating zeta potential of eps fractions by compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charge hua et al 2018 thus an alternative reason was that pds oxidation accelerated the corrosion of zvi which caused more dissolved fe releasing into eps layers leading to lower negative charge in zvi pds treated sample fig 4b shows that zvi pds treatment decreased doc concentration in lb eps and tb eps from 61 0 3 2 mg l to 37 3 3 1 mg l p 0 0007 0 05 and 100 2 4 3 mg l to 51 5 3 0 mg l p 0 00008 0 05 like doc the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in eps fractions were also found to be decreased in zvi pds treated ads fig 4c besides eem analysis further suggested that the amounts of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances decreased in both lb eps and tb eps extracted from the zvi pds treated ads fig s4 with the decrease of eps organics the doc in centrate liquor increased synchronously fig s5 all the results suggested that zvi pds treatment accelerated the breakdown of eps fractions it is known that lb eps spreads from the surface of sludge flocs to bulk solution and is able to bind plentiful water by their highly multihole structure with low density due to strong affinity between water molecule and organics in lb eps sheng et al 2010 the efficient disintegration of lb eps could induce the decrease of relative hydrophilicity and bound water content in lb eps while promoting flocculability zhen et al 2018 since tb eps is sited in the inner layer of sludge flocs and adhered to cell walls the collapse of tb eps decreases bound water in tb eps and also increases the potential of intracellular water release zhen et al 2018 the proteins and polysaccharides being the main composition of eps contain hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic functional groups which are in favor of water molecule attaching neyens et al 2004 previous studies showed that the decreases of proteins and polysaccharides in eps always indicated less stickiness lower hydrophily and better flocculability qian et al 2016 to acquire more information about the influence of zvi pds on changes in other organics in eps ftir was employed ftir spectra of eps fractions can be used to indicate six major organics i e hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids aromatic amino acids and nucleotides with their specific wavenumber or wavenumber range being listed in table s3 it was observed that zvi pds treatment increased the transmittance of all the characteristic peaks representing the functional groups of these six substances in both lb eps and tb eps fig 5 indicating that the contents of all these six organics in eps were decreased by zvi pds treatment it was also found that zvi pds treatment elevated the transmittance of these peaks of sludge pellets fig s6 while decreasing the content of intracellular substances fig s7 indicating that zvi pds treatment induced the release of intracellular substances the secondary structure of eps proteins played a crucial role in sludge hydrophobicity you et al 2017 which was closely relevant to sludge dewatering guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 to access more subtle differences in protein secondary structure second derivative spectra in amide ⅰ band 1700 1600 cm 1 from ftir spectra with or without zvi pds treatment were further analyzed the second derivative spectra were subsequently carried with curve fitting based on the known structure of peptide and protein models you et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 6 six peaks were separated at approximately 1700 1600 cm 1 with the descriptions and fitting results summarized in the bottom of this figure the fitting results exhibited that zvi pds treatment decreased the value of α helix β sheet random coil from 75 63 to 62 43 in lb eps and 65 20 63 88 in tb eps fig 6 it is reported that α helix is kept by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 wu et al 2017 β sheet has a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet while random coils show no definite structure victorovich et al 2013 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 you et al 2017 pointed out that the protein molecule presented a loose structure under a low ratio of α helix β sheet random coil the results indicated that zvi pds treatment broke the hydrogen bond keeping α helix structure of eps proteins leading to protein molecules loosely you et al 2017 therefore hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins are easily exposed which induces strong surface hydrophobicity these results were in consistence with the data of fractal dimension in fig 3b 3 4 what happens to zvi pds after being added in ads pds can decompose to form na and s2o8 2 at a controlled rate when it enters into hydrous media equation 1 when zvi is added into the system it could be corroded by s2o8 2 and o2 h2o to produce fe2 as activator equations 2 and 3 after that fe2 activates s2o8 2 to produce sulfate radical so4 accompanied with its oxidation to form fe3 equation 4 which could also induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh by radical interconversion reaction equation 5 these oxidative radicals are generally considered as the major intermediates of pds activation meanwhile partial fe3 could be converted into fe2 through reacting with reductive zvi equation 6 and this further increased the amount of direct activator for pds activation 1 na 2 s 2 o 8 2 na s 2 o 8 2 2 fe 0 0 5 o 2 h 2 o fe 2 2 oh 3 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 2 so 4 2 4 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 so 4 2 so 4 5 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h oh 6 2 fe 3 fe 0 3 fe 2 the hyperfine coupling constants a n 14 9 g a h 14 9 g all 0 5 g obtained by simulation are reported to be dmpo oh adducts while the hyperfine coupling constants a n 13 8 g a h 10 0 g a h 1 4 g a h 0 8 g all 0 05 g obtained by simulation are in line with dmpo so4 adducts liu et al 2019 song et al 2019 yang et al 2019a as shown in fig 7 a the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 in either zvi or pds added liquid were detected at negligible or low levels whereas their signals in zvi pds added sample were very obvious confirming substantial presence of so4 and oh in the zvi pds added system fig 7b further exhibits the contribution of radicals and dissolved fe to the enhanced dewaterability of ads it can be seen that all the so4 oh and fe2 fe3 benefited the dewaterability with their contribution being in the sequence of so4 oh fe2 fe3 previous work verified that oxidative so4 and oh could cause destructive damage to eps composition e g polysaccharides proteins and other biopolymers cell membrane and other cell components such as lipids dna rna and other biomacromolecules shi et al 2015 wei et al 2016 fe2 and fe3 were effective flocculants for sludge coagulation through compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charge of sludge colloidal particles based on the analyses above a three step mechanism i e so4 oh generation so4 oh oxidation and fe2 fe3 re flocculation is therefore proposed here to explain how zvi pds treatment improves ads dewaterability fig 8 in the first step so4 was produced by zvi activating pds then a portion of so4 was transformed to oh via radical interconversion reactions in the second step so4 oh oxidation enhanced the disruption of organic compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides in lb eps and tb eps fig 4 resulting in the decreases of bound water content fractal dimension and apparent viscosity but the increases of particle size and hydrophobicity fig 3 besides zvi pds treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond that maintains α helix structure of eps proteins which thereby caused protein molecules loosely fig 6 as a result the hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins were exposed easily strengthening the surface hydrophobicity of ads moreover zvi pds treatment promoted the release of intracellular materials figs s6 and s7 reducing intracellular water content as well in the third step fe2 and its oxidation product i e fe3 were effective flocculants thus their generation benefited the coagulation of ads flocs through compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charges of sludge colloidal particles 3 5 implications zvi pds based method is an effective approach to promote ads dewaterability however this is a recently developed method with little understanding of this process this work for the first time reveals the mechanisms of how zvi activated pds improves ads dewatering which provides insights into zvi pds based sludge dewatering process besides this zvi pds based method has important implications to the final disposal of ads currently landfill incineration land improvement and agricultural utilization are commonly used for sludge disposal dai et al 2019 according to the council directive 86 278 eec for sludge treatment land application such as agricultural utilization is considered the preferable method zou et al 2019 this is because sludge contains plentiful organics nutrients and microelements which could enhance soil fertility and water holding capacity for farmland zou et al 2019 however the presence of toxic and harmful contaminants e g pathogens refractory organics and heavy metals in sludge often limits its land application dai et al 2019 leng et al 2014 yu et al 2019 zou et al 2019 it was found from fig 9 a that zvi pds treatment greatly reduced the population of fecal coliform in the dewatered sludge with the number being below the class a requirement of the us standards for class a biosolids i e 3 log mpn g tss yu et al 2019 suggesting that this treatment has good capability in inactivating fecal coliform fig 9b and c showed that compared with the control zvi pds treatment decreased the humic acid content from 118 0 3 0 to 94 0 3 1 mg g tss while this treatment decreased the contents of bisphenol a estrone and 4 nonylphenols by 42 1 1 3 43 5 1 3 and 40 7 1 5 respectively this indicated that zvi pds treatment also reduced the refractory or toxic organic content in dewatered sludge table 2 shows that zvi pds treatment decreased the heavy metals in dewatered sludge while enhancing their solubilization to liquid phase a tclp test further showed that zvi pds treatment decreased the concentrations of these heavy metals in the leachate with the leaching toxicity of pb zn and cd being reduced by 100 69 and 50 respectively table 2 additionally it was found that zvi pds treatment decreased the toxicity of pb zn and cd but increased their stabilization in the dewatered sludge cake fig 10 after zvi pds treatment f1 fraction of pb zn and cd in the dewatered sludge cake decreased from 20 5 25 2 and 28 7 to 5 4 17 2 and 22 2 respectively on the contrary zvi pds treatment increased f4 fraction of pb zn and cd from 43 9 16 5 and 27 4 to 69 9 47 6 and 29 0 respectively this is probably due to that zvi pds treatment effectively enhanced the degradation of organic substances in ads liu 2018 xiong et al 2018 a quantitative risk evaluation conducted by risk assessment code rac based on the percentage of heavy metals in the f1 fraction further exhibited that zvi pds treatment reduced the risk of pb from medium risk to low risk fig 10 all the results demonstrated that zvi pds treatment achieved satisfactory stability of the dewatered sludge by disinfecting pathogens reducing refractory organics mitigating the toxicity of examined heavy metals which benefited its final disposal especially land application such as agricultural utilization it should be emphasized that this study mainly aimed to reveal the mechanism of how zvi pds enhances ads dewaterability thus technical optimization was not carried out for instance only two zvi dosages i e 1 and 2 g g tss two pds dosages i e 0 1 and 0 5 g g tss and one treatment time i e 1 h were tested in this work it was found that more than 95 of zvi could be recycled after each treatment and no significant variation p 0 05 was observed in dewatering performances in a three cycle dewatering test fig s8 suggesting that it is potential to recover and reuse the zvi added in the treatment however a comprehensive optimization research e g a mathematical model method or a response surface method is still needed in the future based on the optimization research scaling up this zvi pds treated method to pilot scale or full scale levels is also necessary in the future to further assess its technical and economic feasibilities under a real world situation 4 conclusion in this study zvi pds treatment significantly enhanced the ads dewaterability experimental results showed that the lowest normalized cst of 8 6 0 5 s l g vss was attained under 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds which was 42 5 of that in the control under this condition 71 2 1 8 of water content press filtration was determined which was 16 9 lower than that measured in the control the mechanism investigated showed that fe2 which was released from zvi corroded by s2o8 2 and h2o o2 activated s2o8 2 to produce radicals i e so4 and oh these powerful species decreased surface negative charges of ads flocs caused disintegration of eps and release of intracellular matter and changed the secondary structure of proteins in addition fe2 and its oxidation product i e fe3 facilitated the flocculation of ads flocs by compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charges of sludge colloids as a consequence the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability of ads were improved and the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads were decreased inducing the enhancement of ads dewaterability further analyses displayed that the contributions of these substances to the dewaterability improvement were in the order of so4 oh fe2 fe3 based on the above results a three step mechanism of zvi pds dewatering ads is proposed including so4 oh generation so4 oh oxidation and fe2 fe3 re flocculation finally it was found that zvi pds treatment inactivated the fecal coliforms degraded multiple recalcitrant organics and mitigated the toxicity of heavy metals in the dewatered sludge benefiting its agricultural utilization acknowledgements the authors were thankful for funds

18617,zero valent iron zvi activating peroxydisulfate pds was demonstrated to be effective in improving the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge ads however details of how zvi pds enhances the dewaterability remain largely unknown this work therefore aims to reveal the facts of what happen in zvi pds involved ads systems experimental results showed that zvi pds treatment remarkably improved the dewaterability of ads with the minimal normalized capillary suction time of 8 6 0 5 s l g vss being obtained at the dosages of 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds which was 42 5 of that in the control in this case 71 2 1 8 of water content press filtration was measured which was 16 9 lower than that determined in the control the mechanism investigations showed that zvi activating pds produced substantially reactive species i e so4 and oh and these strong oxidative radicals decreased surface negative charges of ads flocs caused disruption of extracellular polymeric substances eps and release of intracellular substances and changed the secondary structure of proteins additionally the products of zvi oxidation i e fe2 and fe3 were effective flocculants thus their generation benefited the coagulation of ads flocs through compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charges of sludge colloidal particles as a result the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability of ads were enhanced but the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads were decreased which were responsible for the improvement of dewaterability further analyses exhibited that the contributions of these major contributors were different and their contributions to the dewaterability improvement were in the order of so4 oh fe2 fe3 it was also found that zvi pds treatment enhanced the degradation of recalcitrant organics inactivation of the fecal coliforms and mitigation of the toxicity of heavy metals in the dewatered sludge which were beneficial to its land application graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron peroxydisulfate anaerobically digested sludge extracellular polymeric substance dewaterability 1 introduction the increasing amount of waste activated sludge was generated from activated sludge processing is one of the major challenges faced by wastewater treatment plants wwtps hua et al 2018 li et al 2016 2019 liu et al 2019b 2019c 2019a wei et al 2018 xu et al 2018a b 2019 annual production of sludge cake with moisture content of 80 exceeded 30 million tons in china in 2015 and was expected to reach 50 million tons by 2020 wang et al 2018a b the management of was consumes substantial costs which accounts for 30 60 of the total operation cost of a wwtp hua et al 2018 wang et al 2018a b therefore there is a strong economic incentive for water utilities to reduce was volume was is normally subjected to anaerobic digestion for sludge reduction and stabilization and energy recovery concurrently song et al 2016 this process is capable to reduce sludge volume stabilize organics fractions in sludge and produce biogas in the form of methane wang et al 2018a b after anaerobic digestion the anaerobically digested sludge ads needs to be dewatered before final disposal therefore intensive studies focusing on the enhancement of ads dewatering were conducted in the past various treatment methods such as physical chemical and biological methods were developed to improve ads dewaterability masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 na et al 2007 wang et al 2018a b zhang et al 2017 among them advanced oxidation processes have attracted increasing interests due to its high performance this method is based on the in situ generation of strong oxidants for the oxidation of organic compounds to date hydroxyl radical oh based fenton ultrasonic fenton electro fenton techniques have been widely applied in sludge dewatering hua et al 2018 masihi and badalians gholikandi 2018 pham et al 2010 recently a novel fenton like advanced oxidation process based on peroxydisulfate pds which is extensively used in numerous industrial processes such as bleaching agent disinfectant and oxidant in organic synthesis has attracted much attention liu et al 2019 wei et al 2016 weng and tsai 2016 yang et al 2019a sulfate radical so4 which is commonly produced via activating pds with transition metal has a greater oxidation capacity e0 2 65 3 1 v wider operative ph range and longer half life than oh yang et al 2019a in the past great efforts were made to activate pds to produce so4 for removing organic pollutants from wastewater e g pesticides residuals pharmaceuticals algal toxin dyes aromatics halogenated olefins and perfluorinated compounds matzek and carter 2016 wacławek et al 2017 yang et al 2019b apart from these applications song and his coworkers 2016b recently pointed out another new direction being an additive to pretreat ads for the enhancement of its dewaterability it was observed that when ads was pretreated with zero valent iron zvi 2 0 g g tss activating pds 0 5 g g tss the capillary suction time cst of ads decreased by approximately 90 they also observed that most of zvi used could be recycled by magnetic force this excellent attempt opens a new door for the application of zvi pds and provides an attractive technology for ads dewatering by simply adding certain amounts of zvi and pds into ads treatment unit simultaneously ads dewaterability could be improved largely despite the useful information details of how zvi pds treatment affects ads dewatering have not been illuminated so far it is known that sludge dewaterability is mainly related to physicochemical properties e g bound water content flocculability fractal dimension hydrophobicity and viscosity and eps characteristics of sludge hua et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 to date however it is unknown whether and how zvi pds treatment affects these properties of ads several intermediates such as so4 oh and dissolved iron i e fe2 and fe3 would be formed during the process of zvi activating pds song et al 2016 wei et al 2016 but their potential contributions to ads dewatering have not been differentiated as well besides the contents of recalcitrant organics pathogens and heavy metals in dewatered ads are closely relevant to its final disposal such as agricultural utilization it also remains unknown whether these characteristics of the dewatered ads are affected by zvi pds treatment based on the questions above this work aims to deeply understand how zvi pds treatment affects ads dewatering to obtain comprehensive information the normalized cst of ads treated by different dosages of zvi activated pds 0 0 5 g g tss was first compared then the mechanisms of how zvi pds improves ads dewatering were explored through analyzing the effect of zvi pds on the physiochemical properties relevant to sludge dewatering and the eps characteristics of ads flocs thirdly the effect of zvi pds treatment on the contents of recalcitrant organics fecal coliforms and heavy metals in dewatered ads was also evaluated finally the recycle of zvi used for activating pds was confirmed through a three cycle dewatering test to the best of our knowledge this is the first study revealing the relevant mechanism of zvi pds affecting ads dewaterability the findings achieved in this work not only provide insights into zvi pds based sludge dewatering process but also may guide engineers to develop effective strategies to better manipulate ads dewatering in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources

replicate beakers with a working volume of 600 ml each were utilized each beaker first received 500 ml ads then different dosages of zvi and pds were added into these beakers which were detailed in table 1 after addition each ads sample was homogenized with a mechanical stirrer 300 rpm for 1 h in a temperature controlled room 25 1 c after 1 h treatment 5 ml and 120 ml of mixtures were taken out from each beaker for measuring the normalized cst and wcsc vacuum filtration respectively the dewatering filtrate after vacuum filtration was measured for heavy metals in liquid phase the obtained

batch test was conducted in this test six replicate beakers with identical working volume 600 ml were performed and each received 500 ml ads among them one was set as the blank without addition of any chemical while the other five beakers received 2 g g tss zvi 0 5 g g tss pds 2 g g tss zvi 0 5 g g tss pds 0 1 m tert butanol tba 2 g g tss zvi 0 5 g g tss pds 0 1 m phenol 0 1 m tba or 0 1 m phenol

concentrations of heavy metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer icap 6300 thermo fisher scientific us moreover the chemical species of heavy metals were analyzed with the sequential extraction procedure proposed by community bureau of reference bcr leng et al 2014 this procedure was described in detail in supplementary information table s2 according to this procedure heavy metals could be divided into four fractions i e f1 f2 f3 and f4 which respectively represent the soluble and exchangeable fraction organic and sulfide bound fraction iron and manganese oxides bound fraction and residual fraction leng et al 2014 the chemical species distribution of heavy metals is utilized to evaluate their availability and mobility and the toxicity of different fractions is ranked as following f1 f2 f3 f4 liu 2018 f1 represents the direct toxicity of heavy metals the sum of f2 and f3 indicates the potential toxicity of heavy metals while heavy metals in f4 possess no toxicity xiong et al 2018 after sequential extraction procedure the concentrations of heavy metals were also measured by icap 6300 2 6 statistical analysis all the tests were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant pearson s correlation was conducted to investigate the relationship between sludge filterability and organic compounds in different fractions of eps with the software spss 22 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the ads dewatering performance by zvi pds treatment fig 1 a exhibits the ads dewatering performance after being treated by different dosages of zvi activated pds for 1 h it was observed that zvi or pds treatment alone did not improve the dewaterability of ads for example when ads was treated by 2 g g tss zvi or 0 5 g g tss pds alone no significant variation p 0 05 was found in wcsc under both vacuum filtration and press filtration as compared with those in the control without any chemical addition fig 1b these results were in accordance with the report of zhou et al 2015 who found that the cst slightly reduced by 4 2 or 11 4 after was was treated by 4 g l pds or 15 g l zvi however when ads was treated by the combination of zvi with pds the dewaterability was largely improved in p0 1 group with an increase of zvi addition from 0 to 2 g g tss the normalized cst decreased from 21 5 0 5 to 13 8 0 8 s l g vss in p0 5 group the normalized cst decreased from 22 3 0 5 to 8 6 0 5 s l g vss with zvi addition increasing from 0 to 2 g g tss fig 1a it can be seen that the minimal normalized cst of 8 6 0 5 s l g vss was obtained at the dosages of 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds which was 42 5 of that in the control this result indicated that the optimal dewaterability was attained under this dose combination of zvi and pds therefore the control 2 g g tss zvi treated sludge 0 5 g g tss pds treated sludge and combination of 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds treated sludge were selected as representative samples for further dewatering by press filtration in the scenario of zvi pds treatment 71 2 1 8 of wcsc after press filtration was measured which was 16 9 lower than that determined in the control similar observation was also made on wcsc after vacuum filtration fig 1b through the complete phase of press filtration sludge cake with zvi pds treatment was more rigid than that without any treatment or with zvi or pds treatment fig s2 sem image further showed that the surface of sludge cake in the control after vacuum filtration was highly compact without large openings fig 2 after zvi pds treatment the surface of ads cake presented flake like and or block like structure and substantial channels and openings were found to be distributed on the surface which could act as a drainage for the outflow of water dai et al 2018 all the results demonstrated that the dewaterability of ads could be enhanced by zvi pds treatment the mechanisms of how zvi pds treatment affects the dewaterability of ads were excavated in the following text 3 2 effect of zvi pds treatment on physicochemical properties related to ads dewatering sludge dewatering performance is known to be closely relevant to some key physico chemical properties of sludge such as bound water floc size relative hydrophobicity and rheological property guo et al 2017 jin et al 2003 li and yang 2007 liu et al 2016 wilén et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 zhen et al 2012b thus the effect of zvi pds treatment on these physicochemical characteristics was first examined sludge water can be categorized into four types i e free water interstitial water surface water and hydration intracellular water among them bound water is usually thought as the sum of the latter three bound water as we know is difficult to be removed by mechanical force as this type of water is tightly bound to eps or other sludge components through adhesive forces and or chemical bonds cai et al 2018 fig 3a i exhibits the variation of bound water content in ads samples after different treatments it should be noted that the amount of bound water was calculated by the equation please see equation s 1 for details according to the literature guo et al 2017 and h used in the equation was acquired from differential scanning calorimetry measurement fig 3a ii it was found that the bound water content in ads treated by zvi pds was lower than that in ads without treatment or treated by zvi or pds alone for instance 1 85 0 06 g g tss of bound water was determined in the ads sample treated by 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds whereas the corresponding value was 2 45 0 07 g g tss in the control 2 40 0 10 g g tss in the 2 g g tss zvi treated sample and 2 65 0 10 g g tss in the 0 5 g g tss pds treated sample fig 3a i this result suggested that zvi pds treatment caused more interstitial water surface water or hydration water being transformed and released as free water than other treatments this indicated that more easily removable water was obtained in the zvi pds treated ads for subsequent mechanical dewatering process which was one reason for the increased ads dewaterability fig 3 b shows the changes in sludge particle size d0 5 and fractal dimension of ads samples after different treatments compared with the control or their individual treatments zvi pds treatment increased the floc size but decreased the fractal dimension of ads concretely the floc size and the fractal dimension were 40 12 1 60 μm and 2 20 0 01 in the control 43 2 1 50 μm and 2 19 0 01 in the zvi treated sample and 40 0 1 40 μm and 2 22 0 01 in the pds treated sample zvi pds treatment increased the floc size to 45 20 1 30 μm but decreased the fractal dimension to 2 17 0 01 it is documented that an increase of floc size reduces the exposure of sludge surface weakens the hydrophilicity of sludge and prevents the tiny ads particles from blocking filter medium and cake layer during filtration zhen et al 2012b while fractal dimension reflects the morphology of sludge flocs and reduction of fractal dimension indicates a decrease of compact and dense surface structure dai et al 2018 the results indicated that zvi pds treatment led to ads flocs larger and looser than their initial state contributing to the improvement of dewatering performance it was further observed that zvi pds treatment increased the relative hydrophobicity of ads from 63 4 1 3 70 5 1 97 fig 3c which showed a significant difference p 0 0045 0 05 sludge flocculability is known to be mainly affected by hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions and polymer bridging wilén et al 2003 the enhancement of ads hydrophobicity could induce a decrease of water binding which thereby promotes the flocculability sludge viscosity indicating the deformation of flocs is another important parameter related to sludge dewaterability liu et al 2016 it can be found that the relationship between shear rate and shear stress in all the ads samples was non liner fig 3d exhibiting a non newtonian behavior liu et al 2016 further investigations showed that the rheological behavior of these ads samples could be well fitted by the herschel bulkley model fig 3d which accorded with our previous publication li et al 2018 according to the calculations based on the model equation s 2 it can be seen that zvi pds treatment increased the value of n i e flow behavior index but decreased the value of k i e consistency of sludge obviously fig 3d an increase of n value indicates that the rheological behavior of the sludge tends to be a newtonian behavior xiao et al 2017 while a decrease of k value indicates a reduction of apparent viscosity xiao et al 2017 some researchers indicated that the decrease of apparent viscosity was mainly derived from the disassembly of sludge colloids which efficiently weakened the resistance of flow and compressive forces during dewatering yuan et al 2011 therefore the reduction of apparent viscosity suggested that the inner structure of ads colloids which was maintained principally by eps matrix was destroyed all these physicochemical properties in fig 3 were in accordance with the normalized cst and wcsc shown in fig 1 3 3 effect of zvi pds treatment on the eps of ads sludge flocs contain a number of microbes embedded in a matrix of eps which mainly derives from microbial metabolism lysis of microorganism or absorption of organics from wastewater sheng et al 2010 eps which commonly consist of several organic and inorganic components such as proteins polysaccharides humic substances lipids and nucleic acids li and yang 2007 sheng et al 2010 have a dynamic double layered structure i e lb eps and tb eps lb eps is diffused from tb eps while tb eps encompasses the sludge cells tightly li and yang 2007 as a pivotal structural material of microbial aggregates eps anchylose cells through complex interactions to form a vast net like structure with plentiful water that protects cells against dewatering and toxicant sheng et al 2010 the changes in surface charge spatial distribution composition and chemical structure of eps could affect sludge physicochemical properties basuvaraj et al 2015 hua et al 2018 jin et al 2003 li and yang 2007 hence the effect of zvi pds treatment on the eps properties was also explored fig 4 a displays the measured zeta potential of ads eps fractions after different treatments it can be seen that the zvi pds treatment increased the zeta potential of lb eps and tb eps to be specific zvi pds treatment increased zeta potential of lb eps and tb eps from 22 2 0 7 mv and 17 5 1 2 mv to 10 4 0 6 mv and 8 4 0 8 mv respectively it is documented that a decrease of negative charge indicates a decrement of electrostatic repulsive interactions which contributes to particle collision of sludge and improvement of sludge flocculability you et al 2017 it was noted that the normalized cst was negatively correlated with zeta potential of lb eps r 0 863 p 0 01 0 05 while no correlation was found between the normalized cst and zeta potential of tb eps p 0 1 this is possibly due to that lb eps which is located in the outer flocs have a greater influence on sludge flocculability than tb eps the increased zeta potential in lb and tb eps may be owing to the decreased content of eps fractions by zvi pds treatment fig 4b it is demonstrated that eps fractions contains plentiful anionic groups such as carboxyl groups amino groups and phosphoric acid groups q xu et al 2018a b thus the removal of these ingredients promoted the reduction of negative charge in eps fractions besides zvi pds treatment caused more dissolved fe ions into eps fractions than other treatments fig s3 this also contributed to elevating zeta potential of eps fractions by compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charge hua et al 2018 thus an alternative reason was that pds oxidation accelerated the corrosion of zvi which caused more dissolved fe releasing into eps layers leading to lower negative charge in zvi pds treated sample fig 4b shows that zvi pds treatment decreased doc concentration in lb eps and tb eps from 61 0 3 2 mg l to 37 3 3 1 mg l p 0 0007 0 05 and 100 2 4 3 mg l to 51 5 3 0 mg l p 0 00008 0 05 like doc the concentrations of proteins and polysaccharides in eps fractions were also found to be decreased in zvi pds treated ads fig 4c besides eem analysis further suggested that the amounts of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances decreased in both lb eps and tb eps extracted from the zvi pds treated ads fig s4 with the decrease of eps organics the doc in centrate liquor increased synchronously fig s5 all the results suggested that zvi pds treatment accelerated the breakdown of eps fractions it is known that lb eps spreads from the surface of sludge flocs to bulk solution and is able to bind plentiful water by their highly multihole structure with low density due to strong affinity between water molecule and organics in lb eps sheng et al 2010 the efficient disintegration of lb eps could induce the decrease of relative hydrophilicity and bound water content in lb eps while promoting flocculability zhen et al 2018 since tb eps is sited in the inner layer of sludge flocs and adhered to cell walls the collapse of tb eps decreases bound water in tb eps and also increases the potential of intracellular water release zhen et al 2018 the proteins and polysaccharides being the main composition of eps contain hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic functional groups which are in favor of water molecule attaching neyens et al 2004 previous studies showed that the decreases of proteins and polysaccharides in eps always indicated less stickiness lower hydrophily and better flocculability qian et al 2016 to acquire more information about the influence of zvi pds on changes in other organics in eps ftir was employed ftir spectra of eps fractions can be used to indicate six major organics i e hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids aromatic amino acids and nucleotides with their specific wavenumber or wavenumber range being listed in table s3 it was observed that zvi pds treatment increased the transmittance of all the characteristic peaks representing the functional groups of these six substances in both lb eps and tb eps fig 5 indicating that the contents of all these six organics in eps were decreased by zvi pds treatment it was also found that zvi pds treatment elevated the transmittance of these peaks of sludge pellets fig s6 while decreasing the content of intracellular substances fig s7 indicating that zvi pds treatment induced the release of intracellular substances the secondary structure of eps proteins played a crucial role in sludge hydrophobicity you et al 2017 which was closely relevant to sludge dewatering guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 to access more subtle differences in protein secondary structure second derivative spectra in amide ⅰ band 1700 1600 cm 1 from ftir spectra with or without zvi pds treatment were further analyzed the second derivative spectra were subsequently carried with curve fitting based on the known structure of peptide and protein models you et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 6 six peaks were separated at approximately 1700 1600 cm 1 with the descriptions and fitting results summarized in the bottom of this figure the fitting results exhibited that zvi pds treatment decreased the value of α helix β sheet random coil from 75 63 to 62 43 in lb eps and 65 20 63 88 in tb eps fig 6 it is reported that α helix is kept by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 wu et al 2017 β sheet has a unique structure like the twisted and pleated sheet while random coils show no definite structure victorovich et al 2013 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 you et al 2017 pointed out that the protein molecule presented a loose structure under a low ratio of α helix β sheet random coil the results indicated that zvi pds treatment broke the hydrogen bond keeping α helix structure of eps proteins leading to protein molecules loosely you et al 2017 therefore hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins are easily exposed which induces strong surface hydrophobicity these results were in consistence with the data of fractal dimension in fig 3b 3 4 what happens to zvi pds after being added in ads pds can decompose to form na and s2o8 2 at a controlled rate when it enters into hydrous media equation 1 when zvi is added into the system it could be corroded by s2o8 2 and o2 h2o to produce fe2 as activator equations 2 and 3 after that fe2 activates s2o8 2 to produce sulfate radical so4 accompanied with its oxidation to form fe3 equation 4 which could also induce the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh by radical interconversion reaction equation 5 these oxidative radicals are generally considered as the major intermediates of pds activation meanwhile partial fe3 could be converted into fe2 through reacting with reductive zvi equation 6 and this further increased the amount of direct activator for pds activation 1 na 2 s 2 o 8 2 na s 2 o 8 2 2 fe 0 0 5 o 2 h 2 o fe 2 2 oh 3 fe 0 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 2 so 4 2 4 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 so 4 2 so 4 5 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h oh 6 2 fe 3 fe 0 3 fe 2 the hyperfine coupling constants a n 14 9 g a h 14 9 g all 0 5 g obtained by simulation are reported to be dmpo oh adducts while the hyperfine coupling constants a n 13 8 g a h 10 0 g a h 1 4 g a h 0 8 g all 0 05 g obtained by simulation are in line with dmpo so4 adducts liu et al 2019 song et al 2019 yang et al 2019a as shown in fig 7 a the signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 in either zvi or pds added liquid were detected at negligible or low levels whereas their signals in zvi pds added sample were very obvious confirming substantial presence of so4 and oh in the zvi pds added system fig 7b further exhibits the contribution of radicals and dissolved fe to the enhanced dewaterability of ads it can be seen that all the so4 oh and fe2 fe3 benefited the dewaterability with their contribution being in the sequence of so4 oh fe2 fe3 previous work verified that oxidative so4 and oh could cause destructive damage to eps composition e g polysaccharides proteins and other biopolymers cell membrane and other cell components such as lipids dna rna and other biomacromolecules shi et al 2015 wei et al 2016 fe2 and fe3 were effective flocculants for sludge coagulation through compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charge of sludge colloidal particles based on the analyses above a three step mechanism i e so4 oh generation so4 oh oxidation and fe2 fe3 re flocculation is therefore proposed here to explain how zvi pds treatment improves ads dewaterability fig 8 in the first step so4 was produced by zvi activating pds then a portion of so4 was transformed to oh via radical interconversion reactions in the second step so4 oh oxidation enhanced the disruption of organic compounds e g proteins and polysaccharides in lb eps and tb eps fig 4 resulting in the decreases of bound water content fractal dimension and apparent viscosity but the increases of particle size and hydrophobicity fig 3 besides zvi pds treatment altered the secondary structure of proteins through destroying the hydrogen bond that maintains α helix structure of eps proteins which thereby caused protein molecules loosely fig 6 as a result the hydrophobic sites or groups in eps proteins were exposed easily strengthening the surface hydrophobicity of ads moreover zvi pds treatment promoted the release of intracellular materials figs s6 and s7 reducing intracellular water content as well in the third step fe2 and its oxidation product i e fe3 were effective flocculants thus their generation benefited the coagulation of ads flocs through compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charges of sludge colloidal particles 3 5 implications zvi pds based method is an effective approach to promote ads dewaterability however this is a recently developed method with little understanding of this process this work for the first time reveals the mechanisms of how zvi activated pds improves ads dewatering which provides insights into zvi pds based sludge dewatering process besides this zvi pds based method has important implications to the final disposal of ads currently landfill incineration land improvement and agricultural utilization are commonly used for sludge disposal dai et al 2019 according to the council directive 86 278 eec for sludge treatment land application such as agricultural utilization is considered the preferable method zou et al 2019 this is because sludge contains plentiful organics nutrients and microelements which could enhance soil fertility and water holding capacity for farmland zou et al 2019 however the presence of toxic and harmful contaminants e g pathogens refractory organics and heavy metals in sludge often limits its land application dai et al 2019 leng et al 2014 yu et al 2019 zou et al 2019 it was found from fig 9 a that zvi pds treatment greatly reduced the population of fecal coliform in the dewatered sludge with the number being below the class a requirement of the us standards for class a biosolids i e 3 log mpn g tss yu et al 2019 suggesting that this treatment has good capability in inactivating fecal coliform fig 9b and c showed that compared with the control zvi pds treatment decreased the humic acid content from 118 0 3 0 to 94 0 3 1 mg g tss while this treatment decreased the contents of bisphenol a estrone and 4 nonylphenols by 42 1 1 3 43 5 1 3 and 40 7 1 5 respectively this indicated that zvi pds treatment also reduced the refractory or toxic organic content in dewatered sludge table 2 shows that zvi pds treatment decreased the heavy metals in dewatered sludge while enhancing their solubilization to liquid phase a tclp test further showed that zvi pds treatment decreased the concentrations of these heavy metals in the leachate with the leaching toxicity of pb zn and cd being reduced by 100 69 and 50 respectively table 2 additionally it was found that zvi pds treatment decreased the toxicity of pb zn and cd but increased their stabilization in the dewatered sludge cake fig 10 after zvi pds treatment f1 fraction of pb zn and cd in the dewatered sludge cake decreased from 20 5 25 2 and 28 7 to 5 4 17 2 and 22 2 respectively on the contrary zvi pds treatment increased f4 fraction of pb zn and cd from 43 9 16 5 and 27 4 to 69 9 47 6 and 29 0 respectively this is probably due to that zvi pds treatment effectively enhanced the degradation of organic substances in ads liu 2018 xiong et al 2018 a quantitative risk evaluation conducted by risk assessment code rac based on the percentage of heavy metals in the f1 fraction further exhibited that zvi pds treatment reduced the risk of pb from medium risk to low risk fig 10 all the results demonstrated that zvi pds treatment achieved satisfactory stability of the dewatered sludge by disinfecting pathogens reducing refractory organics mitigating the toxicity of examined heavy metals which benefited its final disposal especially land application such as agricultural utilization it should be emphasized that this study mainly aimed to reveal the mechanism of how zvi pds enhances ads dewaterability thus technical optimization was not carried out for instance only two zvi dosages i e 1 and 2 g g tss two pds dosages i e 0 1 and 0 5 g g tss and one treatment time i e 1 h were tested in this work it was found that more than 95 of zvi could be recycled after each treatment and no significant variation p 0 05 was observed in dewatering performances in a three cycle dewatering test fig s8 suggesting that it is potential to recover and reuse the zvi added in the treatment however a comprehensive optimization research e g a mathematical model method or a response surface method is still needed in the future based on the optimization research scaling up this zvi pds treated method to pilot scale or full scale levels is also necessary in the future to further assess its technical and economic feasibilities under a real world situation 4 conclusion in this study zvi pds treatment significantly enhanced the ads dewaterability experimental results showed that the lowest normalized cst of 8 6 0 5 s l g vss was attained under 2 g g tss zvi and 0 5 g g tss pds which was 42 5 of that in the control under this condition 71 2 1 8 of water content press filtration was determined which was 16 9 lower than that measured in the control the mechanism investigated showed that fe2 which was released from zvi corroded by s2o8 2 and h2o o2 activated s2o8 2 to produce radicals i e so4 and oh these powerful species decreased surface negative charges of ads flocs caused disintegration of eps and release of intracellular matter and changed the secondary structure of proteins in addition fe2 and its oxidation product i e fe3 facilitated the flocculation of ads flocs by compressing double electric layers and neutralizing negative charges of sludge colloids as a consequence the flocculability hydrophobicity and flowability of ads were improved and the bound water content fractal dimension and viscosity of ads were decreased inducing the enhancement of ads dewaterability further analyses displayed that the contributions of these substances to the dewaterability improvement were in the order of so4 oh fe2 fe3 based on the above results a three step mechanism of zvi pds dewatering ads is proposed including so4 oh generation so4 oh oxidation and fe2 fe3 re flocculation finally it was found that zvi pds treatment inactivated the fecal coliforms degraded multiple recalcitrant organics and mitigated the toxicity of heavy metals in the dewatered sludge benefiting its agricultural utilization acknowledgements the authors were thankful for funds

18618,this study characterized dissolved organic matter dom obtained from 47 lakes and 2 streams on ice free areas at lützow holm bay and amundsen bay in east antarctica n 74 where few biogeochemical studies have been historically conducted samples were analyzed for basic water chemistry and by resin fractionation uv vis spectroscopy and excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis eem parafac salinity of the samples ranged very broadly from fresh to hypersaline as a result of evaporative concentration there was a clear positive correlation between log salinity and the spectral slopes of dom s275 295 an indicator of photodegradation thus we interpreted the correlation as a progression of photodegradation by prolonged water retention time of the identified seven parafac components three ubiquitous humic like components decreased as photodegradation progressed while a photorefractory uvc humic like component increased its relative abundance a non humic component traditionally defined as peak n did not show a trend depending on photodegradation and its level was high in nutrient rich lakes presumably due to high in situ production we found robust correlations between the relative abundance of the ubiquitous humic like components and that of the peak n component in the bulk dom irrespective of water types or ice free areas we proposed there were common processes that generated the ubiquitous humic like components from the peak n component in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams such as bacterial processing of

matter dom is a highly heterogeneous collection of hundreds of thousands of organic compounds that collectively play an essential role in key ecosystem processes zark et al 2017 dom ubiquitously exists in water and comprises a similar mass of carbon as atmospheric co2 or the global biomass hedges et al 1997 dom is involved in various biogeochemical processes such as light attenuation metal complexation ph buffering and influencing microbial metabolism findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 and is one of the most important components on earth that influences the health of ecosystems the chemical composition and functionality of dom is strongly influenced by the original source and ecosystem activities roth et al 2014 dom in streams and peatland rivers often contains a high proportion of terrestrial lignin derived materials while that in large lakes and oceans usually contains a high proportion of microbial derived matter aside from the ecosystem specificity of dom molecularly and photochemically indistinguishable ubiquitous components of dom have been recently identified in samples from diverse environments murphy et al 2018 zark and dittmar 2018 these findings imply that there are some common mechanisms that produce these ubiquitous components in dom such as either biotic or abiotic pathways that lead to the production of ubiquitous recalcitrant components of dom that persist in the environment unraveling the underlying mechanisms of the generation of these components is one of the key questions in understanding transformation and long term turnover of dom murphy et al 2018 zark and dittmar 2018 in ice free areas of continental antarctica where no vascular plants are present dom is originated dominantly from in situ biological activity both benthic and planktonic phototrophs in water and phototrophs mosses algae lichens cyanobacteria in the catchments matsumoto 1989 mcknight et al 1994 1991 furthermore because lakes are isolated from each other with independent water catchment areas by impermeable bedrocks they function as closed hydrologic systems the simplicity of the organic matter sources and the lack of the connection with other hydrologic systems limit the number of environmental factors that would otherwise make it difficult to elucidate processes responsible for dom transformations due to the simplicity of the sources the chemical characteristics of antarctic lake dom have been considered to vary little among antarctic lakes aiken et al 1996 mcknight et al 1991 however past studies were exclusively conducted in the mcmurdo dry valleys of east antarctica matsumoto 1989 mcknight et al 1994 1991 and very few biogeochemical studies on dom chemistry have been conducted in other regions in antarctica farzadnia et al 2017 here we report an extensive study conducted in 47 lakes and 2 streams in 6 ice free areas at lützow holm bay east dronning maud land and amundsen bay enderby land in east antarctica this was by far the largest and most diverse dataset that has been historically obtained from antarctic lakes the overall goal of this study was to use spectroscopic techniques to evaluate the potential sources and sinks of dom in these lakes and streams spectroscopic techniques that were used in this study such as uv vis spectroscopy and excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem have been successful in studying concentrations compositions and dynamics of chromophoric cdom and fluorescent dom fdom in aquatic systems including antarctic lakes cawley et al 2016 2013 mcknight et al 1994 we hypothesized that dom in the antarctic lakes and streams has much larger compositional diversity than has been considered and such diversity is mostly introduced by external factors such as photodegradation because the simplicity of the sources would reduce the original dom heterogeneity studying the geochemistry of diverse microbially dominated lake systems should lead to a better understanding of lower latitude aquatic systems as well where several end members form a continuum of dom characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the main sampling campaign was conducted during the austral summer during december 2016 and february 2017 in ice free areas along sôya coast lützow holm bay east dronning maud land located in the southern area of syowa station japan s base fig s1 in sôya coast there are several ice free areas including skarvsnes langhovde skallen breidvågnipa and rundvågshetta where hundreds of lakes of various sizes and water chemistry exist imura et al 2003 kimura et al 2010 kudoh and tanabe 2014 these ice free areas were created during the last 7000 years under the glacier retreat and iso static uplifts that occurred after the last glacial maximum kudoh and tanabe 2014 almost no lakes have any in or out flows and they are fed by melt water from adjacent glaciers and or snow and ice in their catchments the lakes have been isolated from each other with independent water catchment areas and they function as closed hydrologic systems a 1 2 m thick ice cover usually develops on all lakes during march december or january imura et al 2003 additional water sampling was conducted in an ice free area at the foot of mt riiser larsen amundsen bay west enderby land a large number of adélie penguins pygoscelis adeliae 1800 breeding pairs and emperor penguins aptenodytes forsteri have been reported in this region takahashi et al 2000 which would influence the lake water chemistry and biology water chemistry of the lakes in sôya coast is very diverse despite sharing the same climate suggesting that it would induce the diversity in lake water dom as well for example salinity ranges from completely fresh to saline to hypersaline i e more than seven times the salinity of seawater matsumoto 1989 although most of the saline lakes are considered to have been generated via the evaporative concentration of lake water under dry conditions others are marine relict lakes which were in the shallow coastal sea and formed after the iso static uplift of the present lake shores the evapo concentration of sôya coast lakes occurs at variable rates reflecting the balance between evaporation and freshwater inputs when freshwater inputs dominate even marine relict lakes can have zero salinity after a long period see table 1 in contrast to salinity concentrations of essential nutrients for phototroph growth such as nitrate and phosphate are quite low in most of the lakes rendering them oligotrophic waters in proglacial lakes lakes located in front of or close to a glacier exhibit ultra oligotrophic freshwater conditions they typically contain inorganic particles derived from glacial deposits thus the water transparency is low despite the ultra oligotrophic state proglacial lakes directly attached to the glacier terminal tend to have permanent ice covers which can develop up to 4 m thick in winter geological limnological and ecological characteristics of many of the sampled lakes have been described and reviewed elsewhere imura et al 2003 kimura et al 2010 kudoh and tanabe 2014 2 2 water sampling and handling water samples were collected at the deepest point n 19 or shore n 28 of 47 lakes in the ice free areas at lützow holm bay and amundsen bay fig s1 two streams yukidori and yatsude valleys in langhovde n 16 were additionally sampled for comparison to lakes the sampling locations limnological characteristics and basic optical and chemical properties of dom for each lake are presented in table 1 while those for streams are presented in table s1 stream samples were collected at approximately regular intervals from the beginning glacial melt to the end before the outlet to the sea of each stream at the streams and lake shores samples were directly collected into 550 ml volume polyethylene terephthalate bottles after rinsing more than three times with the collected water the ph salinity s and water temperature were recorded in situ using portable water quality meters laqua series horiba kyoto japan at the deepest point of the lakes checked using a portable sonar depth meter ps 7 hondex aichi japan after the confirmation of uniformity in water properties by a multi water quality logger ysi 6600v2 ysi inc oh usa fig s2 lake water was collected at mid depth of the water column using a teflon cylindrical water sampler into the bottles when water stratification was observed water was collected at several depths to capture changes in water chemistry fig s2 i l at five lakes fig s2 b d p and q porewater was sampled from sediment cores that were collected using a gravity corer with a transparent acrylic pipe diameter 5 cm length 50 cm fig s1e after gently aspirating water above the sediment cores bottom water using a glass pipet porewater was collected and stored in the dark the collected waters were filtered in field laboratories as soon as possible usually within a few hours after sampling fourteen samples collected in skallen breidvågnipa and rundvågshetta were filtered in the field laboratory in skarvsnes 1 3 days after sampling because of a logistical limitation samples collected in amundsen bay were filtered in a laboratory on the ice breaking ship shirase on the day of sampling samples for dissolved organic carbon doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn and optical analysis were filtered through pre combusted 450 c 3 h glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 3 μm gf 75 advantec tokyo japan into pre combusted glass bottles a 50 ml aliquot of gf 75 filtered samples was stored in a plastic bottle and kept frozen 20 c for inorganic nutrient analysis the samples for doc and tdn analysis were spiked with sodium azide final concentration of 0 02 and hydrochloric acid final concentration of 1 respectively wako pure chemical osaka japan and stored for further analysis in japan optical analysis was performed immediately after filtration in the field laboratory in skarvsnes or on shirase 2 3 water analysis uv vis absorption spectra 240 600 nm were measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis thermo fisher scientific tokyo japan with a 5 cm path length acid cleaned quartz cuvette at ambient temperature some samples with a high optical density were measured with a 1 cm path length cuvette measurements were baseline corrected using ultrapure water wako pure chemical osaka japan overestimation of absorbance by scatter was evident in some samples which was most likely due to clay sized inorganic particles that passed through the gf 75 filter such samples were mostly from proglacial lakes where lake water was turbid from silt and clay sized particles fed by glaciers table 1 absorbance data in this paper are expressed as napierian absorption coefficients a λ m 1 absorption coefficients of dom were calculated from a λ 2 303a λ l where a λ is the absorbance at wavelength λ and l is the cell path length in meters helms et al 2008 fluorescence eems were collected with a spectrofluorometer fluoromax4 horiba kyoto japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp at room temperature using 5 nm excitation and emission slit widths integration time of 0 25 s excitation ex range of 240 450 nm at 5 nm increments and an emission em range of 300 550 nm at 2 nm increments a sharp peak of the xenon lamp emission 467 nm and raman peak 397 nm were checked daily and corrected if they deviated 0 5 nm from the desired values the eems were corrected for all necessary steps to remove biases and normalized in raman units ru murphy et al 2018 blank eem ultrapure water used for blank subtraction and raman normalization was measured daily in the laboratory in japan we measured doc and tdn using a total organic carbon analyzer combined with a total nitrogen measuring unit toc lcph shimadzu kyoto japan as in kida et al 2019 also dom in the samples was fractionated into hydrophobic hpo and hydrophilic dom based on adsorption onto supelite dax 8 resin in quadruplicate according to kida et al 2019 dom fractions retained on the dax 8 resin hpo included hydrophobic acids i e humic substances and neutrals which are too hydrophobic to be eluted by dilute alkali solution such as less oxygenated humic substances hydrocarbons carbonyl compounds and some anthropogenic matter the proportion of hpo in dom hpo was calculated by hpo dom 100 on a carbon basis the coefficient of variation of replicate hpo determination measurements was 17 average one standard deviation sd 4 9 4 4 fig s3b dissolved inorganic nutrients po4 3 nh4 no2 no3 and sio3 2 were determined colorimetrically using an auto analyzer as previously reported tanabe et al 2017 the limits of detection and quantitation were determined as the average plus 3 or 10 sd of the 10 blank measurements respectively no3 concentrations were determined as the difference between no2 no3 concentrations minus no2 concentrations with or without a no3 reduction step a dissolved organic nitrogen don concentration was calculated as the difference between tdn and the sum of dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations if any of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were below the detection limit a don concentration was calculated as the difference between tdn and the sum of the rest of the detected dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations the proportion of don in tdn don was calculated by don tdn 100 on a nitrogen basis 2 4 optical index and parallel factor analysis we calculated optical indices such as the spectral slope s275 295 doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 and commonly used fluorescence based indices gabor et al 2014 helms et al 2008 weishaar et al 2003 from the absorbance and eem data to estimate the structural properties and origin of dom see supporting information si 1 figs s3 s5 other spectral slope indices that use longer wavelengths were not used because many samples were optically too dilute for the accurate calculation in addition we analyzed the eems by parallel factor analysis parafac to mathematically deconvolute them into distinct fluorescent components with independent spectral characteristics si 2 murphy et al 2018 the identified seven fluorescent components were compared with the published data on an open access spectral database openfluor murphy et al 2014 with the tucker congruence coefficient tcc as similarity criteria the components were named according to their rounded fluorescence emission maximum c325 c415 c360 c500 c440 c460 and c300 with variation explained by each component decreasing sequentially from c325 to c300 c300 was named so because it had a fluorescence maximum at ex em 270 302 nm when em 318 nm was not removed before modeling data not shown the fluorescence intensity at the maximum for each component was represented by fmax in ru murphy et al 2014 the fmax of individual components divided by its doc fmax doc was calculated to track changes in its overall importance in the bulk dom 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical difference between multiple parameters was tested by tukey kramer s multiple comparisons of means linear regressions were fitted using the ordinary least squares method with log10 transformation of variables when needed correlations among fmax doc values of the identified parafac components were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ a significance level of 0 05 was selected for multiple comparisons to test the null hypothesis linear correlations were considered statistically significant when p 0 01 all analyses were conducted with origin 2016 originlab corporation ma usa 3 results 3 1 water chemistry and dom composition salinity of the samples ranged very broadly from fresh to hypersaline s 179 5 times that of seawater table 1 the ph was neutral to slightly basic and dissolved silica sio3 2 concentrations were high table s2 dissolved inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were generally very low and undetectable or below the quantification limit table s2 as a result the don in lakes was as high as 93 3 13 6 among the measured nutrients only sio3 2 concentrations increased along the salinity gradient of s 0 0 5 but the trend in sio3 2 concentrations became unclear in higher salinity lakes other nutrient concentrations did not show any trend along salinity the distribution patterns of c n and the absorption based optical indices along the salinity gradient are shown in fig 1 the doc concentration ranged 0 25 146 mg c l 1 and increased as a function of salinity a similar trend was observed for don and a 254 quantitative measures of cdom salinity alone explained 70 61 and 53 of the variability of doc don and a 254 values respectively linear regression of log log plots consequently a strong log log linear relationship was observed between doc and a 254 r 0 94 p 0 01 table 1 the low doc don ratios indicate the microbial origin of dom the hpo ranged from 18 3 to 60 5 40 4 8 5 the hpo tended to be lower in proglacial lakes and higher in the porewater of lakes the uv absorption indices suva254 and s275 295 showed typical non terrestrial properties fig 1 table 2 the suva254 values were low 0 22 1 66 l mg c 1 m 1 and did not show a clear trend along salinity fig 1e amundsen lake 3 which receives large n inputs from the catchment had the highest suva254 value among others fig 1e this lake had a very high abundance of phytoplankton which was obvious from its green color fig s1f we note that the influence of no3 to the suva254 value of this lake was negligible due to the low absorbance of no3 a 254 0 01 at 100 mg l no3 weishaar et al 2003 in contrast the values of s275 295 showed a clear increasing tendency with the increase in salinity log scale r 0 80 p 0 01 fig 1f porewater and stream samples had lower s275 295 values than others at a given salinity fig 1f table 2 the fluorescent indices also showed typical non terrestrial properties table 2 but values varied along salinity in spite of the anticipated predominantly microbial origin of dom fig s6 3 2 assignments of parafac components seven parafac components were identified with our dataset fig 2 for all of the components except for c300 multiple strong matches tccex em 0 95 were observed 18 23 10 40 3 and 10 matches for c325 c415 c360 c500 c440 and c460 respectively on openfluor c300 had seven matching components with tccex em 0 9 assignments of the components are summarized in table s3 with descriptions of each component provided in the past literature other than c300 c325 and c500 the identified components have been reported as either having allochthonous or autochthonous origins table s3 we assigned c300 and c325 as protein like components table s3 based on their fluorescence positions em 350 nm and the scarcity of polyphenols in antarctic lakes c360 had fluorescence peaks at em 362 nm with the primary excitation maximum at 290 nm the position of c360 was clearly different from a microbial humic like component peak m that occurs at em 370 430 and ex 290 325 which is often found in aquatic systems coble et al 1998 therefore we assigned this component as a non humic peak n em 360 370 nm ex 280 nm which has been associated with new dom production in water coble et al 1998 c460 was assigned as a uvc humic like component table s3 which was reported as photorefractory because of the rapid attenuation of uvb light in water stedmon and markager 2005 the rest of the humic like components c415 c500 and c440 have been reported as ubiquitous components which are found in almost all environments and derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources table s3 murphy et al 2018 stedmon and markager 2005 we further compared our model to the ubiquity models of murphy et al 2018 which were modeled by the one sample parafac of a set of photo decomposed dom isolates fig s7 quite good matches were found between c415 c500 and c440 with several ubiquitous components in their models supporting our assertion that these components were ubiquitous humic like components 3 3 distribution of parafac components fluorescence intensity of the parafac components fmax less clearly increased along the salinity gradient than the other quantitative measures fig s8a and salinity explained less than 42 of the variability of fmax linear regression of log log plots the explained variability was especially small for the ubiquitous humic like components 5 7 8 2 when normalized by doc c325 had the highest intensities followed by c415 while the other components had lower intensities and they were not significantly different from each other fig s9 it was evident that fmax doc values of the parafac components differed among water types fig s8b porewater samples typically had a 5 20 times higher average fmax doc values than lake surface water samples except for c460 and c300 table 2 stream samples also had 2 9 times higher average fmax doc values than lake samples for the ubiquitous humic like components c415 c500 and c440 table 2 saline lake samples had the lowest average fmax doc values for all the components table 2 fig 3 was informative regarding the distribution of the parafac components in response to photodegradation which was assessed by the spectral slope s275 295 fichot and benner 2012 helms et al 2008 1 c360 which is derived from recent in situ production coble et al 1998 did not show changes in its relative abundance depending on the degree of photodegradation fig 3b 2 photodegradation decreased the ubiquitous humic like components c415 c500 and c440 and these components dominated more in the porewater and streams and less at the epilimnion in saline lakes fig 3c 3 uvc humic like component c460 which is photorefractory stedmon and markager 2005 increased its relative importance as photodegradation of bulk dom progressed fig 3d 4 saline lakes exhibited unique parafac compositions with more contribution from protein like components c325 and c300 and much less contribution from c460 which deviated from the relationship between c460 and s275 295 fig 3a and d and 5 amundsen lake 3 penguin lake which received substantial nutrient inputs from nearby penguin colonies table s2 had the lowest protein like components and highest ubiquitous humic like components as well as high c360 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling dom and nutrient concentrations it was obvious that the bulk dom concentration was significantly influenced by evapo concentration in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes because of the dry climate fig 1a and b this was as expected because evapo concentration or dilution by melt water inputs results in either the increase or decrease of any solute in water in closed hydrologic systems similar concentration effects have been observed in lower latitude arid regions among such studies osburn et al 2011 compared doc conductivity in ms cm 1 relationships among saline lakes reported in past studies and found that the slope of regressions between log doc and log conductivity varied from 0 322 to 0 796 0 577 0 156 n 6 our antarctic lake samples had an equation of log doc 0 345 0 394 log conductivity r 2 0 68 p 0 001 the shallower slope of the regression compared to those reported in lower latitude arid regions suggested that the net dom accumulation in the studied antarctic lakes was lower possibly due to the lack of nutrients necessary for primary production in lake water table s2 and the harsh antarctic environment in contrast nutrients other than dissolved silica were not concentrated by evapo concentration table s2 consequently there were no correlations between the fmax values of the parafac components and nutrient concentrations as opposed to those observed in arid lakes osburn et al 2011 this implies that the antarctic lakes are substantially n and p deficient compared to the arid lakes rendering them oligotrophic kudoh and tanabe 2014 as a result don was more influenced by nutrient inputs from the surrounding areas than by evapo concentration for example two lakes in amundsen bay amundsen lake 1 and 3 had low don and had high nitrate no3 concentrations because of n inputs from surrounding penguin colonies and south polar skua nests table s2 similarly five lakes lakes other than nurume and the streams located in yukidori and yatsude valleys in langhovde are affected by inputs from abundant snow petrels that nest in the valleys and had low don table s2 these results suggested that the animal related point source is important in influencing the nutrient distribution in antarctic lakes 4 2 factors controlling the dom composition it appeared that both in situ production and photodegradation substantially influenced the composition of dom in the studied antarctic lakes the observed increase in s275 295 values with increasing salinity fig 1f suggests the progression of photodegradation of dom as a result of prolonged water retention time fichot and benner 2012 helms et al 2008 most of s275 295 values were higher than those previously reported in coastal waters where terrestrial inputs are low for example 0 024 nm 1 in nearshore water of georgia bright helms et al 2008 which supports the predominantly microbial autochthonous origin and or the highly photodegraded state of the studied dom we note that the effects of salinity and ph on the optical properties were investigated and found to be negligible table s4 thus the compositional change was the primary driver for variability in cdom and fdom properties the negligible effect of water chemistry on s275 295 was particularity important because we used the index as the only indicator for dom photodegradation fichot and benner 2012 has also shown that neither biological processes nor changes in ph ionic strength no3 or no2 interferes with s275 295 determination the distribution patterns of the parafac components along s275 295 fig 3 could largely be interpreted by the following three biogeochemical processes i in situ production ii photodegradation and iii precipitation due to high salinity the four samples that had the top four highest c360 fig 3b were those having the highest nutrient especially no3 nh4 and po4 3 concentrations among others table s2 and water color of these lakes were yellow green to green fig s1f strongly supporting that c360 was derived from recent in situ production it is worth noting that there were stronger log log correlations between don concentrations with the levels of c360 r 0 73 and the protein like components r 0 79 0 81 than with those of the ubiquitous humic like components r 0 45 0 51 thus we propose that the level of c360 in the studied antarctic lakes was primarily driven by in situ production and not by photodegradation it is currently not established whether c360 peak n is directly produced by phytoplankton or requires bacterial processing of organic matter originated from primary production however the occurrence of peak n in axenic diatom cultures does indicate that some phytoplankton can produce peak n directly castillo et al 2010 photodegradation substantially influenced the relative contribution of the ubiquitous humic like components and c460 fig 3c and d this was in accordance with the photolabile and photorefractory nature of the ubiquitous humic like components and c460 respectively murphy et al 2018 stedmon and markager 2005 a decrease in c ubiquitous humic and their fmax doc at the epilimnion of saline lakes further supported the photodegradation of the ubiquitous humic like components fig 3c in shallow freshwater sôya coast lakes 3 m tanabe et al 2010 observed that 45 60 of photosynthetically active radiation par 400 700 nm and 20 60 of ultraviolet radiation 300 400 nm reached the lake beds implying that photodegradation of the ubiquitous humic like components could occur throughout the water column it was as expected that porewater samples had higher contribution from the photolabile ubiquitous humic like components because of the lack of sunlight penetration into the lake sediment less than 1 cm fig 5 of tanabe et al 2010 interestingly stream samples had similar optical characteristics as porewater samples namely high suva254 and c ubiquitous humic and low s275 295 and c460 figs 1 and 3 table 2 we presume that this was because the water residence time of the streams at most a few days was much shorter than the most of lakes except for lakes directly fed by a glacier and thus stream dom was not photodegraded substantially the continuous dom inputs from decomposed partially humified mosses within the stream and in stream banks kanda et al 2004 could also be a source of the ubiquitous humic like components the low c460 in saline lakes fig 3d and concomitant increases in c protein fig 3a could be caused by precipitation of c460 due to high salinity sholkovitz 1976 another possibility may be the greater primary production of protein like dom in saline lakes osburn et al 2011 however it appeared that this was not true because lake funazoko which had the much higher nutrient concentrations than other saline lakes table s2 had lower c protein doc and thus lower c protein also the phototroph abundance is typically small in the studied saline lakes tanabe unpublished data the lack of correlations between the protein like component levels and nutrient concentrations may be due to rapid microbial processing of the protein like components originated from primary production stedmon and markager 2005 it could also be partly due to the timing of sampling in lakes oyako and hotoke in sôya coast tanabe et al 2008 observed the maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence under dim light conditions during austral spring and autumn and the minimum chlorophyll a fluorescence in ice free summer and they concluded that the too strong summer light acts as an inhibitor of antarctic phytoplankton growth since our samples were collected during austral summer they may have already undergone extensive algae breakdown and photolytic microbial modification of primary production derived dom insight as to intra annual variation of dom concentrations and compositions should be gained when samples collected during the winter time are analyzed finally the fluorescence based indices failed to adequately capture the changes in fdom compositions described above fig s10 4 3 generation of ubiquitous humic like components and its ecological implications the evapo concentration of the studied lakes occurs at variable rates reflecting the balance between evaporation and freshwater inputs as such the correlation analysis of the fluorescence intensities of the parafac components would result in false positive if not corrected for concentration effects therefore we compared the levels of the parafac components after dividing by the doc concentrations fmax doc as the doc concentrations in this study were largely 70 explained by salinity and dividing by doc could effectively reduce concentration effects in addition fmax doc represents the relative abundance of the parafac components in the bulk dom thus if fmax doc values of two components vary and are strongly correlated among samples it means that the components behave in parallel independent of the behavior of the other constituents of dom fig 4 shows the correlations between c360 doc and the ubiquitous humic like components c415 doc c440 doc and c500 doc all the ubiquitous humic like components had a significant strong correlation with c360 while the other protein like components and c460 had a much weaker correlation the y intercepts for c415 and c500 were not statistically different from zero p 0 01 these universal correlations were observed despite the fact that the samples were collected from closed hydrologic systems of distinct water types and different ice free areas this strongly suggested that there were common processes that generated the ubiquitous components c415 c440 and c500 from c360 in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams with a certain proportion of c360 being transformed into the ubiquitous components the inconsistent assignments of these components in literature allochthonous or autochthonous table s3 also imply their multiple origins or common environmental processing that ultimately leads to these fluorescence because the lakes have been isolated from each other 7000 years with independent water catchment areas and they function as closed hydrologic systems such a process should work on areas larger than the catchment in size or it should work commonly among lakes in water humic like fluorophores can be generated in a culture of bacterial communities amended with phytoplankton derived dom or simple substrates such as glucose in a relatively short period a few weeks kramer and herndl 2004 rochelle newall and fisher 2002 shimotori et al 2012 the bacterial processing of c360 could be a source of the ubiquitous humic like fluorophores in the studied lakes although c500 has not been linked to autochthonous sources table s3 its relatively high contribution to our antarctic dataset suggested that it was of autochthonous origin in this study re emphasizing that one cannot assign humic like fluorophores as terrestrial just because their spectral features resemble that of terrestrially derived natural organic matter murphy et al 2018 the fact that the same ubiquitous humic like fluorophores were found in lake fryxell and the deep sargasso sea 4534 m fig s7 where sunlight penetration is negligible discussed below supports the biotic generation of these fluorophores although recent studies demonstrated that humic like fluorophores can also be generated directly from phytoplankton in axenic cultures castillo et al 2010 chari et al 2013 fukuzaki et al 2014 its contribution to the generation of the ubiquitous humic like fluorophores was likely low in our study considering the lack of relationships between nutrient concentrations and ubiquitous humic like fluorophore levels furthermore abiotic photochemical humification photohumification of dom in the presence of dissolved nitrogen has also been proposed kieber et al 1997 phootoxidation has been shown to cross link lipid precursors incorporating n free amine groups or ammonia into the newly formed marine humic substance and creating humic like fluorescence kieber et al 1997 although mcknight et al 1991 noted that photohumification would not occur in mcmurdo dry valleys antarctic lakes such as lake fryxell which are permanently ice covered and thus have low light intensities photon flux density is 3 10 μmol photons m 2 s 1 below the ice mcknight et al 1991 it could occur in lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes because most lakes are completely ice free during the 2 month austral summer and they can have two orders brighter light 600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 par up to 4 m tanabe et al 2008 than the lakes in mcmurdo dry valleys considering the richness of don fig 1 and the strong light intensity photohumification in the presence of don and din in some nutrient rich lakes may play an important role in abiotic transformation of microbial dom into distinct humic like fluorophores in the studied antarctic lakes the hpo in this study 40 4 8 5 was generally higher than previously reported for lakes in the mcmurdo dry valleys lake vida 12 17 lakes fryxell and hoare 17 24 and 16 18 as fulvic acid respectively and on ross island of east antarctica pony lake 23 34 aiken et al 1996 cawley et al 2016 2013 mcknight et al 1991 and similar to that of temperate clear water lakes table 1 of sato et al 2019 the higher hpo of our samples than of lakes in the mcmurdo dry valleys suggested the higher abundance of humic substances in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams despite prevailing photodegradation levels of the ubiquitous humic like components in the studied antarctic lakes may reflect the balance between the abiotic biotic production and photodegradation the ecological importance of cdom in antarctic lakes has been discussed mainly on its light shading effect for primary producers mcknight et al 1994 the formation of humic like fluorophores could be very important in regulating the depth of the euphotic zone to which visible wavelength radiation can penetrate this light shading role that cdom plays in the studied lakes will be assessed in the future when we will finish analyzing the light penetrating properties of each lake another important attribute of antarctic dom could be its influence on the position of the thermocline an example where dom substantially influenced the thermocline depth could be seen from the depth trend in the water temperature of a saline lake funazoko fig s2k the water temperature of lake funazoko showed a drastic change it was approximately 6 8 c at the surface increased to 20 c at 1 7 m then linearly decreased to 5 c at 6 8 m because the depth trend in conductivity did not correspond with that of temperature the stratification was not a halocline but a thermocline in contrast to other saline lakes fig s2 i j l the very high doc concentration 92 8 mg c l 1 and absorption coefficient a 254 96 1 m 1 of the surface water of this lake table 1 likely absorbed sunlight energy and increased the temperature the depth trend in the temperature was likely the balance between heating by the sunlight absorption and cooling by the atmosphere and deeper water 5 concluding remarks we found large compositional diversity in our antarctic samples in terms of doc don hpo uv absorbing characteristics suva254 and s275 295 and fdom compositions and such diversity was largely due to a different degree of photodegradation therefore the hypothesis that dom in the antarctic lakes and streams has large compositional diversity and such diversity is mostly introduced by external factors such as photodegradation was confirmed in our study in addition we proposed that there were common processes that generated the ubiquitous humic like components from c360 traditionally defined as peak n in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams although we consider biotic and photochemical processes primarily responsible for the generation of the ubiquitous humic like components more studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms we note that the cdom and fdom mainly studied in this work only captured a small portion of the bulk dom future work should broaden the analytical window and incorporate chemical structural techniques such as high field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fourier transformed ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to unravel the unique chemistry of antarctic dom which should lead to a better understanding of the other pristine lakes in the world and

18618,this study characterized dissolved organic matter dom obtained from 47 lakes and 2 streams on ice free areas at lützow holm bay and amundsen bay in east antarctica n 74 where few biogeochemical studies have been historically conducted samples were analyzed for basic water chemistry and by resin fractionation uv vis spectroscopy and excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis eem parafac salinity of the samples ranged very broadly from fresh to hypersaline as a result of evaporative concentration there was a clear positive correlation between log salinity and the spectral slopes of dom s275 295 an indicator of photodegradation thus we interpreted the correlation as a progression of photodegradation by prolonged water retention time of the identified seven parafac components three ubiquitous humic like components decreased as photodegradation progressed while a photorefractory uvc humic like component increased its relative abundance a non humic component traditionally defined as peak n did not show a trend depending on photodegradation and its level was high in nutrient rich lakes presumably due to high in situ production we found robust correlations between the relative abundance of the ubiquitous humic like components and that of the peak n component in the bulk dom irrespective of water types or ice free areas we proposed there were common processes that generated the ubiquitous humic like components from the peak n component in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams such as bacterial processing of primary production derived dom and photochemical transformation of microbial dom keywords autochthonous dom fluorescence microbial process parafac photodegradation 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a highly heterogeneous collection of hundreds of thousands of organic compounds that collectively play an essential role in key ecosystem processes zark et al 2017 dom ubiquitously exists in water and comprises a similar mass of carbon as atmospheric co2 or the global biomass hedges et al 1997 dom is involved in various biogeochemical processes such as light attenuation metal complexation ph buffering and influencing microbial metabolism findlay and sinsabaugh 2003 and is one of the most important components on earth that influences the health of ecosystems the chemical composition and functionality of dom is strongly influenced by the original source and ecosystem activities roth et al 2014 dom in streams and peatland rivers often contains a high proportion of terrestrial lignin derived materials while that in large lakes and oceans usually contains a high proportion of microbial derived matter aside from the ecosystem specificity of dom molecularly and photochemically indistinguishable ubiquitous components of dom have been recently identified in samples from diverse environments murphy et al 2018 zark and dittmar 2018 these findings imply that there are some common mechanisms that produce these ubiquitous components in dom such as either biotic or abiotic pathways that lead to the production of ubiquitous recalcitrant components of dom that persist in the environment unraveling the underlying mechanisms of the generation of these components is one of the key questions in understanding transformation and long term turnover of dom murphy et al 2018 zark and dittmar 2018 in ice free areas of continental antarctica where no vascular plants are present dom is originated dominantly from in situ biological activity both benthic and planktonic phototrophs in water and phototrophs mosses algae lichens cyanobacteria in the catchments matsumoto 1989 mcknight et al 1994 1991 furthermore because lakes are isolated from each other with independent water catchment areas by impermeable bedrocks they function as closed hydrologic systems the simplicity of the organic matter sources and the lack of the connection with other hydrologic systems limit the number of environmental factors that would otherwise make it difficult to elucidate processes responsible for dom transformations due to the simplicity of the sources the chemical characteristics of antarctic lake dom have been considered to vary little among antarctic lakes aiken et al 1996 mcknight et al 1991 however past studies were exclusively conducted in the mcmurdo dry valleys of east antarctica matsumoto 1989 mcknight et al 1994 1991 and very few biogeochemical studies on dom chemistry have been conducted in other regions in antarctica farzadnia et al 2017 here we report an extensive study conducted in 47 lakes and 2 streams in 6 ice free areas at lützow holm bay east dronning maud land and amundsen bay enderby land in east antarctica this was by far the largest and most diverse dataset that has been historically obtained from antarctic lakes the overall goal of this study was to use spectroscopic techniques to evaluate the potential sources and sinks of dom in these lakes and streams spectroscopic techniques that were used in this study such as uv vis spectroscopy and excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem have been successful in studying concentrations compositions and dynamics of chromophoric cdom and fluorescent dom fdom in aquatic systems including antarctic lakes cawley et al 2016 2013 mcknight et al 1994 we hypothesized that dom in the antarctic lakes and streams has much larger compositional diversity than has been considered and such diversity is mostly introduced by external factors such as photodegradation because the simplicity of the sources would reduce the original dom heterogeneity studying the geochemistry of diverse microbially dominated lake systems should lead to a better understanding of lower latitude aquatic systems as well where several end members form a continuum of dom characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the main sampling campaign was conducted during the austral summer during december 2016 and february 2017 in ice free areas along sôya coast lützow holm bay east dronning maud land located in the southern area of syowa station japan s base fig s1 in sôya coast there are several ice free areas including skarvsnes langhovde skallen breidvågnipa and rundvågshetta where hundreds of lakes of various sizes and water chemistry exist imura et al 2003 kimura et al 2010 kudoh and tanabe 2014 these ice free areas were created during the last 7000 years under the glacier retreat and iso static uplifts that occurred after the last glacial maximum kudoh and tanabe 2014 almost no lakes have any in or out flows and they are fed by melt water from adjacent glaciers and or snow and ice in their catchments the lakes have been isolated from each other with independent water catchment areas and they function as closed hydrologic systems a 1 2 m thick ice cover usually develops on all lakes during march december or january imura et al 2003 additional water sampling was conducted in an ice free area at the foot of mt riiser larsen amundsen bay west enderby land a large number of adélie penguins pygoscelis adeliae 1800 breeding pairs and emperor penguins aptenodytes forsteri have been reported in this region takahashi et al 2000 which would influence the lake water chemistry and biology water chemistry of the lakes in sôya coast is very diverse despite sharing the same climate suggesting that it would induce the diversity in lake water dom as well for example salinity ranges from completely fresh to saline to hypersaline i e more than seven times the salinity of seawater matsumoto 1989 although most of the saline lakes are considered to have been generated via the evaporative concentration of lake water under dry conditions others are marine relict lakes which were in the shallow coastal sea and formed after the iso static uplift of the present lake shores the evapo concentration of sôya coast lakes occurs at variable rates reflecting the balance between evaporation and freshwater inputs when freshwater inputs dominate even marine relict lakes can have zero salinity after a long period see table 1 in contrast to salinity concentrations of essential nutrients for phototroph growth such as nitrate and phosphate are quite low in most of the lakes rendering them oligotrophic waters in proglacial lakes lakes located in front of or close to a glacier exhibit ultra oligotrophic freshwater conditions they typically contain inorganic particles derived from glacial deposits thus the water transparency is low despite the ultra oligotrophic state proglacial lakes directly attached to the glacier terminal tend to have permanent ice covers which can develop up to 4 m thick in winter geological limnological and ecological characteristics of many of the sampled lakes have been described and reviewed elsewhere imura et al 2003 kimura et al 2010 kudoh and tanabe 2014 2 2 water sampling and handling water samples were collected at the deepest point n 19 or shore n 28 of 47 lakes in the ice free areas at lützow holm bay and amundsen bay fig s1 two streams yukidori and yatsude valleys in langhovde n 16 were additionally sampled for comparison to lakes the sampling locations limnological characteristics and basic optical and chemical properties of dom for each lake are presented in table 1 while those for streams are presented in table s1 stream samples were collected at approximately regular intervals from the beginning glacial melt to the end before the outlet to the sea of each stream at the streams and lake shores samples were directly collected into 550 ml volume polyethylene terephthalate bottles after rinsing more than three times with the collected water the ph salinity s and water temperature were recorded in situ using portable water quality meters laqua series horiba kyoto japan at the deepest point of the lakes checked using a portable sonar depth meter ps 7 hondex aichi japan after the confirmation of uniformity in water properties by a multi water quality logger ysi 6600v2 ysi inc oh usa fig s2 lake water was collected at mid depth of the water column using a teflon cylindrical water sampler into the bottles when water stratification was observed water was collected at several depths to capture changes in water chemistry fig s2 i l at five lakes fig s2 b d p and q porewater was sampled from sediment cores that were collected using a gravity corer with a transparent acrylic pipe diameter 5 cm length 50 cm fig s1e after gently aspirating water above the sediment cores bottom water using a glass pipet porewater was collected and stored in the dark the collected waters were filtered in field laboratories as soon as possible usually within a few hours after sampling fourteen samples collected in skallen breidvågnipa and rundvågshetta were filtered in the field laboratory in skarvsnes 1 3 days after sampling because of a logistical limitation samples collected in amundsen bay were filtered in a laboratory on the ice breaking ship shirase on the day of sampling samples for dissolved organic carbon doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn and optical analysis were filtered through pre combusted 450 c 3 h glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 3 μm gf 75 advantec tokyo japan into pre combusted glass bottles a 50 ml aliquot of gf 75 filtered samples was stored in a plastic bottle and kept frozen 20 c for inorganic nutrient analysis the samples for doc and tdn analysis were spiked with sodium azide final concentration of 0 02 and hydrochloric acid final concentration of 1 respectively wako pure chemical osaka japan and stored for further analysis in japan optical analysis was performed immediately after filtration in the field laboratory in skarvsnes or on shirase 2 3 water analysis uv vis absorption spectra 240 600 nm were measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis thermo fisher scientific tokyo japan with a 5 cm path length acid cleaned quartz cuvette at ambient temperature some samples with a high optical density were measured with a 1 cm path length cuvette measurements were baseline corrected using ultrapure water wako pure chemical osaka japan overestimation of absorbance by scatter was evident in some samples which was most likely due to clay sized inorganic particles that passed through the gf 75 filter such samples were mostly from proglacial lakes where lake water was turbid from silt and clay sized particles fed by glaciers table 1 absorbance data in this paper are expressed as napierian absorption coefficients a λ m 1 absorption coefficients of dom were calculated from a λ 2 303a λ l where a λ is the absorbance at wavelength λ and l is the cell path length in meters helms et al 2008 fluorescence eems were collected with a spectrofluorometer fluoromax4 horiba kyoto japan equipped with a 150 w xenon arc lamp at room temperature using 5 nm excitation and emission slit widths integration time of 0 25 s excitation ex range of 240 450 nm at 5 nm increments and an emission em range of 300 550 nm at 2 nm increments a sharp peak of the xenon lamp emission 467 nm and raman peak 397 nm were checked daily and corrected if they deviated 0 5 nm from the desired values the eems were corrected for all necessary steps to remove biases and normalized in raman units ru murphy et al 2018 blank eem ultrapure water used for blank subtraction and raman normalization was measured daily in the laboratory in japan we measured doc and tdn using a total organic carbon analyzer combined with a total nitrogen measuring unit toc lcph shimadzu kyoto japan as in kida et al 2019 also dom in the samples was fractionated into hydrophobic hpo and hydrophilic dom based on adsorption onto supelite dax 8 resin in quadruplicate according to kida et al 2019 dom fractions retained on the dax 8 resin hpo included hydrophobic acids i e humic substances and neutrals which are too hydrophobic to be eluted by dilute alkali solution such as less oxygenated humic substances hydrocarbons carbonyl compounds and some anthropogenic matter the proportion of hpo in dom hpo was calculated by hpo dom 100 on a carbon basis the coefficient of variation of replicate hpo determination measurements was 17 average one standard deviation sd 4 9 4 4 fig s3b dissolved inorganic nutrients po4 3 nh4 no2 no3 and sio3 2 were determined colorimetrically using an auto analyzer as previously reported tanabe et al 2017 the limits of detection and quantitation were determined as the average plus 3 or 10 sd of the 10 blank measurements respectively no3 concentrations were determined as the difference between no2 no3 concentrations minus no2 concentrations with or without a no3 reduction step a dissolved organic nitrogen don concentration was calculated as the difference between tdn and the sum of dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations if any of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were below the detection limit a don concentration was calculated as the difference between tdn and the sum of the rest of the detected dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations the proportion of don in tdn don was calculated by don tdn 100 on a nitrogen basis 2 4 optical index and parallel factor analysis we calculated optical indices such as the spectral slope s275 295 doc specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 and commonly used fluorescence based indices gabor et al 2014 helms et al 2008 weishaar et al 2003 from the absorbance and eem data to estimate the structural properties and origin of dom see supporting information si 1 figs s3 s5 other spectral slope indices that use longer wavelengths were not used because many samples were optically too dilute for the accurate calculation in addition we analyzed the eems by parallel factor analysis parafac to mathematically deconvolute them into distinct fluorescent components with independent spectral characteristics si 2 murphy et al 2018 the identified seven fluorescent components were compared with the published data on an open access spectral database openfluor murphy et al 2014 with the tucker congruence coefficient tcc as similarity criteria the components were named according to their rounded fluorescence emission maximum c325 c415 c360 c500 c440 c460 and c300 with variation explained by each component decreasing sequentially from c325 to c300 c300 was named so because it had a fluorescence maximum at ex em 270 302 nm when em 318 nm was not removed before modeling data not shown the fluorescence intensity at the maximum for each component was represented by fmax in ru murphy et al 2014 the fmax of individual components divided by its doc fmax doc was calculated to track changes in its overall importance in the bulk dom 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical difference between multiple parameters was tested by tukey kramer s multiple comparisons of means linear regressions were fitted using the ordinary least squares method with log10 transformation of variables when needed correlations among fmax doc values of the identified parafac components were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ a significance level of 0 05 was selected for multiple comparisons to test the null hypothesis linear correlations were considered statistically significant when p 0 01 all analyses were conducted with origin 2016 originlab corporation ma usa 3 results 3 1 water chemistry and dom composition salinity of the samples ranged very broadly from fresh to hypersaline s 179 5 times that of seawater table 1 the ph was neutral to slightly basic and dissolved silica sio3 2 concentrations were high table s2 dissolved inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were generally very low and undetectable or below the quantification limit table s2 as a result the don in lakes was as high as 93 3 13 6 among the measured nutrients only sio3 2 concentrations increased along the salinity gradient of s 0 0 5 but the trend in sio3 2 concentrations became unclear in higher salinity lakes other nutrient concentrations did not show any trend along salinity the distribution patterns of c n and the absorption based optical indices along the salinity gradient are shown in fig 1 the doc concentration ranged 0 25 146 mg c l 1 and increased as a function of salinity a similar trend was observed for don and a 254 quantitative measures of cdom salinity alone explained 70 61 and 53 of the variability of doc don and a 254 values respectively linear regression of log log plots consequently a strong log log linear relationship was observed between doc and a 254 r 0 94 p 0 01 table 1 the low doc don ratios indicate the microbial origin of dom the hpo ranged from 18 3 to 60 5 40 4 8 5 the hpo tended to be lower in proglacial lakes and higher in the porewater of lakes the uv absorption indices suva254 and s275 295 showed typical non terrestrial properties fig 1 table 2 the suva254 values were low 0 22 1 66 l mg c 1 m 1 and did not show a clear trend along salinity fig 1e amundsen lake 3 which receives large n inputs from the catchment had the highest suva254 value among others fig 1e this lake had a very high abundance of phytoplankton which was obvious from its green color fig s1f we note that the influence of no3 to the suva254 value of this lake was negligible due to the low absorbance of no3 a 254 0 01 at 100 mg l no3 weishaar et al 2003 in contrast the values of s275 295 showed a clear increasing tendency with the increase in salinity log scale r 0 80 p 0 01 fig 1f porewater and stream samples had lower s275 295 values than others at a given salinity fig 1f table 2 the fluorescent indices also showed typical non terrestrial properties table 2 but values varied along salinity in spite of the anticipated predominantly microbial origin of dom fig s6 3 2 assignments of parafac components seven parafac components were identified with our dataset fig 2 for all of the components except for c300 multiple strong matches tccex em 0 95 were observed 18 23 10 40 3 and 10 matches for c325 c415 c360 c500 c440 and c460 respectively on openfluor c300 had seven matching components with tccex em 0 9 assignments of the components are summarized in table s3 with descriptions of each component provided in the past literature other than c300 c325 and c500 the identified components have been reported as either having allochthonous or autochthonous origins table s3 we assigned c300 and c325 as protein like components table s3 based on their fluorescence positions em 350 nm and the scarcity of polyphenols in antarctic lakes c360 had fluorescence peaks at em 362 nm with the primary excitation maximum at 290 nm the position of c360 was clearly different from a microbial humic like component peak m that occurs at em 370 430 and ex 290 325 which is often found in aquatic systems coble et al 1998 therefore we assigned this component as a non humic peak n em 360 370 nm ex 280 nm which has been associated with new dom production in water coble et al 1998 c460 was assigned as a uvc humic like component table s3 which was reported as photorefractory because of the rapid attenuation of uvb light in water stedmon and markager 2005 the rest of the humic like components c415 c500 and c440 have been reported as ubiquitous components which are found in almost all environments and derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources table s3 murphy et al 2018 stedmon and markager 2005 we further compared our model to the ubiquity models of murphy et al 2018 which were modeled by the one sample parafac of a set of photo decomposed dom isolates fig s7 quite good matches were found between c415 c500 and c440 with several ubiquitous components in their models supporting our assertion that these components were ubiquitous humic like components 3 3 distribution of parafac components fluorescence intensity of the parafac components fmax less clearly increased along the salinity gradient than the other quantitative measures fig s8a and salinity explained less than 42 of the variability of fmax linear regression of log log plots the explained variability was especially small for the ubiquitous humic like components 5 7 8 2 when normalized by doc c325 had the highest intensities followed by c415 while the other components had lower intensities and they were not significantly different from each other fig s9 it was evident that fmax doc values of the parafac components differed among water types fig s8b porewater samples typically had a 5 20 times higher average fmax doc values than lake surface water samples except for c460 and c300 table 2 stream samples also had 2 9 times higher average fmax doc values than lake samples for the ubiquitous humic like components c415 c500 and c440 table 2 saline lake samples had the lowest average fmax doc values for all the components table 2 fig 3 was informative regarding the distribution of the parafac components in response to photodegradation which was assessed by the spectral slope s275 295 fichot and benner 2012 helms et al 2008 1 c360 which is derived from recent in situ production coble et al 1998 did not show changes in its relative abundance depending on the degree of photodegradation fig 3b 2 photodegradation decreased the ubiquitous humic like components c415 c500 and c440 and these components dominated more in the porewater and streams and less at the epilimnion in saline lakes fig 3c 3 uvc humic like component c460 which is photorefractory stedmon and markager 2005 increased its relative importance as photodegradation of bulk dom progressed fig 3d 4 saline lakes exhibited unique parafac compositions with more contribution from protein like components c325 and c300 and much less contribution from c460 which deviated from the relationship between c460 and s275 295 fig 3a and d and 5 amundsen lake 3 penguin lake which received substantial nutrient inputs from nearby penguin colonies table s2 had the lowest protein like components and highest ubiquitous humic like components as well as high c360 4 discussion 4 1 factors controlling dom and nutrient concentrations it was obvious that the bulk dom concentration was significantly influenced by evapo concentration in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes because of the dry climate fig 1a and b this was as expected because evapo concentration or dilution by melt water inputs results in either the increase or decrease of any solute in water in closed hydrologic systems similar concentration effects have been observed in lower latitude arid regions among such studies osburn et al 2011 compared doc conductivity in ms cm 1 relationships among saline lakes reported in past studies and found that the slope of regressions between log doc and log conductivity varied from 0 322 to 0 796 0 577 0 156 n 6 our antarctic lake samples had an equation of log doc 0 345 0 394 log conductivity r 2 0 68 p 0 001 the shallower slope of the regression compared to those reported in lower latitude arid regions suggested that the net dom accumulation in the studied antarctic lakes was lower possibly due to the lack of nutrients necessary for primary production in lake water table s2 and the harsh antarctic environment in contrast nutrients other than dissolved silica were not concentrated by evapo concentration table s2 consequently there were no correlations between the fmax values of the parafac components and nutrient concentrations as opposed to those observed in arid lakes osburn et al 2011 this implies that the antarctic lakes are substantially n and p deficient compared to the arid lakes rendering them oligotrophic kudoh and tanabe 2014 as a result don was more influenced by nutrient inputs from the surrounding areas than by evapo concentration for example two lakes in amundsen bay amundsen lake 1 and 3 had low don and had high nitrate no3 concentrations because of n inputs from surrounding penguin colonies and south polar skua nests table s2 similarly five lakes lakes other than nurume and the streams located in yukidori and yatsude valleys in langhovde are affected by inputs from abundant snow petrels that nest in the valleys and had low don table s2 these results suggested that the animal related point source is important in influencing the nutrient distribution in antarctic lakes 4 2 factors controlling the dom composition it appeared that both in situ production and photodegradation substantially influenced the composition of dom in the studied antarctic lakes the observed increase in s275 295 values with increasing salinity fig 1f suggests the progression of photodegradation of dom as a result of prolonged water retention time fichot and benner 2012 helms et al 2008 most of s275 295 values were higher than those previously reported in coastal waters where terrestrial inputs are low for example 0 024 nm 1 in nearshore water of georgia bright helms et al 2008 which supports the predominantly microbial autochthonous origin and or the highly photodegraded state of the studied dom we note that the effects of salinity and ph on the optical properties were investigated and found to be negligible table s4 thus the compositional change was the primary driver for variability in cdom and fdom properties the negligible effect of water chemistry on s275 295 was particularity important because we used the index as the only indicator for dom photodegradation fichot and benner 2012 has also shown that neither biological processes nor changes in ph ionic strength no3 or no2 interferes with s275 295 determination the distribution patterns of the parafac components along s275 295 fig 3 could largely be interpreted by the following three biogeochemical processes i in situ production ii photodegradation and iii precipitation due to high salinity the four samples that had the top four highest c360 fig 3b were those having the highest nutrient especially no3 nh4 and po4 3 concentrations among others table s2 and water color of these lakes were yellow green to green fig s1f strongly supporting that c360 was derived from recent in situ production it is worth noting that there were stronger log log correlations between don concentrations with the levels of c360 r 0 73 and the protein like components r 0 79 0 81 than with those of the ubiquitous humic like components r 0 45 0 51 thus we propose that the level of c360 in the studied antarctic lakes was primarily driven by in situ production and not by photodegradation it is currently not established whether c360 peak n is directly produced by phytoplankton or requires bacterial processing of organic matter originated from primary production however the occurrence of peak n in axenic diatom cultures does indicate that some phytoplankton can produce peak n directly castillo et al 2010 photodegradation substantially influenced the relative contribution of the ubiquitous humic like components and c460 fig 3c and d this was in accordance with the photolabile and photorefractory nature of the ubiquitous humic like components and c460 respectively murphy et al 2018 stedmon and markager 2005 a decrease in c ubiquitous humic and their fmax doc at the epilimnion of saline lakes further supported the photodegradation of the ubiquitous humic like components fig 3c in shallow freshwater sôya coast lakes 3 m tanabe et al 2010 observed that 45 60 of photosynthetically active radiation par 400 700 nm and 20 60 of ultraviolet radiation 300 400 nm reached the lake beds implying that photodegradation of the ubiquitous humic like components could occur throughout the water column it was as expected that porewater samples had higher contribution from the photolabile ubiquitous humic like components because of the lack of sunlight penetration into the lake sediment less than 1 cm fig 5 of tanabe et al 2010 interestingly stream samples had similar optical characteristics as porewater samples namely high suva254 and c ubiquitous humic and low s275 295 and c460 figs 1 and 3 table 2 we presume that this was because the water residence time of the streams at most a few days was much shorter than the most of lakes except for lakes directly fed by a glacier and thus stream dom was not photodegraded substantially the continuous dom inputs from decomposed partially humified mosses within the stream and in stream banks kanda et al 2004 could also be a source of the ubiquitous humic like components the low c460 in saline lakes fig 3d and concomitant increases in c protein fig 3a could be caused by precipitation of c460 due to high salinity sholkovitz 1976 another possibility may be the greater primary production of protein like dom in saline lakes osburn et al 2011 however it appeared that this was not true because lake funazoko which had the much higher nutrient concentrations than other saline lakes table s2 had lower c protein doc and thus lower c protein also the phototroph abundance is typically small in the studied saline lakes tanabe unpublished data the lack of correlations between the protein like component levels and nutrient concentrations may be due to rapid microbial processing of the protein like components originated from primary production stedmon and markager 2005 it could also be partly due to the timing of sampling in lakes oyako and hotoke in sôya coast tanabe et al 2008 observed the maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence under dim light conditions during austral spring and autumn and the minimum chlorophyll a fluorescence in ice free summer and they concluded that the too strong summer light acts as an inhibitor of antarctic phytoplankton growth since our samples were collected during austral summer they may have already undergone extensive algae breakdown and photolytic microbial modification of primary production derived dom insight as to intra annual variation of dom concentrations and compositions should be gained when samples collected during the winter time are analyzed finally the fluorescence based indices failed to adequately capture the changes in fdom compositions described above fig s10 4 3 generation of ubiquitous humic like components and its ecological implications the evapo concentration of the studied lakes occurs at variable rates reflecting the balance between evaporation and freshwater inputs as such the correlation analysis of the fluorescence intensities of the parafac components would result in false positive if not corrected for concentration effects therefore we compared the levels of the parafac components after dividing by the doc concentrations fmax doc as the doc concentrations in this study were largely 70 explained by salinity and dividing by doc could effectively reduce concentration effects in addition fmax doc represents the relative abundance of the parafac components in the bulk dom thus if fmax doc values of two components vary and are strongly correlated among samples it means that the components behave in parallel independent of the behavior of the other constituents of dom fig 4 shows the correlations between c360 doc and the ubiquitous humic like components c415 doc c440 doc and c500 doc all the ubiquitous humic like components had a significant strong correlation with c360 while the other protein like components and c460 had a much weaker correlation the y intercepts for c415 and c500 were not statistically different from zero p 0 01 these universal correlations were observed despite the fact that the samples were collected from closed hydrologic systems of distinct water types and different ice free areas this strongly suggested that there were common processes that generated the ubiquitous components c415 c440 and c500 from c360 in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams with a certain proportion of c360 being transformed into the ubiquitous components the inconsistent assignments of these components in literature allochthonous or autochthonous table s3 also imply their multiple origins or common environmental processing that ultimately leads to these fluorescence because the lakes have been isolated from each other 7000 years with independent water catchment areas and they function as closed hydrologic systems such a process should work on areas larger than the catchment in size or it should work commonly among lakes in water humic like fluorophores can be generated in a culture of bacterial communities amended with phytoplankton derived dom or simple substrates such as glucose in a relatively short period a few weeks kramer and herndl 2004 rochelle newall and fisher 2002 shimotori et al 2012 the bacterial processing of c360 could be a source of the ubiquitous humic like fluorophores in the studied lakes although c500 has not been linked to autochthonous sources table s3 its relatively high contribution to our antarctic dataset suggested that it was of autochthonous origin in this study re emphasizing that one cannot assign humic like fluorophores as terrestrial just because their spectral features resemble that of terrestrially derived natural organic matter murphy et al 2018 the fact that the same ubiquitous humic like fluorophores were found in lake fryxell and the deep sargasso sea 4534 m fig s7 where sunlight penetration is negligible discussed below supports the biotic generation of these fluorophores although recent studies demonstrated that humic like fluorophores can also be generated directly from phytoplankton in axenic cultures castillo et al 2010 chari et al 2013 fukuzaki et al 2014 its contribution to the generation of the ubiquitous humic like fluorophores was likely low in our study considering the lack of relationships between nutrient concentrations and ubiquitous humic like fluorophore levels furthermore abiotic photochemical humification photohumification of dom in the presence of dissolved nitrogen has also been proposed kieber et al 1997 phootoxidation has been shown to cross link lipid precursors incorporating n free amine groups or ammonia into the newly formed marine humic substance and creating humic like fluorescence kieber et al 1997 although mcknight et al 1991 noted that photohumification would not occur in mcmurdo dry valleys antarctic lakes such as lake fryxell which are permanently ice covered and thus have low light intensities photon flux density is 3 10 μmol photons m 2 s 1 below the ice mcknight et al 1991 it could occur in lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes because most lakes are completely ice free during the 2 month austral summer and they can have two orders brighter light 600 μmol photons m 2 s 1 par up to 4 m tanabe et al 2008 than the lakes in mcmurdo dry valleys considering the richness of don fig 1 and the strong light intensity photohumification in the presence of don and din in some nutrient rich lakes may play an important role in abiotic transformation of microbial dom into distinct humic like fluorophores in the studied antarctic lakes the hpo in this study 40 4 8 5 was generally higher than previously reported for lakes in the mcmurdo dry valleys lake vida 12 17 lakes fryxell and hoare 17 24 and 16 18 as fulvic acid respectively and on ross island of east antarctica pony lake 23 34 aiken et al 1996 cawley et al 2016 2013 mcknight et al 1991 and similar to that of temperate clear water lakes table 1 of sato et al 2019 the higher hpo of our samples than of lakes in the mcmurdo dry valleys suggested the higher abundance of humic substances in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams despite prevailing photodegradation levels of the ubiquitous humic like components in the studied antarctic lakes may reflect the balance between the abiotic biotic production and photodegradation the ecological importance of cdom in antarctic lakes has been discussed mainly on its light shading effect for primary producers mcknight et al 1994 the formation of humic like fluorophores could be very important in regulating the depth of the euphotic zone to which visible wavelength radiation can penetrate this light shading role that cdom plays in the studied lakes will be assessed in the future when we will finish analyzing the light penetrating properties of each lake another important attribute of antarctic dom could be its influence on the position of the thermocline an example where dom substantially influenced the thermocline depth could be seen from the depth trend in the water temperature of a saline lake funazoko fig s2k the water temperature of lake funazoko showed a drastic change it was approximately 6 8 c at the surface increased to 20 c at 1 7 m then linearly decreased to 5 c at 6 8 m because the depth trend in conductivity did not correspond with that of temperature the stratification was not a halocline but a thermocline in contrast to other saline lakes fig s2 i j l the very high doc concentration 92 8 mg c l 1 and absorption coefficient a 254 96 1 m 1 of the surface water of this lake table 1 likely absorbed sunlight energy and increased the temperature the depth trend in the temperature was likely the balance between heating by the sunlight absorption and cooling by the atmosphere and deeper water 5 concluding remarks we found large compositional diversity in our antarctic samples in terms of doc don hpo uv absorbing characteristics suva254 and s275 295 and fdom compositions and such diversity was largely due to a different degree of photodegradation therefore the hypothesis that dom in the antarctic lakes and streams has large compositional diversity and such diversity is mostly introduced by external factors such as photodegradation was confirmed in our study in addition we proposed that there were common processes that generated the ubiquitous humic like components from c360 traditionally defined as peak n in the lützow holm bay and amundsen bay lakes and streams although we consider biotic and photochemical processes primarily responsible for the generation of the ubiquitous humic like components more studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms we note that the cdom and fdom mainly studied in this work only captured a small portion of the bulk dom future work should broaden the analytical window and incorporate chemical structural techniques such as high field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fourier transformed ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to unravel the unique chemistry of antarctic dom which should lead to a better understanding of the other pristine lakes in the world and

18619,fenton sludge fs generated from fenton process with high contents of iron and organic contaminants is regarded as a hazardous waste that requires to be properly disposed considering that fe iii compounds could stimulate dissimilatory iron reduction dir and enrich iron reducing bacteria irb that utilized fe iii as electron acceptor to oxidize organic matters fs was introduced in anaerobic digestion ad reactors for treating wastewater meanwhile disposing fs results showed that methane production and organic matters removal significantly increased with dosing fs from 0 to 2 4 g also a majority of organic matters involved in fs was mineralized including 38 5 of pahs removal humic acids ha with redox activity involved in fs might affect efficiency of dir after extracting ha from fs the rate and the extent of fe iii reduction of fs decreased by 33 2 and 13 9 respectively together with analysis of the electron exchange capacity of ha it suggested that the ha involved in fs might serve as an electron shuttle to effectively promote dir the increase of sludge conductivity and the enrichment of irbs in microbial communities with dosage of fs were in agreement with the above results graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton sludge anaerobic digestion dissimilatory iron reduction iron oxides humic acids 1 introduction fenton reaction using fe ii to catalyze h2o2 to generate oh radical at strongly acidic ph has been proven to be a promising advanced oxidation process in refractory wastewater treatment bautista et al 2008 compared with other advanced oxidation processes it has great potential of industrial popularization on account of its high efficiency and relatively low operating cost arslan alaton 2003 however fenton sludge fs generated from the neutralization of the effluent of fenton reaction involving high contents of iron organic contaminants et al therefore it has been listed as a hazardous waste in some countries which requires proper treatment prior to discharge benatti et al 2009 traditional methods such as combustion and landfill cannot eliminate the environmental risks of fs and possibly result in contaminant spread yoo et al 2001 considering that iron makes up as high as 20 40 dry weight of fs and mainly exists as insoluble ferric iron kishimoto et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the fe iii components in fs can be used as an iron source to stimulate dissimilatory iron reduction dir to enhance the anaerobic digestion ad performance during the dir fe iii oxides enrich iron reducing bacteria irb that utilizes insoluble fe iii as terminal electron acceptor to gain energy coupling of oxidizing a variety of substrates however it should be considered that there is a potential competition between irbs and methanogens for substrates such as acetate from the perspective of thermodynamics fe iii reduction 1410 kj mol gains more free energy than methanogenesis from 31 to 185 5 kj mol meaning that dir takes precedency over methanogenesis to capture electron donors which may result in decrease of methane production zhang et al 2009 overall several previous studies have showed positive effects on both organic matter removal and methane production with fe iii added it indicates that the promotion of dir to accelerate decomposing organic matters is superior to its competition with methanogenesis baek et al 2014 wang et al 2018 dong et al 2016 in addition organic matters om involved in fs are bonded with fe iii via adsorption and precipitation that likely decrease its bioavailability dir was also hypothesized to directly lead to the release of contaminants from the fe iii om complex which might accelerate the decomposition of the om in fs pan et al 2016 in our previous study wang et al 2017 fs was added in an ad system to enhance the ad performance based on the dir principle in which 65 3 om involved in fs was removed with biogas recovery as energy it was seemed that promoting the efficiency of dir may both improve the organics removal in ad and accelerate the decomposition of om in fs during dir pathway extracellular electron transfer from cells to insoluble fe iii is a critical step which is completed by the following pathway bird et al 2011 i via outer membrane c type cytochromes ii directly contact via extracellular nanowires such as pili iii electron shuttle or iv solubilization of fe iii by organic chelators it was reported that some redox active om with quinine hydroquinone moieties such as 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid aqds were capable of acting as electron shuttles to mediate the electron transfer between cells and iron oxide surface macdonald et al 2011 royer et al 2002 in this pathway electrons were firstly transferred from extracellular proteins of irbs to quinone moieties with producing hydroquinone and then hydroquinone further ferried electrons to reduce ferric oxides with quinone regenerated thus it was observed that adding aqds increased the rate and the extent of iron reduction in previous studies macdonald et al 2011 royer et al 2002 on the other hand the biogenic fe ii during dir takes secondary reactions including adsorption to iron oxide and precipitation of ferrous minerals e g feco3 fe3 po4 2 and fe3o4 to occupy surface sites of fe iii which may slow down the rate of dir royer et al 2002 organic complexants such as nta and ferrozine were reportedly capable of chelating with fe ii to lessen the negative effects of fe ii to improve the redcution of fe iii oxides royer et al 2002 humic acids ha a natural om presenting in many wastewater such as landfill leachate moravia et al 2013 paper wastewater et al was reported to mediate the extracellular electron transportation between cells and fe iii during dir chai et al 2007 stern et al 2018 on account of the presence of redox active hydroxyl carbonyl and quinone hydroquinone groups ha is capable of acting as electron shuttle as same as aqds which benefits for iron reduction also ha is able to chelate with fe ii to alleviate the biogenic fe ii adsorbed and precipitated on surface of fe iii making fe iii reduction continuously proceed based on above consideration an ha containing fs generated from treating landfill leachate was used to enhance ad in this study two independent experiments were designed to 1 investigate effects of the fs on the improvement of ad performance and 2 analyze effects of the ha of fs on the enhancement of dir during ad 2 methods 2 1 preparation of fenton sludge ha containing fs was derived from a fenton process treating landfill leachate dalian china the molar ratio of fe ii to h2o2 was 1 3 using 30 mmol l feso4 7h2o as the fe ii source after 24 h of static settlement the fs was harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm then stored at 4 c the obtained fs showed an amorphous form according to xrd spectrum fig s1 and seaction s1 main characteristics of this fs were listed in table 1 to investigate the effects of ha involved in fs on dir another type of fs was obtained through a process to extract ha from original fs labeled noha fs the detail method to extract ha was according with baglieri et al 2007 2 2 seed sludge seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a waste sludge treatment plant in dalian china total solid ts of the seed sludge was 60 8 0 2 g l mean standard deviation n 3 and ratio of volatile solid vs to ts was 56 3 2 3 sequencing batch experiment to investigate the effects of fenton sludge on the improvement of ad performance an artificial wastewater was used as feeding substrates in a sequencing batch experiment the initial composition per liter of the artificial wastewater was as follows glucose 2 40 g yeast extract 0 48 g milk powder songhuajiang taobao com china 2 00 g nh4cl 0 46 g kh2po4 0 10 g nahco3 5 00 g trace element solution 10 ml the composition of the trace element solution was described in our previous study zhao et al 2015 the cod and ph of this artificial wastewater were about 5000 mg l and 7 2 respectively four ad reactors each reactor had three parallels were conducted in cylindrical glass digesters internal diameter of 60 mm with a working volume of 240 ml each reactor received 30 ml of seed sludge as inoculum and 210 ml artificial wastewater as feed substances all reactors were operated with a sequencing batch operating mode each cycle was 24 h including the following steps feeding 0 5 h digesting 22 0 h settling 1 0 h and draining 0 5 h at the beginning of experiments 120 ml of the treated wastewater in supernate was firstly drawn out for analysis then 120 ml of the fresh artificial wastewater was pumped into the digester meaning a hrt of 48 h differently 0 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 g of original fs were added to the 120 ml fresh artificial wastewater every day for these four ad reactors labeled r0 r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively all the four reactors were conducted at 37 c in a thermostatic incubator 2 4 design batch experiments and sampling another batch experiment for bio reduction of fe iii test was conducted to investigate the effects of ha of fs on dir the batch experiment containing three groups each group had three parallels was set up in glass serum bottles with a working volume of 100 ml a fs free as control a group with noha fs added and a group with ha fs original fs added the dosage of these two kinds of fs was counted with fe at a final concentration of 10 mm an artificial medium was used for the fe iii reduction experiments the composition of the artificial medium was as follows 20 mg l nacl 5 mg l mgso4 5 mg l kcl 0 95 mg l nh4cl 0 95 mg l kh2po4 1 ml l trace element solution mentioned above 50 mm sodium acetate as electron donors and 15 mm sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate sbes was used to exclude the influences of methanogenesis 100 ml of this medium was added to each bottle the inoculum was collected from a laboratory ad reactor then cultured with sodium acetate as the electron donor and fe oh 3 colloid to enrich irbs before use the sludge was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min then the sludge pellets were re suspended to the original volume with 0 1 m pbs and then centrifuged such process was repeated three times to remove organic matters as many as possible from the sludge inoculum was inoculated at a final concentration about 2000 mg l before the digestion the headspace and sludge of the bottles was aerated via nitrogen gas for 0 5 h to removed oxygen afterwards the bottles were sealed with teflon faced butyl rubber stoppers in which a hole was drilled to connect with a liquid sampling pipe 1 ml portion of suspension liquid was sampled to centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 5 min to harvest supernate then 1 ml 2 m hcl was added to this supernate for determination of aqueous fe ii another 1 ml portion of well mixed liquid was sampled then added 1 ml 6 m hcl for determination of total fe ii all bottles were operated in the dark at 37 2 c in an incubator 2 5 chemical analysis ts vs and tcod were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater clescerl 2011 ph was recorded using a ph

using another gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid tianmei gc 7900p fid the analytic methods of the gas chromatograph were performed according to the report by jiang et al 2007 a sequential extraction procedure for determine different form of iron in sludge was according to the method by poulton et al 2005 the total iron content of the fs was determined using inductively coupled plasma icp optima2000dv perkinelmer ferrous iron and total iron ion were analyzed by an adaptation of the ferrozine technique cooper et al 2000 element chemical states were further analyzed by

mode using a nicolet 5700 spectrometer 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the electron donor capacities edc and electron acceptor capacities eac of ha was measured by an an electrochemistry workstation chenhua co ltd chi650b shanghai china using a three electrode cell the cell consisted of a vitreous carbon with a projected surface area of 2 25 cm2 as working electrode an ag agcl as

oxidation meo respectively the mediators were diquat dibromide monohydrate dq for mer and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt abts for meo potentials were measured vs ag agcl but were reported vs she the ha samples were first spiked to in anoxic buffer solution ph 7 0 1 m phosphate 0 1 m kcl to final concentrations of 1 or 4 g l then a 500 μl of this suspension was spiked to the cells to measure the transferred amount of electrons by chronoamperometry ca measurements via the methods proposed by aeschbacher et al 2010 2 6 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing after 24 days experiments of sequencing batch ad systems 10 ml of sludge samples were collected to analyze microbial communities and functional genes via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing the detailed methods of dna extraction pcr and sequencing are provided in the support information 2 7 calculation methane production rate mpr ml g cod d was calculated by the following formula 1 1 mpr v m e t h a n e t c o d i n f l u e n t t c o d f s where v methane is the volume of daily methane production ml tcod influent is the tcod of daily influent g d tcod fs is the tcod of fs dosed in the influent g d acidification efficiency ae was evaluated by the following formula 2 2 a e t c o d v f a s t c o d m e t h a n e t c o d i n f l u e n t t c o d f s 100 where tcod vfas is the concentration of effluent vfas mg cod and cod methane is the concentration of methane mg cod the equivalent relationship between cod and vfas was according to zhao et al 2017 vs reduction of fs was calculated by the following formula 3 3 vs reduction vs theoretical increment vs actual increment vs theoretical increment 100 4 vs theoretical increment vs fs mfs t where vs reduction is volatile organic solid reduction of fs added into the reactor by anaerobic digestion vs theoretical increment means that the addition of fs into the reactor containing 120 2 mg g vs created an increment of vs to the reactor it is calculated by formula 4 where vs fs means the vs contained in fs 120 2 mg g m fs means the daily dosage of fs in each reactor 0 0 6 1 2 g 2 4 g t means the numbers of days of dosing fs vs actual increment is the difference between vs of fs added reactor r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 and vs of r0 reactor therefore the difference between vs theoretical increment and vs actual increment the part of vs in fs that was degraded during anaerobic digestion ts reduction was calculated with the same method of vs reduction 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of ad performance with fs supplement fig 1 a showed the effluent cod of the four ad reactors with dosages of fs of 0 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 g during the digestion respectively after a period for adaptation the operation of reactors tended to stability finally the effluent cod were 2637 5 1862 0 1692 2 and 1408 8 mg l for r0 r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively with the total cod removal rates including the cod of both wastewater and fs added of 47 3 68 2 74 8 and 83 2 respectively fig 1b it indicated that the organics removal rates of the three fs added reactors increased by 20 9 27 5 and 36 0 compared with r0 similar results had been reported by baek et al 2015 who observed an enhanced organic removal rate of dairy wastewater with ferric oxyhydroxide and magnetite supplement the results was likely related to fe iii components of fs that participated in dir to accelerate the decomposition of organic matters methane production of four reactors was similar to the cod removal profiles during the last 8 days the daily methane yield was generally stable in the four reactors with an average of 43 5 67 0 75 7 and 92 4 ml d respectively it meant that methane production was improved along with increasing fs dosage considering om involved in fs might be converted into methane the methane yield per unit cod was calculated as shown in table 2 the daily methane production per unit cod of the four reactors averaged 72 5 95 5 94 1 and 91 6 ml methane g codtotal d respectively it implied that the increased methane production was primarily resulted from the improvement of organic decomposition by dir to produce appropriate substrates available for methane production accordingly the total vfas in the four ad reactors were 1340 3 796 6 1027 9 and 1835 3 mg l respectively fig 2 as intermediates of ad vfas produced from hydrolytic acidogenesis might be finally converted to methane as a result an obviously increase of methane production was observed in the fs added reactors together with vfas and methane production the acidification efficiency ae of the four reactors were 54 5 64 2 69 6 and 93 8 respectively indicating that the entire ad was accelerated with dosing fs besides the components of vfas were significantly different in the four ad reactors with the increase of daily dosage of fs from 0 to 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 g the content of propionate gradually decreased from 42 4 to 33 3 7 8 and 0 5 respectively instead the ratio of acetate of these four groups increased from 31 6 to 49 6 77 2 and 89 1 considering the thermodynamical barrier of propionate decomposition δg 76 1 kj mol the vfas composed of less propionate and more acetate was beneficial for methanogenesis schmidt and ahring 1993 during the digestion the organic matters involved in fs was also biodegraded by microbial decomposition as shown in table 3 78 8 85 6 of vs involved in the dosed fs was degraded with 76 0 80 3 of ts removal in fs the release of om from fs during the dir was a potential reason for such high vs reduction rate in fs most om was bonded stably with iron oxides which could decrease the bioavailability of om and slow down its microbial decay however it was reported that dir could decrease the carbon sequestration in fe om complexes via reducing fe oxides and therefore released om for microbial degradation pan et al 2016 besides a variety of macromolecules and toxic substances such as long chain fatty acids pyridine benzpyrole plasticizer pahs detected in fs fig s2 and table s1 were also degraded during ad which likely lessen their ecological risks taking pahs as an example the removal ratio of pahs with different rings and molecular weight ranged from 8 8 to 58 5 totally 38 5 of pahs was removed from the original 386 8 ng gfs dry weight to 247 5 ng gfs after digestion table s2 concentration of ferrous iron fig 3 reflected the extent of dir at the end of experiment most fe iii involved in fs was reduced into fe ii with a final concentration of 2477 0 mg l for r0 6 4904 5 mg l for r1 2 and 7664 5 mg l for r2 4 it meant that the iron reduction rate of 78 7 93 3 and 90 3 in the three fs dosed reactors respectively fig 3a showed that the highest concentrations of ferrous iron released to the effluent of these three reactors were 10 2 57 1 83 6 and 246 1 mg l respectively with the increase of ph due to the degradation of organic acids in the days later the liquid fe ii concentration of the three reactors all decreased by the potential adsorption precipitation and chelation reaction of fe ii fig 1d according to the analysis on fe ii in sludge fe ii forms appeared as exchangeable 0 1 adsorbed 0 3 organic bounded 54 3 carbonate bounded 0 2 and mineral state 45 2 fig 3c actually it is unusual that the effluent ferrous iron concentration exceeds 50 mg l for most of well operated ad settings due to the precipitation of ferrous iron peng et al 2014 yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 in this study the obviously higher ferrous iron in the reactors with the fs dosage was likely related with the chelation of some organic matters fig 3c such as ha in fs which helped alleviate the adsorption precipitation of fe ii produced on the surface of fe iii thereby increasing the fe ii content of the effluent was well as improving dir to continuously occur 3 2 effects of ha in fenton sludge on dir process as mentioned above dir was likely the reason for improving the ad performance and reduction of fs to clarify the roles of ha of fs on dir ha was extracted from fs referred as noha fs and then a batch ad reactor with adding noha fs was conducted to investigate the fe iii reduction as comparison two parallel ad reactors were operated with adding the original fs named as ha fs and with no fs addition named control respectively 3 2 1 characterization of fs before and after ha extraction according to xps spectra fig 4 o c fe na s were the main elements of both these two fs after extracting ha the carbon atomic content peak located at 284 0 ev decreased from 37 7 to 26 4 which was a main component of ha the fe 2p spectra of two fs samples both showed two peaks at 724 6 ev and 711 2 ev which corresponded to the fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 spin orbit peaks of ferric iron ponomar et al 2017 wang et al 2017 differently noha fs showed a relatively smooth curve while many tiny noise signals emerged in the profile of ha fs which indicated that the intensity of fe was weaker and the fe content was lower on the surface in ha fs considering that ha extraction did not change the content of fe iii of fs the decrease of fe iii intensity in xps spectra suggested that iron oxides were partly covered by organic matters such as ha to decrease its response in the xps spectra however the coverage of ha on fe iii was just a signal that ha was chelated with or adsorbed on fe iii which allowed ha to transfer electron to fe iii surface so that enhanced the efficiency of dir ftir spectrum revealed the compositions of function groups of noha fs ha fs and the ha extracted fig 5 a the grey circle showed the common function groups between noha fs and ha fs the peak at 680 cm 1 was assigned to fe o asymmetric vibrations which belonged to the iron oxides in both two samples doelsch et al 2001 1130 cm 1 was assigned to c o stretching vibration of some oms involved in fs in case of the blue circles according to the series peaks located in the region of 1400 1708 cm 1 and 2750 3000 cm 1 they exhibited the common function groups between ha fs original fs and ha extracted from it namely these function groups were all disappeared in noha fs after the extraction the peak at 1402 cm 1 was assigned to c h bending vibration gu et al 1995 1450 cm 1 1540 cm 1 were assigned to cc stretching vibration of aromatic structure doelsch et al 2001 duarte et al 2003 the peaks at 1650 cm 1 1702 cm 1 was assigned to co stretching vibration doelsch et al 2001 duarte et al 2003 liu et al 2014 all these function groups were contributed from quinonyl moieties which confirmed the existence in the original fs ha fs and the ha extracted by the way the peaks at 2750 cm 1 to 3000 cm 1 were assigned to c h stretching vibration belonging to structure of fatty chain which was the host structure of ha amir et al 2010 liu et al 2014 specially a peak at 3470 cm 1 only appeared in the ha fs which was assigned to oh stretch of fe oh doelsch et al 2001 it was in agreement with the results of fe2p xps spectra suggesting a chelation of fe with hydroxyl in ha 3 2 2 roles of ha in fs in the microorganism mediated iron reduction fig 6 showed the profiles of fe ii generated from the reduction of fe iii in the initial 36 h the fe iii reduction of both ha fs and noha fs groups was slow afterwards 36 110 h the reduction of fe iii significantly increased with a rate of 7 38 mg fe ii h for ha fs while it was only 4 93 mg fe ii h for noha fs at the end of the experiment the total biogenic fe ii in the ha fs group was 366 1 mg l meaning 65 4 of fe iii dosed was reduced into fe ii comparatively the fe ii generation was 288 1 mg l with a reduction fe iii rate of 51 5 in noha fs these results suggested that the presence of ha in fs promoted both the rate and the extent of dir a potential reason was related that ha might serve as a shuttle to transport electron between cells and fe iii quinine hydroquinone moieties of ha were believed electro active and capable of participating in the microbial dir during the dir mediated by ha quinone accepted electrons from irb to generate hydroquinone and then fe iii captured electrons from hydroquinone to generate fe ii with regeneration of quinone eusterhues et al 2014 shimizu et al 2013 fig 5b showed typical current time responses for the successive additions of ha for eac determination a negative potential was imposed on the working electrodes as ha was injected into the system a cathodic current was generated suggesting that the redox active moieties in ha were directly reduced at working electrode the amount of electrons transferred during the redox process were quantified by integration of current caused by ha the edc determination procedure was similar to the eac except a positive potential was imposed on the work electrodes in which an anodic current was generated after calculation edc and eac of ha were 12 58 μmol e g ha and 6 11 μmol e g ha respectively confirming the redox capacity of ha in electron shuttle between irb and fe iii in the other hand the chelation of ha with fe ii could alleviate the precipitation and adsorption of fe ii on the surface of fe iii oxide to benefit dir to continuously proceed an evidence was that ha significantly increased the fe ii dispersed in the aqueous phase as a result the biogenic aqueous fe ii was 124 1 mg l in the presence of ha while it was only 3 9 mg l in the nofs ha group in agreement royer et al 2002 reported that ha could function as both iron chelator and electron shuttle to participate in dir the improved dir with presence of ha might increase the release of om from fs and accelerate the consumption of organic substances as electron donors of dir 3 3 other potential mechanism for improving dir of fs beside the effects of ha on dir eps on the biofilm also played a key role in electron transfer and mass transfer between microorganism and extracellular environment shi et al 2016 polysaccharides and protein are main components of eps which almost accounted for 70 80 of eps sheng et al 2010 sheng and yu 2006 the dosage of fs in the ad reactors also changed their composition of eps of sludge as shown in fig 7 a the concentrations of polysaccharide protein of these four reactors increased from 2 5 0 3 to 6 1 1 2 8 3 2 0 and 8 5 6 9 mg g vss respectively the polysaccharide of eps with high cohesiveness made it easy to adhere to the surface of fe iii oxides of fs and the amino acids of proteins usually presenting negative charge also were easily bonded with multivalent cations like fe iii and fe ii through electrostatic force jang et al 2001 as a result eps surrounding the outside of microbial could closely combine with fe iii to benefit the electron exchange between microorganism and fe iii moreover some specific types of protein like substrates such as cytochrome contained in eps was capable of carrying electron to surface of fe iii to produce fe ii ye et al 2018 in our previous study adding both fe2o3 and fe oh 3 in ad promoted the secretion of polysaccharides and protein of eps to enhance the electron exchange capacity of eps wang et al 2018 various types of electron transportation involved in ad led to the formation of conductive sludge zhao et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 the conductivity of the sludge of r0 was 6 5 us cm while 51 7 90 0 and 115 3 us cm in r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively meaning the conductivity of the sludge increased by 6 9 folds for r0 6 12 8 folds for r1 2 and 16 7 folds for r2 4 respectively considering the conductivity of fs itself 3 0 us cm was lower than all sludge in the ad reactor the increase of sludge conductivity was not directly contributed from fs it was reported that irbs such as geobacter possessed extracellular conductive pili which was responsible for extracellular electron transfer to insoluble fe iii oxides malvankar et al 2011 richter et al 2009 these electrically conductive pili exhibited a high and metal like conductance which seemed to increase the conductivity of sludge accordingly irbs such as clostridium xivb and clostridium iv holding type iv pili were enriched in the fs added reactors li et al 2019 pham et al 2003 fig 8 besides desulfovibrio another typical irb was the dominant specie accounting for 16 2 for r0 6 18 7 for r1 2 and 26 1 for r2 4 respectively its abundance also increased with fs added heidelberg et al 2004 park et al 2008 pohorelic et al 2002 totally the abundances of these irbs accounted for 20 2 20 3 and 27 1 in r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively while these irbs abundance was less than 1 in r0 the increase of irbs abundance with adding fs was in agreement with the higher performances of ad and high extent of dir 4 conclusions fs effectively promoted the ad performances in terms of methane production and organics removal it benefited from that fe iii of fs could stimulate dir by enriching irbs that utilized organic matters as substrates meanwhile a majority of contaminants including pahs in fs was decomposed during ad ha involved in fs was confirmed to accelerate the efficiency of dir through acting as electron shuttle between cells and fe iii and through the chelation with fe ii to remove biogenic fe ii on the surface of fe iii as a result more than 90 of the fe iii could be reduced into fe ii through dir process besides enhanced secretion of eps and higher conductive sludge in fs added reactors were in agreement with the improved ad performance microbial community analysis showed that various types of irbs were enriched which were responsible for the high extent of fe iii reduction in the fs added reactors in this study we proposed an economical and environmentally friendly method to dispose the fs via biological digestion it was speculated that fs generated from different wastewater treatment formed diverse types of fe om complex which might affect its function on ad performance acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial

18619,fenton sludge fs generated from fenton process with high contents of iron and organic contaminants is regarded as a hazardous waste that requires to be properly disposed considering that fe iii compounds could stimulate dissimilatory iron reduction dir and enrich iron reducing bacteria irb that utilized fe iii as electron acceptor to oxidize organic matters fs was introduced in anaerobic digestion ad reactors for treating wastewater meanwhile disposing fs results showed that methane production and organic matters removal significantly increased with dosing fs from 0 to 2 4 g also a majority of organic matters involved in fs was mineralized including 38 5 of pahs removal humic acids ha with redox activity involved in fs might affect efficiency of dir after extracting ha from fs the rate and the extent of fe iii reduction of fs decreased by 33 2 and 13 9 respectively together with analysis of the electron exchange capacity of ha it suggested that the ha involved in fs might serve as an electron shuttle to effectively promote dir the increase of sludge conductivity and the enrichment of irbs in microbial communities with dosage of fs were in agreement with the above results graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton sludge anaerobic digestion dissimilatory iron reduction iron oxides humic acids 1 introduction fenton reaction using fe ii to catalyze h2o2 to generate oh radical at strongly acidic ph has been proven to be a promising advanced oxidation process in refractory wastewater treatment bautista et al 2008 compared with other advanced oxidation processes it has great potential of industrial popularization on account of its high efficiency and relatively low operating cost arslan alaton 2003 however fenton sludge fs generated from the neutralization of the effluent of fenton reaction involving high contents of iron organic contaminants et al therefore it has been listed as a hazardous waste in some countries which requires proper treatment prior to discharge benatti et al 2009 traditional methods such as combustion and landfill cannot eliminate the environmental risks of fs and possibly result in contaminant spread yoo et al 2001 considering that iron makes up as high as 20 40 dry weight of fs and mainly exists as insoluble ferric iron kishimoto et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the fe iii components in fs can be used as an iron source to stimulate dissimilatory iron reduction dir to enhance the anaerobic digestion ad performance during the dir fe iii oxides enrich iron reducing bacteria irb that utilizes insoluble fe iii as terminal electron acceptor to gain energy coupling of oxidizing a variety of substrates however it should be considered that there is a potential competition between irbs and methanogens for substrates such as acetate from the perspective of thermodynamics fe iii reduction 1410 kj mol gains more free energy than methanogenesis from 31 to 185 5 kj mol meaning that dir takes precedency over methanogenesis to capture electron donors which may result in decrease of methane production zhang et al 2009 overall several previous studies have showed positive effects on both organic matter removal and methane production with fe iii added it indicates that the promotion of dir to accelerate decomposing organic matters is superior to its competition with methanogenesis baek et al 2014 wang et al 2018 dong et al 2016 in addition organic matters om involved in fs are bonded with fe iii via adsorption and precipitation that likely decrease its bioavailability dir was also hypothesized to directly lead to the release of contaminants from the fe iii om complex which might accelerate the decomposition of the om in fs pan et al 2016 in our previous study wang et al 2017 fs was added in an ad system to enhance the ad performance based on the dir principle in which 65 3 om involved in fs was removed with biogas recovery as energy it was seemed that promoting the efficiency of dir may both improve the organics removal in ad and accelerate the decomposition of om in fs during dir pathway extracellular electron transfer from cells to insoluble fe iii is a critical step which is completed by the following pathway bird et al 2011 i via outer membrane c type cytochromes ii directly contact via extracellular nanowires such as pili iii electron shuttle or iv solubilization of fe iii by organic chelators it was reported that some redox active om with quinine hydroquinone moieties such as 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonic acid aqds were capable of acting as electron shuttles to mediate the electron transfer between cells and iron oxide surface macdonald et al 2011 royer et al 2002 in this pathway electrons were firstly transferred from extracellular proteins of irbs to quinone moieties with producing hydroquinone and then hydroquinone further ferried electrons to reduce ferric oxides with quinone regenerated thus it was observed that adding aqds increased the rate and the extent of iron reduction in previous studies macdonald et al 2011 royer et al 2002 on the other hand the biogenic fe ii during dir takes secondary reactions including adsorption to iron oxide and precipitation of ferrous minerals e g feco3 fe3 po4 2 and fe3o4 to occupy surface sites of fe iii which may slow down the rate of dir royer et al 2002 organic complexants such as nta and ferrozine were reportedly capable of chelating with fe ii to lessen the negative effects of fe ii to improve the redcution of fe iii oxides royer et al 2002 humic acids ha a natural om presenting in many wastewater such as landfill leachate moravia et al 2013 paper wastewater et al was reported to mediate the extracellular electron transportation between cells and fe iii during dir chai et al 2007 stern et al 2018 on account of the presence of redox active hydroxyl carbonyl and quinone hydroquinone groups ha is capable of acting as electron shuttle as same as aqds which benefits for iron reduction also ha is able to chelate with fe ii to alleviate the biogenic fe ii adsorbed and precipitated on surface of fe iii making fe iii reduction continuously proceed based on above consideration an ha containing fs generated from treating landfill leachate was used to enhance ad in this study two independent experiments were designed to 1 investigate effects of the fs on the improvement of ad performance and 2 analyze effects of the ha of fs on the enhancement of dir during ad 2 methods 2 1 preparation of fenton sludge ha containing fs was derived from a fenton process treating landfill leachate dalian china the molar ratio of fe ii to h2o2 was 1 3 using 30 mmol l feso4 7h2o as the fe ii source after 24 h of static settlement the fs was harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 rpm then stored at 4 c the obtained fs showed an amorphous form according to xrd spectrum fig s1 and seaction s1 main characteristics of this fs were listed in table 1 to investigate the effects of ha involved in fs on dir another type of fs was obtained through a process to extract ha from original fs labeled noha fs the detail method to extract ha was according with baglieri et al 2007 2 2 seed sludge seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a waste sludge treatment plant in dalian china total solid ts of the seed sludge was 60 8 0 2 g l mean standard deviation n 3 and ratio of volatile solid vs to ts was 56 3 2 3 sequencing batch experiment to investigate the effects of fenton sludge on the improvement of ad performance an artificial wastewater was used as feeding substrates in a sequencing batch experiment the initial composition per liter of the artificial wastewater was as follows glucose 2 40 g yeast extract 0 48 g milk powder songhuajiang taobao com china 2 00 g nh4cl 0 46 g kh2po4 0 10 g nahco3 5 00 g trace element solution 10 ml the composition of the trace element solution was described in our previous study zhao et al 2015 the cod and ph of this artificial wastewater were about 5000 mg l and 7 2 respectively four ad reactors each reactor had three parallels were conducted in cylindrical glass digesters internal diameter of 60 mm with a working volume of 240 ml each reactor received 30 ml of seed sludge as inoculum and 210 ml artificial wastewater as feed substances all reactors were operated with a sequencing batch operating mode each cycle was 24 h including the following steps feeding 0 5 h digesting 22 0 h settling 1 0 h and draining 0 5 h at the beginning of experiments 120 ml of the treated wastewater in supernate was firstly drawn out for analysis then 120 ml of the fresh artificial wastewater was pumped into the digester meaning a hrt of 48 h differently 0 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 g of original fs were added to the 120 ml fresh artificial wastewater every day for these four ad reactors labeled r0 r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively all the four reactors were conducted at 37 c in a thermostatic incubator 2 4 design batch experiments and sampling another batch experiment for bio reduction of fe iii test was conducted to investigate the effects of ha of fs on dir the batch experiment containing three groups each group had three parallels was set up in glass serum bottles with a working volume of 100 ml a fs free as control a group with noha fs added and a group with ha fs original fs added the dosage of these two kinds of fs was counted with fe at a final concentration of 10 mm an artificial medium was used for the fe iii reduction experiments the composition of the artificial medium was as follows 20 mg l nacl 5 mg l mgso4 5 mg l kcl 0 95 mg l nh4cl 0 95 mg l kh2po4 1 ml l trace element solution mentioned above 50 mm sodium acetate as electron donors and 15 mm sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate sbes was used to exclude the influences of methanogenesis 100 ml of this medium was added to each bottle the inoculum was collected from a laboratory ad reactor then cultured with sodium acetate as the electron donor and fe oh 3 colloid to enrich irbs before use the sludge was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min then the sludge pellets were re suspended to the original volume with 0 1 m pbs and then centrifuged such process was repeated three times to remove organic matters as many as possible from the sludge inoculum was inoculated at a final concentration about 2000 mg l before the digestion the headspace and sludge of the bottles was aerated via nitrogen gas for 0 5 h to removed oxygen afterwards the bottles were sealed with teflon faced butyl rubber stoppers in which a hole was drilled to connect with a liquid sampling pipe 1 ml portion of suspension liquid was sampled to centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 5 min to harvest supernate then 1 ml 2 m hcl was added to this supernate for determination of aqueous fe ii another 1 ml portion of well mixed liquid was sampled then added 1 ml 6 m hcl for determination of total fe ii all bottles were operated in the dark at 37 2 c in an incubator 2 5 chemical analysis ts vs and tcod were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater clescerl 2011 ph was recorded using a ph analyzer denver instrument ub 10 denver the extracellular polymeric substance eps of the anaerobic sludge were extracted using the cation exchange resin cer technique cer 20 50 mesh 732 001 7 according to frølund et al 1996 proteins were analyzed with lowry s method using bovine serum albumin as a standard solution frolund et al 1995 polysaccharide was measured with the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as a standard solution masuko et al 2005 the volume of biogas collected by the gas sampling bag was measured by a syringe the ch4 proportion of biogas was measured using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector tcd tianmei gc 7900p tcd zhao et al 2015 short chain volatile fatty acids vfas including acetate propionate butyrate and valerate were analyzed using another gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid tianmei gc 7900p fid the analytic methods of the gas chromatograph were performed according to the report by jiang et al 2007 a sequential extraction procedure for determine different form of iron in sludge was according to the method by poulton et al 2005 the total iron content of the fs was determined using inductively coupled plasma icp optima2000dv perkinelmer ferrous iron and total iron ion were analyzed by an adaptation of the ferrozine technique cooper et al 2000 element chemical states were further analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermofisher an electrochemical workstation zhenhua chi1030c china equipped with three probes system was used to analyze the conductivity of the suspended sludge the method about measurement and calculation of conductivity of sludge was referred to zhao et al 2016 a gas chromatography mass spectrometry agilent gc7890 5975msd equipped with a 50 m capillary column varian cp sil 8 cb 50 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm operating in electron impact ionization were used to analyze the macromolecular organic matter including pahs in fs detail method for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs was according to wang et al 2015 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker vertex 70 was recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 in transmission mode using a nicolet 5700 spectrometer 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the electron donor capacities edc and electron acceptor capacities eac of ha was measured by an an electrochemistry workstation chenhua co ltd chi650b shanghai china using a three electrode cell the cell consisted of a vitreous carbon with a projected surface area of 2 25 cm2 as working electrode an ag agcl as reference electrode and a platinum wire electrode as counter electrode the electrode was equilibrated to the desired potentials eh 0 49 v in mediated electrochemical reduction mer and eh 0 61 v in oxidation meo respectively the mediators were diquat dibromide monohydrate dq for mer and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt abts for meo potentials were measured vs ag agcl but were reported vs she the ha samples were first spiked to in anoxic buffer solution ph 7 0 1 m phosphate 0 1 m kcl to final concentrations of 1 or 4 g l then a 500 μl of this suspension was spiked to the cells to measure the transferred amount of electrons by chronoamperometry ca measurements via the methods proposed by aeschbacher et al 2010 2 6 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing after 24 days experiments of sequencing batch ad systems 10 ml of sludge samples were collected to analyze microbial communities and functional genes via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing the detailed methods of dna extraction pcr and sequencing are provided in the support information 2 7 calculation methane production rate mpr ml g cod d was calculated by the following formula 1 1 mpr v m e t h a n e t c o d i n f l u e n t t c o d f s where v methane is the volume of daily methane production ml tcod influent is the tcod of daily influent g d tcod fs is the tcod of fs dosed in the influent g d acidification efficiency ae was evaluated by the following formula 2 2 a e t c o d v f a s t c o d m e t h a n e t c o d i n f l u e n t t c o d f s 100 where tcod vfas is the concentration of effluent vfas mg cod and cod methane is the concentration of methane mg cod the equivalent relationship between cod and vfas was according to zhao et al 2017 vs reduction of fs was calculated by the following formula 3 3 vs reduction vs theoretical increment vs actual increment vs theoretical increment 100 4 vs theoretical increment vs fs mfs t where vs reduction is volatile organic solid reduction of fs added into the reactor by anaerobic digestion vs theoretical increment means that the addition of fs into the reactor containing 120 2 mg g vs created an increment of vs to the reactor it is calculated by formula 4 where vs fs means the vs contained in fs 120 2 mg g m fs means the daily dosage of fs in each reactor 0 0 6 1 2 g 2 4 g t means the numbers of days of dosing fs vs actual increment is the difference between vs of fs added reactor r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 and vs of r0 reactor therefore the difference between vs theoretical increment and vs actual increment the part of vs in fs that was degraded during anaerobic digestion ts reduction was calculated with the same method of vs reduction 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of ad performance with fs supplement fig 1 a showed the effluent cod of the four ad reactors with dosages of fs of 0 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 g during the digestion respectively after a period for adaptation the operation of reactors tended to stability finally the effluent cod were 2637 5 1862 0 1692 2 and 1408 8 mg l for r0 r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively with the total cod removal rates including the cod of both wastewater and fs added of 47 3 68 2 74 8 and 83 2 respectively fig 1b it indicated that the organics removal rates of the three fs added reactors increased by 20 9 27 5 and 36 0 compared with r0 similar results had been reported by baek et al 2015 who observed an enhanced organic removal rate of dairy wastewater with ferric oxyhydroxide and magnetite supplement the results was likely related to fe iii components of fs that participated in dir to accelerate the decomposition of organic matters methane production of four reactors was similar to the cod removal profiles during the last 8 days the daily methane yield was generally stable in the four reactors with an average of 43 5 67 0 75 7 and 92 4 ml d respectively it meant that methane production was improved along with increasing fs dosage considering om involved in fs might be converted into methane the methane yield per unit cod was calculated as shown in table 2 the daily methane production per unit cod of the four reactors averaged 72 5 95 5 94 1 and 91 6 ml methane g codtotal d respectively it implied that the increased methane production was primarily resulted from the improvement of organic decomposition by dir to produce appropriate substrates available for methane production accordingly the total vfas in the four ad reactors were 1340 3 796 6 1027 9 and 1835 3 mg l respectively fig 2 as intermediates of ad vfas produced from hydrolytic acidogenesis might be finally converted to methane as a result an obviously increase of methane production was observed in the fs added reactors together with vfas and methane production the acidification efficiency ae of the four reactors were 54 5 64 2 69 6 and 93 8 respectively indicating that the entire ad was accelerated with dosing fs besides the components of vfas were significantly different in the four ad reactors with the increase of daily dosage of fs from 0 to 0 6 1 2 and 2 4 g the content of propionate gradually decreased from 42 4 to 33 3 7 8 and 0 5 respectively instead the ratio of acetate of these four groups increased from 31 6 to 49 6 77 2 and 89 1 considering the thermodynamical barrier of propionate decomposition δg 76 1 kj mol the vfas composed of less propionate and more acetate was beneficial for methanogenesis schmidt and ahring 1993 during the digestion the organic matters involved in fs was also biodegraded by microbial decomposition as shown in table 3 78 8 85 6 of vs involved in the dosed fs was degraded with 76 0 80 3 of ts removal in fs the release of om from fs during the dir was a potential reason for such high vs reduction rate in fs most om was bonded stably with iron oxides which could decrease the bioavailability of om and slow down its microbial decay however it was reported that dir could decrease the carbon sequestration in fe om complexes via reducing fe oxides and therefore released om for microbial degradation pan et al 2016 besides a variety of macromolecules and toxic substances such as long chain fatty acids pyridine benzpyrole plasticizer pahs detected in fs fig s2 and table s1 were also degraded during ad which likely lessen their ecological risks taking pahs as an example the removal ratio of pahs with different rings and molecular weight ranged from 8 8 to 58 5 totally 38 5 of pahs was removed from the original 386 8 ng gfs dry weight to 247 5 ng gfs after digestion table s2 concentration of ferrous iron fig 3 reflected the extent of dir at the end of experiment most fe iii involved in fs was reduced into fe ii with a final concentration of 2477 0 mg l for r0 6 4904 5 mg l for r1 2 and 7664 5 mg l for r2 4 it meant that the iron reduction rate of 78 7 93 3 and 90 3 in the three fs dosed reactors respectively fig 3a showed that the highest concentrations of ferrous iron released to the effluent of these three reactors were 10 2 57 1 83 6 and 246 1 mg l respectively with the increase of ph due to the degradation of organic acids in the days later the liquid fe ii concentration of the three reactors all decreased by the potential adsorption precipitation and chelation reaction of fe ii fig 1d according to the analysis on fe ii in sludge fe ii forms appeared as exchangeable 0 1 adsorbed 0 3 organic bounded 54 3 carbonate bounded 0 2 and mineral state 45 2 fig 3c actually it is unusual that the effluent ferrous iron concentration exceeds 50 mg l for most of well operated ad settings due to the precipitation of ferrous iron peng et al 2014 yu et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 in this study the obviously higher ferrous iron in the reactors with the fs dosage was likely related with the chelation of some organic matters fig 3c such as ha in fs which helped alleviate the adsorption precipitation of fe ii produced on the surface of fe iii thereby increasing the fe ii content of the effluent was well as improving dir to continuously occur 3 2 effects of ha in fenton sludge on dir process as mentioned above dir was likely the reason for improving the ad performance and reduction of fs to clarify the roles of ha of fs on dir ha was extracted from fs referred as noha fs and then a batch ad reactor with adding noha fs was conducted to investigate the fe iii reduction as comparison two parallel ad reactors were operated with adding the original fs named as ha fs and with no fs addition named control respectively 3 2 1 characterization of fs before and after ha extraction according to xps spectra fig 4 o c fe na s were the main elements of both these two fs after extracting ha the carbon atomic content peak located at 284 0 ev decreased from 37 7 to 26 4 which was a main component of ha the fe 2p spectra of two fs samples both showed two peaks at 724 6 ev and 711 2 ev which corresponded to the fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 spin orbit peaks of ferric iron ponomar et al 2017 wang et al 2017 differently noha fs showed a relatively smooth curve while many tiny noise signals emerged in the profile of ha fs which indicated that the intensity of fe was weaker and the fe content was lower on the surface in ha fs considering that ha extraction did not change the content of fe iii of fs the decrease of fe iii intensity in xps spectra suggested that iron oxides were partly covered by organic matters such as ha to decrease its response in the xps spectra however the coverage of ha on fe iii was just a signal that ha was chelated with or adsorbed on fe iii which allowed ha to transfer electron to fe iii surface so that enhanced the efficiency of dir ftir spectrum revealed the compositions of function groups of noha fs ha fs and the ha extracted fig 5 a the grey circle showed the common function groups between noha fs and ha fs the peak at 680 cm 1 was assigned to fe o asymmetric vibrations which belonged to the iron oxides in both two samples doelsch et al 2001 1130 cm 1 was assigned to c o stretching vibration of some oms involved in fs in case of the blue circles according to the series peaks located in the region of 1400 1708 cm 1 and 2750 3000 cm 1 they exhibited the common function groups between ha fs original fs and ha extracted from it namely these function groups were all disappeared in noha fs after the extraction the peak at 1402 cm 1 was assigned to c h bending vibration gu et al 1995 1450 cm 1 1540 cm 1 were assigned to cc stretching vibration of aromatic structure doelsch et al 2001 duarte et al 2003 the peaks at 1650 cm 1 1702 cm 1 was assigned to co stretching vibration doelsch et al 2001 duarte et al 2003 liu et al 2014 all these function groups were contributed from quinonyl moieties which confirmed the existence in the original fs ha fs and the ha extracted by the way the peaks at 2750 cm 1 to 3000 cm 1 were assigned to c h stretching vibration belonging to structure of fatty chain which was the host structure of ha amir et al 2010 liu et al 2014 specially a peak at 3470 cm 1 only appeared in the ha fs which was assigned to oh stretch of fe oh doelsch et al 2001 it was in agreement with the results of fe2p xps spectra suggesting a chelation of fe with hydroxyl in ha 3 2 2 roles of ha in fs in the microorganism mediated iron reduction fig 6 showed the profiles of fe ii generated from the reduction of fe iii in the initial 36 h the fe iii reduction of both ha fs and noha fs groups was slow afterwards 36 110 h the reduction of fe iii significantly increased with a rate of 7 38 mg fe ii h for ha fs while it was only 4 93 mg fe ii h for noha fs at the end of the experiment the total biogenic fe ii in the ha fs group was 366 1 mg l meaning 65 4 of fe iii dosed was reduced into fe ii comparatively the fe ii generation was 288 1 mg l with a reduction fe iii rate of 51 5 in noha fs these results suggested that the presence of ha in fs promoted both the rate and the extent of dir a potential reason was related that ha might serve as a shuttle to transport electron between cells and fe iii quinine hydroquinone moieties of ha were believed electro active and capable of participating in the microbial dir during the dir mediated by ha quinone accepted electrons from irb to generate hydroquinone and then fe iii captured electrons from hydroquinone to generate fe ii with regeneration of quinone eusterhues et al 2014 shimizu et al 2013 fig 5b showed typical current time responses for the successive additions of ha for eac determination a negative potential was imposed on the working electrodes as ha was injected into the system a cathodic current was generated suggesting that the redox active moieties in ha were directly reduced at working electrode the amount of electrons transferred during the redox process were quantified by integration of current caused by ha the edc determination procedure was similar to the eac except a positive potential was imposed on the work electrodes in which an anodic current was generated after calculation edc and eac of ha were 12 58 μmol e g ha and 6 11 μmol e g ha respectively confirming the redox capacity of ha in electron shuttle between irb and fe iii in the other hand the chelation of ha with fe ii could alleviate the precipitation and adsorption of fe ii on the surface of fe iii oxide to benefit dir to continuously proceed an evidence was that ha significantly increased the fe ii dispersed in the aqueous phase as a result the biogenic aqueous fe ii was 124 1 mg l in the presence of ha while it was only 3 9 mg l in the nofs ha group in agreement royer et al 2002 reported that ha could function as both iron chelator and electron shuttle to participate in dir the improved dir with presence of ha might increase the release of om from fs and accelerate the consumption of organic substances as electron donors of dir 3 3 other potential mechanism for improving dir of fs beside the effects of ha on dir eps on the biofilm also played a key role in electron transfer and mass transfer between microorganism and extracellular environment shi et al 2016 polysaccharides and protein are main components of eps which almost accounted for 70 80 of eps sheng et al 2010 sheng and yu 2006 the dosage of fs in the ad reactors also changed their composition of eps of sludge as shown in fig 7 a the concentrations of polysaccharide protein of these four reactors increased from 2 5 0 3 to 6 1 1 2 8 3 2 0 and 8 5 6 9 mg g vss respectively the polysaccharide of eps with high cohesiveness made it easy to adhere to the surface of fe iii oxides of fs and the amino acids of proteins usually presenting negative charge also were easily bonded with multivalent cations like fe iii and fe ii through electrostatic force jang et al 2001 as a result eps surrounding the outside of microbial could closely combine with fe iii to benefit the electron exchange between microorganism and fe iii moreover some specific types of protein like substrates such as cytochrome contained in eps was capable of carrying electron to surface of fe iii to produce fe ii ye et al 2018 in our previous study adding both fe2o3 and fe oh 3 in ad promoted the secretion of polysaccharides and protein of eps to enhance the electron exchange capacity of eps wang et al 2018 various types of electron transportation involved in ad led to the formation of conductive sludge zhao et al 2016 as shown in fig 7 the conductivity of the sludge of r0 was 6 5 us cm while 51 7 90 0 and 115 3 us cm in r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively meaning the conductivity of the sludge increased by 6 9 folds for r0 6 12 8 folds for r1 2 and 16 7 folds for r2 4 respectively considering the conductivity of fs itself 3 0 us cm was lower than all sludge in the ad reactor the increase of sludge conductivity was not directly contributed from fs it was reported that irbs such as geobacter possessed extracellular conductive pili which was responsible for extracellular electron transfer to insoluble fe iii oxides malvankar et al 2011 richter et al 2009 these electrically conductive pili exhibited a high and metal like conductance which seemed to increase the conductivity of sludge accordingly irbs such as clostridium xivb and clostridium iv holding type iv pili were enriched in the fs added reactors li et al 2019 pham et al 2003 fig 8 besides desulfovibrio another typical irb was the dominant specie accounting for 16 2 for r0 6 18 7 for r1 2 and 26 1 for r2 4 respectively its abundance also increased with fs added heidelberg et al 2004 park et al 2008 pohorelic et al 2002 totally the abundances of these irbs accounted for 20 2 20 3 and 27 1 in r0 6 r1 2 and r2 4 respectively while these irbs abundance was less than 1 in r0 the increase of irbs abundance with adding fs was in agreement with the higher performances of ad and high extent of dir 4 conclusions fs effectively promoted the ad performances in terms of methane production and organics removal it benefited from that fe iii of fs could stimulate dir by enriching irbs that utilized organic matters as substrates meanwhile a majority of contaminants including pahs in fs was decomposed during ad ha involved in fs was confirmed to accelerate the efficiency of dir through acting as electron shuttle between cells and fe iii and through the chelation with fe ii to remove biogenic fe ii on the surface of fe iii as a result more than 90 of the fe iii could be reduced into fe ii through dir process besides enhanced secretion of eps and higher conductive sludge in fs added reactors were in agreement with the improved ad performance microbial community analysis showed that various types of irbs were enriched which were responsible for the high extent of fe iii reduction in the fs added reactors in this study we proposed an economical and environmentally friendly method to dispose the fs via biological digestion it was speculated that fs generated from different wastewater treatment formed diverse types of fe om complex which might affect its function on ad performance acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial
