5815,coastal aquifers are an important freshwater resource for significant portions of the global population understanding the dynamic relationship between aquifer recharge storage and discharge is fundamental for sustainable groundwater management here we present an expanded freshwater balance equation that considers the dynamic interaction between fresh groundwater and underlying saltwater through a respective storage term which may explain significant time lags in long term trends between recharge storage and discharge we demonstrate the presence of such a time lag and its effect on freshwater budget calculations with data from a major karst spring in florida we develop and validate a parsimonious aquifer model and show that our expanded water balance is consistent with an observed time lag on the order of 15 years between multi decadal averages of rainfall and spring discharge long term trends in precipitation are known to occur in many regions of the world and we expect our findings to have direct relevance for coastal aquifers at a global scale keywords coastal aquifers freshwater storage saltwater interaction groundwater depletion karst spring 1 introduction water balance and stream flow models relating aquifer recharge storage and discharge are fundamental for the management of freshwater resources alley et al 2002 gleeson et al 2016 long term trends in freshwater storage or discharge including pumping are used to assess groundwater depletion rates and the sustainability of aquifer exploitation e g green et al 2011 gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 reager et al 2016 different hypotheses to explain shifts in long term freshwater balances are possible including effects of pumping from the aquifer changes in land use and infiltration rates climatic changes affecting precipitation and or evapotranspiration et regime shifts in drainage behavior or combinations thereof for coastal aquifers the interaction between fresh and saltwater is an important mechanism that has been investigated from multiple perspectives including effects of sea level and groundwater storage changes on saltwater intrusion retreat kiro et al 2008 watson et al 2010 chang et al 2011 webb and howard 2011 ferguson and gleeson 2012 lu and werner 2013 rotzoll and fletcher 2013 as well as on stream flow for a hypothetical island masterson and garabedian 2007 besides changing sea levels lu and werner 2013 also investigated effects of changes in inland water levels studies on coastal aquifers also focus on variability in aquifer recharge michael et al 2005 van der velde et al 2006 freshwater pumping ferguson and gleeson 2012 and geochemical disequilibrium between fresh and marine waters morrissey et al 2010 sanford 2010 several of these studies discuss response time scales of different hydrological variables or closely related time lags between pairs of hydrological variables when a system is forced periodically it is recognized that hydrological response times for a single system can be drastically different depending on what hydrological variable is considered e g watson et al 2010 fewer studies directly focus on the freshwater balance of coastal aquifers under the influence of saltwater interaction and different drivers a numerical study of the gaza aquifer concludes that observed seawater intrusion and falling water levels in the aquifer can be attributed to groundwater pumping qahman and larabi 2006 exploring a quasi equilibrium analytical approach for the evolution of a sharp freshwater saltwater interface shows that changes in seawater volumes stored in a coastal aquifer may significantly affect groundwater level trends and hence the interpretation of freshwater balances morgan et al 2012 the authors further conclude that changes in seawater volumes should be routinely included in water balance studies of coastal aquifers but also that further research needs to better elucidate the relationships between hydraulic disequilibrium time lags and aquifer characteristics along these lines a numerical study of the dynamics of the freshwater volume stored in the aquifer of a small pacific island demonstrated that both recharge and pumping exert a strong control on the freshwater balance with hydraulic response time to pumping of 20 years post et al 2018 however existing modeling approaches for freshwater saltwater interaction are either numerical or quasi steady state such that case studies of freshwater balances explicitly accounting for interface movement are scarce and a generalized framework or expanded freshwater balance equation for coastal aquifers has not been established a fundamental component of all studies involving the interaction of freshwater and saltwater is the density difference causing a buoyancy effect of saltwater in an aquifer on an overlying lower density freshwater lens in the presence of a hydraulic connection between the saltwater body in the aquifer and the ocean i e excluding the opposite case of isolated terrestrial freshwater lenses laattoe et al 2017 this interaction affects the depth of the freshwater saltwater interface under hydraulic equilibrium and for a saltwater density consistent with seawater this is known as the ghyben herzberg principle and determines that a unit change in aquifer head leads to an approximately 40 times larger movement of the interface between fresh groundwater and the underlying saltwater michael et al 2005 thus small and persistent changes in observed water table elevations can be accompanied by large and hidden volumetric changes in freshwater storage fitts 2012 page 224 morgan et al 2012 post et al 2018 in general the hydraulic response time scale of aquifers with predominantly horizontal flow is known to be on the order of tr laq 2 saq taq where laq is a characteristic length scale of the aquifer saq is a storage coefficient and taq is aquifer transmissivity alley et al 2002 manga 1999 townley 1995 in coastal aquifers with a hydraulic connection to the ocean volumetric changes in freshwater storage may be composed of contributions due to 1 elastic deformation or confined component with saq 10 3 corresponding to specific storage multiplied by aquifer thickness 2 water table fluctuations or unconfined component with saq 0 1 corresponding to specific yield i e effective porosity near the water table and 3 saltwater interface movement or interface component with saq 1 corresponding to 40 times the effective porosity near the interface if the vertical resistance to flow is negligible fitts 2012 because the latter value is largest by at least an order of magnitude the hydraulic response time of a given aquifer may be drastically influenced by the presence or absence of a dynamic saltwater interface for example the hydraulic response time of a confined non coastal aquifer may be on the order of days but it may be on the order of years for the same aquifer under unconfined conditions however in the presence of dynamic saltwater interaction the aquifer response time could be raised to the order of decades here we introduce a generalized freshwater balance equation for aquifers with dynamic saltwater interaction i e containing temporally changing volumes of seawater we do not consider changes in sea level but show that multi decadal trends in aquifer recharge combined with the dynamic interaction of freshwater and saltwater at their interface may cause significant impacts on long term water balances of coastal aquifers we develop a parsimonious analytical aquifer model of dynamic freshwater storage and discharge based on physical principles and we apply the model using geological information and hydrologic data for silver springs a major springshed in florida we validate the model against a simplified numerical variable density flow model and show that our generalized water balance is consistent with an observed time lag on the order of 15 years between multi decadal averages of precipitation and spring discharge this time lag distorts simple i e models ignoring saltwater interaction water balance calculations over periods as long as several decades and may explain apparent anomalies in drainage behavior such as long periods of increasing precipitation and decreasing discharge or vice versa we also discuss this finding in general terms and establish a simple first order relationship between the hydraulic response time of an aquifer system and the recharge discharge time lag as a function of the time scale of recharge variability 2 data and methods 2 1 study site silver springs is a major karst spring system meinzer 1927 munch et al 2007 yang et al 2019 draining from the globally significant floridan aquifer alley et al 2002 sanford 2010 unesco 2009 the spring has mean discharge above 20 m3 s german 2010 and is located near the centerline of the florida peninsula approximately 80 km from both the atlantic and gulf coasts the springshed area is approximately 2300 km2 knowles 1996 and is underlain by an aquifer system containing saltwater below a depth of approximately 500 m which is connected to the ocean by the permeable oldsmar formation hughes et al 2009 williams and kuniansky 2016 due to the large distance from the coast it appears reasonable to assume that aquifer response is unaffected by many complex mechanisms of seawater intrusion related to ocean dynamics and the horizontal movement of water michael et al 2005 kuan et al 2012 werner et al 2013 the top of the system upper floridan aquifer is predominantly unconfined and overlays an aquitard middle semiconfining unit which is present over most portions of the springshed and a lower semi confined aquifer lower floridan aquifer fig 1 knowles 1996 motz and dogan 2005 williams and kuniansky 2016 water storage in the vadose zone as well as surface runoff other than the spring discharge are negligible knowles 1996 knowles et al 2010 silver springs is noted for its ecological importance and tourism there is a long record of discharge observations at silver springs with sporadic measurements from the early 1900s and regular measurements starting in 1932 details on data acquisition and preparation for precipitation p from a single rainfall station in the springshed spring discharge qs and effective upper aquifer head h1 as an area weighted average of measured heads in springshed observation wells are given in the supporting information in what follows all variables refer to monthly time series with an additional subscript av indicating centered 30 year moving averages 2 2 identification of time lag in long term trends since the 1960s spring discharge has decreased at an average annual rate of approximately 0 2 m3 s fig 2 a while precipitation data fig 2b do not show an obviously related trend however plotting 30 year means of discharge against those of precipitation fig 2c reveals that the decrease in discharge beginning in approximately 1965 is commensurate with a decrease in precipitation green data points since approximately 1985 however precipitation has remained relatively constant or even increased slightly from its lowest level while discharge has continued to decline black data points the centered 30 year means pav of precipitation multiplied by the springshed area a appear to be dominated by a periodic trend of approximately 100 year wavelength fig 2d green this has been related to the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo in ocean surface temperature enfield et al 2001 which has been occurring over multiple centuries zhang and delworth 2006 as a natural candidate to describe such gradual oscillating changes we fit a sinusoidal function to pava for linear time invariant systems as a first order dynamic approximation it is also known that a sinusoidal input function will produce a sinusoidal output function of equal wavelength but possibly different amplitude and phase a sine fit of equal wavelength applied to the centered 30 year means qs av of discharge fig 2d blue also produces a plausible fit although the available period of record for qs is shorter than that for p the additional data points in fig 2a blue circles not used in 30 year averages and long term sine fits increase confidence in the sinusoidal trend by showing low measured discharges prior to 1930 similar to post 2000 moreover there has been an increasing trend in qs since its absolute minimum in 2012 with the largest cumulative increase in discharge over comparable time spans since 1960 comparison of the sine fits in fig 2d e g the years they reach their maxima reveals a time lag of approximately 15 years between the long term trends in precipitation and discharge with 95 confidence 1 a parameters of the sine fits and confidence intervals are determined with the fit function in matlab using non linear least squares yielding root mean square residuals of 1 1 and 0 4 m3 s for pava and qs av respectively the time lag found is not significantly affected by the specific choice of averaging period nor by uncertainty in amo wavelength see supporting information 2 3 evapotranspiration and pumping for our study site et is the second strongest hydrological driver after p and due to the complexities involved in its determination we consider four alternative estimates denoted by et1 et2 et3 and et4 av equal to 1 e t 1 constant 2 e t 2 0 75 e t 1 from october may 1 5 e t 1 from june september 3 e t 3 p p m p e t m 1 m p e t 4 e t 4 a v p av p av m av p e t av m av 1 m av p e t av where m and mav are budyko exponents roderick and farquhar 2011 potential evapotranspiration pet fig 3 a in mm day is calculated from turc s method 5 pet 0 013 ϑ 24 σ 50 ϑ 15 which has been recommended for pet calculation over regional scales in the southeastern united states lu et al 2005 in eq 5 ϑ in c is the average of the minimum and maximum temperatures ϑmin and ϑmax recorded for a given month available since 1897 while σ in mj m2day is the monthly solar radiation estimated by σ 016 σ e ϑ max ϑ min where σe in mj m2day is the monthly extraterrestrial radiation thepadia and martinez 2012 scenario et1 represents the simplest case of constant et knowles 1996 while et2 incorporates seasonal effects by applying a monthly et rate from june to september which is twice the monthly et rate from october through may knowles 1996 scenarios et3 and et4 are based on the budyko framework roderick and farquhar 2011 and are included to investigate possible effects on et and aquifer recharge caused by long term climatic trends in particular air temperature affecting pet because of uncertainty about the most appropriate time scale for applying the budyko equation we distinguish between et3 on a monthly basis and et4 av on a 30 year basis due to non linearity there is a difference whether eq 3 is applied for each month and then averaged or whether averages pav and petav are used in eq 4 using n a p et for aquifer recharge we find et1 1 07 m a m 10 and mav 2 25 by imposing that the baselines of the long term sine fits to qs av and nav be equal in the sense of an approximate mass balance over an infinite time span the value of et1 is approximately 10 larger than that of knowles 1996 based on a springshed water balance which does not consider saltwater interaction however the budyko exponent mav falls inside the range of most typical values between 1 5 and 2 6 roderick and farquhar 2011 in contrast the larger value of m applied at the much shorter monthly intervals corresponds to a scenario where et p in months where p pet water limited and where et pet in months where pet p energy limited freshwater withdrawal rates are available for marion county from 1965 through 2015 in intervals between 1 and 5 years https www usgs gov centers car fl water science groundwater pumping is much larger than surface water abstraction and as a conservative estimate we consider the sum of both since marion county contains the largest part of the springshed fig 1a reported pumping rates for the county are converted to total springshed pumping rates qp by a proportional correction considering the areas of marion county 4360 km2 and the silver springshed 2300 km2 resulting pumping rates are linearly interpolated on a monthly basis assuming qp 0 before 1940 and qp constant after 2015 at the same value of 2015 fig 3b 2 4 water balance of an unconfined aquifer classically the freshwater balance for unconfined aquifers i e neglecting elastic storage over a time period δt in terms of flow rates is 6 q s a v a n 1 δ h 1 δ t a p av e t av q p a v possible return flow of pumped water into the aquifer e g excess irrigation is conservatively neglected here besides the constants n1 a and δt all variables are understood as averages subscript av over δt except for δh1 which is the total change in aquifer average water level over δt using data of p and qs fig 2 qp and pet fig 3 and h1 supporting information we apply eq 6 as a moving water balance over the full period of record with values of a 2300 km2 for examples where larger values have been assumed see supporting information n1 0 2 knowles 1996 and δt 30 a fig 4 results for et1 constant and et2 seasonally constant are visually indistinguishable fig 4a while et3 monthly budyko fig 4b and et4 30 year budyko fig 4c cause different degrees of attenuation in nav with respect to pav however although the magnitudes and rates of decline in nav green line are similar to those of qs av bold blue line the remaining discrepancies between nav and qs av are significant and show that none of the et scenarios is capable of explaining the respective time lag neither does consideration of pumping through qp av which implies a reduction of effective recharge black line similarly although there is a marked long term trend in h1 see supporting information with an associated change in freshwater storage it is by far not strong enough to compensate for the discrepancies in the water balance thin blue line even for larger values of n1 as assumed here given the strong influence of et and the difficulty in its estimation as well as the uncertainty about actual pumping rates across the springshed we ask the question of what values of et and qp are necessary to close the 30 year average water balances expressed by eq 6 for this purpose we observe that the variability in petav fig 3a is relatively small compared to that of pav fig 2d such that we postulate etav apav b as a simple mathematical relationship we further allow the total pumping rate to be a multiple cqp av of the reported values fig 3b the constants a b and c all constrained to 0 are determined by least squares fitting after substitution into eq 6 the left hand side is treated as the dependent variable while the right hand side contains the independent variables pav and qp av results yield a 0 23 b 0 and c 2 3 with an improved fit of the water budget over the decades fig 4d however this fit implies the conditions 1 that et be strictly proportional to p and 2 that true pumping rates are more than twice as large as reported qp condition 1 cannot be expected to be appropriate in reality because ratios of et p are known to be consistently lower for larger values of p sanford and selnick 2012 reitz et al 2017 that is et in the study area is more strongly controlled by energy limits rather than water limits such that average et values are relatively constant with respect to p condition 2 implies a 2 3 fold underestimation of qp which is extremely unlikely given the very conservative nature of the original estimate even considering uncertainty in springshed area and hence qp of as much as 30 from the value adopted here munch et al 2007 in fact the qp values are more likely to be overestimates given that a large portion of pumped water is used for irrigation with a considerable potential for return flow into the aquifer which is neglected here and would substantially decrease the effective groundwater abstraction such irrigation includes agriculture 20 of qp as of 2010 recreational areas 10 and households though public supply 40 as well as domestic self supply 20 https www usgs gov centers car fl water science within households in central florida up to 60 of the water is directly applied for garden irrigation haley et al 2007 romero and dukes 2014 while treated municipal wastewater within the springshed is also exclusively dedicated to irrigation of public areas city of ocala 2019 moreover we note that the best fit water balance still diverges both before 1955 and after 1995 for unexplained reasons therefore we conclude that et and qp alone are not sufficient to consistently close the water balance and we investigate an expanded water balance including freshwater storage changes due to saltwater interaction 2 5 water balance with saltwater interaction as investigated previously fitts 2012 morgan et al 2012 for coastal aquifers the movement of the interface between the overlying freshwater and underlying saltwater bodies can significantly affect freshwater balances hydrogeological information available for the florida peninsula williams and kuniansky 2016 indicates that there is saltwater in the lower part of the aquifer system below silver springs and that it is hydraulically connected to the ocean as to allow interface movement similar to the unconfined water table the saltwater interface is essentially horizontal even more so at distance from the coast and it is the vertical change in interface depth h that determines the additional amount of freshwater stored in or released from the aquifer to express this mathematically we include a term in the water balance of eq 6 to form a generalized water balance equation for aquifers with saltwater interaction as 7 q s a v a n 1 δ h 1 δ t a n 2 δ h δ t a p av e t av q p a v where n2 is the effective porosity at the depth of the saltwater interface and δh is the change in interface depth over time δt the product an 2δh represents the increase in freshwater storage due to downward movement of the saltwater interface this is analogous to the unconfined aquifer storage term where an 1δh1 represents the increase in freshwater storage due to an upward movement of the water table i e the freshwater air interface in typical water balance studies the time frame δt is taken or assumed to be large enough to neglect the unconfined storage term especially if water level data are not available data on saltwater interface depth and particularly temporal changes thereof are rarely available such that application of eq 7 requires a modeling approach for estimating δh 2 6 model development 2 6 1 conceptual model we develop a parsimonious linear and time invariant reservoir model of the coupled upper and lower aquifer system fig 5 an upper unconfined aquifer at hydraulic head h1 receiving recharge is coupled to a lower aquifer through a semi confining layer of hydraulic resistance r12 the lower aquifer at hydraulic head h2 dynamically interacts with the ocean by moving the underlying saltwater body against hydraulic resistance r0 the freshwater storage mechanism in the upper aquifer is dominated by changes in water table elevation while freshwater storage changes in the lower aquifer are due to movement of the saltwater interface the principle of continuity of pressure applies across both the water table at constant atmospheric pressure as well as the saltwater interface at depth variable variable pressure storage due to elastic deformation of water and aquifers is neglected see supporting information the semi confining layer and the direct discharge q2 are not needed for reproducing the long term time lag instead by serving as a separator between aquifers the semi confining layer allows for reproducing both short and long term fluctuations in qs fig 2 the direct discharge q2 of the lower aquifer into the spring at head hs is included based on the observed hysteresis and time lag between long term trends in h1 and qs see supporting information all hydraulic resistances r in the model represent ratios of head differences to discharges e g r1 h1 hs q1 this linear lumped model approach is related to more complex distributed aquifer models and non linear reservoir models as opposed to distributed aquifer models e g townley 1995 manga 1999 where aquifers are assumed homogeneous and head is a function of location each of our model aquifers consists of two parts the first is an outer radial zone of large surface area receiving recharge and responsible for storage the second part is a zone near the spring causing hydraulic losses due to flow convergence and large flow velocities similarly our model assumes that the hydraulic resistance against the vertical flow component of the freshwater is concentrated in the less permeable semi confining layer mathematically the approximate equivalence of hydraulic response times between distributed and linear reservoir models has been established for the case of parallel horizontal flow gelhar 1974 and is further illustrated by a simple example below moreover with respect to non linear reservoir models where spatial variability in head is also neglected and discharge is a non linear function of aquifer storage e g brutsaert 2008 kirchner 2009 in particular for karst aquifers scanlon et al 2003 hartmann et al 2014 our approach considers the special case of a linear relationship between head proportional to storage and discharge finally fundamental results of the analytical model are successfully validated against numerical variable density flow simulations in sutra voss and provost 2010 winston 2000 2009 where recharge periodicity leads to a dynamic saltwater interface depth and a spring discharge that lags the recharge signal see supporting information 2 6 2 mathematical model based on these assumptions our aquifer model fig 5 and darcy s law with h1 s h1 hs and h2 s h2 hs we write 8 q 1 h 1 s r 1 9 q 2 h 2 s r 2 10 q 12 h 1 s h 2 s r 12 mass conservation of freshwater in the spring pool with negligible storage as well as in the upper and lower aquifers further gives 11 q s q 1 q 2 12 a n 1 d h 1 s dt n q 1 q 12 q p 13 a n 2 dh dt q 12 q 2 equating freshwater and saltwater pressures at the interface continuity of pressure in terms of equivalent height of freshwater column gives 14 h h 2 s h s ρ s ρ f h r 0 q 12 q 2 where the left hand side corresponds to the freshwater side density ρf while the right hand side represents the saltwater side density ρs including hydraulic head losses due to saltwater discharge q0 q12 q2 between the aquifer and the ocean fig 5 eq 14 can be rearranged and substituted into eqs 9 and 10 to eliminate h2 s subsequent substitution of eqs 8 10 into eqs 12 and 13 yields a linear coupled system of equations in two dynamic variables h1 s and h for very large r0 i e in the absence of a hydraulic connection between the saltwater body at the bottom of the aquifer and the ocean eq 14 becomes q12 q2 such that the interface storage effect and eq 13 vanish in this case the only remaining freshwater storage mechanism would be due to the water table fluctuations expressed by eq 12 here we are most interested in the opposite extreme of an efficient hydraulic connection between the aquifer and the ocean this corresponds to r0 0 in eq 14 and 15 h ρ f ρ s ρ f h 2 s h s which is used to eliminate h from eq 13 yielding 16 as d h 2 s dt q 12 q 2 where dhs dt 0 is used and 17 s n 2 ρ f ρ s ρ f 40 n 2 is the effective lower aquifer storage coefficient due to freshwater saltwater interface movement of velocity dh dt fitts 2012 page 224 comparison of eqs 12 and 16 shows that saltwater interface storage coefficient s has the same nature and meaning as the unconfined storage coefficient n1 specific yield for freshwater storage due to water table fluctuations notably however the factor ρf ρs ρf 40 in eq 17 implies that s n1 if n1 n2 the solutions for qs and h1 s can be found by laplace transformation or numerically see appendix a subsequently the solutions for h2 s q1 q2 and q12 are easily obtained from eqs 8 11 and 15 for example the saltwater interface depth is found as h 40 qs h1 s r1 r2 hs and its estimated temporal evolution in the common absence of direct observations can be used to compute values of δh for arbitrary time spans δt in the water balance of eq 7 it is in fact the case that the present modeling approach is a more detailed but still spatially simplified water balance involving a coupled system of two reservoirs with different storage mechanisms this is best revealed by adding eqs 12 and 13 which exactly yields the differential version of the water balance expressed by eq 7 while eq 7 relies on measurements or assumptions of relatively small values of the storage terms an 1δh1 δt and an 2δh δt our model provides these magnitudes as output for a known system forcing due to n and qp 2 6 3 parameterization by letting r12 approach infinity the upper and lower aquifers become decoupled fig 5 and eqs a9 and a10 reduce to t1 ar1n1 and t2 ar2s representing the hydraulic response time scales of each aquifer in isolation for a general aquifer of surface area aaq hydraulic resistance raq and storativity saq this implies a response time scale of tr aaqraqsaq this result is equivalent to the commonly recognized expression for hydrological response time scale tr laq 2 saq taq for a confined rectangular aquifer of width waq transmissivity taq and length laq an analogous comparison for one dimensional radial flow through a circular confined aquifer of radius laq and area aaq laq 2 π leads to raq ln laq r0 2πtaq and tr ln laq r0 laq 2 saq 2taq where r0 is the radius of the inner aquifer boundary this reflects the fact that for radial flow with discharge across the inner boundary aquifer response not only depends on laq 2 saq taq but also on the order of magnitude logarithm of laq r0 townley 1995 for silver springs we estimate r0 500 m based on the fact that the major spring vents are distributed over approximately 1 km of the silver river headwater reach knowles et al 2010 this results in ln laq r0 2 2 and further leads to raq 0 6 taq for relating aquifer transmissivities to the hydraulic resistance values in our model our model possesses five parameters n1 s r1 r2 and r12 when assuming a good hydraulic connection between aquifer and ocean i e r0 0 based on hydrogeological information available we find a first estimate of specific yield as n1 0 2 the independently measured average upper aquifer transmissivity of 2 m2 s is proportional to the reciprocal of hydraulic resistance and may be converted into an estimate of r1 0 6 2 0 3 s m2 the hydraulic leakance of the semi confining layer is reported as approximately 0 02 a 1 motz and dogan 2005 and translates into an estimate of r12 1 0 02a 0 7 s m2 the large uncertainty about both lower aquifer transmissivity and its connectedness to the spring vents directly propagates into a first estimate of r2 however one may expect r2 to be on a similar order of magnitude as r1 such that discharge q2 from the lower aquifer may explain the observed time lag between h1 and qs the effective porosity n2 of the lower aquifer is also expected to range in the same order of magnitude as n1 further details on model parameterization in laplace domain followed by a sensitivity analysis in time domain using a goodness of fit measure gupta et al 2009 are given in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 model application to silver springs optimized model parameters found from steady state and dynamic calibration using time series of inputs n and qp with observations of h1 and qs are t1 1 5 a t2 30 a bq 0 3 bh 0 5 and ah

of magnitude with the first estimates from hydrogeological aquifer properties above resistance r12 is somewhat smaller here which we attribute to the fact that the semi confining layer is known to be absent over portions of the springshed lower aquifer porosity n2 is also smaller than n1 which may be due to a reduction in aquifer porosity with depth e g weaker karstification fracturing larger overburden and or an incomplete presence of the saltwater interface below the freshwater body which could be partially underlain by impermeable bedrock fig 6 displays time series of estimates from our aquifer model for qs and h1 compared to field measurements despite the relative simplicity of the model estimates of both monthly data fig 6a and b and 30 year means fig 6c and d reproduce fundamental properties of measured data at both time scales that is variability in qs and h1 at a monthly scale is well predicted while at the same time matching the variance and time lag of long term means being aware of the relationship between eq 7 and eqs 12 and 13 section 2 6 2 the red continuous line in fig 6c is also a representation of the moving water balance including saltwater interaction i e eq 7 after isolating qs av we observe a clearly improved performance with respect to fig 4 where saltwater interaction was ignored eq 6 and water balances for different scenarios remained either far from closing or required unreasonable assumptions on both et and qp for yet further illustration we use our calibrated model to produce two additional simulations of qs av for the scenarios of no pumping r0 0 as before and qp 0 fig 6c red dashed line as well as of an underlying saltwater body which is disconnected from the ocean r0 and qp as before fig 6c red dotted line while there is sensitivity to pumping its effects are relatively small compared to the overall decline observed in spring discharge disallowing the movement of the saltwater interface and related changes in freshwater storage causes a much larger impact on the water balance most notably the impact of the dynamic saltwater interface also very accurately explains the observed discrepancies in long term averages of recharge green and discharge blue as part of the water balance our model estimates saltwater interface depths between 530 and 560 m below sea level fig 6d which is consistent with results of independent studies hughes et al 2009 williams and kuniansky 2016 changes in freshwater storage per unit springshed area due to saltwater movement are equal to the product of porosity and changes in interface depth eqs 7 and 13 interface movement is seen to be in marked disequilibrium with water table fluctuations compare red and black lines an observation that has been reported previously for near shore aquifers michael et al 2005 note also that the long term amplitude of interface depth fluctuations greatly exceeds that of the water level in the unconfined aquifer for several decades before 2010 our model estimates a decline in lower aquifer freshwater storage and a related rise of the saltwater interface with the overlying deep and older freshwater body this finding is consistent with the observation that the apparent age of water at another major karst spring approximately 100 km north west of silver springs has monotonically increased for approximately 20 years martin et al 2016 moreover a comprehensive age dating study at silver springs concluded that almost 50 of spring discharge derived from the two major vents consists of young water 5 years while the remaining spring groups contribute older water 30 years knowles et al 2010 this is comparable to our model predicting that upper aquifer i e younger discharge q1 amounts to approximately 60 of total spring discharge both on average i e steady state as well as for the time of age dating in 2007 model results in the spectral domain fig 7 a as a function of frequency f also show good agreement between the observed periodogram in qs grey and the respective estimated power spectral density psd from eq a4 blue insignificant attenuation between long term fluctuations of n and qs are only expected for changes over multiple centuries log10 f 2 5 moreover there is potential for even larger time lags δt than observed in fig 2d if long term trends are significant over time scales of more than one century i e f 0 01 a 1 currell et al 2016 fig 7b blue line for short term variability e g intra annual with log10 f 0 fig 7a and b illustrate a strong degree of attenuation between recharge and discharge peaks associated with relatively small time lags due to the large hydraulic response time of the lower aquifer and its significant contribution to overall springshed dynamics single recharge events do not alter the system state drastically for example a single recharge event equivalent to the volume of one month of average spring discharge qs approximately 21 m3 s has a maximum impact of 0 4 m3 s on qs at the time of the event and causes a maximum movement of the saltwater interface of 20 cm approximately 5 years after the event this extremely slow dynamics at a relatively large depth poses significant challenges to direct monitoring of interface movement the effects of long term changes in recharge on qs freshwater storage n 1δh1 n 2δh eq 7 and interface depth h are illustrated for both step fig 7c and ramp functions fig 7d the step response functions show that it takes approximately one century for the aquifer to reach equilibrium after a sudden change in the recharge regime e g extensive land development over a short period of time moreover the ramp response functions fig 7d suggest that aquifer response to gradual changes in recharge as expected from long term changes in land use pumping or particularly resulting from climate change may present delays of 20 30 years 3 2 model general implications depending on the properties of a particular aquifer e g a porosity at the saltwater interface 0 08 as estimated for silver springs time scales of aquifer responses and associated time lags may be even larger in large aquifers of low transmissivity multi decadal response times may occur even in the absence of saltwater interaction however mean elevation and variability of aquifer water levels must then be large enough to both match the low transmissivity for a given discharge and actually provide for correspondingly large volumetric changes in freshwater storage for a more general illustration of the effects of freshwater storage due to fluctuations of both water table and saltwater interface we reduce the silver springs model to a single reservoir this reduction is achieved by setting r12 0 and r2 such that eqs a2 and a3 collapse to 18 q n 1 t r k where k is the laplace variable and superscript asterisks denote variables in laplace space the hydraulic response time tr r1a n1 s consists of the additive components due to fluctuations of the water table and specific yield n1 as well as due to fluctuations of the saltwater interface and porosity n2 through eq 17 eq 18 is successfully validated against a numerical sutra model for n1 0 i e confined conditions see supporting information using k 2πi tw where i is the imaginary unit we take the absolute value and argument of the complex transfer function q n to arrive at expressions for spectral attenuation and dimensionless time lag as 19 q a n a 1 1 2 π t r t w 2 20 δ t t w 1 2 π arctan 2 π t r t w where na and tw are amplitude and wavelength of recharge respectively while qa and δt are the attenuated amplitude and time lag of discharge q with respect to recharge a sinusoidal trend component in long term averages of recharge causes a sinusoidal trend component in long term averages of discharge which is of equal wavelength but increasingly attenuated qa na 1 in eq 19 and delayed δt tw 0 in eq 20 as hydraulic response time grows fig 8 a compare green line with blue lines for different values of tr tw where nm and qm denote the means of n and q respectively in a plot of recharge against discharge for a particular spectral component such attenuation and time delay may lead to significant deviations from the line of identity fig 8b green line for tr tw 0 i e n q when tr tw is larger than zero consequently if changes in freshwater storage are neglected typical mass balance metrics such as q n long term mean discharge per unit long term mean recharge are in error and not constant in time the maximum error in volumetric water balance is the change in freshwater storage illustrated as the shaded area in fig 8a for tr tw 0 1 equal to the difference between recharged and discharged volumes vn and vq during a half period where q n or vice versa in relative terms of vq vn there is significant potential for water budget errors if both na nm long term recharge variability as produced by multi decadal oscillations and tr tw are larger than zero fig 8c yellow zone such errors are in general due to both attenuation and time lag moreover for tr tw 0 01 where attenuation is practically absent fig 8a eq 19 there is still potential for significant time lags equal to δt tr fig 8d eq 20 with arctan x x for x 1 which may be consequential if tr is on the order of the time scale of a water budget study note however that in general δt tr i e time lag can be much smaller than response time and that eq 20 provides a simple first order expression for their relationship as a function of tw eqs 19 and 20 and fig 8 show that the relative hydraulic response time tr tw fundamentally determines aquifer dynamics presently the availability of detailed hydrological records limits long term water balance studies to several decades at the most that is while annual and sub annual fluctuations can be effectively filtered out by temporal averaging as customary with long term water balance studies decadal and multi decadal fluctuations currell et al 2016 cannot be eliminated this further means that the presence of tw on the order of decades or more may induce significant errors if changes in freshwater storage are not correctly accounted for 4 conclusions large hydraulic response times can result in significant rate dependent hystereses between long term trends in aquifer recharge and discharge figs 2c and 8b such hystereses directly affect assessments of freshwater storage depletion stream flow models and generally any type of water budget calculation if not accounted for long term lags between recharge and discharge inevitably cause discrepancies between flux and volume based methods for aquifer depletion studies taylor et al 2013 or may confound the distinction between anthropogenic and climate driven aquifer depletion yi et al 2016 a potential mechanism for causing large hydraulic response times in coastal aquifers is the movement of the saltwater interface with the associated changes of freshwater storage in the aquifer we present an expanded freshwater balance equation to account for this effect and demonstrate its significance through the development of a parsimonious model of freshwater recharge storage discharge dynamics in an aquifer with application to silver springs florida although not investigated here in detail we anticipate further important implications of our findings one is with regard to regional and long term water resources management using aquifer storage and recovery asr strategies alley et al 2002 where multi decadal variability and significant time lags between periods of maximum recharge storage and stream discharge provide potential for exploitation further implications are expected for the interpretation of large scale remote sensing data for coastal aquifers such as provided by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace famiglietti and rodell 2013 sproles et al 2015 breña naranjo et al 2014 sun et al 2010 as a decline in freshwater storage is associated

5815,coastal aquifers are an important freshwater resource for significant portions of the global population understanding the dynamic relationship between aquifer recharge storage and discharge is fundamental for sustainable groundwater management here we present an expanded freshwater balance equation that considers the dynamic interaction between fresh groundwater and underlying saltwater through a respective storage term which may explain significant time lags in long term trends between recharge storage and discharge we demonstrate the presence of such a time lag and its effect on freshwater budget calculations with data from a major karst spring in florida we develop and validate a parsimonious aquifer model and show that our expanded water balance is consistent with an observed time lag on the order of 15 years between multi decadal averages of rainfall and spring discharge long term trends in precipitation are known to occur in many regions of the world and we expect our findings to have direct relevance for coastal aquifers at a global scale keywords coastal aquifers freshwater storage saltwater interaction groundwater depletion karst spring 1 introduction water balance and stream flow models relating aquifer recharge storage and discharge are fundamental for the management of freshwater resources alley et al 2002 gleeson et al 2016 long term trends in freshwater storage or discharge including pumping are used to assess groundwater depletion rates and the sustainability of aquifer exploitation e g green et al 2011 gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 reager et al 2016 different hypotheses to explain shifts in long term freshwater balances are possible including effects of pumping from the aquifer changes in land use and infiltration rates climatic changes affecting precipitation and or evapotranspiration et regime shifts in drainage behavior or combinations thereof for coastal aquifers the interaction between fresh and saltwater is an important mechanism that has been investigated from multiple perspectives including effects of sea level and groundwater storage changes on saltwater intrusion retreat kiro et al 2008 watson et al 2010 chang et al 2011 webb and howard 2011 ferguson and gleeson 2012 lu and werner 2013 rotzoll and fletcher 2013 as well as on stream flow for a hypothetical island masterson and garabedian 2007 besides changing sea levels lu and werner 2013 also investigated effects of changes in inland water levels studies on coastal aquifers also focus on variability in aquifer recharge michael et al 2005 van der velde et al 2006 freshwater pumping ferguson and gleeson 2012 and geochemical disequilibrium between fresh and marine waters morrissey et al 2010 sanford 2010 several of these studies discuss response time scales of different hydrological variables or closely related time lags between pairs of hydrological variables when a system is forced periodically it is recognized that hydrological response times for a single system can be drastically different depending on what hydrological variable is considered e g watson et al 2010 fewer studies directly focus on the freshwater balance of coastal aquifers under the influence of saltwater interaction and different drivers a numerical study of the gaza aquifer concludes that observed seawater intrusion and falling water levels in the aquifer can be attributed to groundwater pumping qahman and larabi 2006 exploring a quasi equilibrium analytical approach for the evolution of a sharp freshwater saltwater interface shows that changes in seawater volumes stored in a coastal aquifer may significantly affect groundwater level trends and hence the interpretation of freshwater balances morgan et al 2012 the authors further conclude that changes in seawater volumes should be routinely included in water balance studies of coastal aquifers but also that further research needs to better elucidate the relationships between hydraulic disequilibrium time lags and aquifer characteristics along these lines a numerical study of the dynamics of the freshwater volume stored in the aquifer of a small pacific island demonstrated that both recharge and pumping exert a strong control on the freshwater balance with hydraulic response time to pumping of 20 years post et al 2018 however existing modeling approaches for freshwater saltwater interaction are either numerical or quasi steady state such that case studies of freshwater balances explicitly accounting for interface movement are scarce and a generalized framework or expanded freshwater balance equation for coastal aquifers has not been established a fundamental component of all studies involving the interaction of freshwater and saltwater is the density difference causing a buoyancy effect of saltwater in an aquifer on an overlying lower density freshwater lens in the presence of a hydraulic connection between the saltwater body in the aquifer and the ocean i e excluding the opposite case of isolated terrestrial freshwater lenses laattoe et al 2017 this interaction affects the depth of the freshwater saltwater interface under hydraulic equilibrium and for a saltwater density consistent with seawater this is known as the ghyben herzberg principle and determines that a unit change in aquifer head leads to an approximately 40 times larger movement of the interface between fresh groundwater and the underlying saltwater michael et al 2005 thus small and persistent changes in observed water table elevations can be accompanied by large and hidden volumetric changes in freshwater storage fitts 2012 page 224 morgan et al 2012 post et al 2018 in general the hydraulic response time scale of aquifers with predominantly horizontal flow is known to be on the order of tr laq 2 saq taq where laq is a characteristic length scale of the aquifer saq is a storage coefficient and taq is aquifer transmissivity alley et al 2002 manga 1999 townley 1995 in coastal aquifers with a hydraulic connection to the ocean volumetric changes in freshwater storage may be composed of contributions due to 1 elastic deformation or confined component with saq 10 3 corresponding to specific storage multiplied by aquifer thickness 2 water table fluctuations or unconfined component with saq 0 1 corresponding to specific yield i e effective porosity near the water table and 3 saltwater interface movement or interface component with saq 1 corresponding to 40 times the effective porosity near the interface if the vertical resistance to flow is negligible fitts 2012 because the latter value is largest by at least an order of magnitude the hydraulic response time of a given aquifer may be drastically influenced by the presence or absence of a dynamic saltwater interface for example the hydraulic response time of a confined non coastal aquifer may be on the order of days but it may be on the order of years for the same aquifer under unconfined conditions however in the presence of dynamic saltwater interaction the aquifer response time could be raised to the order of decades here we introduce a generalized freshwater balance equation for aquifers with dynamic saltwater interaction i e containing temporally changing volumes of seawater we do not consider changes in sea level but show that multi decadal trends in aquifer recharge combined with the dynamic interaction of freshwater and saltwater at their interface may cause significant impacts on long term water balances of coastal aquifers we develop a parsimonious analytical aquifer model of dynamic freshwater storage and discharge based on physical principles and we apply the model using geological information and hydrologic data for silver springs a major springshed in florida we validate the model against a simplified numerical variable density flow model and show that our generalized water balance is consistent with an observed time lag on the order of 15 years between multi decadal averages of precipitation and spring discharge this time lag distorts simple i e models ignoring saltwater interaction water balance calculations over periods as long as several decades and may explain apparent anomalies in drainage behavior such as long periods of increasing precipitation and decreasing discharge or vice versa we also discuss this finding in general terms and establish a simple first order relationship between the hydraulic response time of an aquifer system and the recharge discharge time lag as a function of the time scale of recharge variability 2 data and methods 2 1 study site silver springs is a major karst spring system meinzer 1927 munch et al 2007 yang et al 2019 draining from the globally significant floridan aquifer alley et al 2002 sanford 2010 unesco 2009 the spring has mean discharge above 20 m3 s german 2010 and is located near the centerline of the florida peninsula approximately 80 km from both the atlantic and gulf coasts the springshed area is approximately 2300 km2 knowles 1996 and is underlain by an aquifer system containing saltwater below a depth of approximately 500 m which is connected to the ocean by the permeable oldsmar formation hughes et al 2009 williams and kuniansky 2016 due to the large distance from the coast it appears reasonable to assume that aquifer response is unaffected by many complex mechanisms of seawater intrusion related to ocean dynamics and the horizontal movement of water michael et al 2005 kuan et al 2012 werner et al 2013 the top of the system upper floridan aquifer is predominantly unconfined and overlays an aquitard middle semiconfining unit which is present over most portions of the springshed and a lower semi confined aquifer lower floridan aquifer fig 1 knowles 1996 motz and dogan 2005 williams and kuniansky 2016 water storage in the vadose zone as well as surface runoff other than the spring discharge are negligible knowles 1996 knowles et al 2010 silver springs is noted for its ecological importance and tourism there is a long record of discharge observations at silver springs with sporadic measurements from the early 1900s and regular measurements starting in 1932 details on data acquisition and preparation for precipitation p from a single rainfall station in the springshed spring discharge qs and effective upper aquifer head h1 as an area weighted average of measured heads in springshed observation wells are given in the supporting information in what follows all variables refer to monthly time series with an additional subscript av indicating centered 30 year moving averages 2 2 identification of time lag in long term trends since the 1960s spring discharge has decreased at an average annual rate of approximately 0 2 m3 s fig 2 a while precipitation data fig 2b do not show an obviously related trend however plotting 30 year means of discharge against those of precipitation fig 2c reveals that the decrease in discharge beginning in approximately 1965 is commensurate with a decrease in precipitation green data points since approximately 1985 however precipitation has remained relatively constant or even increased slightly from its lowest level while discharge has continued to decline black data points the centered 30 year means pav of precipitation multiplied by the springshed area a appear to be dominated by a periodic trend of approximately 100 year wavelength fig 2d green this has been related to the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo in ocean surface temperature enfield et al 2001 which has been occurring over multiple centuries zhang and delworth 2006 as a natural candidate to describe such gradual oscillating changes we fit a sinusoidal function to pava for linear time invariant systems as a first order dynamic approximation it is also known that a sinusoidal input function will produce a sinusoidal output function of equal wavelength but possibly different amplitude and phase a sine fit of equal wavelength applied to the centered 30 year means qs av of discharge fig 2d blue also produces a plausible fit although the available period of record for qs is shorter than that for p the additional data points in fig 2a blue circles not used in 30 year averages and long term sine fits increase confidence in the sinusoidal trend by showing low measured discharges prior to 1930 similar to post 2000 moreover there has been an increasing trend in qs since its absolute minimum in 2012 with the largest cumulative increase in discharge over comparable time spans since 1960 comparison of the sine fits in fig 2d e g the years they reach their maxima reveals a time lag of approximately 15 years between the long term trends in precipitation and discharge with 95 confidence 1 a parameters of the sine fits and confidence intervals are determined with the fit function in matlab using non linear least squares yielding root mean square residuals of 1 1 and 0 4 m3 s for pava and qs av respectively the time lag found is not significantly affected by the specific choice of averaging period nor by uncertainty in amo wavelength see supporting information 2 3 evapotranspiration and pumping for our study site et is the second strongest hydrological driver after p and due to the complexities involved in its determination we consider four alternative estimates denoted by et1 et2

recommended for pet calculation over regional scales in the southeastern united states lu et al 2005 in eq 5 ϑ in c is the average of the minimum and maximum temperatures ϑmin and ϑmax recorded for a given month available since 1897 while σ in mj m2day is the monthly solar radiation estimated by σ 016 σ e ϑ max ϑ min where σe in mj m2day is the monthly extraterrestrial radiation thepadia and martinez 2012 scenario et1 represents the simplest case of constant et knowles 1996 while et2 incorporates seasonal effects by applying a monthly et rate from june to september which is twice the monthly et rate from october through may knowles 1996 scenarios et3 and et4 are based on the budyko framework roderick and farquhar 2011 and are included to investigate possible effects on et and aquifer recharge caused by long term climatic trends in particular air temperature affecting pet because of uncertainty about the most appropriate time scale for applying the budyko equation we distinguish between et3 on a monthly basis and et4 av on a 30 year basis due to non linearity there is a difference whether eq 3 is applied for each month and then averaged or whether averages pav and petav are used in eq 4 using n a p et for aquifer recharge we find et1 1 07 m a m 10 and mav 2 25 by imposing that the baselines of the long term sine fits to qs av and nav be equal in the sense of an approximate mass balance over an infinite time span the value of et1 is approximately 10 larger than that of knowles 1996 based on a springshed water balance which does not consider saltwater interaction however the budyko exponent mav falls inside the range of most typical values between 1 5 and 2 6 roderick and farquhar 2011 in contrast the larger value of m applied at the much shorter monthly intervals corresponds to a scenario where et p in months where p pet water limited and where et pet in months where pet p energy limited freshwater withdrawal rates are available for marion county from 1965 through 2015 in intervals between 1 and 5 years https www usgs gov centers car fl water science groundwater pumping is much larger than surface water abstraction and as a conservative estimate we consider the sum of both since marion county contains the largest part of the springshed fig 1a reported pumping rates for the county are converted to total springshed pumping rates qp by a proportional correction considering the areas of marion county 4360 km2 and the silver springshed 2300 km2 resulting pumping rates are linearly interpolated on a monthly basis assuming qp 0 before 1940 and qp constant after 2015 at the same value of 2015 fig 3b 2 4 water balance of an unconfined aquifer classically the freshwater balance for unconfined aquifers i e neglecting elastic storage over a time period δt in terms of flow rates is 6 q s a v a n 1 δ h 1 δ t a p av e t av q p a v possible return flow of pumped water into the aquifer e g excess irrigation is conservatively neglected here besides the constants n1 a and δt all variables are understood as averages subscript av over δt except for δh1 which is the total change in aquifer average water level over δt using data of p and qs fig 2 qp and pet fig 3 and h1 supporting information we apply eq 6 as a moving water balance over the full period of record with values of a 2300 km2 for examples where larger values have been assumed see supporting information n1 0 2 knowles 1996 and δt 30 a fig 4 results for et1 constant and et2 seasonally constant are visually indistinguishable fig 4a while et3 monthly budyko fig 4b and et4 30 year budyko fig 4c cause different degrees of attenuation in nav with respect to pav however although the magnitudes and rates of decline in nav green line are similar to those of qs av bold blue line the remaining discrepancies between nav and qs av are significant and show that none of the et scenarios is capable of explaining the respective time lag neither does consideration of pumping through qp av which implies a reduction of effective recharge black line similarly although there is a marked long term trend in h1 see supporting information with an associated change in freshwater storage it is by far not strong enough to compensate for the discrepancies in the water balance thin blue line even for larger values of n1 as assumed here given the strong influence of et and the difficulty in its estimation as well as the uncertainty about actual pumping rates across the springshed we ask the question of what values of et and qp are necessary to close the 30 year average water balances expressed by eq 6 for this purpose we observe that the variability in petav fig 3a is relatively small compared to that of pav fig 2d such that we postulate etav apav b as a simple mathematical relationship we further allow the total pumping rate to be a multiple cqp av of the reported values fig 3b the constants a b and c all constrained to 0 are determined by least squares fitting after substitution into eq 6 the left hand side is treated as the dependent variable while the right hand side contains the independent variables pav and qp av results yield a 0 23 b 0 and c 2 3 with an improved fit of the water budget over the decades fig 4d however this fit implies the conditions 1 that et be strictly proportional to p and 2 that true pumping rates are more than twice as large as reported qp condition 1 cannot be expected to be appropriate in reality because ratios of et p are known to be consistently lower for larger values of p sanford and selnick 2012 reitz et al 2017 that is et in the study area is more strongly controlled by energy limits rather than water limits such that average et values are relatively constant with respect to p condition 2 implies a 2 3 fold underestimation of qp which is extremely unlikely given the very conservative nature of the original estimate even considering uncertainty in springshed area and hence qp of as much as 30 from the value adopted here munch et al 2007 in fact the qp values are more likely to be overestimates given that a large portion of pumped water is used for irrigation with a considerable potential for return flow into the aquifer which is neglected here and would substantially decrease the effective groundwater abstraction such irrigation includes agriculture 20 of qp as of 2010 recreational areas 10 and households though public supply 40 as well as domestic self supply 20 https www usgs gov centers car fl water science within households in central florida up to 60 of the water is directly applied for garden irrigation haley et al 2007 romero and dukes 2014 while treated municipal wastewater within the springshed is also exclusively dedicated to irrigation of public areas city of ocala 2019 moreover we note that the best fit water balance still diverges both before 1955 and after 1995 for unexplained reasons therefore we conclude that et and qp alone are not sufficient to consistently close the water balance and we investigate an expanded water balance including freshwater storage changes due to saltwater interaction 2 5 water balance with saltwater interaction as investigated previously fitts 2012 morgan et al 2012 for coastal aquifers the movement of the interface between the overlying freshwater and underlying saltwater bodies can significantly affect freshwater balances hydrogeological information available for the florida peninsula williams and kuniansky 2016 indicates that there is saltwater in the lower part of the aquifer system below silver springs and that it is hydraulically connected to the ocean as to allow interface movement similar to the unconfined water table the saltwater interface is essentially horizontal even more so at distance from the coast and it is the vertical change in interface depth h that determines the additional amount of freshwater stored in or released from the aquifer to express this mathematically we include a term in the water balance of eq 6 to form a generalized water balance equation for aquifers with saltwater interaction as 7 q s a v a n 1 δ h 1 δ t a n 2 δ h δ t a p av e t av q p a v where n2 is the effective porosity at the depth of the saltwater interface and δh is the change in interface depth over time δt the product an 2δh represents the increase in freshwater storage due to downward movement of the saltwater interface this is analogous to the unconfined aquifer storage term where an 1δh1 represents the increase in freshwater storage due to an upward movement of the water table i e the freshwater air interface in typical water balance studies the time frame δt is taken or assumed to be large enough to neglect the unconfined storage term especially if water level data are not available data on saltwater interface depth and particularly temporal changes thereof are rarely available such that application of eq 7 requires a modeling approach for estimating δh 2 6 model development 2 6 1 conceptual model we develop a parsimonious linear and time invariant reservoir model of the coupled upper and lower aquifer system fig 5 an upper unconfined aquifer at hydraulic head h1 receiving recharge is coupled to a lower aquifer through a semi confining layer of hydraulic resistance r12 the lower aquifer at hydraulic head h2 dynamically interacts with the ocean by moving the underlying saltwater body against hydraulic resistance r0 the freshwater storage mechanism in the upper aquifer is dominated by changes in water table elevation while freshwater storage changes in the lower aquifer are due to movement of the saltwater interface the principle of continuity of pressure applies across both the water table at constant atmospheric pressure as well as the saltwater interface at depth variable variable pressure storage due to elastic deformation of water and aquifers is neglected see supporting information the semi confining layer and the direct discharge q2 are not needed for reproducing the long term time lag instead by serving as a separator between aquifers the semi confining layer allows for reproducing both short and long term fluctuations in qs fig 2 the direct discharge q2 of the lower aquifer into the spring at head hs is included based on the observed hysteresis and time lag between long term trends in h1 and qs see supporting information all hydraulic resistances r in the model represent ratios of head differences to discharges e g r1 h1 hs q1 this linear lumped model approach is related to more complex distributed aquifer models and non linear reservoir models as opposed to distributed aquifer models e g townley 1995 manga 1999 where aquifers are assumed homogeneous and head is a function of location each of our model aquifers consists of two parts the first is an outer radial zone of large surface area receiving recharge and responsible for storage the second part is a zone near the spring causing hydraulic losses due to flow convergence and large flow velocities similarly our model assumes that the hydraulic resistance against the vertical flow component of the freshwater is concentrated in the less permeable semi confining layer mathematically the approximate equivalence of hydraulic response times between distributed and linear reservoir models has been established for the case of parallel horizontal flow gelhar 1974 and is further illustrated by a simple example below moreover with respect to non linear reservoir models where spatial variability in head is also neglected and discharge is a non linear function of aquifer storage e g brutsaert 2008 kirchner 2009 in particular for karst aquifers scanlon et al 2003 hartmann et al 2014 our approach considers the special case of a linear relationship between head proportional to storage and discharge finally fundamental results of the analytical model are successfully validated against numerical variable density flow simulations in sutra voss and provost 2010 winston 2000 2009 where recharge periodicity leads to a dynamic saltwater interface depth and a spring discharge that lags the recharge signal see supporting information 2 6 2 mathematical model based on these assumptions our aquifer model fig 5 and darcy s law with h1 s h1 hs and h2 s h2 hs we write 8 q 1 h 1 s r 1 9 q 2 h 2 s r 2 10 q 12 h

a n 2 dh dt q 12 q 2 equating freshwater and saltwater pressures at the interface continuity of pressure in terms of equivalent height of freshwater column gives 14 h h 2 s h s ρ s ρ f h r 0 q 12 q 2 where the left hand side corresponds to the freshwater side density ρf while the right hand side represents the saltwater side density ρs including hydraulic head losses due to saltwater discharge q0 q12 q2 between the aquifer and the ocean fig 5 eq 14 can be rearranged and substituted into eqs 9 and 10 to eliminate h2 s subsequent substitution of eqs 8 10 into eqs 12 and 13 yields a linear coupled system of equations in two dynamic variables h1 s and h for very large r0 i e in the absence of a hydraulic connection between the saltwater body at the bottom of the aquifer and the ocean eq 14 becomes q12 q2 such that the interface storage effect and eq 13 vanish in this case the only remaining freshwater storage mechanism would be due to the water table fluctuations expressed by eq 12 here we are most interested in the opposite extreme of an efficient hydraulic connection between the aquifer and the ocean this corresponds to r0 0 in eq 14 and 15 h ρ f ρ s ρ f h 2 s h s which is used to eliminate h from eq 13 yielding 16 as d h 2 s dt q 12 q 2 where dhs dt 0 is used and 17 s n 2 ρ f ρ s ρ f 40 n 2 is the effective lower aquifer storage coefficient due to freshwater saltwater interface movement of velocity dh dt fitts 2012 page 224 comparison of eqs 12 and 16 shows that saltwater interface storage coefficient s has the same nature and meaning as the unconfined storage coefficient n1 specific yield for freshwater storage due to water table fluctuations notably however the factor ρf ρs ρf 40 in eq 17 implies that s n1 if n1 n2 the solutions for qs and h1 s can be found by laplace transformation or numerically see appendix a subsequently the solutions for h2 s q1 q2 and q12 are easily obtained from eqs 8 11 and 15 for example the saltwater interface depth is found as h 40 qs h1 s r1 r2 hs and its estimated temporal evolution in the common absence of direct observations can be used to compute values of δh for arbitrary time spans δt in the water balance of eq 7 it is in fact the case that the present modeling approach is a more detailed but still spatially simplified water balance involving a coupled system of two reservoirs with different storage mechanisms this is best revealed by adding eqs 12 and 13 which exactly yields the differential version of the water balance expressed by eq 7 while eq 7 relies on measurements or assumptions of relatively small values of the storage terms an 1δh1 δt and an 2δh δt our model provides these magnitudes as output for a known system forcing due to n and qp 2 6 3 parameterization by letting r12 approach infinity the upper and lower aquifers become decoupled fig 5 and eqs a9 and a10 reduce to t1 ar1n1 and t2 ar2s representing the hydraulic response time scales of each aquifer in isolation for a general aquifer of surface area aaq hydraulic resistance raq and storativity saq this implies a response time scale of tr aaqraqsaq this result is equivalent to the commonly recognized expression for hydrological response time scale tr laq 2 saq taq for a confined rectangular aquifer of width waq transmissivity taq and length laq an analogous comparison for one dimensional radial flow through a circular confined aquifer of radius laq and area aaq laq 2 π leads to raq ln laq r0 2πtaq and tr ln laq r0 laq 2 saq 2taq where r0 is the radius of the inner aquifer boundary this reflects the fact that for radial flow with discharge across the inner boundary aquifer response not only depends on laq 2 saq taq but also on the order of magnitude logarithm of laq r0 townley 1995 for silver springs we estimate r0 500 m based on the fact that the major spring vents are distributed over approximately 1 km of the silver river headwater reach knowles et al 2010 this results in ln laq r0 2 2 and further leads to raq 0 6 taq for relating aquifer transmissivities to the hydraulic resistance values in our model our model possesses five parameters n1 s r1 r2 and r12 when assuming a good hydraulic connection between aquifer and ocean i e r0 0 based on hydrogeological information available we find a first estimate of specific yield as n1 0 2 the independently measured average upper aquifer transmissivity of 2 m2 s is proportional to the reciprocal of hydraulic resistance and may be converted into an estimate of r1 0 6 2 0 3 s m2 the hydraulic leakance of the semi confining layer is reported as approximately 0 02 a 1 motz and dogan 2005 and translates into an estimate of r12 1 0 02a 0 7 s m2 the large uncertainty about both lower aquifer transmissivity and its connectedness to the spring vents directly propagates into a first estimate of r2 however one may expect r2 to be on a similar order of magnitude as r1 such that discharge q2 from the lower aquifer may explain the observed time lag between h1 and qs the effective porosity n2 of the lower aquifer is also expected to range in the same order of magnitude as n1 further details on model parameterization in laplace domain followed by a sensitivity analysis in time domain using a goodness of fit measure gupta et al 2009 are given in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 model application to silver springs optimized model parameters found from steady state and dynamic calibration using time series of inputs n and qp with observations of h1 and qs are t1 1 5 a t2 30 a bq 0 3 bh 0 5 and ah 0 12 s m2 using eqs a6 a10 this can be converted into the five model parameters of fig 5 as r1 0 19 s m2 r2 0 23 s m2 r12 0 1 s m2 n1 0 32 and s 3 corresponding to n2 0 08 these results agree in order of magnitude with the first estimates from hydrogeological aquifer properties above resistance r12 is somewhat smaller here which we attribute to the fact that the semi confining layer is known to be absent over portions of the springshed lower aquifer porosity n2 is also smaller than n1 which may be due to a reduction in aquifer porosity with depth e g weaker karstification fracturing larger overburden and or an incomplete presence of the saltwater interface below the freshwater body which could be partially underlain by impermeable bedrock fig 6 displays time series of estimates from our aquifer model for qs and h1 compared to field measurements despite the relative simplicity of the model estimates of both monthly data fig 6a and b and 30 year means fig 6c and d reproduce fundamental properties of measured data at both time scales that is variability in qs and h1 at a monthly scale is well predicted while at the same time matching the variance and time lag of long term means being aware of the relationship between eq 7 and eqs 12 and 13 section 2 6 2 the red continuous line in fig 6c is also a representation of the moving water balance including saltwater interaction i e eq 7 after isolating qs av we observe a clearly improved performance with respect to fig 4 where saltwater interaction was ignored eq 6 and water balances for different scenarios remained either far from closing or required unreasonable assumptions on both et and qp for yet further illustration we use our calibrated model to produce two additional simulations of qs av for the scenarios of no pumping r0 0 as before and qp 0 fig 6c red dashed line as well as of an underlying saltwater body which is disconnected from the ocean r0 and qp as before fig 6c red dotted line while there is sensitivity to pumping its effects are relatively small compared to the overall decline observed in spring discharge disallowing the movement of the saltwater interface and related changes in freshwater storage causes a much larger impact on the water balance most notably the impact of the dynamic saltwater interface also very accurately explains the observed discrepancies in long term averages of recharge green and discharge blue as part of the water balance our model estimates saltwater interface depths between 530 and 560 m below sea level fig 6d which is consistent with results of independent studies hughes et al 2009 williams and kuniansky 2016 changes in freshwater storage per unit springshed area due to saltwater movement are equal to the product of porosity and changes in interface depth eqs 7 and 13 interface movement is seen to be in marked disequilibrium with water table fluctuations compare red and black lines an observation that has been reported previously for near shore aquifers michael et al 2005 note also that the long term amplitude of interface depth fluctuations greatly exceeds that of the water level in the unconfined aquifer for several decades before 2010 our model estimates a decline in lower aquifer freshwater storage and a related rise of the saltwater interface with the overlying deep and older freshwater body this finding is consistent with the observation that the apparent age of water at another major karst spring approximately 100 km north west of silver springs has monotonically increased for approximately 20 years martin et al 2016 moreover a comprehensive age dating study at silver springs concluded that almost 50 of spring discharge derived from the two major vents consists of young water 5 years while the remaining spring groups contribute older water 30 years knowles et al 2010 this is comparable to our model predicting that upper aquifer i e younger discharge q1 amounts to approximately 60 of total spring discharge both on average i e steady state as well as for the time of age dating in 2007 model results in the spectral domain fig 7 a as a function of frequency f also show good agreement between the observed periodogram in qs grey and the respective estimated power spectral density psd from eq a4 blue insignificant attenuation between long term fluctuations of n and qs are only expected for changes over multiple centuries log10 f 2 5 moreover there is potential for even larger time lags δt than observed in fig 2d if long term trends are significant over time scales of more than one century i e f 0 01 a 1 currell et al 2016 fig 7b blue line for short term variability e g intra annual with log10 f 0 fig 7a and b illustrate a strong degree of attenuation between recharge and discharge peaks associated with relatively small time lags due to the large hydraulic response time of the lower aquifer and its significant contribution to overall springshed dynamics single recharge events do not alter the system state drastically for example a single recharge event equivalent to the volume of one month of average spring discharge qs approximately 21 m3 s has a maximum impact of 0 4 m3 s on qs at the time of the event and causes a maximum movement of the saltwater interface of 20 cm approximately 5 years after the event this extremely slow dynamics at a relatively large depth poses significant challenges to direct monitoring of interface movement the effects of long term changes in recharge on qs freshwater storage n 1δh1 n 2δh eq 7 and interface depth h are illustrated for both step fig 7c and ramp functions fig 7d the step response functions show that it takes approximately one century for the aquifer to reach equilibrium after a sudden change in the recharge regime e g extensive land development over a short period of time moreover the ramp response functions fig 7d suggest that aquifer response to gradual changes in recharge as expected from long term changes in land use pumping or particularly resulting from climate change may present delays of 20 30 years 3 2 model general implications depending on the properties of a particular aquifer e g a porosity at the saltwater interface 0 08 as estimated for silver springs time scales of aquifer responses and associated time lags may be even larger in large aquifers of low transmissivity multi decadal response times may occur even in the absence of saltwater interaction however mean elevation and variability of aquifer water levels must then be large enough to both match the low transmissivity for a given discharge and actually provide for correspondingly large volumetric changes in freshwater storage for a more general illustration of the effects of freshwater storage due to fluctuations of both water table and saltwater interface we reduce the silver springs model to a single reservoir this reduction is achieved by setting r12 0 and r2 such that eqs a2 and a3 collapse to 18 q n 1 t r k where k is the laplace variable and superscript asterisks denote variables in laplace space the hydraulic response time tr r1a n1 s consists of the additive components due to fluctuations of the water table and specific yield n1 as well as due to fluctuations of the saltwater interface and porosity n2 through eq 17 eq 18 is successfully validated against a numerical sutra model for n1 0 i e confined conditions see supporting information using k 2πi tw where i is the imaginary unit we take the absolute value and argument of the complex transfer function q n to arrive at expressions for spectral attenuation and dimensionless time lag as 19 q a n a 1 1 2 π t r t w 2 20 δ t t w 1 2 π arctan 2 π t r t w where na and tw are amplitude and wavelength of recharge respectively while qa and δt are the attenuated amplitude and time lag of discharge q with respect to recharge a sinusoidal trend component in long term averages of recharge causes a sinusoidal trend component in long term averages of discharge which is of equal wavelength but increasingly attenuated qa na 1 in eq 19 and delayed δt tw 0 in eq 20 as hydraulic response time grows fig 8 a compare green line with blue lines for different values of tr tw where nm and qm denote the means of n and q respectively in a plot of recharge against discharge for a particular spectral component such attenuation and time delay may lead to significant deviations from the line of identity fig 8b green line for tr tw 0 i e n q when tr tw is larger than zero consequently if changes in freshwater storage are neglected typical mass balance metrics such as q n long term mean discharge per unit long term mean recharge are in error and not constant in time the maximum error in volumetric water balance is the change in freshwater storage illustrated as the shaded area in fig 8a for tr tw 0 1 equal to the difference between recharged and discharged volumes vn and vq during a half period where q n or vice versa in relative terms of vq vn there is significant potential for water budget errors if both na nm long term recharge variability as produced by multi decadal oscillations and tr tw are larger than zero fig 8c yellow zone such errors are in general due to both attenuation and time lag moreover for tr tw 0 01 where attenuation is practically absent fig 8a eq 19 there is still potential for significant time lags equal to δt tr fig 8d eq 20 with arctan x x for x 1 which may be consequential if tr is on the order of the time scale of a water budget study note however that in general δt tr i e time lag can be much smaller than response time and that eq 20 provides a simple first order expression for their relationship as a function of tw eqs 19 and 20 and fig 8 show that the relative hydraulic response time tr tw fundamentally determines aquifer dynamics presently the availability of detailed hydrological records limits long term water balance studies to several decades at the most that is while annual and sub annual fluctuations can be effectively filtered out by temporal averaging as customary with long term water balance studies decadal and multi decadal fluctuations currell et al 2016 cannot be eliminated this further means that the presence of tw on the order of decades or more may induce significant errors if changes in freshwater storage are not correctly accounted for 4 conclusions large hydraulic response times can result in significant rate dependent hystereses between long term trends in aquifer recharge and discharge figs 2c and 8b such hystereses directly affect assessments of freshwater storage depletion stream flow models and generally any type of water budget calculation if not accounted for long term lags between recharge and discharge inevitably cause discrepancies between flux and volume based methods for aquifer depletion studies taylor et al 2013 or may confound the distinction between anthropogenic and climate driven aquifer depletion yi et al 2016 a potential mechanism for causing large hydraulic response times in coastal aquifers is the movement of the saltwater interface with the associated changes of freshwater storage in the aquifer we present an expanded freshwater balance equation to account for this effect and demonstrate its significance through the development of a parsimonious model of freshwater recharge storage discharge dynamics in an aquifer with application to silver springs florida although not investigated here in detail we anticipate further important implications of our findings one is with regard to regional and long term water resources management using aquifer storage and recovery asr strategies alley et al 2002 where multi decadal variability and significant time lags between periods of maximum recharge storage and stream discharge provide potential for exploitation further implications are expected for the interpretation of large scale remote sensing data for coastal aquifers such as provided by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace famiglietti and rodell 2013 sproles et al 2015 breña naranjo et al 2014 sun et al 2010 as a decline in freshwater storage is associated with a rising higher density saltwater column at the bottom of the freshwater lens finally we highlight the broader relevance of our findings by recognizing 1 the importance of coastal aquifers for

5816,in agricultural practices the huge demand on fresh water for irrigation together with water scarcity encourages the reuse of wastewater as a water resource integrated management of water resources by considering the efficient use of wastewater could result in fresh water saving a field experiment was conducted to compare the effects of two irrigation water sources brackish secondary treated wastewater and surface canal fresh water on maize crop during the irrigation cycle soil water content distribution was estimated by means of time lapse mode electrical resistivity tomography ert soil electrical resistivity being highly sensitive to soil moisture and water salinity the effects of the two water sources on the spatial temporal distribution of ert derived soil moisture values were assessed and different roots behaviors observed results show a decreased root water uptake with brackish irrigation water with respect to fresh water this result implies an increase in water savings due to reduced crop water requirement which has significant implications for economic and environmental management keywords treated wastewater reuse sustainable irrigation brackish water root water uptake electrical resistivity tomography ert fresh water saving 1 introduction the increasing demand for fresh water for irrigation combined with water scarcity encourages the reuse of wastewater as a water resource in the next few years widespread and more frequent use of treated wastewater as an adaptation to climate change is expected however sustained treated wastewater reuse in agriculture requires careful consideration in many aspects such as soil and crop characteristics and the irrigation scheme therefore knowledge based management kbm scheduling must be developed and locally tailored the farmer s choice of the right irrigation depth and timing should be driven by robust knowledge from monitoring soil moisture hydraulic characteristics and by soil and crop modeling rather than on an empirical basis several authors have studied the crop response to using treated water for irrigation in terms of root and of aboveground vegetation growth yield mass and quality and hygienic risks to the food chain related to possible fecal contamination forslund et al 2010 jensen et al 2010 forslund et al 2013 battilani et al 2014 however the impact of irrigation with moderately saline wastewater on the soil volume colonized by roots has not yet been well investigated this is not a trivial issue since the reuse of brackish wastewater could affect soil plant water interactions and soil hydrological properties as well as plant growth and crop yield as pointed out by the fao technical paper pescod 1992 that provides the guidelines for using treated effluent for irrigation to develop an applicable and effective kbm scheduling detailed knowledge of the soil plant water interaction and an accurate estimate of the main hydrological parameters is required to provide models with high quality data the conventional use of sensors for point scale hydrological measurements is not always adequate to model soil heterogeneity and salt accumulation due to the difficulties of deploying a suitable number of probes able to capture the spatial variability of soil properties in the field recently in addition to point scale measurements non conventional approaches that use non invasive geophysical methods represent promising tools for agricultural applications including precision agriculture hydrologic monitoring and environmental investigations allred et al 2008 electrical methods are particularly suited to model soil hydrological properties because electrical properties are highly sensitive to soil moisture and salinity samouëlian et al 2005 many authors report success in using geophysical techniques to estimate soil moisture changes michot et al 2003 beff et al 2013 alamry et al 2017 evaluate spatial variability of root water uptake srayeddin and doussan 2009 vanella et al 2018 quantify root biomass amato et al 2008 rossi et al 2011 and monitor soil plant interactions ursino et al 2013 cassiani et al 2016 among these cassiani et al 2016 monitored rhizosphere eco hydrological processes in an apple orchard using time lapse minimally invasive micro 3d electrical resistivity tomography ert to better understand soil vegetation water exchanges in the upper soil layer colonized by roots the authors clearly recognized the need to consider the effects of water salinity in the water infiltration process in this paper we mainly focus on evaluating water quality effects on the irrigation dynamics of the root zone via time lapse ert monitoring the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of ert to image the effects of treated wastewater on root water uptake and to accurately estimate the soil moisture distribution over space and time for this purpose the impacts of different irrigation water qualities were studied during the maize crop growing season 2 materials and methods within the water4crops euro india collaborative project reference website http www water4crops org several experimental activities focused on the assessment and impact of different irrigation waters treated brackish wastewater and fresh water and irrigation strategies on crop productivity have been carried out the amount and timing of irrigation water and supplied nutrients was calculated using a specific decision support system dss in particular the fertirrigere dss model battilani 2006 was developed for maize and locally calibrated and validated to manage irrigation scheduling for every irrigation cycle and to improve the precision calculations of soil moisture and crop water and nutrient requirements the model was adjusted according to the field recorded soil moisture data from sensors and or gravimetric measurements some of these results were already published in afzal et al 2016 this paper will focus mainly on small scale and high resolution ert monitoring to image the effects of brackish wastewater on root uptake 2 1 experimental field site the experimental field located near bologna in the plain of the po river northern italy fig 1 a was chosen for its proximity to a small wastewater treatment plant 2000 ei fig 1b that delivered tertiary treated disinfected water for experimental activities this fulfilled the minimum requirements of italian legislative decree 152 2006 the treated water was spiked with sodium chloride to keep the electrical conductivity ec constant at 4 0 ds m 1 corresponding to the maximum ec allowed by italian law d l 152 2006 for agricultural reuse of urban treated wastewater the fresh water used for the field test ec 0 3 ds m 1 comes from the canal near the experimental farm the experimental field was characterized by the typical soils of the po valley with a high content of both silt and clay and low content of fine sand fig 2 those soils are normally deep and without a noticeable skeleton 2 mm an extensive and shallow water table is normally at a depth ranging from 0 6 m to 1 6 m below ground surface bgs during the winter and at the beginning of the growing season the capillary rise can be significant in terms of crop evapotranspiration etc replenishment or even harmful for the plant this shallow water table limits salt leaching and often causes salt transport upwards from the soil layers under the root zone 1 m by means of capillary rise moreover the silty clayey soil is characterized by slow horizontal and gravity water movement which can result in water clogging the soil and temporary high salt concentration or accumulation near the active roots for the experimental tests two adjacent plots from the same roughly 1 5 ha experimental site were used each plot was irrigated for the entire season with either fresh or treated brackish wastewater before starting the experimental tests the soil was characterized in terms of textural and hydrological properties sixteen core samples s1 s16 and eight samples for each plot were collected using standard 8 0 cm ø soil auger from the layer 0 0 50 m depth before starting the geophysical monitoring among these two core samples were drilled along the two ert profiles to relate the geophysical signal to the soil properties particle size analysis was carried out by sieving gee and or 2002 to determine the percentage of sand 2 0 05 mm silt 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 0 002 mm based on the u s department of agriculture soil classifications usda 1982 the results of soil texture analysis shown in fig 2 highlight the homogeneity in terms of particle size for the whole test site and particularly for samples s1 s7 and s14 s15 collected along the ert profiles fig 3 installed in the two plots that were irrigated differently moreover during the irrigation season the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured at 8 locations and at two different depths 0 15 and 0 30 m bgs within both plots using a guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corporation 1987 a t test was performed to compare the two datasets each consisted of 8 saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured in both plots irrigated with fresh water and in that irrigated with brackish water at 0 15 m depth the two data sets belong to the same population since the p value was equal to 0 039 and therefore are statistically equal at the 95 confidence level the average saturated hydraulic conductivity value was 1 8 10 4 cm s 1 at 0 15 m bgs the same statistical approach was used for the two data sets of the saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured at 0 30 m depth again the two data sets belong to the same population having p value equal to 0 048 and in this case 0 30 m depth the computed average hydraulic conductivity was 2 6 10 4 cm s 1 2 2 soil moisture and salinity measurements in the experimental test site capacitance sensors were installed for soil moisture salinity and temperature measurements soil moisture was recorded hourly using sensors spectrum smec300 placed into and below the root zone overall 24 sensors were installed in 12 measurement points at two different depths 0 3 m and 0 6 m bgs soil salinity was measured by the same sensors equipped with a pair of carbon ink electrodes which provide a large contact surface with the soil interstitial water 2 3 electrical resistivity tomography electrical resistivity is an intrinsic property of soil that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes electric current flow it is based on ohm s law and its measurement consists of injecting electric current into the ground through two current electrodes and measuring a voltage difference at two potential electrodes when electrodes are used alternatively as current and voltage dipoles along a line or a grid a 2d or 3d resistivity distribution in the subsurface in a tomography scheme ert is obtained the observed electrical resistivity i e the resistance multiplied by a geometrical factor that depends on the arrangement of the quadrupole is an apparent value because it assumes a homogeneous subsurface the true subsurface resistivity model is obtained solving the inversion problem binley and kemna 2005 by determining a model of the subsurface whose response agrees with the observed data in detail a starting model i e a homogeneous resistivity distribution in the subsurface is iteratively modified so that the difference between the model response and the observed data values is minimized the soil resistivity values are converted to saturation degree through petrophysical relationships typically archie s law archie 1942 or into soil moisture by means of a site specific calibration function as was done in this study 2 3 1 geophysical monitoring in april before the start of the irrigation season two static ert profiles located less than 40 m apart were measured to define the background resistivity of the investigated soil for each ert profile 48 stainless steel electrodes placed 0 15 m apart fig 3 were used at the two plots from the same experimental site and irrigated with the two different water qualities the short inter electrode spacing half the distance between the drippers along each profile was chosen to obtain accurate and detailed high resolution in electrical resistivity images and to adequately capture the infiltration and suction process by the roots subsequently during the peak of the maize growing season an ert survey was carried out in time lapse mode to monitor a complete irrigation cycle defined as the time period between two subsequent irrigations as mentioned before a dss was used to manage the irrigation schedule for each cycle to optimize the needed quantity of water therefore every irrigation cycle could be monitored as an independent snapshot and this allowed monitoring a single cycle by using a high spatial temporal resolution geophysical survey the expected investigation depth was about 0 6 m i e the depth mainly involved in the root water uptake to calibrate the geophysical data along each ert profile two smec 300 sensors were installed at two different depths 0 3 m and 0 6 m fig 3 during the maximum root expansion phase the infiltration redistribution of irrigation water was monitored using five ert acquisition data sets distributed over three days the first ert data set t1 was collected before the monitored irrigation to determine the starting condition during the first day of monitoring the two plots were irrigated for about 6 h with 5 3 mm of fresh water and treated brackish wastewater respectively after about 2 and 10 h from the end of the irrigation the second and the third ert data sets t2 and t3 were collected the fourth and the fifth ert data sets t4 and t5 were recorded after 24 and 32 h from the end of irrigation respectively during the entire monitoring period 10 ert data acquisitions were collected the ert survey was performed using a dipole dipole configuration array 1500 quadrupoles for each data set of which 750 were direct and 750 were reciprocal measurements for the data quality control the misfit between direct and reciprocal data provides the data error estimate as commonly suggested in the inversion procedure to minimize geometrical error due to the positions of the current source points the electrodes were placed into holes drilled in wooden boards fig 1c and kept fixed for the entire monitoring period before collecting ert data a good flow of electrical current into the subsurface was confirmed by low values of contact resistance less than 1 kω measured between the electrode and the ground preliminary electrical data were collected to set the transmission parameters such as injected current and potential measured table 1 res2dinv commercial software www geotomosoft com was used for the inversion process the raw experimental data were treated by removing the data points that overcame the threshold values table 2 to ensure that good quality data were considered for the inversion procedure for each ert dataset 29 resistivity data points less than 4 were removed prior to the inversion step therefore the complete dataset for the time lapse inversion consisted of 721 resistivity data points a 3 data error estimate that is the tolerance threshold derived from the reciprocal data analysis see table 2 was incorporated in res2dinv as a boundary condition for the inversion process the inversion was carried out following two different procedures 1 two ert background images one for each monitored plot were inverted independently and 2 the other eight ert images four for each plot were inverted using time lapse analysis based on joint inversion techniques and different types of cross model constraints kim et al 2009 the starting data set inversion model was used as a reference model in the inversion of subsequent time lapse data sets the whole data set was inverted using a simultaneous inversion option in which the model obtained at the final iteration for the first data set is used as the starting model for the successive data sets a robust smoothness constrained option claerbout and muir 1973 which minimizes the absolute changes in the model resistivity values was applied in the present study case the data set collected soon after the stop of irrigation t2 was chosen as the reference resistivity model with which to compare subsequent images this is because the changes in electrical resistivity between data sets t1 and t2 recorded in the upper part of the subsurface could have been attributed to inversion artifacts kim et al 2009 due to the vertical resolution of geophysical images being approximately equal to the inter electrode spacing 0 15 m the inversion process was stopped after five iterations beyond which the rms error the root mean square between the calculated and measured model ranging from 4 to 6 did not change significantly during ert monitoring the soil temperature trend recorded at two different depths fig 4 shows a quasi steady temperature over time 2 3 2 electrical resistivity vs soil moisture correlation function due to the high clay content in the investigated soil the contribution of surface conduction in archie s law is not negligible for this reason to convert ert images ρ ω m into soil moisture data θ g g we experimentally determine a specific petrophysical relationship we set the temperature at 21 c in a thermostatic room at the irsa cnr laboratory for the laboratory experiment which corresponds to the mean value of the soil temperature recorded during the field activity the two core samples collected from each monitored plot p1a and p2b 0 15 m long and 0 03 m in diameter have dimensions comparable with the resolution of the ert profiles performed in the field the samples were saturated in a vacuum bell jar with the same water used for irrigation in the different plots 0 3 ds m 1 and 4 ds m 1 for samples p1a and p1b respectively and the maximum gravimetric water content recorded after saturation was about 0 3 g g small steel nails were used as electrodes and soil electrical resistivity was measured using a four electrodes array a pair of current electrodes fixed on the external faces of the samples and another pair used as potential electrodes located in between for measuring soil electrical resistivity in the laboratory a homemade device made of an industrial box connected to the nails by means of cables and terminals was used a precision load cell ohaus scout pro 4000 g resolution 0 1 g was used for weighing the samples while electrical measurements were collected using an iris instruments syscal switch pro 48 resistivity meter during the evaporation process the samples reached water content of about 0 1 g g the electrical resistivity and weight data were simultaneously collected every 5 min for the first monitoring day and then every hour for about one week while drying the sample weights decreased and gravimetric soil water content was computed by means the formula 1 θ g w i w d w d where θg is the gravimetric soil water content g g wi g is the sample weight measured at different times and wd g is the dry weight of the sample oven dried for 48 h at 105 c 3 results 3 1 time lapse ert survey the comparison among the static ert images fig 5 highlights the resistivity soil conditions before and during the irrigation season fig 5a b and c refer to the plot irrigated with fresh water while fig 5d e and f correspond to the plot irrigated with brackish wastewater specifically fig 5a and d represent the resistivity distribution recorded before starting the irrigation season fig 5b and 5e show the resistivity distribution at time t1 before the monitored irrigation cycle but 90 days after the beginning of irrigation season and fig 5c and 5f show the resistivity distributions at time t2 two hours after the end of the irrigation event fig 5a and d show a very narrow resistivity range about 10 ω m that does not reflect any soil heterogeneity as corroborated by the homogeneity of the soils properties fig 2 fig 5b and e collected at time t1 highlight electrical structures not detected in the resistivity images fig 5a and d from before the beginning of the irrigation season fig 5b in particular shows drop shaped highly resistive bodies in the upper part of the soil corresponding to the location of the drippers installed on the surface while fig 5e shows an almost continuous structure along the line and soft drop shaped resistive bodies at time t2 both the drop shaped and continuous structure along the line highlight a decrease in resistivity fig 5c and f mainly concentrated in the upper part of the soil up to 30 40 cm depth which is the main area involved in root suction activity the effects of resistivity changes during the monitored irrigation cycle are enhanced in the time lapse ert analysis performed with respect to the t2 ert dataset i e the first data set collected after the end of the irrigation the resistivity changes shown in fig 6 look different based on the irrigation water used in the plot irrigated with fresh water the resistivity values increase up to 20 in the upper part of the subsoil within 0 3 m from bgs 30 h after the end of the irrigation fig 6c when brackish water was used a lower increase of resistivity less than 10 at the same observation time is observed in the subsoil up to 0 5 m from bgs fig 6f the analysis of static and time lapse resistivity images comply with the evidence mentioned by srayeddin and doussan 2009 ursino et al 2013 cassiani et al 2016 and vanella et al 2018 that observed positive resistivity changes associated with decreasing volumetric soil moisture caused by the root water uptake nevertheless since the electrical resistivity depends on several factors water content salinity porosity and clay and silt content it provides information that could lead to incorrect interpretation of the hydrological processes therefore to infer clear hydrological meaning from the resistivity images their conversion into water content sections is needed 3 2 ert derived soil moisture the electrical resistivity vs gravimetric soil moisture experimental curves obtained in the laboratory shown in fig 7 highlight different trends for the samples saturated with different types of water considering the noticeable water salinity effects measured at the sample scale the ert images were converted into soil moisture using the two different calibration functions the graphs in fig 8 show good agreement between soil moisture values measured hourly by the smec300 and those estimated from ert data at five time points and in the two measurement plots locally the estimated and measured values of θ slightly differ from each other due to the different spatial resolution of the two approaches moreover at a small scale the irregularities of the ground surface can influence the emitter s positioning at the plot scale the spatiotemporal pattern of the water content before and during the geophysical monitoring is shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows static soil water content at time t1 fig 9a and c and at time t2 fig 9b and d while fig 10 highlights the water content changes with respect to the t2 model chosen as the reference water content model according to the time lapse resistivity processing fig 6 as explained in section 2 3 1 the comparison between the water content images recorded at time t1 and t2 in the plots irrigated with fresh water and brackish wastewater highlights drop differences in structures drop shaped and continuous structures along the line respectively and soil water content range in fact at time t1 the soil irrigated with brackish wastewater fig 9c had a higher water content compared with that irrigated using fresh water fig 9a at time t2 two hours after the end of the irrigation event both in soil irrigated with fresh and brackish water the water content increases fig 9b and d within 30 40 cm from bgs which is the subsoil portion mainly involved in the roots activity the time lapse analysis fig 10 highlights water content changes recorded in the following 30 h at time t3 10 h after the end of irrigation that is 8 h after time t2 drop shaped positive water content changes were still recorded in soil irrigated with fresh water fig 10a while small changes were observed in soil irrigated with brackish water fig 10d at time t4 and t5 24 h and 32 h after the end of irrigation respectively a significant decreasing water content trend up to 20 was evident in soil irrigated with fresh water and negative drop shaped structures were concentrated corresponding to the position of the drippers installed on the surface fig 10b c however in plots irrigated with brackish wastewater an almost continuous structure is seen along the line and soil moisture variations do not exceed 5 fig 10e f compared with smec 300 measurements ert can estimate 2d soil moisture distribution with high lateral and vertical resolution emphasizing the main features of the irrigation dynamics not detected by the solely point scale measurements to better highlight the dynamics of the irrigation cycle vertical soil moisture profiles were extracted from ert images along with the smec300 measurements points fig 11 in this case the vertical profiles also confirm the different trends recorded in plots irrigated with fresh and brackish wastewater i e reduced water uptake in the upper portion of the soil irrigated with brackish wastewater in both cases at the end of the irrigation season the soil salinity values decreased showing a negligible soil salinization effect probably due to the rain leaching effects this trend highlights an interesting issue to consider in case of wastewater used as an irrigation source even though there are interesting only two years of soil salinity monitoring 4 discussion the resistivity images figs 5 and 6 and water content sections figs 9 and 10 highlight similar patterns given the correlation between resistivity and water content nevertheless to provide a clear hydrological meaning to the resistivity images static and time lapse ert derived water content images need to be considered the different patterns observed when different water quality is used i e drop shaped and almost continuous structures along the line for soils irrigated with fresh and brackish water respectively mainly depend on the soil water content conditions fig 9a and c in fact the high soil water content recorded on the plot irrigated with brackish water at time t1 is due to the reduced capability of the plants to take up water from the soil this evidence leads to a homogeneous distribution of water content fig 9c recorded 90 days after the beginning of the irrigation season however the soil irrigated with fresh water shows alternating low water content values fig 9a concentrated in drop shaped bulbs observed exactly below the position of the drippers installed in correspondence with the maize plants the different behavior of the plant to take up water from the soil depending on the quality of the irrigation water as observed in the geophysical results could be explained by the fact that the osmotic pressure by means of which the root extracts water from the pore space can change under different salt concentrations as previous studies corroborate eaton 1941 romero aranda et al 2001 at the same time time lapse water content changes fig 10 clearly show the general pattern associated with both the infiltration dynamics and the root water uptake effects in fact within 10 h from the end of the irrigation event infiltration dynamics is prevalent compared to the root water uptake because the water content increases in the upper portion of the soil up to about 30 40 cm which is the area mainly involved in the roots activity later the water content in the drop shaped and in the continuous structures along line decreases meaning that the suction activity by the roots is predominant however soil salinity could also affect the dynamics of the soil water the crop yield and the total dry matter specifically in this study from the geophysical point of view we can assume negligible effects of soil salinity as confirmed by the steadiness of the soil salinity values collected in the field along the ert profiles during the monitoring period this assures that the percentage changes observed in the soil moisture distribution during the irrigation cycle fig 10 are due to the soil plant water interaction since the soil quite homogeneous in terms of texture and hydraulic properties as corroborated by the saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements therefore the small changes in soil moisture distribution observed in soil irrigated with brackish water figg 10d 10e 10f imply a reduced water requirement by the plants due to the lowered root suction by considering the scant literature on using brackish water for irrigation this evidence has a great impact on water resource management in agriculture opening challenging scenarios in using brackish water as a water irrigation source the potential use of brackish wastewater is enhanced considering its poor impact on plant growth in fact afzal et al 2016 demonstrated that some of the biometric measurements crop dry matter leaf area index and nitrogen content do not change significantly over two irrigation seasons whether fresh or brackish wastewater is used at the same time showed a negligible soil salinization process probably due to the rain leaching effect during the winter without affecting the yield crop however the impact of long term irrigation with brackish wastewater on soil salinity needs to be evaluated 5 conclusion we investigated the capability of a non invasive ert technique to evaluate the effects of treated wastewater on the dynamics of the irrigation cycle in particular the root water uptake and the soil moisture distribution were accurately monitored using time lapse analysis the results obtained prove that ert is an effective tool to monitor over space and time the processes triggered by irrigation that point scale measurements are not able to capture adequately accurate estimates of soil moisture content were obtained by converting the ert data through specific petrophysical relationships experimentally determined in a laboratory with the same irrigation water quality used in the field the estimated soil moisture changes visualized in the profiles were related to the root water uptake effects when brackish water is used for irrigation the root uptake decreases as demonstrated by the low changes in soil moisture content this behavior can be explained by the high osmotic pressure that inhibits the water flow from the soil to the plant which could have a relevant implication in terms of reduced water requirement and hence increased water saving by encouraging the reuse of treated wastewater as a water resource in agriculture moreover previously published predictive scenarios over the entire maize irrigation season confirm the plants capability to save water when brackish wastewater is used as an irrigation source without affecting crop productivity afzal et al 2016 this work demonstrates that reusing treated brackish water in agriculture combined with the reduced crop water requirement caused by using brackish water for irrigation can allow water savings especially with the joint use of novel irrigation strategies the results of this study have significant economic and environmental implications not only in terms of water savings but also for sustainable wastewater reuse especially in areas where clean drinking water is scarce or where poor quality soils are already subjected to salinization for these conditions wastewater could be used as the only source for irrigation with positive economic implications furthermore reusing wastewater could have a positive impact on environmental strategies because its high nutrient content could reduce or even eliminate the need to

5816,in agricultural practices the huge demand on fresh water for irrigation together with water scarcity encourages the reuse of wastewater as a water resource integrated management of water resources by considering the efficient use of wastewater could result in fresh water saving a field experiment was conducted to compare the effects of two irrigation water sources brackish secondary treated wastewater and surface canal fresh water on maize crop during the irrigation cycle soil water content distribution was estimated by means of time lapse mode electrical resistivity tomography ert soil electrical resistivity being highly sensitive to soil moisture and water salinity the effects of the two water sources on the spatial temporal distribution of ert derived soil moisture values were assessed and different roots behaviors observed results show a decreased root water uptake with brackish irrigation water with respect to fresh water this result implies an increase in water savings due to reduced crop water requirement which has significant implications for economic and environmental management keywords treated wastewater reuse sustainable irrigation brackish water root water uptake electrical resistivity tomography ert fresh water saving 1 introduction the increasing demand for fresh water for irrigation combined with water scarcity encourages the reuse of wastewater as a water resource in the next few years widespread and more frequent use of treated wastewater as an adaptation to climate change is expected however sustained treated wastewater reuse in agriculture requires careful consideration in many aspects such as soil and crop characteristics and the irrigation scheme therefore knowledge based management kbm scheduling must be developed and locally tailored the farmer s choice of the right irrigation depth and timing should be driven by robust knowledge from monitoring soil moisture hydraulic characteristics and by soil and crop modeling rather than on an empirical basis several authors have studied the crop response to using treated water for irrigation in terms of root and of aboveground vegetation growth yield mass and quality and hygienic risks to the food chain related to possible fecal contamination forslund et al 2010 jensen et al 2010 forslund et al 2013 battilani et al 2014 however the impact of irrigation with moderately saline wastewater on the soil volume colonized by roots has not yet been well investigated this is not a trivial issue since the reuse of brackish wastewater could affect soil plant water interactions and soil hydrological properties as well as plant growth and crop yield as pointed out by the fao technical paper pescod 1992 that provides the guidelines for using treated effluent for irrigation to develop an applicable and effective kbm scheduling detailed knowledge of the soil plant water interaction and an accurate estimate of the main hydrological parameters is required to provide models with high quality data the conventional use of sensors for point scale hydrological measurements is not always adequate to model soil heterogeneity and salt accumulation due to the difficulties of deploying a suitable number of probes able to capture the spatial variability of soil properties in the field recently in addition to point scale measurements non conventional approaches that use non invasive geophysical methods represent promising tools for agricultural applications including precision agriculture hydrologic monitoring and environmental investigations allred et al 2008 electrical methods are particularly suited to model soil hydrological properties because electrical properties are highly sensitive to soil moisture and salinity samouëlian et al 2005 many authors report success in using geophysical techniques to estimate soil moisture changes michot et al 2003 beff et al 2013 alamry et al 2017 evaluate spatial variability of root water uptake srayeddin and doussan 2009 vanella et al 2018 quantify root biomass amato et al 2008 rossi et al 2011 and monitor soil plant interactions ursino et al 2013 cassiani et al 2016 among these cassiani et al 2016 monitored rhizosphere eco hydrological processes in an apple orchard using time lapse minimally invasive micro 3d electrical resistivity tomography ert to better understand soil vegetation water exchanges in the upper soil layer colonized by roots the authors clearly recognized the need to consider the effects of water salinity in the water infiltration process in this paper we mainly focus on evaluating water quality effects on the irrigation dynamics of the root zone via time lapse ert monitoring the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of ert to image the effects of treated wastewater on root water uptake and to accurately estimate the soil moisture distribution over space and time for this purpose the impacts of different irrigation water qualities were studied during the maize crop growing season 2 materials and methods within the water4crops euro india collaborative project reference website http www water4crops org several experimental activities focused on the assessment and impact of different irrigation waters treated brackish wastewater and fresh water and irrigation strategies on crop productivity have been carried out the amount and timing of irrigation water and supplied nutrients was calculated using a specific decision support system dss in particular the fertirrigere dss model battilani 2006 was developed for maize and locally calibrated and validated to manage irrigation scheduling for every irrigation cycle and to improve the precision calculations of soil moisture and crop water and nutrient requirements the model was adjusted according to the field recorded soil moisture data from sensors and or gravimetric measurements some of these results were already published in afzal et al 2016 this paper will focus mainly on small scale and high resolution ert monitoring to image the effects of brackish wastewater on root uptake 2 1 experimental field site the experimental field located near bologna in the plain of the po river northern italy fig 1 a was chosen for its proximity to a small wastewater treatment plant 2000 ei fig 1b that delivered tertiary treated disinfected water for experimental activities this fulfilled the minimum requirements of italian legislative decree 152 2006 the treated water was spiked with sodium chloride to keep the electrical conductivity ec constant at 4 0 ds m 1 corresponding to the maximum ec allowed by italian law d l 152 2006 for agricultural reuse of urban treated wastewater the fresh water used for the field test ec 0 3 ds m 1 comes from the canal near the experimental farm the experimental field was characterized by the typical soils of the po valley with a high content of both silt and clay and low content of fine sand fig 2 those soils are normally deep and without a noticeable skeleton 2 mm an extensive and shallow water table is normally at a depth ranging from 0 6 m to 1 6 m below ground surface bgs during the winter and at the beginning of the growing season the capillary rise can be significant in terms of crop evapotranspiration etc replenishment or even harmful for the plant this shallow water table limits salt leaching and often causes salt transport upwards from the soil layers under the root zone 1 m by means of capillary rise moreover the silty clayey soil is characterized by slow horizontal and gravity water movement which can result in water clogging the soil and temporary high salt concentration or accumulation near the active roots for the experimental tests two adjacent plots from the same roughly 1 5 ha experimental site were used each plot was irrigated for the entire season with either fresh or treated brackish wastewater before starting the experimental tests the soil was characterized in terms of textural and hydrological properties sixteen core samples s1 s16 and eight samples for each plot were collected using standard 8 0 cm ø soil auger from the layer 0 0 50 m depth before starting the geophysical monitoring among these two core samples were drilled along the two ert profiles to relate the geophysical signal to the soil properties particle size analysis was carried out by sieving gee and or 2002 to determine the percentage of sand 2 0 05 mm silt 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 0 002 mm based on the u s department of agriculture soil classifications usda 1982 the results of soil texture analysis shown in fig 2 highlight the homogeneity in terms of particle size for the whole test site and particularly for samples s1 s7 and s14 s15 collected along the ert profiles fig 3 installed in the two plots that were irrigated differently moreover during the irrigation season the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured at 8 locations and at two different depths 0 15 and 0 30 m bgs within both plots using a guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corporation 1987 a t test was performed to compare the two datasets each consisted of 8 saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured in both plots irrigated with fresh water and in that irrigated with brackish water at 0 15 m depth the two data sets belong to the same population since the p value was equal to 0 039 and therefore are statistically equal at the 95 confidence level the average saturated hydraulic conductivity value was 1 8 10 4 cm s 1 at 0 15 m bgs the same statistical approach was used for the two data sets of the saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured at 0 30 m depth again the two data sets belong to the same population having p value equal to 0 048 and in this case 0 30 m depth the computed average hydraulic conductivity was 2 6 10 4 cm s 1 2 2 soil moisture and salinity measurements in the experimental test site capacitance sensors were installed for soil moisture salinity and temperature measurements soil moisture was recorded hourly using sensors spectrum smec300 placed into and below the root zone overall 24 sensors were installed in 12 measurement points at two different depths 0 3 m and 0 6 m bgs soil salinity was measured by the same sensors equipped with a pair of carbon ink electrodes which provide a large contact surface with the soil interstitial water 2 3 electrical resistivity tomography electrical resistivity is an intrinsic property of soil that quantifies how strongly a given material opposes electric current flow it is based on ohm s law and its measurement consists of injecting electric current into the ground through two current electrodes and measuring a voltage difference at two potential electrodes when electrodes are used alternatively as current and voltage dipoles along a line or a grid a 2d or 3d resistivity distribution in the subsurface in a tomography scheme ert is obtained the observed electrical resistivity i e the resistance multiplied by a geometrical factor that depends on the arrangement of the quadrupole is an apparent value because it assumes a homogeneous subsurface the true subsurface resistivity model is obtained solving the inversion problem binley and kemna 2005 by determining a model of the subsurface whose response agrees with the observed data in detail a starting model i e a homogeneous resistivity distribution in the subsurface is iteratively modified so that the difference between the model response and the observed data values is minimized the soil resistivity values are converted to saturation degree through petrophysical relationships typically archie s law archie 1942 or into soil moisture by means of a site specific calibration function as was done in this study 2 3 1 geophysical monitoring in april before the start of the irrigation season two static ert profiles located less than 40 m apart were measured to define the background resistivity of the investigated soil for each ert profile 48 stainless steel electrodes placed 0 15 m apart fig 3 were used at the two plots from the same experimental site and irrigated with the two different water qualities the short inter electrode spacing half the distance between the drippers along each profile was chosen to obtain accurate and detailed high resolution in electrical resistivity images and to adequately capture the infiltration and suction process by the roots subsequently during the peak of the maize growing season an ert survey was carried out in time lapse mode to monitor a complete irrigation cycle defined as the time period between two subsequent irrigations as mentioned before a dss was used to manage the irrigation schedule for each cycle to optimize the needed quantity of water therefore every irrigation cycle could be monitored as an independent snapshot and this allowed monitoring a single cycle by using a high spatial temporal resolution geophysical survey the expected investigation depth was about 0 6 m i e the depth mainly involved in the root water uptake to calibrate the geophysical data along each ert profile two smec 300 sensors were installed at two different depths 0 3 m and 0 6 m fig 3 during the maximum root expansion phase the infiltration redistribution of irrigation water was monitored using five ert acquisition data sets distributed over three days the first ert data set t1 was collected before the monitored irrigation to determine the starting condition during the first day of monitoring the two plots were irrigated for about 6 h with 5 3 mm of fresh water and treated brackish wastewater respectively after about 2 and 10 h from the end of the irrigation the second and the third ert data sets t2 and t3 were collected the fourth and the fifth ert data sets t4 and t5 were recorded after 24 and 32 h from the end of irrigation respectively during the entire monitoring period 10 ert data acquisitions were collected the ert survey was performed using a dipole dipole configuration array 1500 quadrupoles for each data set of which 750 were direct and 750 were reciprocal measurements for the data quality control the misfit between direct and reciprocal data provides the data error estimate as commonly suggested in the inversion procedure to minimize geometrical error due to the positions of the current source points the electrodes were placed into holes drilled in wooden boards fig 1c and kept fixed for the entire monitoring period before collecting ert data a good flow of electrical current into the subsurface was confirmed by low

option claerbout and muir 1973 which minimizes the absolute changes in the model resistivity values was applied in the present study case the data set collected soon after the stop of irrigation t2 was chosen as the reference resistivity model with which to compare subsequent images this is because the changes in electrical resistivity between data sets t1 and t2 recorded in the upper part of the subsurface could have been attributed to inversion artifacts kim et al 2009 due to the vertical resolution of geophysical images being approximately equal to the inter electrode spacing 0 15 m the inversion process was stopped after five iterations beyond which the rms error the root mean square between the calculated and measured model ranging from 4 to 6 did not change significantly during ert monitoring the soil temperature trend recorded at two different depths fig 4 shows a quasi steady temperature over time 2 3 2 electrical resistivity vs soil moisture correlation function due to the high clay content in the investigated soil the contribution of surface conduction in archie s law is not negligible for this reason to convert ert images ρ ω m into soil moisture data θ g g we experimentally determine a specific petrophysical relationship we set the temperature at 21 c in a thermostatic room at the irsa cnr laboratory for the laboratory experiment which corresponds to the

for samples p1a and p1b respectively and the maximum gravimetric water content recorded after saturation was about 0 3 g g small steel nails were used as electrodes and soil electrical resistivity was

water the resistivity values increase up to 20 in the upper part of the subsoil within 0 3 m from bgs 30 h after the end of the irrigation fig 6c when brackish water was used a lower increase of resistivity less than 10 at the same observation time is observed in the subsoil up to 0 5 m from bgs fig 6f the analysis of static and time lapse resistivity images comply with the evidence mentioned by srayeddin and doussan 2009 ursino et al 2013 cassiani et al 2016 and vanella et al 2018 that observed positive resistivity changes associated with decreasing volumetric soil moisture caused by the root water uptake nevertheless since the electrical resistivity depends on several factors water content salinity porosity and clay and silt content it provides information that could lead to incorrect interpretation of the hydrological processes therefore to infer clear hydrological meaning from the resistivity images their conversion into water content sections is needed 3 2 ert derived soil moisture the electrical resistivity vs gravimetric soil moisture experimental curves obtained in the laboratory shown in fig 7 highlight different trends for the samples saturated with different types of water considering the noticeable water salinity effects measured at the sample scale the ert images were converted into soil moisture using the two different calibration functions the graphs in fig 8 show good agreement between soil moisture values measured hourly by the smec300 and those estimated from ert data at five time points and in the two measurement plots locally the estimated and measured values of θ slightly differ from each other due to the different spatial resolution of the two approaches moreover at a small scale the irregularities of the ground surface can influence the emitter s positioning at the plot scale the spatiotemporal pattern of the water content before and during the geophysical monitoring is shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows static soil water content at time t1 fig 9a and c and at time t2 fig 9b and d while fig 10 highlights the water content changes with respect to the t2 model chosen as the reference water content model according to the time lapse resistivity processing fig 6 as explained in section 2 3 1 the comparison between the water content images recorded at time t1 and t2 in the plots irrigated with fresh water and brackish wastewater highlights drop differences in structures drop shaped and continuous structures along the line respectively and soil water content range in fact at time t1 the soil irrigated with brackish wastewater fig 9c had a higher water content compared with that irrigated using fresh water fig 9a at time t2 two hours after the end of the irrigation event both in soil irrigated with fresh and brackish water the water content increases fig 9b and d within 30 40 cm from bgs which is the subsoil portion mainly involved in the roots activity the time lapse analysis fig 10 highlights water content changes recorded in the following 30 h at time t3 10 h after the end of irrigation that is 8 h after time t2 drop shaped positive water content changes were still recorded in soil irrigated with fresh water fig 10a while small changes were observed in soil irrigated with brackish water fig 10d at time t4 and t5 24 h and 32 h after the end of irrigation respectively a significant decreasing water content trend up to 20 was evident in soil irrigated with fresh water and negative drop shaped structures were concentrated corresponding to the position of the drippers installed on the surface fig 10b c however in plots irrigated with brackish wastewater an almost continuous structure is seen along the line and soil moisture variations do not exceed 5 fig 10e f compared with smec 300 measurements ert can estimate 2d soil moisture distribution with high lateral and vertical resolution emphasizing the main features of the irrigation dynamics not detected by the solely point scale measurements to better highlight the dynamics of the irrigation cycle vertical soil moisture profiles were extracted from ert images along with the smec300 measurements points fig 11 in this case the vertical profiles also confirm the different trends recorded in plots irrigated with fresh and brackish wastewater i e reduced water uptake in the upper portion of the soil irrigated with brackish wastewater in both cases at the end of the irrigation season the soil salinity values decreased showing a negligible soil salinization effect probably due to the rain leaching effects this trend highlights an interesting issue to consider in case of wastewater used as an irrigation source even though there are interesting only two years of soil salinity monitoring 4 discussion the resistivity images figs 5 and 6 and water content sections figs 9 and 10 highlight similar patterns given the correlation between resistivity and water content nevertheless to provide a clear hydrological meaning to the resistivity images static and time lapse ert derived water content images need to be considered the different patterns observed when different water quality is used i e drop shaped and almost continuous structures along the line for soils irrigated with fresh and brackish water respectively mainly depend on the soil water content conditions fig 9a and c in fact the high soil water content recorded on the plot irrigated with brackish water at time t1 is due to the reduced capability of the plants to take up water from the soil this evidence leads to a homogeneous distribution of water content fig 9c recorded 90 days after the beginning of the irrigation season however the soil irrigated with fresh water shows alternating low water content values fig 9a concentrated in drop shaped bulbs observed exactly below the position of the drippers installed in correspondence with the maize plants the different behavior of the plant to take up water from the soil depending on the quality of the irrigation water as observed in the geophysical results could be explained by the fact that the osmotic pressure by means of which the root extracts water from the pore space can change under different salt concentrations as previous studies corroborate eaton 1941 romero aranda et al 2001 at the same time time lapse water content changes fig 10 clearly show the general pattern associated with both the infiltration dynamics and the root water uptake effects in fact within 10 h from the end of the irrigation event infiltration dynamics is prevalent compared to the root water uptake because the water content increases in the upper portion of the soil up to about 30 40 cm which is the area mainly involved in the roots activity later the water content in the drop shaped and in the continuous structures along line decreases meaning that the suction activity by the roots is predominant however soil salinity could also affect the dynamics of the soil water the crop yield and the total dry matter specifically in this study from the geophysical point of view we can assume negligible effects of soil salinity as confirmed by the steadiness of the soil salinity values collected in the field along the ert profiles during the monitoring period this assures that the percentage changes observed in the soil moisture distribution during the irrigation cycle fig 10 are due to the soil plant water interaction since the soil quite homogeneous in terms of texture and hydraulic properties as corroborated by the saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements therefore the small changes in soil moisture distribution observed in soil irrigated with brackish water figg 10d 10e 10f imply a reduced water requirement by the plants due to the lowered root suction by considering the scant literature on using brackish water for irrigation this evidence has a great impact on water resource management in agriculture opening challenging scenarios in using brackish water as a water irrigation source the potential use of brackish wastewater is enhanced considering its poor impact on plant growth in fact afzal et al 2016 demonstrated that some of the biometric measurements crop dry matter leaf area index and nitrogen content do not change significantly over two irrigation seasons whether fresh or brackish wastewater is used at the same time showed a negligible soil salinization process probably due to the rain leaching effect during the winter without affecting the yield crop however the impact of long term irrigation with brackish wastewater on soil salinity needs to be evaluated 5 conclusion we investigated the capability of a non invasive ert technique to evaluate the effects of treated wastewater on the dynamics of the irrigation cycle in particular the root water uptake and the soil moisture distribution were accurately monitored using time lapse analysis the results obtained prove that ert is an effective tool to monitor over space and time the processes triggered by irrigation that point scale measurements are not able to capture adequately accurate estimates of soil moisture content were obtained by converting the ert data through specific petrophysical relationships experimentally determined in a laboratory with the same irrigation water quality used in the field the estimated soil moisture changes visualized in the profiles were related to the root water uptake effects when brackish water is used for irrigation the root uptake decreases as demonstrated by the low changes in soil moisture content this behavior can be explained by the high osmotic pressure that inhibits the water flow from the soil to the plant which could have a relevant implication in terms of reduced water requirement and hence increased water saving by encouraging the reuse of treated wastewater as a water resource in agriculture moreover previously published predictive scenarios over the entire maize irrigation season confirm the plants capability to save water when brackish wastewater is used as an irrigation source without affecting crop productivity afzal et al 2016 this work demonstrates that reusing treated brackish water in agriculture combined with the reduced crop water requirement caused by using brackish water for irrigation can allow water savings especially with the joint use of novel irrigation strategies the results of this study have significant economic and environmental implications not only in terms of water savings but also for sustainable wastewater reuse especially in areas where clean drinking water is scarce or where poor quality soils are already subjected to salinization for these conditions wastewater could be used as the only source for irrigation with positive economic implications furthermore reusing wastewater could have a positive impact on environmental strategies because its high nutrient content could reduce or even eliminate the need to

5817,the purpose of this research was to compare annual watershed sediment delivery estimates for 60 michigan rivers using two fundamentally different approaches the great lakes regional trend line that was developed by the u s army corps of engineers usace and the global bqart watershed sediment delivery equation that was developed by syvitski and milliman 2007 in addition for six of the 60 watersheds the global bqart equation and the usace great lakes regional trend line were compared to watershed sediment delivery estimates that were prepared by the usace using complex calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models the usace great lakes regional trend line is an empirical equation that was developed based on sediment delivery estimates from 48 reservoirs and 13 watersheds located throughout the great lakes basin and predicts watershed sediment delivery based on watershed area r2 0 78 the syvitski and milliman bqart equation was developed from a database encompassing 488 global rivers whose watersheds cover 63 of the earth s surface the bqart equation estimates watershed sediment delivery as dependent on five variables including a geologic and human influence factor b the mean annual flow of the river q watershed area a the difference between the maximum elevation of the watershed and the elevation of the receiving water relief r and mean basin temperature t the global bqart sediment delivery equation was validated for rivers with mean annual flows exceeding 30 m3 s the watersheds for the 60 michigan rivers evaluated in the present research cover 128 043 kilometers2 and the mean annual river flows range from 1 0 m3 s days river to 132 5 m3 s st joseph river and average 22 m3 sec overall the watershed sediment delivery estimates for these 60 rivers using the global bqart equation were 19 lower than those based on the usace great lakes regional trend line and were within 25 of the usace regional trend line for 21 of the 60 rivers evaluated with respect to the 12 michigan rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 sec the global bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 32 higher than the usace great lakes regional trend line of the remaining 48 rivers with mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s the global bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 31 lower than the usace great lakes regional trend line the global bqart equation provided close estimates of watershed sediment delivery for 21 of the 60 michigan rivers evaluated in this research in comparison to the usace great lakes regional trend line especially for rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s this implies that the global and great lakes regional processes of soil erosion and deposition and sediment transport to the river outlet are similar especially for the large michigan watersheds regression analysis comparing the terms of the global bqart equation to the 60 watershed sediment delivery estimates developed using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line revealed that the most important variables affecting watershed sediment delivery are watershed area a mean annual river flow q and relief r keywords watershed sediment delivery bqart equation usace great lakes regional trend line great lakes basin michigan watersheds 1 introduction watershed sediment delivery is the total amount of sediment generated within a watershed and delivered to the river outlet over a particular timeframe estimation of watershed sediment delivery involves an understanding of the complex processes of soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition borah et al 2008 creech et al 2010 garcia 2008 gray and simoes 2008 macarthur et al 2008 milliman and farnsworth 2011 sommerlot et al 2013 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017a b usace 1995 2008 the present research was conducted to compare annual watershed sediment delivery estimates using two fundamentally different approaches the 2010 great lakes regional trend line that was developed by the usace usace 2010 creech et al 2010 and the global bqart sediment delivery equation that was developed syvitski and milliman 2007 the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line is based on 61 watershed sediment delivery estimates that are located within great lakes basin and served as the basis of comparison with respect to the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates in addition for six of these 60 watersheds the global bqart equation and the usace great lakes regional trend line were compared to watershed sediment delivery estimates that were prepared by the usace using complex calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models with respect to the usace s calibrated watershed sediment delivery models the author s hypothesized that these process based models would be more reliable than either the usace great lakes regional trend line or the global bqart sediment delivery equation by comparing the watershed sediment delivery estimates using the global bqart equation and usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the authors gained insights regarding the river and basin characteristics that primarily affect watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet soil erosion at the watershed scale involves transport of sediment entrained in overland surface water flow to the river system as well as erosion of the bed and banks of the river formation of gullies river bank failure and mass wasting as water and sediment move from a higher elevation to a lower elevation energy is released and a river dissipates this energy by performing work on the channel erosion and deposition and by movement of sediment entrained in water bagnold 1977 morisawa 1968 brooks et al 2013 unesco 2013 the transport of sediment by water forms the bed and banks of the river and changes the slope of the river through aggradation raising of the river bed and degradation deepening of the river bed sediment depositional areas e g sinks within the watershed include sediment deposited onto floodplains and in the bed and banks of the river as well as sediment deposited in natural lakes and manmade reservoirs that trap sediment before it reaches the river outlet biedenharn et al 2008 cohen et al 2014 fisrwg 1998 foster et al 1981 gray and simoes 2008 usace 2008 estimation of watershed sediment delivery integrates the effects of river flow topography surficial geology and land use excessive sedimentation has significant economic impacts and is a leading stressor of biological communities that inhabit these waterways charlton 2008 macarthur et al 2008 smith et al 2015 the effects of excessive sedimentation include habitat degradation and corresponding changes to the biological communities and spawning habitats yang 2006 mdeq 2008 with respect to economic impact damage to infrastructure due to excessive erosion and sedimentation is well documented asce 2008 usace 1995 usace 2015 excessive erosion along river banks and downcutting of the river bed can damage roads sewers bridges buildings and other infrastructure aside from the effects on biological communities excessive sedimentation can significantly reduce reservoir capacity and affect the water quality of rivers and impoundments usace 1995 yang 2006 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017a b another economic impact of watershed sediment delivery includes the physical loss of top soil due to erosion which can adversely affect soil fertility and lead to an increase in fertilizer use and increased agricultural expense potentially degrading the water quality of nearby streams and rivers montgomery 2012 ritter 2015 trimble and lund 1982 the usace detroit district maintains 94 harbors and navigation channels within the great lakes watershed usace 2017a of the 60 michigan rivers included in this research 30 of these rivers discharge to usace detroit district maintained harbors or navigation channels see fig 1 excessive sedimentation at the river outlet to usace navigation channels and harbors can limit shipping e g light loading of freighters and is an ongoing issue requiring periodic condition assessment and maintenance dredging to maintain the cut depths of these harbors and navigation channels navigational servitude from 1986 to 2013 usace great lakes navigational dredging averaged approximately 2 4 million meters3 of sediment each year however sediment is accumulating in the navigational channels and harbors faster than the sediment is removed resulting in a growing dredging backlog usace 2014 the estimated fiscal year 2018 navigational dredging costs in the great lakes approach 38 000 000 usace 2017b 2 methods to evaluate sediment delivery to the great lakes 60 michigan watersheds were included in this research and range in size from the falls river with a contributing watershed area covering 117 kilometers2 to the saginaw river watershed covering 15 882 kilometers2 see table 1 and fig 1 together the area of these 60 watersheds covers 128 043 kilometers2 of which 119 622 kilometers2 are located within in the state of michigan and 8 421 kilometers2 extend into adjoining states watershed sediment delivery equations have often been developed for application at a much larger watershed scales than those represented by these 60 michigan watersheds syvitski 2002 syvitski and milliman 2007 cohen et al 2011 and cohen et al 2014 for example the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart equation was developed from a database of 488 global rivers whose watersheds cover 63 of the earth s surface the global bqart equation was validated for rivers that have mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s cohn et al 2011 syvitski 2019 as shown in table 1 the average annual flow rate of the michigan rivers included in this research is 22 meters3 sec and range in size from 1 0 meter3 sec days river to 132 5 meters3 sec st joseph river presented in table 1 are the watershed characteristics for these 60 michigan rivers including receiving water annual mean river flow rate 1 5 year and 10 year recurrence interval flow rates watershed area maximum watershed elevation and watershed land use calibrated hydrologic and watershed sediment delivery models were developed by the usace under the great lakes tributary model gltm program that was established through section 516 e of the water resources development act of 1996 these comprehensive usace 516 e studies were completed on six of the 60 michigan watersheds included in this research a key enabler of this research is the extensive data set that was provided by the michigan department of environment great lakes and energy egle formerly the michigan department of environmental quality hydrologic studies and dam safety unit with respect to mean annual river flow and 1 5 year and 10 year recurrence interval flows for all 60 watersheds at the point where the river discharges into either a great lake or great lake connecting channel see table 1 in addition the egle provided contributing watershed area for 45 of the 60 watersheds if a contributing watershed area was not available the total watershed area is shown in table 1 the project team utilized detailed geographic information system gis data provided by the state of michigan including 8 digit and 12 digit watershed boundaries digital terrain models and land use maps needed to estimate the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart variables with respect to geologic and human influence factor b relief r and mean basin temperature t land use data was obtained from the 1992 and 2001 version of the national land cover database nlcd 2010 with respect to watersheds that extend outside of the state of michigan gis data from the u s department of agriculture geospatial data gateway usda 2019 and the u s geological survey usgs 2019 national map viewer were used 2 1 usace watershed models to estimate sediment delivery of the 60 michigan rivers included in this research calibrated hydrologic watershed models and estimates of watershed sediment delivery were developed by the usace for six watersheds these watershed sediment delivery estimates were prepared in conjunction with the great lakes tributary modeling program 516 e usace 2008 and include saginaw river watershed usace 1999 2000a clinton river watershed usace 2005 st joseph river watershed usace 2007a grand river watershed usace 2007b sebewaing river watershed usace 2007c ontonagon river watershed usace 2010 watershed models were used by the usace to simulate short term individual storm events and long term historical changes in a watershed by estimating upland soil and stream erosion hydrologic conditions and transport and deposition of sediment these models are comprehensive and data intensive tools some of which can also be used simulate chemical mixing in water these models are also called nonpoint source pollution models because they simulate surface water pollutants including sediment nutrients pesticides and other chemicals originating from nonpoint or diffused sources borah et al 2008 usace 2008 watershed models have been used by the usace and others to predict sediment delivery are complex and require extensive data regarding the hydrologic conditions of the watershed as well as detailed data regarding soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition processes as with all models the reliability and accuracy of the input data directly affect the reliability and accuracy of the watershed sediment delivery output estimated using models for this reason model calibration of the hydrologic conditions was completed by the usace for each of these watersheds usace 2008 riedel et al 2010 2 2 estimates of watershed sediment delivery using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line usace 2010 creech et al 2010 is based on sediment delivery estimates from 61 watersheds located throughout the great lakes basin these include 13 usace 516 e models and 48 great lakes reservoirs from the subcommittee on sedimentation reservoir sedimentation ressed database usgs 2014 using these data the usace 2010 developed an area based watershed sediment delivery regression equation for the great lakes watershed see fig 2 where 1 q s 177 6 a 0 77 where qs watershed sediment delivery metric tonnes year a watershed area kilometers2 the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line is an empirical equation and as such is most applicable to estimating watershed sediment delivery within the great lakes basin watershed sediment delivery predicted using eq 1 for the 60 michigan rivers included in this research is presented in table 2 note that eq 1 is presented as a function of watershed area kilometers2 and watershed sediment delivery metric tonnes year the great lakes regional trend line usace 2010 was originally published with watershed area presented in miles2 and watershed sediment delivery in tons year with respect to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the high correlation between watershed area and watershed sediment delivery r2 0 78 appears to be reflected in the high correlation r2 0 95 between watershed area and mean annual river flow for the 60 watersheds included in this research see fig 3 2 3 estimates of watershed sediment delivery using the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart equation given the extensive data and computational requirements of calibrated hydrodynamic and watershed sediment delivery models usace 2010 riedel et al 2010 a number of empirical models have been developed based on observations of watershed sediment delivery and watershed characteristics schumm and hadley 1961a b wilson 1973 milliman 1980 milliman and meade 1983 milliman and syvitski 1992 mulder and syvitski 1996 milliman and syvitski 1992 demonstrated a strong correlation r2 ranging from 0 70 to 0 82 between watershed sediment delivery qs millions of metric tonnes of sediment year mt yr and basin area a kilometers2 using a global database of 275 rivers mulder and syvitski 1996 observed that when watersheds with significant human impacts were removed the correlation coefficient improved further mulder and syvitski 1996 noted the importance of surficial geology on watershed sediment delivery where watersheds comprised of softer sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated soils demonstrated much larger sediment delivery than those underlain by metamorphic and igneous rocks the importance of surficial geology on watershed sediment delivery at the river outlet has been studied by many authors striffler 1963 bent 1970 bent 1971 thomas and beson 1975 usgs 1984 pinet and souriau 1988 probst and suchet 1992 hicks et al 1996 ludwig and probst 1998 inman and jenkins 1999 kapsimalis et al 2005 one of milliman and syvitski s 1992 contributions was evaluating rivers regardless of size based on relief classes syvitski and milliman 2007 relief r represents the maximum watershed elevation minus the elevation of the receiving water mulder and syvitski s 1996 multi regression analysis established a relationship between watershed sediment delivery watershed area and maximum watershed relief syvitski and milliman 2007 developed the bqart equation using a database of 488 global rivers whose watersheds encompass 63 of the earth s land surface the bqart equation estimates annual suspended sediment load that will discharge to a receiving water body at mean annual river flow syvitski and milliman 2007 developed two equations one equation for watersheds where the annual mean basin temperature is greater than 2 centigrade c and a second equation for watersheds with an annual mean basin temperature 2 c the 60 rivers evaluated in this research have mean basin temperatures 2 c see table 2 the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart equation for watersheds with annual mean basin temperatures greater than 2 c follows 2 q s wb q 0 31 a 0 5 rt where qs watershed

michigan energy great lakes and environment egle hydrologic studies and dam safety unit for all 60 michigan watersheds contributing watershed areas were also provided by egle for 45 of the 60 watersheds included in this research see table 1 if a contributing watershed area was not available then the total watershed area was used to calculate the bqart watershed sediment delivery estimate mean basin temperature t was calculated using the average annual temperature of the closest city to the river outlet using data provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration us climate data 2019 the maximum watershed elevations are shown in table 1 with respect to relief r the receiving water elevations for the great lakes represent the long term average elevation from 1918 to 2018 usace 2019 the following receiving water elevations were utilized lake superior 183 41 m lake huron and lake michigan 176 43 m lake st clair 175 02 m and lake erie 174 15 m with respect to rivers that discharge to great lakes connecting channels such as the st clair river pine river belle river and black river east and the detroit river rouge river the receiving water elevation at the river outlet was calculated using the water surface slope of the connecting channel between the adjacent great lakes the variable b of the bqart equation accounts for characteristics of the watershed and human influence characteristics of the watershed include the glacial erosion factor i an average basin wide lithology factor l and the sediment trapping efficiency te of lakes and man made reservoirs syvitski and milliman 2007 the human influenced soil erosion factor eh addresses anthropogenic factors that affect sediment delivery to rivers draining watersheds such as agricultural practices urbanization and deforestation among others syvitski and milliman 2007 the variable b is calculated as follows syvitski and milliman 2007 3 b il 1 t e e h where l basin wide lithology factor see fig 5 of syvitski and milliman 2007 te sediment trapping efficiency of dams and lakes within the watershed eh human influence soil erosion factor see fig 7 of syvitski and milliman 2007 i glacial erosion factor where i 1 0 0 9 a g ag area of the drainage watershed as a percentage of the total drainage area of the watershed the basin wide lithology factor l addresses surficial geology and the impact on watershed sediment delivery watersheds composed of soft rock and unconsolidated sediments deliver more sediment to rivers then watersheds underlain by igneous and metamorphic rocks syvitski and milliman 2007 utilized six basin wide lithology classes ranging from basins composed of hard igneous or high grade metamorphic rocks l 0 5 to basins underlain by exceptionally erodible materials such as loess l 3 a basin wide lithology factor l 2 is reserved for basins draining a significant proportion of sedimentary rocks unconsolidated sedimentary cover and alluvial deposits syvitski and milliman 2007 the 60 watersheds addressed in this research are underlain by unconsolidated glacial deposits including glacial outwash plains glacial till ice contact and lacustrine deposits for this reason a basin wide lithology factor l 2 was utilized for this research natural lakes and manmade reservoirs trap sediment before the sediment can reach the river outlet the effect of an individual dam on watershed sediment yield is a function of the amount of water entering the lake or reservoir the hydraulic capacity of the lake or reservoir and the resulting hydraulic retention time the geometry of the surface water body and the size of the suspended sediment and bedload among other factors usace 1995 morris et al 2008 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017a with respect to michigan the 60 watersheds included in this research contain 2 439 dams most are either small mill ponds or water control structures with respect to the 60 watersheds included in this research there are 1 007 large dams that are listed in the national inventory dams nid usace 2018 nid dams either exceed 7 62 m in height and exceed 18 502 meters3 in storage or equal or exceed 61 674 meters3 storage and exceed 1 83 m in height or present a hazard to human health loss of human life is likely if the dam fails in the great lakes region the small dams are often located at the edges of the watershed where relief is greatest near glacial moraines and outwash deposits in contrast to the large dams that are typically located in series along the main stems of the larger rivers vorosmarty et al 2003 developed equations to predict basin wide sediment trapping efficiency however the effect of multiple manmade reservoirs and natural lakes on watershed sediment delivery is difficult to predict due to the inherent challenge of calculating a basin specific trapping efficiency te the average 1 te value in syvitski and milliman s 2007 global database of 488 rivers 0 8 was used for this research the human influenced soil erosion factor eh addresses anthropogenic factors such as urbanization deforestation agricultural practices and mining activities which can increase watershed sediment delivery to a river outlet syvitski and milliman 2007 according to syvitski and milliman 2007 an eh of 0 3 is used for high density populations of greater than 200 people kilometer2 and a per capita income of 15 000 year an eh of 1 is used for basins with a low human footprint population 50 kilometer2 an eh of 2 0 was used for watersheds with population density pd 200 kilometer2 but per capita income is low 1 000 year with respect to michigan all 83 counties have a per capita income greater than 15 000 year based on the 2010 united states census data for our research population densities were calculated for each of the 60 watersheds and the human influenced soil erosion factor was varied by population density using the syvitski and milliman 2007 values described previously as shown in table 2 the human influence soil erosion factor eh was set to 1 for all watersheds with exception of watersheds with high population densities 200 kilometer2 where eh was set to 0 3 including the macatawa river pd 256 kilometer2 the rouge river pd 1087 kilometer2 the clinton river pd 696 kilometer2 and the huron river pd 260 kilometer2 with respect to the bqart equation the glacial erosion factor i ranges from 1 0 ice cover to 10 100 ice cover since there are no glaciers in michigan the glacial erosion factor was set to i 1 representing 0 ice cover syvitski and milliman 2007 syvitski and milliman 2007 found that watershed sediment delivery to the world s oceans was most affected by geological parameters 65 watershed area maximum relief surficial geology and ice cover climatic factors 14 precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic factors 16 reservoir sedimentation and population density the bqart variables and watershed sediment delivery estimates calculated in the presented study for 60 michigan rivers are presented in table 2 3 results and discussion as detailed in table 1 the 60 watersheds included in this research are dominated by forest land wetlands and agriculture forest land ranges from 3 6 of the 269 kilometer2 sebewaing river watershed to 82 l of the 117 kilometer2 falls river watershed approximately half of the 60 michigan watersheds evaluated in this research contain over 40 forest land and the average watershed contains 38 1 forest land in addition agricultural lands and wetlands dominate these 60 michigan watersheds the average and maximum percentage of watershed area that contains agricultural land use are 21 5 and 88 5 sebewaing river watershed respectively the average and maximum percentage of watershed area that contain wetlands are 21 9 and 56 0 tahquamenon river watershed respectively michigan s wetlands are typically located adjacent to the rivers and streams that drain the watershed during 1 5 year and 2 0 year recurrence interval flow events these wetlands accumulate sediment a sediment sink when a river exceeds bankfull thirty four of the 60 michigan watersheds included in this research contain greater than 15 wetlands given michigan s industrial and commercial heritage related to the auto industry not surprisingly urban land use identified as developed in table 1 constitutes an important percentage of watersheds located in michigan s largest cities the watershed with highest percentage of urban development is the rouge river watershed within the city of detroit 84 1 other examples of watersheds that contain an elevated percentage of urban land use include the macatawa river watershed 34 1 near the city of holland michigan the clinton river watershed 55 6 north of the city of detroit the huron river watershed 32 8 west and south of the city of detroit and the saginaw river watershed 12 7 encompassing the cities of flint saginaw and bay city of the 60 rivers evaluated the average percentage of developed land within the watershed is 9 7 the ratio of mean annual river flow to the corresponding 1 5 year and 10 year recurrence interval flows see table 1 is a characteristic feature that distinguishes the percentage of developed land the value of this ratio increases as the percentage of developed land increases the magnitude of mean annual river flow as well as the 1 5 year and 2 0 year recurrence interval flows is one of the most critical inputs to estimating watershed sediment delivery the relationship between mean annual river flow and the watershed area for the 60 michigan rivers included in this research is shown in fig 3 and presented in equation 4 4 mean annual river flow q 0 00 95 a r 2 0 95 where q mean annual river flow meters3 sec a watershed area kilometers2 the noted r2 value of 0 95 signifies the strong correlation between mean annual river flow and watershed area there are two likely reasons why the correlation between watershed area and mean annual flow is so strong first michigan s extensive glacial heritage has resulted in relatively small differences in topography at the watershed scale in comparison to the elevation of the receiving water the corresponding great lake or great lakes connecting channel these multiple glacial events have resulted in the low gradient rivers that are common in michigan and throughout the great lakes basin second although the percentage of developed urbanized land greatly affects mean flow and flood flows within michigan s urban watersheds the average percentage of developed land in the 60 michigan watersheds that are presented in this paper is relatively small 9 71 with watershed land use dominated by forest land wetlands and agriculture with respect to watershed sediment delivery basin area has been referred to as the great integrator syvitski and kettner 2008 michigan s surficial geology reflects its glacial heritage these multiple glacial advances resulted in watersheds underlain by a complex sequence of glacial moraines ice contact deposits glacial outwash plains and glacial lake bed deposits flint 1971 farrand 1982 the complex surficial geology of michigan and resulting low gradient streams as well as the low percentage of developed land likely explains why there is a strong correlation between the mean annual river flow and watershed area syvitski and milliman 2007 also found a strong correlation between mean annual river flow and watershed area with respect to 488 rivers in their global database the bqart terms with the highest correlations to mean annual river flow q were watershed area a 0 75 and relief r 0 25 a recent study prepared for michigan s egle stantec 2014 found a similar relationship between watershed area and mean annual river flow for 28 southern michigan watersheds ranging in size from 24 8 kilometers2 to 1 412 kilometers2 with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 84 to 0 94 comparison of watershed sediment delivery estimates using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line and the syvitski and milliman s 2007 global bqart equation are presented in table 2 of the 60 rivers evaluated the global bqart equation predicts on average 19 less sediment delivery to the river outlet in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line see table 2 in fig 4 watershed sediment delivery estimates using the global bqart equation are compared graphically to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line both a regression line and a 1 1 line is shown in fig 4 the equation of the regression line is 5 y 1 19 0 9x 8855 8 r 2 0 87 where y watershed sediment delivery global bqart equation metric tonnes year x watershed sediment delivery usace great lakes regional trend line metric tonnes year the slope of the regression equation of 1 1909 is reflected in the average difference 19 between the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line shown in table 2 and is also apparent in comparison to the 1 1 line that is shown in fig 4 the noted r2 value of 0 87 of the regression line demonstrates the strong correlation between these two methods of estimating watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet overall the global bqart sediment delivery estimates are within 25 of the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line for 21 out of the 60 michigan rivers 35 of these 21 rivers 15 of these rivers have mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s which is the validated minimum water discharge that was used to establish the bqart equation cohn et al 2011 syvitski jpm 2019 as shown in table 1 and figure 4 48 of the 60 rivers have mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s with respect to the michigan rivers with mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s 31 of the rivers have bqart sediment delivery estimates that are within 25 of the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line of these 48 rivers the bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 31 smaller than the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the global bqart equation provides lower estimates of the watershed sediment delivery in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line for rivers with mean annual flow rates of less than 30 m3 s of the 12 michigan rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s 50 of the rivers have bqart sediment delivery estimates that are within 25 of the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line further these 12 rivers have global bqart sediment delivery estimates that were on average 32 larger than the corresponding usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate of these 12 rivers two stand out the bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates for the manistee river and muskegon river were 109 and 107 larger than the corresponding usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate see table 2 the percent differences between the bqart model estimate and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate of greater than 30 were noted in three other rivers with mean annual river flows 30 m3 s including the portage river 33 ontonagon river 44 and menominee river 32 with respect to the manistee river muskegon river portage river ontonagon river and menominee river the relief term r is greater than 0 34 km for all five rivers the relief term r for the remaining seven rivers averages 0 23 km reflecting the low gradient streams common in michigan see table 2 the differences in watershed sediment delivery between these two methods appears to be due at least in part to the value used for the relief term r of the global bqart equation insight into the importance of the relief term r of the bqart equation was gained by evaluating watersheds that are divided into major sub basins of the 60 watersheds included in this research eight watersheds are divided into major sub basins typically defined by glacial moraines egle 2019 these rivers and watershed reference number include the au gres river 1 the au sable river 2 the pine river 10 the grand river 14 the saginaw river 32 the st joseph river 34 the menominee river 50 and the portage river 55 for these eight rivers the relief term r was calculated from the area weighted maximum elevation of the individual sub basins for example with respect to the saginaw river the maximum elevation of the watershed 470 m occurs in the tittabawassee sub basin which accounts for 23 of the total watershed area the sub basin area weighted maximum elevation for the saginaw river watershed is 374 m see table 1 the effect of using the sub basin area weighted maximum watershed elevation in conjunction with the global bqart estimate of watershed sediment delivery is shown in table 3 the effect of the relief term r is evident the use of the maximum watershed relief term r in comparison to the sub basin area weighted maximum watershed relief results in an average watershed sediment delivery increase of 17 with respect to the saginaw river the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates using the area weighted relief and maximum relief are 290 000 tonnes year and 420 000 tonnes year respectively the use of the area weighted relief term r in conjunction with the global bqart model estimate of watershed sediment delivery closely matches the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate of 300 000 tonnes year for the saginaw river with respect to other rivers with mean annual flows 30 m3 s see table 3 the use of the sub basin area weighted relief term r in conjunction with the bqart equation provided closer estimates of watershed sediment delivery in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line these include the portage river the au sable river the menominee river the st joseph river and the grand river to gain further understanding of the sensitivity of the terms of the bqart equation in relation to watershed sediment delivery the bqart values for each of the 60 watersheds presented in table 2 were compared against watershed sediment delivery estimates prepared using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the results of the regression analysis and correlation matrix are shown in table 4 table 4 reveals that the bqart terms most affecting watershed sediment delivery are watershed area a mean annual river flow q and relief r in addition to comparison of the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line both methods were compared to calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment transport models that were completed by the usace see table 5 the usace 516 e studies were completed on six of the 60 rivers included in this research the saginaw river watershed usace 1999 2000a the clinton river watershed usace 2005 the st joseph river watershed usace 2007a the grand river watershed usace 2007b the sebewaing river watershed usace 2007c and the ontonagon river watershed usace 2010 the saginaw river is the largest watershed in michigan 15 882 kilometers2 and due to the river s high watershed sediment delivery to saginaw bay lake huron is arguably the most studied with respect to the saginaw river watershed the mean annual flow rate is 124 9 m3 s the watershed sediment delivery predicted using the global bqart equation is estimated to be 290 000 tonnes year to saginaw bay lake huron the global bqart estimate is very similar to the watershed sediment delivery estimate of 250 000 tonnes year that was prepared in conjunction with the usace s 1999 2000a 516 e program the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line predicts a watershed sediment delivery of 300 000 tonnes year which is nearly identical to the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimate of 290 000 tonnes year the most recent usace 516 e study was completed on the ontonagon river usace 2010 the ontonagon river covers 3585 kilometers2 and has an mean annual flow rate of 39 4 m3 s using calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models the usace estimated watershed sediment delivery of 175 000 tonnes year to lake superior the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line and the global bqart equation predict watershed sediment delivery of 97 000 and 140 000 tonnes year respectively u s geological survey sediment gages with long term records are rare in michigan however a usgs gage with over 20 years of measurements is located on the ontonagon river using the usgs sediment gage data the usace 2010 estimated that the average annual watershed sediment delivery to lake superior is approximately 140 000 tonnes year in this case the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimate was similar to the usace 516 e study and the watershed sediment delivery estimate completed by the usace 2010 using the usgs ontonagon river sediment gage and less similar to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line four other usace 516 e studies were completed by the usace two on rivers that have mean annual flow rates of less than 30 m3 s sebewaing river and the clinton river and two on rivers with mean annual flow rates greater than 30 m3 s st joseph river and the grand river the sebewaing river and clinton river discharge to lake huron and lake st clair and have mean annual flow rates of 1 6 m3 s and 17 6 m3 s respectively with respect to the sebewaing river the watershed delivery estimates are 5 200 tonnes year usace 516 e study 13 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 3 200 tonnes year global bqart equation with respect to the clinton river the watershed sediment delivery estimates are 73 000 tonnes year usace 516 e study 27 000 tonnes year usgs sediment gage 63 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 18 000 tonnes year global bqart equation in the case of the rivers with mean annual river flows smaller than 30 m3 s the variability of the watershed sediment delivery estimates is high and the bqart watershed sediment delivery equation typically predicts less sediment delivery than the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line see fig 4 the st joseph river and the grand river discharge to lake michigan and are two of the largest rivers included in this research with mean annual flow rates of 132 5 m3 s and 127 1 m3 s with respect to the grand river the three watershed sediment delivery estimates were very similar with 250 000 tonnes year usace 516 e study 280 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 260 000 tonnes year global bqart equation with respect to the st joseph river the watershed sediment delivery estimates are 76 000 tonnes year usace 516 e study 250 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 290 000 tonnes year global bqart equation with respect to the st joseph river the variability of the watershed sediment delivery estimates may be due the large number of dams located on this river as discussed in the usace 2007b 516 e study 190 dams are located within the st joseph river watershed of which 95 are considered large dams usace 2007b estimates that only 13 of the watershed can drain directly to the river outlet and that up to 80 of the suspended sediment is trapped by the large network of dams located within this watershed given the differences in the data sets used to develop the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the bqart equation can provide remarkably close estimates of watershed sediment delivery especially for rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s the watershed sediment delivery estimates calculated using the global bqart equation are comparable to the usace great lakes regional trend line for many michigan watersheds and implies that the global and great lakes regional processes of soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition are similar with respect to rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s the bqart equation appears to overestimate watershed sediment delivery in comparison the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line these higher estimates of watershed sediment delivery may be due in part to the value used for the relief r term of the bqart equation examples include the muskegon river and manistee river and to a lesser extent portage river ontonagon river and menominee river for the st joseph river the importance of the sediment trapping efficiency of dams and natural lakes located within the watershed is evident based on the usace 516 e estimate of watershed sediment delivery in comparison to the global bqart equation and the usace 2020 great lakes regional trend line the impact of natural lakes and dams on watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet is an area of ongoing research 4 conclusions the purpose of this research was to compare watershed sediment delivery estimates using three methods the great lakes regional trend line that was developed by the usace 2010 the global bqart sediment delivery equation that was developed syvitski and milliman 2007 and watershed sediment delivery estimates that were prepared using calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models in conjunction with the usace s 516 e program for six of the 60 michigan watersheds the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line is an empirical equation and as such is most applicable to estimating watershed sediment delivery within the great lakes basin the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line was developed based on sediment delivery estimates from 48 reservoirs and 13 watersheds located throughout the great lakes basin and predicts watershed sediment delivery as a function of area the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart equation was developed from a database encompassing 488 global rivers whose watersheds cover 63 of the earth s surface the bqart equation estimates watershed sediment delivery as a function five variables including a geologic and human influence factor b the mean annual flow of the river q watershed area a the difference between the maximum elevation of the watershed and the elevation of the receiving water relief r and mean basin temperature t the present research showed that overall the global bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 19 lower than the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line with respect to the usace 516 e studies comparison of the three methods showed high variability for the sebewaing river and clinton river given than both rivers have mean annual river flows below 30 m3 s the variability of the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates were expected of the remaining four rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s the usace 516 e watershed sediment delivery estimates were very similar to the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line with respect to the grand river and saginaw and less similar for the ontonagon river and the st joseph river with respect to the st joseph river the low usace 516 e estimate for watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet is most likely due to the presence of a large number of dams within this watershed the global bqart equation provided surprisingly close estimates of watershed sediment delivery for 21 of the 60 michigan rivers evaluated in this research in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line especially for rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s it is noteworthy that the watershed sediment delivery values calculated using the global bqart equation are so similar to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line for a number of michigan watersheds and implies that the global and great lakes regional processes of soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition are similar comparison of the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line indicate that the most important variables affecting watershed sediment delivery are watershed area a mean annual river flow q and relief r this research was conducted to support the development of a new set of watershed sediment delivery equations applicable to the smaller low gradient streams located in michigan and throughout the great lakes basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments dr james syvitski university of colorado was especially helpful in providing data and answering questions regarding estimation of watershed sediment delivery using the bqart equation in addition we acknowledge the extensive support provided by susan greiner pe egle and dr marlio lesmez pe egle of hydrologic studies and dam safety unit who completed mean river flow and exceedance flow calculations for all 60 watersheds and contributing watershed areas for 45 of the 60 watersheds 
5817,the purpose of this research was to compare annual watershed sediment delivery estimates for 60 michigan rivers using two fundamentally different approaches the great lakes regional trend line that was developed by the u s army corps of engineers usace and the global bqart watershed sediment delivery equation that was developed by syvitski and milliman 2007 in addition for six of the 60 watersheds the global bqart equation and the usace great lakes regional trend line were compared to watershed sediment delivery estimates that were prepared by the usace using complex calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models the usace great lakes regional trend line is an empirical equation that was developed based on sediment delivery estimates from 48 reservoirs and 13 watersheds located throughout the great lakes basin and predicts watershed sediment delivery based on watershed area r2 0 78 the syvitski and milliman bqart equation was developed from a database encompassing 488 global rivers whose watersheds cover 63 of the earth s surface the bqart equation estimates watershed sediment delivery as dependent on five variables including a geologic and human influence factor b the mean annual flow of the river q watershed area a the difference between the maximum elevation of the watershed and the elevation of the receiving water relief r and mean basin temperature t the global bqart sediment delivery equation was validated for rivers with mean annual flows exceeding 30 m3 s the watersheds for the 60 michigan rivers evaluated in the present research cover 128 043 kilometers2 and the mean annual river flows range from 1 0 m3 s days river to 132 5 m3 s st joseph river and average 22 m3 sec overall the watershed sediment delivery estimates for these 60 rivers using the global bqart equation were 19 lower than those based on the usace great lakes regional trend line and were within 25 of the usace regional trend line for 21 of the 60 rivers evaluated with respect to the 12 michigan rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 sec the global bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 32 higher than the usace great lakes regional trend line of the remaining 48 rivers with mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s the global bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 31 lower than the usace great lakes regional trend line the global bqart equation provided close estimates of watershed sediment delivery for 21 of the 60 michigan rivers evaluated in this research in comparison to the usace great lakes regional trend line especially for rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s this implies that the global and great lakes regional processes of soil erosion and deposition and sediment transport to the river outlet are similar especially for the large michigan watersheds regression analysis comparing the terms of the global bqart equation to the 60 watershed sediment delivery estimates developed using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line revealed that the most important variables affecting watershed sediment delivery are watershed area a mean annual river flow q and relief r keywords watershed sediment delivery bqart equation usace great lakes regional trend line great lakes basin michigan watersheds 1 introduction watershed sediment delivery is the total amount of sediment generated within a watershed and delivered to the river outlet over a particular timeframe estimation of watershed sediment delivery involves an understanding of the complex processes of soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition borah et al 2008 creech et al 2010 garcia 2008 gray and simoes 2008 macarthur et al 2008 milliman and farnsworth 2011 sommerlot et al 2013 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017a b usace 1995 2008 the present research was conducted to compare annual watershed sediment delivery estimates using two fundamentally different approaches the 2010 great

great lakes regional trend line is based on 61 watershed sediment delivery estimates that are located within great lakes basin and served as the basis of comparison with respect to the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates in addition for six of these 60 watersheds the global bqart equation and the usace great lakes regional trend line were compared to watershed sediment delivery estimates that were prepared by the usace using complex calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models with respect to the usace s calibrated watershed sediment delivery models the author s hypothesized that these process based models would be more reliable than either the usace great lakes regional trend line or the global bqart sediment delivery equation by comparing the watershed sediment delivery estimates using the global bqart equation and usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the authors gained insights regarding the river and basin characteristics that primarily affect watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet soil erosion at the watershed scale involves transport of sediment entrained in overland surface water flow to the river system as well as erosion of the bed and banks of the river formation of gullies river bank failure and mass wasting as water and sediment move from a higher elevation to a lower elevation energy is released and a river dissipates this energy by performing work on the channel erosion and deposition and by movement of sediment entrained in water bagnold 1977 morisawa 1968 brooks et al 2013 unesco 2013 the transport of sediment by water forms the bed and banks of the river and changes the slope of the river through aggradation raising of the river bed and degradation deepening of the river bed sediment depositional areas e g sinks within the watershed include sediment deposited onto floodplains and in the bed and banks of the river as well as sediment deposited in natural lakes and manmade reservoirs that trap sediment before it reaches the river outlet biedenharn et al 2008 cohen et al 2014 fisrwg 1998 foster et al 1981 gray and simoes 2008 usace 2008 estimation of watershed sediment delivery integrates the effects of river flow topography surficial geology and land use excessive sedimentation has significant economic impacts and is a leading stressor of biological communities that inhabit these waterways charlton 2008 macarthur et al 2008 smith et al 2015 the effects of excessive sedimentation include habitat degradation and corresponding changes to the biological communities and spawning habitats yang 2006 mdeq 2008 with respect to economic impact damage to infrastructure due to excessive erosion and sedimentation is well documented asce 2008 usace 1995 usace 2015 excessive erosion along river banks and downcutting of the river bed can damage roads sewers bridges buildings and other infrastructure aside from the effects on biological communities excessive sedimentation can significantly reduce reservoir capacity and affect the water quality of rivers and impoundments usace 1995 yang 2006 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017a b another economic impact of watershed sediment delivery includes the physical loss of top soil due to erosion which can adversely affect soil fertility and lead to an increase in fertilizer use and increased agricultural expense potentially degrading the water quality of nearby streams and rivers montgomery 2012 ritter 2015 trimble and lund 1982 the usace detroit district maintains 94 harbors and navigation channels within the great lakes watershed usace 2017a of the 60 michigan rivers included in this research 30 of these rivers discharge to usace detroit district maintained harbors or navigation channels see fig 1 excessive sedimentation at the river outlet to usace navigation channels and harbors can limit shipping e g light loading of freighters and is an ongoing issue requiring periodic condition assessment and maintenance dredging to maintain the cut depths of these harbors and navigation channels navigational servitude from 1986 to 2013 usace great lakes navigational dredging averaged approximately 2 4 million meters3 of sediment each year however sediment is accumulating in the navigational channels and harbors faster than the sediment is removed resulting in a growing dredging backlog usace 2014

included in this research and range in size from the falls river with a contributing watershed area covering 117 kilometers2 to the saginaw river watershed covering 15 882 kilometers2 see table 1 and fig 1 together the area of these 60 watersheds covers 128 043 kilometers2 of which 119 622 kilometers2 are located within in the state of michigan and 8 421 kilometers2 extend into adjoining states watershed sediment delivery equations have often been developed for application at a much larger watershed scales than those represented by these 60 michigan watersheds syvitski 2002 syvitski and milliman 2007 cohen et al 2011 and cohen et al 2014 for example the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart equation was developed from a database of 488 global rivers whose watersheds cover 63 of the earth s surface the global bqart equation was validated for rivers that have mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s cohn et al 2011 syvitski 2019 as shown in table 1 the average annual flow rate of the michigan rivers included in this research is 22 meters3 sec and range in size from 1 0 meter3 sec days river to 132 5 meters3 sec st joseph river presented in table 1 are the watershed characteristics for these 60 michigan rivers including receiving water annual mean river flow rate 1 5 year and 10 year recurrence interval flow rates watershed area maximum watershed elevation and watershed land use calibrated hydrologic and watershed sediment delivery models were developed by the usace under the great lakes tributary model gltm program that was established through section 516 e of the water resources development act of 1996 these comprehensive usace 516 e studies were completed on six of the 60 michigan watersheds included in this research a key enabler of this research is the extensive data set that was provided by the michigan department of environment great lakes and energy egle formerly the michigan department of environmental quality hydrologic studies and dam safety unit with respect to mean annual river flow and 1 5 year and 10 year recurrence interval flows for all 60 watersheds at the point where the river discharges into either a great lake or great lake connecting channel see table 1 in addition the egle provided contributing watershed area for 45 of the 60 watersheds if a contributing watershed area was not available the total watershed area is shown in table 1 the project team utilized detailed geographic information system gis data provided by the state of michigan including 8 digit and 12 digit watershed boundaries digital terrain models and land use maps needed to estimate the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart variables with respect to geologic and human influence factor b relief r and mean basin temperature t land use data was obtained from the 1992 and 2001 version of the national land cover database nlcd 2010 with respect to watersheds that extend outside of the state of michigan gis data from the u s department of agriculture geospatial data gateway usda 2019 and the u s geological survey usgs 2019 national map viewer were used 2 1 usace watershed models to estimate sediment delivery of the 60 michigan rivers included in this research calibrated hydrologic watershed models and estimates of watershed sediment delivery were developed by the usace for six watersheds these watershed sediment delivery estimates were prepared in conjunction with the great lakes tributary modeling program 516 e usace 2008 and include saginaw river watershed usace 1999 2000a clinton river watershed usace 2005 st joseph river watershed usace 2007a grand river watershed usace 2007b sebewaing river watershed usace 2007c ontonagon river watershed usace 2010 watershed models were used by the usace to simulate short term individual storm events and long term historical changes in a watershed by estimating upland soil and stream erosion hydrologic conditions and transport and deposition of sediment these models are comprehensive and data intensive tools some of which can also be used simulate chemical mixing in water these models are also called nonpoint source pollution models because they simulate surface water pollutants including sediment nutrients pesticides and other chemicals originating from nonpoint or diffused sources borah et al 2008 usace 2008 watershed models have been used by the usace and others to predict sediment delivery are complex and require extensive data regarding the hydrologic conditions of the watershed as well as detailed data regarding soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition processes as with all models the reliability and accuracy of the input data directly affect the reliability and accuracy of the watershed sediment delivery output estimated using models for this reason model calibration of the hydrologic conditions was completed by the usace for each of these watersheds usace 2008 riedel et al 2010 2 2 estimates of watershed sediment delivery using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line usace 2010 creech et al 2010 is based on sediment delivery estimates from 61 watersheds located throughout the great lakes basin these include 13 usace 516 e models and 48 great lakes reservoirs from the subcommittee on sedimentation reservoir sedimentation ressed database usgs 2014 using these data the usace 2010 developed an area based watershed sediment delivery regression equation for the great lakes watershed see fig 2 where 1 q s 177 6 a 0 77 where qs watershed sediment delivery metric tonnes year a watershed area kilometers2 the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line is an empirical equation and as such is most applicable to estimating watershed sediment delivery within the great lakes basin watershed sediment delivery predicted using eq 1 for the 60 michigan rivers included in this research is presented in table 2 note that eq 1 is presented as a function of watershed area kilometers2 and watershed sediment delivery metric tonnes year the great lakes regional trend line usace 2010 was originally published with watershed area presented in miles2 and watershed sediment delivery in tons year with respect to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the high correlation between watershed area and watershed sediment delivery r2 0 78 appears to be reflected in the high correlation r2 0 95 between watershed area and mean annual river flow for the 60 watersheds included in this research see fig 3 2 3 estimates of watershed sediment delivery using the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart equation given the extensive data and computational requirements of calibrated hydrodynamic and watershed sediment delivery models usace 2010 riedel et al 2010 a number of empirical models have been developed based on observations of watershed sediment delivery and watershed characteristics schumm and hadley 1961a b wilson 1973 milliman 1980 milliman and meade 1983 milliman and syvitski 1992 mulder and syvitski 1996 milliman and syvitski 1992 demonstrated a strong correlation r2 ranging from 0 70 to 0 82 between watershed sediment delivery qs millions of metric tonnes of sediment year mt yr and basin area a kilometers2 using a global database of 275 rivers mulder and syvitski 1996 observed that when watersheds with significant human impacts were removed the correlation coefficient improved further mulder and syvitski 1996 noted the importance of surficial geology on watershed sediment delivery where watersheds comprised of softer sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated soils demonstrated much larger sediment delivery than those underlain by metamorphic and igneous rocks the importance of surficial geology on watershed sediment delivery at the river outlet has been studied by many authors striffler 1963 bent 1970 bent 1971 thomas and beson 1975 usgs 1984 pinet and souriau 1988 probst and suchet 1992 hicks et al 1996 ludwig and probst 1998 inman and jenkins 1999 kapsimalis et al 2005 one of milliman and syvitski s 1992 contributions was evaluating rivers regardless of size based on relief classes syvitski and milliman 2007 relief r represents the maximum watershed elevation minus the elevation of the receiving water mulder and syvitski s 1996 multi regression analysis established a relationship between watershed sediment delivery watershed area and maximum watershed relief syvitski and milliman 2007 developed the bqart equation using a database of 488 global rivers whose watersheds encompass 63 of the earth s land surface the bqart equation estimates annual suspended sediment load that will discharge to a receiving water body at mean annual river flow syvitski and milliman 2007 developed two equations one equation for watersheds where the annual mean basin temperature is greater than 2 centigrade c and a second equation for watersheds with an annual mean basin temperature 2 c the 60 rivers evaluated in this research have mean

watersheds included in this research see table 1 if a contributing watershed area was not available then the total watershed area was used to calculate the bqart watershed sediment delivery estimate mean basin temperature t was calculated using the average annual temperature of the closest city to the river outlet using data provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration us climate data 2019 the maximum watershed elevations are shown in table 1 with respect to relief r the receiving water elevations for the great lakes represent the long term average elevation from 1918 to 2018 usace 2019 the following receiving water elevations were utilized lake superior 183 41 m lake huron and lake michigan 176 43 m lake st clair 175 02 m and lake erie 174 15 m with respect to rivers that discharge to great lakes connecting channels such as the st clair river pine river belle river and black river east and the detroit river rouge river the receiving water elevation at the river outlet was calculated using the water surface slope of the connecting channel between the adjacent great lakes the variable b of the bqart equation accounts for characteristics of the watershed and human influence characteristics of the watershed include the glacial erosion factor i an average basin wide lithology factor l and the sediment trapping efficiency te of lakes and man made reservoirs syvitski and milliman 2007 the human influenced soil erosion factor eh addresses anthropogenic factors that affect sediment delivery to rivers draining watersheds such as agricultural practices urbanization and deforestation among others syvitski and milliman 2007 the variable b is calculated as follows syvitski and milliman 2007 3 b il 1 t e e h where l basin wide lithology factor

erosion factor where i 1 0 0 9 a g ag area of the drainage watershed as a percentage of the total drainage area of the watershed the basin wide lithology factor l addresses surficial geology and the impact on watershed sediment delivery watersheds composed of soft rock and unconsolidated sediments deliver more sediment to rivers then watersheds underlain by igneous and metamorphic rocks syvitski and milliman 2007 utilized six basin wide lithology classes ranging from basins composed of hard igneous or high grade metamorphic rocks l 0 5 to basins underlain by exceptionally erodible materials such as loess l 3 a basin wide lithology factor l 2 is reserved for basins draining a significant proportion of sedimentary rocks unconsolidated sedimentary cover and alluvial deposits syvitski and milliman 2007 the 60 watersheds addressed in this research are underlain by unconsolidated glacial deposits including glacial outwash plains glacial till ice contact and lacustrine deposits for this reason a basin wide lithology factor l 2 was utilized for this research natural lakes and manmade reservoirs trap sediment before the sediment can reach the river outlet the effect of an individual dam on watershed sediment yield is a function of the amount of water entering the lake or reservoir the hydraulic capacity of the lake or reservoir and the resulting hydraulic retention time the geometry of the surface water body and the size of the suspended sediment and bedload among other factors usace 1995 morris et al 2008 alighalehbabakhani et al 2017a with respect to michigan the 60 watersheds included in this research contain 2 439 dams most are either small mill ponds or water control structures with respect to the 60 watersheds included in this research there are 1 007 large dams that are listed in the national inventory dams nid usace 2018 nid dams either exceed 7 62 m in height and exceed 18 502 meters3 in storage or equal or exceed 61 674 meters3 storage and exceed 1 83 m in height or present a hazard to human health loss of human life is likely if the dam fails in the great lakes region the small dams are often located at the edges of the watershed where relief is greatest near glacial moraines and outwash deposits in contrast to the large dams that are typically located in series along the main stems of the larger rivers vorosmarty et al 2003 developed equations to predict basin wide sediment trapping efficiency however the effect of multiple manmade reservoirs and natural lakes on watershed sediment delivery is difficult to predict due to the inherent challenge of calculating a basin specific trapping efficiency te the average 1 te value in syvitski and milliman s 2007 global database of 488 rivers 0 8 was used for this research the human influenced soil erosion factor eh addresses anthropogenic factors such as urbanization deforestation agricultural practices and mining activities which can increase watershed sediment delivery to a river outlet syvitski and milliman 2007 according to syvitski and milliman 2007 an eh of 0 3 is used for high density populations of greater than 200 people kilometer2 and a per capita income of 15 000 year an eh of 1 is used for basins with a low human footprint population 50 kilometer2 an eh of 2 0 was used for watersheds with population density pd 200 kilometer2 but per capita income is low 1 000 year with respect to michigan all 83 counties have a per capita income greater than 15 000 year based on the 2010 united states census data for our research population densities were calculated for each of the 60 watersheds and the human influenced soil erosion factor was varied by population density using the syvitski and milliman 2007 values described previously as shown in table 2 the human influence soil erosion factor eh was set to 1 for all watersheds with exception of watersheds with high population densities 200 kilometer2 where eh was set to 0 3 including the macatawa river pd 256 kilometer2 the rouge river pd 1087 kilometer2 the clinton river pd 696 kilometer2 and the huron river pd 260 kilometer2 with respect to the bqart equation the glacial erosion factor i ranges from 1 0 ice cover to 10 100 ice cover since there are no glaciers in michigan the glacial erosion factor was set to i 1 representing 0 ice cover syvitski and milliman 2007 syvitski and milliman 2007 found that watershed sediment delivery to the world s oceans was most affected by geological parameters 65 watershed area maximum relief surficial geology and ice cover climatic factors 14 precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic factors 16 reservoir sedimentation and population density the bqart variables and watershed sediment delivery estimates calculated in the presented study for 60 michigan rivers are presented in table 2 3 results and discussion as detailed in table 1 the 60 watersheds included in this research are dominated by forest land wetlands and agriculture forest land ranges from 3 6 of the 269 kilometer2 sebewaing river watershed to 82 l of the 117 kilometer2 falls river watershed approximately half of the 60 michigan watersheds evaluated in this research contain over 40 forest land and the average watershed contains 38 1 forest land in addition agricultural lands and wetlands dominate these 60 michigan watersheds the average and maximum percentage of watershed area that contains agricultural land use are 21 5 and 88 5 sebewaing river watershed respectively the average and maximum percentage of watershed area that contain wetlands are 21 9 and 56 0 tahquamenon river watershed respectively michigan s wetlands are typically located adjacent to the rivers and streams that drain the watershed during 1 5 year and 2 0 year recurrence interval flow events these wetlands accumulate sediment a sediment sink when a river exceeds bankfull thirty four of the 60 michigan watersheds included in this research contain greater than 15 wetlands given michigan s industrial and commercial heritage related to the auto industry not surprisingly urban land use identified as developed in table 1 constitutes an important percentage of watersheds located in michigan s largest cities the watershed with highest percentage of urban development is the rouge river watershed within the city of detroit 84 1 other examples of watersheds that contain an elevated percentage of urban land use include the macatawa river watershed 34 1 near the city of holland michigan the clinton river watershed 55 6 north of the city of detroit the huron river watershed 32 8 west and south of the city of detroit and the saginaw river watershed 12 7 encompassing the cities of flint saginaw and bay city of the 60 rivers evaluated the average percentage of developed land within the watershed is 9 7 the ratio of mean annual river flow to the corresponding 1 5 year and 10 year recurrence interval flows see table 1 is a characteristic feature that distinguishes the percentage of developed land the value of this ratio increases as the percentage of developed land increases the magnitude of mean annual river flow as well as the 1 5 year and 2 0 year recurrence interval flows is one of the most critical inputs to estimating watershed sediment delivery the relationship between mean annual river flow and the watershed area for the 60 michigan rivers included in this research is shown in fig 3 and presented in equation 4 4 mean annual river flow q 0 00 95 a r 2 0 95 where q mean annual river flow meters3 sec a watershed area kilometers2 the noted r2 value of 0 95 signifies the strong correlation between mean annual river flow and watershed area there are two likely reasons why the correlation between watershed area and mean annual flow is so strong first michigan s extensive glacial heritage has resulted in relatively small differences in topography at the watershed scale in comparison to the elevation of the receiving water the corresponding great lake or great lakes connecting channel these multiple glacial events have resulted in the low gradient rivers that are common in michigan and throughout the great lakes basin second although the percentage of developed urbanized land greatly affects mean flow and flood flows within michigan s urban watersheds the average percentage of developed land in the 60 michigan watersheds that are presented in this paper is relatively small 9 71 with watershed land use dominated by forest land wetlands and agriculture with respect to watershed sediment delivery basin area has been referred to as the great integrator syvitski and kettner 2008 michigan s surficial geology reflects its glacial heritage these multiple glacial advances resulted in watersheds underlain by a complex sequence of glacial moraines ice contact deposits glacial outwash plains and glacial lake bed deposits flint 1971 farrand 1982 the complex surficial geology of michigan and resulting low gradient streams as well as the low percentage of developed land likely explains why there is a strong correlation between the mean annual river flow and watershed area syvitski and milliman 2007 also found a strong correlation between mean annual river flow and watershed area with respect to 488 rivers in their global database the bqart terms with the highest correlations to mean annual river flow q were watershed area a 0 75 and relief r 0 25 a recent study prepared for michigan s egle stantec 2014 found a similar relationship between watershed area and mean annual river flow for 28 southern michigan watersheds ranging in size from 24 8 kilometers2 to 1 412 kilometers2 with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 84 to 0 94 comparison of watershed sediment delivery estimates using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line and the syvitski and milliman s 2007 global bqart equation are presented in table 2 of the 60 rivers evaluated the global bqart equation predicts on average 19 less sediment delivery to the river outlet in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line see table 2 in fig 4 watershed sediment delivery estimates using the global bqart equation are compared graphically to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line both a regression line and a 1 1 line is shown in fig 4 the equation of the regression line is 5 y 1 19 0 9x 8855 8 r 2 0 87 where y watershed sediment delivery global bqart equation metric tonnes year x watershed sediment delivery usace great lakes regional trend line metric tonnes year the slope of the regression equation of 1 1909 is reflected in the average difference 19 between the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line shown in table 2 and is also apparent in comparison to the 1 1 line that is shown in fig 4 the noted r2 value of 0 87 of the regression line demonstrates the strong correlation between these two methods of estimating watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet overall the global bqart sediment delivery estimates are within 25 of the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line for 21 out of the 60 michigan rivers 35 of these 21 rivers 15 of these rivers have mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s which is the validated minimum water discharge that was used to establish the bqart equation cohn et al 2011 syvitski jpm 2019 as shown in table 1 and figure 4 48 of the 60 rivers have mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s with respect to the michigan rivers with mean annual flows of less than 30 m3 s 31 of the rivers have bqart sediment delivery estimates that are within 25 of the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line of these 48 rivers the bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 31 smaller than the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the global bqart equation provides lower estimates of the watershed sediment delivery in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line for rivers with mean annual flow rates of less than 30 m3 s of the 12 michigan rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s 50 of the rivers have bqart sediment delivery estimates that are within 25 of the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line further these 12 rivers have global bqart sediment delivery estimates that were on average 32 larger than the corresponding usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate of these 12 rivers two stand out the bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates for the manistee river and muskegon river were 109 and 107 larger than the corresponding usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate see table 2 the percent differences between the bqart model estimate and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate of greater than 30 were noted in three other rivers with mean annual river flows 30 m3 s including the portage river 33 ontonagon river 44 and menominee river 32 with respect to the manistee river muskegon river portage river ontonagon river and menominee river the relief term r is greater than 0 34 km for all five rivers the relief term r for the remaining seven rivers averages 0 23 km reflecting the low gradient streams common in michigan see table 2 the differences in watershed sediment delivery between these two methods appears to be due at least in part to the value used for the relief term r of the global bqart equation insight into the importance of the relief term r of the bqart equation was gained by evaluating watersheds that are divided into major sub basins of the 60 watersheds included in this research eight watersheds are divided into major sub basins typically defined by glacial moraines egle 2019 these rivers and watershed reference number include the au gres river 1 the au sable river 2 the pine river 10 the grand river 14 the saginaw river 32 the st joseph river 34 the menominee river 50 and the portage river 55 for these eight rivers the relief term r was calculated from the area weighted maximum elevation of the individual sub basins for example with respect to the saginaw river the maximum elevation of the watershed 470 m occurs in the tittabawassee sub basin which accounts for 23 of the total watershed area the sub basin area weighted maximum elevation for the saginaw river watershed is 374 m see table 1 the effect of using the sub basin area weighted maximum watershed elevation in conjunction with the global bqart estimate of watershed sediment delivery is shown in table 3 the effect of the relief term r is evident the use of the maximum watershed relief term r in comparison to the sub basin area weighted maximum watershed relief results in an average watershed sediment delivery increase of 17 with respect to the saginaw river the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates using the area weighted relief and maximum relief are 290 000 tonnes year and 420 000 tonnes year respectively the use of the area weighted relief term r in conjunction with the global bqart model estimate of watershed sediment delivery closely matches the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line estimate of 300 000 tonnes year for the saginaw river with respect to other rivers with mean annual flows 30 m3 s see table 3 the use of the sub basin area weighted relief term r in conjunction with the bqart equation provided closer estimates of watershed sediment delivery in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line these include the portage river the au sable river the menominee river the st joseph river and the grand river to gain further understanding of the sensitivity of the terms of the bqart equation in relation to watershed sediment delivery the bqart values for each of the 60 watersheds presented in table 2 were compared against watershed sediment delivery estimates prepared using the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the results of the regression analysis and correlation matrix are shown in table 4 table 4 reveals that the bqart terms most affecting watershed sediment delivery are watershed area a mean annual river flow q and relief r in addition to comparison of the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line both methods were compared to calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment transport models that were completed by the usace see table 5 the usace 516 e studies were completed on six of the 60 rivers included in this research the saginaw river watershed usace 1999 2000a the clinton river watershed usace 2005 the st joseph river watershed usace 2007a the grand river watershed usace 2007b the sebewaing river watershed usace 2007c and the ontonagon river watershed usace 2010 the saginaw river is the largest watershed in michigan 15 882 kilometers2 and due to the river s high watershed sediment delivery to saginaw bay lake huron is arguably the most studied with respect to the saginaw river watershed the mean annual flow rate is 124 9 m3 s the watershed sediment delivery predicted using the global bqart equation is estimated to be 290 000 tonnes year to saginaw bay lake huron the global bqart estimate is very similar to the watershed sediment delivery estimate of 250 000 tonnes year that was prepared in conjunction with the usace s 1999 2000a 516 e program the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line predicts a watershed sediment delivery of 300 000 tonnes year which is nearly identical to the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimate of 290 000 tonnes year the most recent usace 516 e study was completed on the ontonagon river usace 2010 the ontonagon river covers 3585 kilometers2 and has an mean annual flow rate of 39 4 m3 s using calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models the usace estimated watershed sediment delivery of 175 000 tonnes year to lake superior the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line and the global bqart equation predict watershed sediment delivery of 97 000 and 140 000 tonnes year respectively u s geological survey sediment gages with long term records are rare in michigan however a usgs gage with over 20 years of measurements is located on the ontonagon river using the usgs sediment gage data the usace 2010 estimated that the average annual watershed sediment delivery to lake superior is approximately 140 000 tonnes year in this case the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimate was similar to the usace 516 e study and the watershed sediment delivery estimate completed by the usace 2010 using the usgs ontonagon river sediment gage and less similar to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line four other usace 516 e studies were completed by the usace two on rivers that have mean annual flow rates of less than 30 m3 s sebewaing river and the clinton river and two on rivers with mean annual flow rates greater than 30 m3 s st joseph river and the grand river the sebewaing river and clinton river discharge to lake huron and lake st clair and have mean annual flow rates of 1 6 m3 s and 17 6 m3 s respectively with respect to the sebewaing river the watershed delivery estimates are 5 200 tonnes year usace 516 e study 13 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 3 200 tonnes year global bqart equation with respect to the clinton river the watershed sediment delivery estimates are 73 000 tonnes year usace 516 e study 27 000 tonnes year usgs sediment gage 63 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 18 000 tonnes year global bqart equation in the case of the rivers with mean annual river flows smaller than 30 m3 s the variability of the watershed sediment delivery estimates is high and the bqart watershed sediment delivery equation typically predicts less sediment delivery than the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line see fig 4 the st joseph river and the grand river discharge to lake michigan and are two of the largest rivers included in this research with mean annual flow rates of 132 5 m3 s and 127 1 m3 s with respect to the grand river the three watershed sediment delivery estimates were very similar with 250 000 tonnes year usace 516 e study 280 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 260 000 tonnes year global bqart equation with respect to the st joseph river the watershed sediment delivery estimates are 76 000 tonnes year usace 516 e study 250 000 tonnes year usace great lakes regional trend line and 290 000 tonnes year global bqart equation with respect to the st joseph river the variability of the watershed sediment delivery estimates may be due the large number of dams located on this river as discussed in the usace 2007b 516 e study 190 dams are located within the st joseph river watershed of which 95 are considered large dams usace 2007b estimates that only 13 of the watershed can drain directly to the river outlet and that up to 80 of the suspended sediment is trapped by the large network of dams located within this watershed given the differences in the data sets used to develop the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line the bqart equation can provide remarkably close estimates of watershed sediment delivery especially for rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s the watershed sediment delivery estimates calculated using the global bqart equation are comparable to the usace great lakes regional trend line for many michigan watersheds and implies that the global and great lakes regional processes of soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition are similar with respect to rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s the bqart equation appears to overestimate watershed sediment delivery in comparison the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line these higher estimates of watershed sediment delivery may be due in part to the value used for the relief r term of the bqart equation examples include the muskegon river and manistee river and to a lesser extent portage river ontonagon river and menominee river for the st joseph river the importance of the sediment trapping efficiency of dams and natural lakes located within the watershed is evident based on the usace 516 e estimate of watershed sediment delivery in comparison to the global bqart equation and the usace 2020 great lakes regional trend line the impact of natural lakes and dams on watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet is an area of ongoing research 4 conclusions the purpose of this research was to compare watershed sediment delivery estimates using three methods the great lakes regional trend line that was developed by the usace 2010 the global bqart sediment delivery equation that was developed syvitski and milliman 2007 and watershed sediment delivery estimates that were prepared using calibrated hydrodynamic and sediment delivery models in conjunction with the usace s 516 e program for six of the 60 michigan watersheds the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line is an empirical equation and as such is most applicable to estimating watershed sediment delivery within the great lakes basin the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line was developed based on sediment delivery estimates from 48 reservoirs and 13 watersheds located throughout the great lakes basin and predicts watershed sediment delivery as a function of area the syvitski and milliman 2007 bqart equation was developed from a database encompassing 488 global rivers whose watersheds cover 63 of the earth s surface the bqart equation estimates watershed sediment delivery as a function five variables including a geologic and human influence factor b the mean annual flow of the river q watershed area a the difference between the maximum elevation of the watershed and the elevation of the receiving water relief r and mean basin temperature t the present research showed that overall the global bqart sediment delivery estimates were on average 19 lower than the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line with respect to the usace 516 e studies comparison of the three methods showed high variability for the sebewaing river and clinton river given than both rivers have mean annual river flows below 30 m3 s the variability of the global bqart watershed sediment delivery estimates were expected of the remaining four rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s the usace 516 e watershed sediment delivery estimates were very similar to the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line with respect to the grand river and saginaw and less similar for the ontonagon river and the st joseph river with respect to the st joseph river the low usace 516 e estimate for watershed sediment delivery to the river outlet is most likely due to the presence of a large number of dams within this watershed the global bqart equation provided surprisingly close estimates of watershed sediment delivery for 21 of the 60 michigan rivers evaluated in this research in comparison to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line especially for rivers with mean annual flows greater than 30 m3 s it is noteworthy that the watershed sediment delivery values calculated using the global bqart equation are so similar to the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line for a number of michigan watersheds and implies that the global and great lakes regional processes of soil erosion sediment transport and sediment deposition are similar comparison of the global bqart equation and the usace 2010 great lakes regional trend line indicate that the most important variables affecting watershed sediment delivery are watershed area a mean annual river flow q and relief r this research was conducted to support the development of a new set of watershed sediment delivery equations applicable to the smaller low gradient streams located in michigan and throughout the great lakes basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

nature of floods these models cannot deal with every problem of fsms therefore several metaheuristic approaches based on the idea of ensembles have been applied in recent years to reduce the disadvantages of the models in this study anfis ga anfis sa anfis ica and anfis de approaches in the gis environment were considered for the assessment of the flood susceptibility and flood zoning in

determine the relationships between factors in various processes the anfis is the result of the integration of adaptive neural networks and fuzzy inference system developed by yang 1990 1993 nairn and alsharhan 1997 wang and elhag 2008 similar to the fuzzy model this model employs empirical knowledge and can be trained like a neural network model based on the use of a combined learning process it is possible to set parameters based on input and output data jang 1996 in a word the anfis system consists of a five layer structure with several input variables where each input has two or more membership functions bezdek et al 1984 the anfis model applied to flood susceptibility and hazard assessment consists of five layers as shown in fig 4 tien bui et al 2012 a detailed description of the anfis model is available in the literature tien bui et al 2012 razavi termeh et al 2018 2 3 2 genetic algorithm ga the ga was first introduced by holland in 1970 at the university of michigan holland 1975 the ga imitates the survival of generations in the natural world wang et al 2008 this method is referred to as a random search method because it randomly samples the space of answers this algorithm chooses a population of chromosomes each of which is an answer to the problem s space after the initial population is generated by the parent selection operator several chromosomes are selected after the implementation of crossover and mutation operators for the parents new children are produced finally using the selection operator the current population is selected from the children and parents for the next replication saeidian et al 2016 the ga operators are as follows parent choice operator to start the generation production in the ga first the parent selection operator is used to select two chromosomes from the population called parent derived chromosomes which are then introduced into the production process for the generation of chromosomes and application of combination and mutation operators the criterion for choosing members is the matching value but the selection process is random in this research the parent chromosomes were selected using the wheel selection mechanism which is the most appropriate random choice mechanism based on the selection probability saeidian et al 2016 crossover operator the crossover operator is the most important ga operator the crossover operator tries to generate a new chromosome by mixing old generations of chromosomes therefore the parents exchange their genes in the selection section and create new members the ga crossover causes less genetic or population diversity because it facilitates the combination of good genes saeidian et al 2016 in this study two point crossover was applied to run the ga and change the chromosomes from one generation to another fig 5 mutation operator the mutation operator creates other probability answers after creating a member in a new population in the ga the mutation of each gene is probable during the mutation a gene may be removed from or added to the genes of a population mutation represents the change of a gene depending on the type of coding different mutation methods can be produced saeidian et al 2016 in this research random mutation was used for ga modeling fig 6 after the random selection of a chromosome during the mutation one gene will select as candidate for changing its value 2 3 3 simulated annealing sa the sa algorithm has been introduced by kirkpatrick et al 1983 this approach creates a link among the entropy atomic structure and temperature during the tempering of a component in the annealing process a component is heated to a higher temperature than its melting temperature subsequently its temperature is gradually decreased the temperature reduction is very slow such that the material component is in thermodynamic equilibrium tran and tran 2007 vasan and raju 2009 in other notations the temperature of the object remains constant such that the best crystalline structure with the least energy is formed in the sa algorithm the solutions proposed for the problem are at higher temperatures and are often inappropriate the temperature variable is then reduced over time such that better solutions at low temperatures are obtained the algorithm gains the next answers using the current answers in this algorithm warming up is performed by applying more random variations of variables at higher temperatures the variables change more as the temperature decreases the range of random variables also decreases the changes that lead to better results are always accepted however the acceptance of changes that result in deterioration has a particular probability tran and tran 2007 vasan and raju 2009 7 δ f f x n e w f x o l d where f x n e w is the target function value at the new point and f x o l d is the target function value at the previous point the probability of the answers is as follows 1 if δ f 0 x o l d is replaced by x n e w 2 if δ f 0 x o l d is replaced by x n e w with the probability of p e δ f t the sa algorithm operates based on an initial response and its modification to achieve a possible solution the production of the initial answer is random after choosing the randomized initial answer and calculating the objective function of this answer another answer is identified in the neighborhood of the initial answer in this study the combination of three different neighborhood concepts is used by assigning a probability to each neighbor anand et al 2010 1 replacement in this neighborhood two centers are merged as shown in fig 7 2 inverse in this neighborhood two centers are selected in addition to replacing the two centers all centers between the two selected ones are reversed fig 7 3 removal and transmission in this neighborhood two centers are selected the first center is then removed and moved to a place after the second center fig 7 the temperature reduction at each stage is exponential and the probability of accepting a new response is based on the relations mentioned in the sa algorithm 2 3 4 imperialist competitive algorithm ica the ica is based on social and human phenomena this algorithm has been presented by atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 the ica is a powerful optimization technique including the mathematical modeling of the sociopolitical phenomenon several countries are considered as the primary population in the algorithm the initial population is randomly selected given the cost function the countries are divided into colonialist and colony classes over the long term countries with higher and lower powers are chosen as colonizers and colonies respectively after the colonizers are identified with respect to their power other countries are randomly assigned to one of the colonizers each colonialist and colonies belonging to the countries are called empire atashpaz gargari 2009 du et al 2014 another method of dividing the colonies into colonialists is based on the normalized cost which can be calculated using eq 8 8 n â t â c n max i t â c i t â c n where t â c n is cost of the empire n and n â t â c n is the total normalized value of that empire the empire with the lowest cost has the most power based on the normalized cost the colony s competition power probability can be calculated using eq 9 9 p p n n t c n i 1 n imp n t c i in the next step a colonialist country is identified to analyze colonies focusing on the culture and social structure colonial countries are closed to colonialist in various political and social strata the colonies are then moved to the colonial country note that during the implementation of the algorithm several colonies may reach a point in the cost function that costs less than the value of the cost function in the colonial position in this case the different colonies and colonial positions change and the algorithm continues with the colonial country of a recent situation and begin to apply assimilation decisions to the colonies to calculate the cost function the total cost of the empires is computed as follows 10 t â c n f i m p δ m e a n f c o l o n y where f imp is the value of the objective function of the colonizer f colony represents the mean values of the target functions of the colonies and the constant δ ranges from zero to one after calculating the cost of each empire the colonies of weak empires are eliminated and merged into stronger empires the recruitment or competition between colonists is repeated at each stage of the repetition of the algorithm colonialists with less power lose one of their colonies a colony separated from the weaker colonizer has the lowest power among all colonies in the next stage empires that have lost all colonies are eliminated and merged into colonialist as a colony this process continues until a colonialist with the greatest power is obtained to complete the algorithm the conditions are considered to be terminated among these conditions a certain number of repetitions of a particular algorithm or execution time can be mentioned atashpaz gargari 2009 the algorithm ends when the final condition or final colonizer is reached 2 3 5 differential evolution de the de strategy is a probabilistic population based optimization method in this algorithm production of the primary population and the continuation of the evolution of future generations and also valuation of the evaluation function is in accordance with the ga das et al 2009 based on this strategy only two operators that is crossover and mutation are applied but with different approaches this strategy has been proposed by storn and price 1997 the main difference between this algorithm and other evolutionary algorithms is to choose the direction and distance of the current population from other members of the population to guide the search process into a desirable direction storn and price 1997 the overall process of this algorithm is as follows valuation operator this algorithm initially creates a random population in the range of the corresponding problem values at this stage the boundaries of the values are determined in the next step four members of the population are randomly selected among these four members one member is determined to be the target member and the three other members are randomly assigned to vectors 1 2 and 3 storn 2008 mutation operator at this stage to generate a mutated vector the difference between the two vectors 2 and 3 in the coefficient f is plotted against vector 1 a mutated vector is created using eq 11 during each mutation operation within the population storn 2008 11 v i g 1 x r 1 g f x r 2 g x r 3 g the coefficient f called the scale factor ranges from 0 to 2 this coefficient determines the length of the mutation step crossover operator in this section crossover occurs between a mutant vector and the target member selected in the first stage and the measurement vector is generated the basis of this compound is based on the c r coefficient which ranges from 0 to 1 each component of the mutant vector is transmitted to the candidate vector with the probability of c r otherwise the equivalent component is replaced in the original vector this operator is represented in eq 12 storn 2008 12 u ji g 1 v ji g 1 i f r a n d c r o r j j rand x ji g o t h e r w i s e selection at this stage the sampling vector obtained in the previous stage and the target member that was selected in the first stage are assigned values based on the objective function if the value of the vector of the evaluation is larger than that of the target member it will be one of the members of the next generation otherwise the target member becomes one of the members of the next generation the choice between the measurement vector measurement and the target member can be expressed as storn 2008 13 x ji g 1 u ji g 1 i f f u i g 1 f x i g x ji g o t h e r w i s e 2 4 ensembles including the anfis and metaheuristic algorithms the calculation of the gradient descent as conventional learning algorithm in the anfis model is difficult the use of chain rules may lead to a local minimum and affect the accuracy of modeling process from another point of view when we use different inputs the anfis is not suitable for modeling problems because the generated fuzzy rules increase exponentially with the increase in the inputs some of the problems of the increase in the fuzzy rules are related to increasing errors and long computation times of the modeling process to remove these limitations orientation of membership function parameters and improve the accuracy of anfis model four ensemble algorithms including the anfis de anfis ica anfis ga and anfis sa were used in this study instead of traditional methods the flowchart of the ensemble modeling process is presented in fig 8 in this research the root mean square error rmse was used as a statistical evaluation criterion eq 15 to determine the accuracy of the established flood susceptibility models kia et al 2012 however savage et al 2013 stated that the rmse as a standard metric to determine errors in geoscience modeling is very sensitive to outliers big data and large values therefore the objective function of the metaheuristic approaches was computed based on eqs 14 16 mohapatra et al 2015 14 e t y 15 rmse mean e 2 16 objective f u n c t i o n min rmse where t represents the target data y represents the input data function and fuzzy system whose values are optimized and e is the error function value to be minimized 3 results to determine the ensemble models the weights obtained from the bivariate frequency ratio model were used as system inputs and were transferred to the matlab software after normalization the parameter set used in the de ga ica and sa is listed in table 3 the convergence graphs of the objective function of each approach after the implementation of the combined ensemble models are presented in fig 9 fig 9 shows that the proposed anfis de ensemble approach has the best convergence ratio 0 2562 with respect to the adjustment of the parameters of the adaptive fuzzy neural system when the objective function of this problem is minimized followed by the anfis ga anfis ica and anfis sa combinations with values of 0 31212 0 3345 and 0 33976 respectively the convergence diagram of these three models including 1000 iterations is shown in fig 9 the results of the evaluation of the ensemble models using the roc receiver operating characteristics curve and validation dataset show that the accuracy of the anfis ga ensemble is 0 903 followed by anfis sa 0 843 anfis de 0 812 and anfis ica 0 798 table 4 indicates the success and prediction rates of the four models the results indicate that anfis ga is the best model with respect to both the training and validating processes as mentioned above the rmse function was used to evaluate the performances of the ensemble approaches eq 15 in general an indirect trend can be observed with respect to the rmse a lower rmse indicates better results when comparing different models the outputs derived from the training data and validation of the combined models are shown in figs 10 17 the results show that the rmse of the training data of the anfis de is 0 2562 representing the best value among the four ensemble models followed by anfis ga anfis ica and anfis sa with values of 0 3121 0 3345 and 0 3398 respectively the standard deviations stdevs of the generated responses were determined the anfis de training data have the lowest stdev 0 25695 among the combined models followed by the anfis ga anfis ica and anfis sa models with values of 0 31303 0 33543 and 0 34068 respectively based on the stdev the output of the anfis de model is more stable than that of other combined models the error histogram generated using eq 14 is shown in figs 10 17 the histogram indicates that the error has a normal distribution finally the outputs of the ensemble models in matlab were transferred to arcgis to map the flood susceptibility and hazards in the study area fig 18 and table 5 based on table 5 the percentage of the area of the low moderate high and very high susceptibility classes of angis ica is 24 51 26 61 25 17 and 23 72 respectively however the percentages of anfis sa are 28 95 42 88 19 41 and 8 76 respectively the results show that the low moderate high and very high susceptibility classes cover 34 92 36 62 18 65 and 9 82 of the study area in anfis ga respectively the percentage of each susceptibility class of the anfis de ensemble is 35 16 34 13 20 34 and 10 38 respectively therefore it can be concluded that the anfis ica overestimates the very high susceptibility class compared with other ensemble models and thus has the lowest accuracy based on the auc values table 4 4 discussion floods are known to be dangerous hazards that negatively impact the human safety economy and environment the results of the evaluation of ensemble models using the roc curve and auc indicate that the anfis ga ensemble has the highest accuracy an auc value of 0 903 followed by anfis sa 0 843 anfis de 0 812 and anfis ica 0 798 the reason for the high accuracy and superiority of the ga sa and de algorithms compared with the ica algorithm is that the three former algorithms are population based the ica algorithm does not have an initial population but starts with a random response and thus is less accurate than the other population approaches the primary differences between the de and ga algorithms are the arrangements of the mutation and crossover operators and the operation modes of selection operator the reason for the higher accuracy of the ga algorithm relative to the da is its ability to search locally also the ga and sa algorithms are superior to the ica algorithm because of their memory function maintenance of appropriate responses and sharing of information among chromosomes artificial intelligence algorithms are difficult in process modeling however wise algorithms including the ga sa ica and de are proper techniques for the calculation and optimization of the results of artificial intelligence methods especially for the identification of solutions for high dimensional and nonlinear problems thus these models reduce problems related to the dimension and local minimum chen et al 2017a vahidnia et al 2010 indicated that the anfis is a nonlinear and flexible model they stated that this model is suitable for the creation of a framework of simple inferences based on lee et al 2015 who integrated the anfis with the frequency ratio to establish landslide susceptibility maps in korea the anfis method has the learning ability of anns and expert knowledge of fuzzy inference systems the authors illustrated that this hybrid model is an effective tool because of its highly accurate results in addition ensemble models do not have the disadvantages of machine learning methods and data driven and bivariate statistical analyses tehrany et al 2013 this superiority enhances the popularity of ensemble models among researchers studying floods chen et al 2017b however the weaknesses of this method are the inability to assess the flood velocity duration and depth wang et al 2015 nasiri aghdam et al 2016 who applied the statistical index wi and anfis indicated that the prediction and success rates of the anfis method for landslide susceptibility mapping are 0 89 and 0 90 respectively based on kavzoglu et al 2015 ga and de are algorithms that are very important and suitable for complex optimization problems presenting proper combinations of factors among available factors kavzoglu et al 2015 as stated in kavzoglu et al 2015 the ga is reliable and stable based on tien bui et al 2016 de is a population based stochastic search approach which solves global optimization problems however the population vectors in the de are randomly sampled and integrated to build vectors for future generations chen et al 2017a recently ebtehaj et al 2018 compared the use of the gmdh group method of data handling and anfis algorithms for the calculation of the discharge coefficient of a rectangular side weir they evaluated the results of single and multi objective methods the results showed that multi objective approaches have the highest accuracy the authors also confirmed that the anfis ga svd singular value decomposition outperforms the gmdh ga svd anfis ga and gmdh ga and machine learning and regression based equations hong et al 2018 proposed anfis models coupled with de and ga for the assessment of spatial flood models in hengfeng county china they indicated that the anfis de with an auc value of 0 852 is the best model followed by the anfis ga 0 849 in general the results of previous studies indicate that ensemble models are suitable for flood hazard assessment in this study the flood susceptibility was mapped by coupling anfis with the ga sa ica and de algorithms the results show that the ensembles of anfis and wise approaches ga sa de and ica can be applied for flood susceptibility and hazard zoning in dingnan county and elsewhere future studies should focus on comparing the results of flood susceptibility evaluations with flood simulation models to reduce the problems related to the models additionally floods recognized as one of the main causes of soil erosion and degradation in the study area as well as being an essential source of sediments delivered to stream channels these negative effects have caused the infrastructure of the study area to be damaged and thus so many people leave these regions and migrate to other regions further a deeper assessment of the relations among different processes of land degradation have to be considered in supporting the concept of adaptive management measures including water and agronomic conservation activities 5 conclusions flood management is important to prevent economic losses and human casualties especially in emerging economies such as china in this research the use of gis based ensemble algorithms for flood hazard assessment was tested the anfis was coupled with the ga sa ica and de algorithms it is difficult to use artificial intelligence algorithms in process modeling in contrast wise algorithms including the ga sa ica and de are suitable for optimizing the results of artificial intelligence methods particularly for the identification of solutions to high dimensional and nonlinear problems such as flood prediction in fact these models reduce problems related to the dimension and local minimum furthermore they enhance the anfis model accuracy flood susceptibility maps constructed with the anfis ga anfis sa anfis ica and anfis de ensembles were assessed by using roc curves in this study the auc values of the anfis ga anfis sa anfis de and anfis ica are 90 37 84 32 81 21 and 79 84 respectively based on the rmse the anfis de model is the most suitable for flood susceptibility zoning generally the models proposed this study can be considered as alternative techniques for the prediction of

susceptibility modeling anfis genetic algorithm simulated annealing imperialist competitive algorithm differential evolution 1 introduction floods are natural hazards worldwide leading to the deaths of many people and economic losses the rainfall characteristics are considered to be the most important climatic factors affecting the occurrence of floods çelik et al 2012 however the generation of storm runoff at the basin scale is complex soulsby et al 2010 generally different factors play key roles in flood events and their hazards such as climate change land use evolution rainfall geomorphology lithology and human activity reneau 2000 beckers et al 2013 based on previous studies regional flooding is related to the decrease in the surface water storage reager et al 2014 headwaters are known as deep and tight channels which benefit flood wave transformation belmonte and beltrán 2001 in addition sediment dynamics can lead to frequent overbank flooding and thus to erosion and deposition billi 2011 land use changes due to climate scenarios and environmental changes may affect the sediment transport and flood development garcía ruiz et al 2008 marchetti et al 2016 reported that ndvi normalized difference vegetation index patterns are important in terms of vegetation physiognomies elevation and flood dynamics marchetti et al 2016 in addition the stream power is the factor affecting the geomorphic effectiveness of flood discharge knighton 1999 to model the risk of floods in floodplain regions gis geographic information system based morphometry and satellite imagery have been applied youssef et al 2011 the flood risk significantly increases due to land development urbanization population growth and migration sampson et al 2015 recently the

nature of floods these models cannot deal with every problem of fsms therefore several metaheuristic approaches based on the idea of ensembles have been applied in recent years to reduce the disadvantages of the models in this study anfis ga anfis sa anfis ica and anfis de approaches in the gis environment were considered for the assessment of the flood susceptibility and flood zoning in

determine the relationships between factors in various processes the anfis is the result of the integration of adaptive neural networks and fuzzy inference system developed by yang 1990 1993 nairn and alsharhan 1997 wang and elhag 2008 similar to the fuzzy model this model employs empirical knowledge and can be trained like a neural network model based on the use of a combined learning process it is possible to set parameters based on input and output data jang 1996 in a word the anfis system consists of a five layer structure with several input variables where each input has two or more membership functions bezdek et al 1984 the anfis model applied to flood susceptibility and hazard assessment consists of five layers as shown in fig 4 tien bui et al 2012 a detailed description of the anfis model is available in the literature tien bui et al 2012 razavi termeh et al 2018 2 3 2 genetic algorithm ga the ga was first introduced by holland in 1970 at the university of michigan holland 1975 the ga imitates the survival of generations in the natural world wang et al 2008 this method is referred to as a random search method because it randomly samples the space of answers this algorithm chooses a population of chromosomes each of which is an answer to the problem s space after the initial population is generated by the parent selection operator several chromosomes are selected after the implementation of crossover and mutation operators for the parents new children are produced finally using the selection operator the current population is selected from the children and parents for the next replication saeidian et al 2016 the ga operators are as follows parent choice operator to start the generation production in the ga first the parent selection operator is used to select two chromosomes from the population called parent derived chromosomes which are then introduced into the production process for the generation of chromosomes and application of combination and mutation operators the criterion for choosing members is the matching value but the selection process is random in this research the parent chromosomes were selected using the wheel selection mechanism which is the most appropriate random choice mechanism based on the selection probability saeidian et al 2016 crossover operator the crossover operator is the most important ga operator the crossover operator tries to generate a new chromosome by mixing old generations of chromosomes therefore the parents exchange their genes in the selection section and create new members the ga crossover causes less genetic or population diversity because it facilitates the combination of good genes saeidian et al 2016 in this study two point crossover was applied to run the ga and change the chromosomes from one generation to another fig 5 mutation operator the mutation operator creates other probability answers after creating a member in a new population in the ga the mutation of each gene is probable during the mutation a gene may be removed from or added to the genes of a population mutation represents the change of a gene depending on the type of coding different mutation methods can be produced saeidian et al 2016 in this research random mutation was used for ga modeling fig 6 after the random selection of a chromosome during the mutation one gene will select as candidate for changing its value 2 3 3 simulated annealing sa the sa algorithm has been introduced by kirkpatrick et al 1983 this approach creates a link among the entropy atomic structure and temperature during the tempering of a component in the annealing process a component is heated to a higher temperature than its melting temperature subsequently its temperature is gradually decreased the temperature reduction is very slow such that the material component is in thermodynamic equilibrium tran and tran 2007 vasan and raju 2009 in other notations the temperature of the object remains constant such that the best crystalline structure with the least energy is formed in the sa algorithm the solutions proposed for the problem are at higher temperatures and are often inappropriate the temperature variable is then reduced over time such that better solutions at low temperatures are obtained the algorithm gains the next answers using the current answers in this algorithm warming up is performed by applying more random variations of variables at higher temperatures the variables change more as the temperature decreases the range of random variables also decreases the changes that lead to better results are always accepted however the acceptance of changes that result in deterioration has a particular probability tran and tran 2007 vasan and raju 2009 7 δ f f x n e w f x o l d where f x n e w is the target function value at the new point and f x o l d is the target function value at the previous point the probability of the answers is as follows 1 if δ f 0 x o l d is replaced by x n e w 2 if δ f 0 x o l d is replaced by x n e w with the probability of p e δ f t the sa algorithm operates based on an initial response and its modification to achieve a possible solution the production of the initial answer is random after choosing the randomized initial answer and calculating the objective function of this answer another answer is identified in the neighborhood of the initial answer in this study the combination of three different neighborhood concepts is used by assigning a probability to each neighbor anand et al 2010 1 replacement in this neighborhood two centers are merged as shown in fig 7 2 inverse in this neighborhood two centers are selected in addition to replacing the two centers all centers between the two selected ones are reversed fig 7 3 removal and transmission in this neighborhood two centers are selected the first center is then removed and moved to a place after the second center fig 7 the temperature reduction at each stage is exponential and the probability of accepting a new response is based on the relations mentioned in the sa algorithm 2 3 4 imperialist competitive algorithm ica the ica is based on social and human phenomena this algorithm has been presented by atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 the ica is a powerful optimization technique including the mathematical modeling of the sociopolitical phenomenon several countries are considered as the primary population in the algorithm the initial population is randomly selected given the cost function the countries are divided into colonialist and colony classes over the long term countries with higher and lower powers are chosen as colonizers and colonies respectively after the colonizers are identified with respect to their power other countries are randomly assigned to one of the colonizers each colonialist and colonies belonging to the countries are called empire atashpaz gargari 2009 du et al 2014 another method of dividing the colonies into colonialists is based on the normalized cost which can be calculated using eq 8 8 n â t â c n max i t â c i t â c n where t â c n is cost of the empire n and n â t â c n is the total normalized value of that empire the empire with the lowest cost has the most power based on the normalized cost the colony s competition power probability can be calculated using eq 9 9 p p n n t c n i 1 n imp n t c i in the next step a colonialist country is identified to analyze colonies focusing on the culture and social structure colonial countries are closed to colonialist in various political and social strata the colonies are then moved to the colonial country note that during the implementation of the algorithm several colonies may reach a point in the cost function that costs less than the value of the cost function in the colonial position in this case the different colonies and colonial positions change and the algorithm continues with the colonial country of a recent situation and begin to apply assimilation decisions to the colonies to calculate the cost function the total cost of the empires is computed as follows 10 t â c n f i m p δ m e a n f c o l o n y where f imp is the value of the objective function of the colonizer f colony represents the mean values of the target functions of the colonies and the constant δ ranges from zero to one after calculating the cost of each empire the colonies of weak empires are eliminated and merged into stronger empires the recruitment or competition between colonists is repeated at each stage of the repetition of the algorithm colonialists with less power lose one of their colonies a colony separated from the weaker colonizer has the lowest power among all colonies in the next stage empires that have lost all colonies are eliminated and merged into colonialist as a colony this process continues until a colonialist with the greatest power is obtained to complete the algorithm the conditions are considered to be terminated among these conditions a certain number of repetitions of a particular algorithm or execution time can be mentioned atashpaz gargari 2009 the algorithm ends when the final condition or final colonizer is reached 2 3 5 differential evolution de the de strategy is a probabilistic population based optimization method in this algorithm production of the primary population and the continuation of the evolution of future generations and also valuation of the evaluation function is in accordance with the ga das et al 2009 based on this strategy only two operators that is crossover and mutation are applied but with different approaches this strategy has been proposed by storn and price 1997 the main difference between this algorithm and other evolutionary algorithms is to choose the direction and distance of the current population from other members of the population to guide the search process into a desirable direction storn and price 1997 the overall process of this algorithm is as follows valuation operator this algorithm initially creates a random population in the range of the corresponding problem values at this stage the boundaries of the values are determined in the next step four members of the population are randomly selected among these four members one member is determined to be the target member and the three other members are randomly assigned to vectors 1 2 and 3 storn 2008 mutation operator at this stage to generate a mutated vector the difference between the two vectors 2 and 3 in the coefficient f is plotted against vector 1 a mutated vector is created using eq 11 during each mutation operation within the population storn 2008 11 v i g 1 x r 1 g f x r 2 g x r 3 g the coefficient f called the scale factor ranges from 0 to 2 this coefficient determines the length of the mutation step crossover operator in this section crossover occurs between a mutant vector and the target member selected in the first stage and the measurement vector is generated the basis of this compound is based on the c r coefficient which ranges from 0 to 1 each component of the mutant vector is transmitted to the candidate vector with the probability of c r otherwise the equivalent component is replaced in the original vector this operator is represented in eq 12 storn 2008 12 u ji g 1 v ji g 1 i f r a n d c r o r j j rand x ji g o t h e r w i s e selection at this stage the sampling vector obtained in the previous stage and the target member that was selected in the first stage are assigned values based on the objective function if the value of the vector of the evaluation is larger than that of the target member it will be one of the members of the next generation otherwise the target member becomes one of the members of the next generation the choice between the measurement vector measurement and the target member can be expressed as storn 2008 13 x ji g 1 u ji g 1 i f f u i g 1 f x i g x ji g o t h e r w i s e 2 4 ensembles including the anfis and metaheuristic algorithms the calculation of the gradient descent as conventional learning algorithm in the anfis model is difficult the use of chain rules may lead to a local minimum and affect the accuracy of modeling process from another point of view when we use different inputs the anfis is not suitable for modeling problems because the generated fuzzy rules increase exponentially with the increase in the inputs some of the problems of the increase in the fuzzy rules are related to increasing errors and long computation times of the modeling process to remove these limitations orientation of membership function parameters and improve the accuracy of anfis model four ensemble algorithms including the anfis de anfis ica anfis ga and anfis sa were used in this study instead of traditional methods the flowchart of the ensemble modeling process is presented in fig 8 in this research the root mean square error rmse was used as a statistical evaluation criterion eq 15 to determine the accuracy of the established flood susceptibility models kia et al 2012 however savage et al 2013 stated that the rmse as a standard metric to determine errors in geoscience modeling is very sensitive to outliers big data and large values therefore the objective function of the metaheuristic approaches was computed based on eqs 14 16 mohapatra et al 2015 14 e t y 15 rmse mean e 2 16 objective f u n c t i o n min rmse where t represents the target data y represents the input data function and fuzzy system whose values are optimized and e is the error function value to be minimized 3 results to determine the ensemble models the weights obtained from the bivariate frequency ratio model were used as system inputs and were transferred to the matlab software after normalization the parameter set used in the de ga ica and sa is listed in table 3 the convergence graphs of the objective function of each approach after the implementation of the combined ensemble models are presented in fig 9 fig 9 shows that the proposed anfis de ensemble approach has the best convergence ratio 0 2562 with respect to the adjustment of the parameters of the adaptive fuzzy neural system when the objective function of this problem is minimized followed by the anfis ga anfis ica and anfis sa combinations with values of 0 31212 0 3345 and 0 33976 respectively the convergence diagram of these three models including 1000 iterations is shown in fig 9 the results of the evaluation of the ensemble models using the roc receiver operating characteristics curve and validation dataset show that the accuracy of the anfis ga ensemble is 0 903 followed by anfis sa 0 843 anfis de 0 812 and anfis ica 0 798 table 4 indicates the success and prediction rates of the four models the results indicate that anfis ga is the best model with respect to both the training and validating processes as mentioned above the rmse function was used to evaluate the performances of the ensemble approaches eq 15 in general an indirect trend can be observed with respect to the rmse a lower rmse indicates better results when comparing different models the outputs derived from the training data and validation of the combined models are shown in figs 10 17 the results show that the rmse of the training data of the anfis de is 0 2562 representing the best value among the four ensemble models followed by anfis ga anfis ica and anfis sa with values of 0 3121 0 3345 and 0 3398 respectively the standard deviations stdevs of the generated responses were determined the anfis de training data have the lowest stdev 0 25695 among the combined models followed by the anfis ga anfis ica and anfis sa models with values of 0 31303 0 33543 and 0 34068 respectively based on the stdev the output of the anfis de model is more stable than that of other combined models the error histogram generated using eq 14 is shown in figs 10 17 the histogram indicates that the error has a normal distribution finally the outputs of the ensemble models in matlab were transferred to arcgis to map the flood susceptibility and hazards in the study area fig 18 and table 5 based on table 5 the percentage of the area of the low moderate high and very high susceptibility classes of angis ica is 24 51 26 61 25 17 and 23 72 respectively however the percentages of anfis sa are 28 95 42 88 19 41 and 8 76 respectively the results show that the low moderate high and very high susceptibility classes cover 34 92 36 62 18 65 and 9 82 of the study area in anfis ga respectively the percentage of each susceptibility class of the anfis de ensemble is 35 16 34 13 20 34 and 10 38 respectively therefore it can be concluded that the anfis ica overestimates the very high susceptibility class compared with other ensemble models and thus has the lowest accuracy based on the auc values table 4 4 discussion floods are known to be dangerous hazards that negatively impact the human safety economy and environment the results of the evaluation of ensemble models using the roc curve and auc indicate that the anfis ga ensemble has the highest accuracy an auc value of 0 903 followed by anfis sa 0 843 anfis de 0 812 and anfis ica 0 798 the reason for the high accuracy and superiority of the ga sa and de algorithms compared with the ica algorithm is that the three former algorithms are population based the ica algorithm does not have an initial population but starts with a random response and thus is less accurate than the other population approaches the primary differences between the de and ga algorithms are the arrangements of the mutation and crossover operators and the operation modes of selection operator the reason for the higher accuracy of the ga algorithm relative to the da is its ability to search locally also the ga and sa algorithms are superior to the ica algorithm because of their memory function maintenance of appropriate responses and sharing of information among chromosomes artificial intelligence algorithms are difficult in process modeling however wise algorithms including the ga sa ica and de are proper techniques for the calculation and optimization of the results of artificial intelligence methods especially for the identification of solutions for high dimensional and nonlinear problems thus these models reduce problems related to the dimension and local minimum chen et al 2017a vahidnia et al 2010 indicated that the anfis is a nonlinear and flexible model they stated that this model is suitable for the creation of a framework of simple inferences based on lee et al 2015 who integrated the anfis with the frequency ratio to establish landslide susceptibility maps in korea the anfis method has the learning ability of anns and expert knowledge of fuzzy inference systems the authors illustrated that this hybrid model is an effective tool because of its highly accurate results in addition ensemble models do not have the disadvantages of machine learning methods and data driven and bivariate statistical analyses tehrany et al 2013 this superiority enhances the popularity of ensemble models among researchers studying floods chen et al 2017b however the weaknesses of this method are the inability to assess the flood velocity duration and depth wang et al 2015 nasiri aghdam et al 2016 who applied the statistical index wi and anfis indicated that the prediction and success rates of the anfis method for landslide susceptibility mapping are 0 89 and 0 90 respectively based on kavzoglu et al 2015 ga and de are algorithms that are very important and suitable for complex optimization problems presenting proper combinations of factors among available factors kavzoglu et al 2015 as stated in kavzoglu et al 2015 the ga is reliable and stable based on tien bui et al 2016 de is a population based stochastic search approach which solves global optimization problems however the population vectors in the de are randomly sampled and integrated to build vectors for future generations chen et al 2017a recently ebtehaj et al 2018 compared the use of the gmdh group method of data handling and anfis algorithms for the calculation of the discharge coefficient of a rectangular side weir they evaluated the results of single and multi objective methods the results showed that multi objective approaches have the highest accuracy the authors also confirmed that the anfis ga svd singular value decomposition outperforms the gmdh ga svd anfis ga and gmdh ga and machine learning and regression based equations hong et al 2018 proposed anfis models coupled with de and ga for the assessment of spatial flood models in hengfeng county china they indicated that the anfis de with an auc value of 0 852 is the best model followed by the anfis ga 0 849 in general the results of previous studies indicate that ensemble models are suitable for flood hazard assessment in this study the flood susceptibility was mapped by coupling anfis with the ga sa ica and de algorithms the results show that the ensembles of anfis and wise approaches ga sa de and ica can be applied for flood susceptibility and hazard zoning in dingnan county and elsewhere future studies should focus on comparing the results of flood susceptibility evaluations with flood simulation models to reduce the problems related to the models additionally floods recognized as one of the main causes of soil erosion and degradation in the study area as well as being an essential source of sediments delivered to stream channels these negative effects have caused the infrastructure of the study area to be damaged and thus so many people leave these regions and migrate to other regions further a deeper assessment of the relations among different processes of land degradation have to be considered in supporting the concept of adaptive management measures including water and agronomic conservation activities 5 conclusions flood management is important to prevent economic losses and human casualties especially in emerging economies such as china in this research the use of gis based ensemble algorithms for flood hazard assessment was tested the anfis was coupled with the ga sa ica and de algorithms it is difficult to use artificial intelligence algorithms in process modeling in contrast wise algorithms including the ga sa ica and de are suitable for optimizing the results of artificial intelligence methods particularly for the identification of solutions to high dimensional and nonlinear problems such as flood prediction in fact these models reduce problems related to the dimension and local minimum furthermore they enhance the anfis model accuracy flood susceptibility maps constructed with the anfis ga anfis sa anfis ica and anfis de ensembles were assessed by using roc curves in this study the auc values of the anfis ga anfis sa anfis de and anfis ica are 90 37 84 32 81 21 and 79 84 respectively based on the rmse the anfis de model is the most suitable for flood susceptibility zoning generally the models proposed this study can be considered as alternative techniques for the prediction of

5819,identification of thresholds associated with key climate catchment and morphological variables for hydrological droughts can further improve our understanding of evolution and propagation of droughts in a complex water resource system these thresholds are associated with complex interaction between climate and catchment variables and they are often connected through hierarchical as well as non linear relationships the advantage of selecting a multi factor predictor domain can detect multiple thresholds that may not be observed by analyses limited to single predictors in the present study we developed a conceptual modeling framework by integrating a hydrological model developed based on the soil and water assessment tool swat and statistical models to quantify the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables and their thresholds on hydrological drought duration and severity for the watersheds located in savannah river basin srb the concept of standardized runoff index sri was used to derive the multiscale hydrological drought time series i e sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 to investigate short term medium term and long term drought events based on their duration and severity it was observed that the linear models developed based on the climate variables may not be capable for predicting the duration of multiscale hydrological droughts whereas the performance of statistical models can be significantly improved by the addition of catchment and morphological variables in addition among the morphological variables stream order seems to have a significant control over short medium and long term drought duration across the study area in the second phase of our analysis we employed classification and regression tree cart algorithm for quantifying the thresholds associated with climate catchment and morphological variables that have potential influence on the hydrological drought the result indicates that the variables and its associated threshold vary for short medium and long term drought the proposed modeling framework can be extended for ungauged basins to improve the drought management keywords hydrological drought swat model decision tree threshold 1 introduction a prolonged drought has a significant impact on the socio economic environmental and ecological systems that affects millions of people around the world each year domeisen 1995 carlowicz 1996 wilhite 2000 mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 konapala and mishra 2020 drought has direct or indirect impact on multiple sectors wilhite et al 2007 such as economic loss wilhite 2000 mortality and conflicts garcía herrera et al 2010 hsiang et al 2013 ecology choat et al 2012 agriculture mishra et al 2015 and water resources planning and management rajsekhar et al 2015 mishra and singh 2011 drought affects water quantity lund and reed 1995 and quality van vliet and zwolsman 2008 of surface and groundwater systems mishra and singh 2010 due to the complex interaction between climate catchment and morphological processes the quantification of drought events initiation and termination are often challenging van loon and laaha 2015 veettil and mishra 2018 konapala and mishra 2017 2020 the drought events in the future are anticipated to increase in the continental united states due to the climate change sheffield et al 2012 for instance in 2002 more than 50 of the north american continent witnessed moderate to severe drought lawrimore and stephens 2003 cook et al 2007 the drought severity in the last decades increased not only in the west but also in the southeastern part of the usa clark et al 2016 for example the southeast united states experienced significant drought during 1965 to 1971 1980 to 1982 1985 to 1988 1998 to 2002 weaver 2005 and 2006 to 2009 veettil and mishra 2016 a number of drought indices are used for quantifying different types of drought mishra and singh 2010 such as palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 and standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 in this study we applied the concept of standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 for quantifying the hydrological drought for the watersheds located in savannah river basin hydrological drought has direct impact on multiple stakeholders such as irrigation electricity generation and recreation purpose within a river basin van vliet et al 2012 mishra and singh 2010 therefore better understanding of hydrological drought can be more meaningful for surface and groundwater water resources management hydrological drought occurs when the surface flow river flow and lakes or reservoirs levels decline below long term mean mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 it can be also termed as streamflow drought clausen and pearson 1995 hydrological drought assessment at a catchment scale is often difficult due to limited observed data sets moreover from a water resources management point of view the duration and severity analysis of a hydrological drought is essential the information on duration of hydrological drought is predominantly crucial for lives in an aquatic ecosystem humphries and baldwin 2003 and quantifying the drought severity is more important for abstraction of water from a stream for different purposes e g hydropower production mining and domestic use similar to the other categories of drought the anomalies in atmospheric processes initiates the hydrologic drought the propagation of hydrological drought is not only related to the climate characteristics but it is also influenced by the catchment properties peters et al 2006 tallaksen et al 2009 mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 konapala and mishra 2020 wanders et al 2010 and morphology of stream network bond et al 2008 for instance a decrease in soil moisture storage in a catchment causes depletion in the amount of water contributed to the aquifer system which further causes gradual drying of ground water discharge base flow and tapering of stream flow huntington and niswonger 2012 leading to hydrological drought additional catchment characteristics such as land use type e g forest area grass land and agriculture catchment elevation and soil type also influence initiation of hydrological drought there are few studies that investigated the combined influence of climate and catchment variables on hydrological droughts e g van loon and laaha 2015 konapala and mishra 2020 although the definition of hydrological drought is straightforward the challenge remains to understand the process that triggers these drought events van loon 2015 konapala and mishra 2020 therefore it is important to identify key variables and associated thresholds that controls these hydrological droughts the quantification of thresholds can result from complex interaction between climate and catchment variables and they are often connected through hierarchical as well as non linear relationships the identification of thresholds from a set of multi factor predictor domains can detect multiple thresholds that may not be observed by analyses limited to single predictors the specific objectives of this study are a to investigate the influence of either individually or combined climate catchment and morphological variables responsible for triggering hydrological drought in savannah river basin and b to identify the threshold limits for the climate catchment and morphological variables that triggers the hydrological drought using the concept of decision tree the identification of threshold limit can provide useful information for decision makers to identify appropriate variables that can trigger the short medium and long term hydrological drought 2 study

analysis is performed based on the p value and t test which is an inbuilt option in the swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 sufi2 algorithm can narrow down the range of uncertainty by identifying a range of parameters that reduce overall uncertainty in the developed model and model output i e streamflow is quantified by 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu calculated at 2 5 and 97 5 the goodness of fit criteria utilized to analyze the swat model performance are coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliff 1970 r and p factor the overall time period used for evaluating the swat model performance is 1990 2013 the first three years i e 1990 1992 were used as warm up period to initialize important model process and related variables and subsequently this time period is excluded from the analysis finally the model was simulated and evaluated against the observed usgs stream flow data available from 1993 to 2013 we divided the stream flow dataset in to two periods for calibration 1993 2005 and for validation 2006 2013 the model performance and calibrated parameters are explained in section 4 1 3 2 standardized runoff index sri the sri shukla and wood 2008 is based on the concept of standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 in this study sri was used to quantifying the hydrological drought characteristics e g duration and severity for 104 watersheds located in savannah river basin the following steps were used for deriving the sri a the monthly time series of stream flow data was extracted for 104 watersheds located in srb using the well calibrated swat model b these long term streamflow record is fitted to a suitable probability distribution in our study we identified gamma distribution as the best model based on the chi square goodnessof fittest the gamma distribution can be a reasonable descriptor of the monthly flow series compared to other distributions sharma and panu 2014 c once the probability density function is determined the cumulative probability of the streamflow time series at different time scale is computed and d the inverse normal gaussian function with mean zero and variance one is then applied to the cumulative probability distribution function which results in the sri table 1 in this study we selected a threshold of sri 1 to identify moderate to higher drought events for our analysis based on this concept we calculated the drought duration and severity of hydrological drought for each 104 watersheds using theory of runs mishra and singh 2010 subsequently the sri analysis is performed for three time scales to represent short term drought accumulation period of 1 month sri 1 medium term drought accumulation period of 6 months sri 6 and long term drought accumulation period of 12 months sri 12 the average drought duration and severity are calculated with respect to the total number of drought events occurred for each watersheds of srb using a time period 1993 to 2013 3 3 analysis of climate catchment and morphological variables we investigated the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables table 2 on hydrological drought duration and severity by using linear and non linear statistical analysis in the first part of our investigation we applied bivariate correlation analysis for exploring the strength of linear relationship between the drought characteristics and individual climate catchment and morphological variables subsequently we applied multi linear regression analysis and backward stepwise selection method to a group of variables and the non linear cart classification and regression tree approach for quantifying the threshold of each of the selected variables for predicting the hydrological drought duration and severity an overview of these methodologies are discussed in the following section 3 3 1 variables selection in the first phase of our investigation the bivariate correlation analysis was applied to explore the strength of relationship between the drought characteristics and individual climate catchment and morphological variables it is possible that the collinearity may exist between different variables used in the study therefore we generated the correlation matrix of pairwise combinations of all variables based on the pearson correlation coefficient the correlation matrix allowed us to identify the interdependence among the climate catchment and morphological variables initially the linear regression analysis was performed based on individual climate catchment and morphological variables for investigating their role in drought severity and duration then we applied the backward stepwise selection method to select a subset of variables from climate catchment and morphological variable space these selected variables can be considered as key variables for influencing the hydrological drought in the srb subsequently the best model from backward stepwise selection method is selected by using akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 3 3 2 classification and regression trees cart the cart models were developed to identify the threshold associated between climate catchment and morphological variables and hydrological drought we developed classification and regression tree using a recursive partitioning algorithm which classifies the space defined by the input variables e g climate catchment and morphological variables based on the output variables e g drought characteristics the cart is an effective representation of stepwise decision making process of a complex system solomatine 2002 by stratifying the predictor space to a number of simple regions based on the output variable breiman et al 1984 james et al 2013 deshmukh and singh 2016 in addition the method is simple to use and easy to interpret and it can be considered as one of the most appropriate approach among supervised learning techniques james et al 2013 overall the set of splitting rules divide the predictor space into various classes is represented as a tree therefore these types of approaches are known as decision or classification tree methods in this tree like structure the nodes contain the conditions or threshold of the variables that control the hydrological drought across the watersheds whereas the leaves represent the magnitude of hydrological drought duration and severity the following steps are used to develop the decision tree model for quantifying the thresholds associated with climate catchment and morphological variables i the response and predictor variables are first selected for individual watersheds located in srb where the response variables are drought characteristics i e drought duration and severity and predictor variables are climate catchment and morphological variables of particular watersheds ii divide the predictor space that is the set of predictor variables x1 x2 xp into j discrete and non intersecting regions such as r1 r2 rj and iii for every variables that fall into the region rj the tree makes the same prediction which is the mean of the drought characteristic values in the region rj the purpose of dividing predictor space into different regions r1 r2 rj is to minimize the residual sum of squares rss given by 1 rs s min j 1 j i r j y i y r j 2 where y r j is the mean response of the response variable drought characteristics within the jth region generally by considering every possible partition of predictor feature space into distinct regions is computationally challenging therefore decision tree algorithm utilize recursive binary splitting which is based on a top down approach by successively splitting the predictor space represented by two new branches further down on the tree in order to perform the recursive binary splitting we first selected the predictor xj and the threshold s eqs 2 and 3 so that by splitting the predictor space can lead to maximum reduction in rss which is given by eq 4 2 r 1 j s x x j s 3 r 2 j s x x j s 4 i x i r 1 j s y i y r 1 i x i r 2 j s y i y r 2 the final selection of predictor variable and associated threshold is based on the lowest rss for the resulting tree the output of the tree divides data into a number of classes or series of nodes and each node represents the ranges of hydrological drought duration severity in the form of a boxplot the final tree provides the threshold and significance p value value of each variable that has a potential influence on the hydrological drought in the srb 4 results 4 1 swat model performance evaluation the sufi2 algorithm was applied for performing the parameterization and sensitivity analysis of swat model the swat model is calibrated and validated at the 6 gauging stations located in the upper central and lower portion of the srb overall 17 parameters were calibrated for simulating the stream flow and most sensitive parameters are identified based on p value and t test provided in the global sensitivity analysis i e inbuilt option in the swat cup a list of 10 most sensitive parameters are provided in table 3 the goodness of fit statistics r2 nse p factor and r factor between swat based flow and observed flow for four hydrologic stations located in the srb is provided in the table 4 the time series plot between swat simulated flow and observed flow at usgs stream gaging stations 02192000 and 021985000 are shown in fig 3 a detailed explanation on model parameterization and sensitivity analysis is provided in veettil and mishra 2016 4 2 overview of multiscale hydrological droughts in the savannah river basin in the present study the swat model was used to generate streamflow and further sri time series for 104 watersheds located in the srb subsequently the multiscale hydrological drought time series were derived based on sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 based on the streamflow accumulation periods of 1 month 6 months and 12 months respectively the boxplot and spatial distribution of average drought duration and severity of short medium and long term droughts based on sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 for the watersheds located in the srb are shown in fig 4 the average duration of short term drought based on the sri 1 varies between 3 and 23 months for medium term drought based on the sri 6 it varies between 14 and 54 months and for the long term drought the average duration varies between 28 and 89 months derived based on sri 12 it can be clearly observed that the average duration of drought event increases as the temporal scale of sri increased this analysis suggests that the sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 can be used to classify drought duration in to short medium and long term events it was observed that the distribution of average drought duration and severity varies among watersheds for short medium and long term drought in the case of average drought severity short term drought showed a median of 10 fig 4a the average drought severity for short term drought is relatively less in the upper watersheds of srb whereas the maximum severity was observed in the central watershed located farther from the mainstream network the boxplot of average drought duration for sri 1 showed a median of 10 months in the srb similar to the drought severity the average duration of short term drought is comparatively less in the upper part of the srb where the duration of drought events varies from 2 to 9 months fig 4a however for the watersheds located in the lower part of the basin exhibited drought duration up to 23 months for sri 1 drought it was also observed that the short term drought duration and its severity is comparatively less in the most of the watersheds located near to the main stream network on the other hand the watersheds located farther from the mainstream network exhibited higher values of short term drought duration and severity the boxplot of average drought severity for sri 6 is shown in fig 4a which indicates a median value of 32 for srb fig 4a the spatial distribution of average drought duration for sri 6 drought also showed a similar pattern of average drought severity similar to the short term drought the watersheds located in the upper part of the srb exhibits lower values of medium term drought duration and severity whereas drought duration and severity increases towards lower parts of srb most of the watersheds located in the central part of the basin witness higher duration of droughts that varies between 34 and 54 months and severity values between 35 and 47 it was also observed that the percentage of area affected by medium term drought across the watersheds of srb was comparatively higher than short term and long term drought in the case of long term droughts the boxplot of average drought duration and severity showed a median of 37 months and 42 respectively the spatial distribution of average drought duration for sri 12 varies between 28 and 89 months over the srb whereas the severity ranges from 24 to 97 it was observed that the number of watersheds with higher drought duration is less in the srb unlike the medium term drought higher values of long term drought were distributed over the watersheds located in georgia state overall the spatial pattern of short medium and long term drought duration and severity obtained from different sri time series varies within the srb fig 5 illustrates the correlation between average hydrological drought duration and severity derived from these three sri time series for watersheds located in srb it was observed that both drought characteristics are correlated to each other however the correlation strength changes as the timescale of sri time series increases for example stronger linear correlation was observed for sri 1 correlation coefficient 0 91 and it is reduced for sri 6 correlation coefficient 0 82 which further dramatically reduced for sri 12 the scattered plot for sri 12 appeared in two distinct clusters located in lower and higher ends it was observed that the correlation strength between drought severity and duration share a linear relationship for low sri time scales e g sri 1 and sri 6 however at higher time scales e g sri 12 the correlation strength likely to change from linear to non linear relationship this non linear relationship may be attributed to the complex non linear interaction between climate and catchment characteristics including potential role of base flow depending upon the surface water and groundwater interactions this highlights the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables can be different for multiscale hydrological drought duration and severity 4 3 spatial pattern of key climate catchment and morphological variables the difference in spatial patterns of short medium and long term hydrological droughts are likely to be associated with the difference in spatial distribution of climate catchment and morphological variables of a river basin therefore it is important to investigate the spatial distribution of key variables which are strongly correlated with short medium and long term drought across the watersheds of srb the boxplot of important climate catchment and morphological variables across the srb is illustrated in fig 6 in the case of climate variable the magnitude of mean annual precipitation varies between 1045 mm and 2293 mm with a median of 1200 mm the spatial pattern of mean annual precipitation during the period of 1993 2013 over the srb is provided in fig 7 a it was observed that the higher magnitude of annual precipitation is distributed over the upper watersheds of the srb the spatial distribution of rainfall plays an important role on hydrological drought tran et al 2015 beyene et al 2014 van lanen et al 2013 as the deficit in rainfall triggers meteorological drought and further it leads to hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 the higher magnitude of rainfall can be a possible reason for the lower duration of hydrological drought for the watersheds located in the upper part of srb the boxplot of average seasonal precipitation during the spring summer and fall season shows a median of 400 mm 319 mm and 481 mm respectively the spatial pattern of mean precipitation during spring pcp spn summer pcp sum and fall pcp fal season for the srb is shown in fig 7 the pcp spn varies between 308 mm and 750 mm across the watersheds whereas the pcp fal varies between from 300 mm to 975 mm and the pcp sum varies between 280 mm and 595 mm it was observed that during summer season the precipitation is comparatively higher across the watersheds located in lower srb the boxplot of important catchment variables such as base flow index bfi pastureland wetland forestland catchment area and elevation is illustrated in fig 6b and c the spatial distribution of the catchment variable bfi varies between 0 15 and 0 41 for the watersheds located in the srb fig 7e the bfi is a measure of slow and continuous contribution of ground water to the streamflow smakhtin 2001 and in most of the dry season the entire stream flow is contributed by the base flow the bfi has a strong role in controlling the storage capacity and response time of a catchment and it is also a good indicator of the geological characteristics of a catchment bloomfield et al 2009 hidsal et al 2004 smakhtin 2001 here the bfi is derived based on automated base flow separation and recession analysis techniques developed by arnold et al 1995 which utilize a digital filter based automated base flow separation technique which is capable to produce the results similar to the graphical separation technique the boxplot of catchment variables related to the land use classes such as pastureland wetland and forestland are shown in fig 6b the range of these catchment variables are expressed as the ratio between the areas of land use class in a catchment to the total area of the catchment the pastureland wetland forestland ranges from 0 to 0 35 0 to 0 62 and 0 02 to 0 92 respectively across the watersheds of srb the land use plays an important role in controlling the hydrological drought in a watershed for instance the pastureland increases the amount of evapotranspiration and reduce the water yield capacity zhang et al 2016 therefore a larger area of pastureland may lead the catchment to hydrological drought fig 6d illustrates the boxplot of morphological variables such as form factor ff circulatory ratio cr and elongation ratio the morphological variable stream order s order varies between one and four for the watersheds located in the srb fig 7f and it was also observed that the watersheds located close to the main river network exhibit higher values of s order hakala and hartman 2004 4 4 potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables in this section we investigated the potential influence of selected climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought by using linear regression and backward stepwise selection method since multicollinearity exists between different climate catchment and morphological variables used in the study we generated the correlation matrix of pairwise combinations of important variables based on the pearson correlation coefficient fig 8 the variables related to altitude such as maximum elevation maxelev minimum elevation minelev and average elevation elev are strongly correlated across the watersheds of srb therefore we selected elev for further analysis the candidate variables were selected based on their least collinearity nature with other variables as well as the higher pearson correlation with hydrological drought durations for the watersheds of srb the above steps are illustrated with following example the pearson correlation coefficient between the elevation and forestland based on 104 watersheds located in the srb is 0 7 however the correlation strength between elevation and short term hydrological drought duration is higher in comparison to forestland therefore watershed elevations were selected for the analysis the linear and non linear relationship between the candidate variables and the hydrological drought duration for short and medium term drought are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the climate variables including a pcp pcp fal and pcp spn and morphological variable s order showed a negative correlation with average drought duration whereas catchment variables such as bfi pastureland and wetland showed a positive correlation with average drought duration for sri 1 and sri 6 drought duration subsequently we investigated the potential influence of selected climate catchment and morphological variables separately on average drought duration for sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 drought by applying linear regression these individual models are named as the climate catchment and morphological models tables 5 7 finally we analyzed the relative impact of climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought duration by applying backward stepwise selection method this integrated model is named as combined model table 8 4 4 1 potential influence on short term drought several studies have been carried out to investigate the significant role of climate variables in hydrological drought propagation over a river basin wang et al 2015 sheffield et al 2012 the present study also indicated that the precipitation and evapotranspiration plays an important role in controlling the short term drought duration in the srb table 5 in case of climate model mean annual precipitation a pcp showed comparatively higher significance p value in controlling the hydrological drought duration therefore below normal average precipitation in the srb may lead the watersheds to a short term drought the mean annual evapotranspiration a et also exhibited a considerable significance in the climate model table 5 this situation will further direct to an additional loss of water stored in the soil layer water bodies and lead the region to hydrological drought therefore a combination of lower precipitation with higher evapotranspiration may increase the possibility of short term drought over the watersheds of srb here the climate model for predicting the duration of short term drought produced a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 12 which indicates that the short term drought cannot be predicted appropriately based on only climate variables whereas the catchment model exhibited a r2 value of 0 49 for predicting the short term drought duration over the watersheds table 6 the baseflow index bfi is identified as the most significant catchment variable p value 5 03e 07 for predicting the average duration of short term drought in this study the bfi showed a positive correlation with the short term drought duration which is similar to van loon and laaha 2015 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 barker et al 2015 the bfi has a strong role in controlling the base flow which plays an important role for hydrological drought moreover the contribution of base flow for a long term denotes higher duration of drought in the watersheds this may be a possible reason for the positive correlation of bfi with the short term drought for the srb therefore knowledge of base flow is crucial for developing catchment management strategies such as water quality management reservoir management particularly during the drought period smakhtin 2001 the stream width has a significant influence on the short term drought p value 1 63e 07 with a negative correlation which indicates that decrease in width of stream network may lead to longer duration of short term drought the land use types such as wetland and pastureland also has a major role on short term drought where the wetland exhibited a positive correlation with hydrological drought duration which indicates that the catchments with a larger area of wetland is more susceptible to hydrological drought similarly pastureland also witnessed a positive correlation with short term drought duration for the watersheds of srb this may be due to increase in the evapotranspiration and decreases in the water yield zhang et al 2016 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 due to pasturelands the loss of water through evapotranspiration may reduce the streamflow contribution from agricultural pastureland and finally lead to hydrological drought over the basin bagley et al 2014 similar to the climate model the morphological model also showed a lower value of coefficient of determination 0 18 for predicting the average duration for sri 1 drought table 7 the significant morphological variables influencing the short term drought duration are stream order and relief ratio both the variables exhibited a negative correlation with the short term drought it was observed that most of the watersheds with first or second order streams are considerably influenced by the hydrological drought and similar findings are highlighted in previous studies cowx et al 1984 hakala and hartman 2004 the maximum s order in the srb is four fig 5c and the higher order streams are observed near to the mainstream network this can be a possible reason for distribution of longer duration drought events towards the watersheds located away from the mainstream network although the climate model and morphological models were less accurate in predicting the hydrological drought over the srb the catchment model was able to predict the hydrological drought duration with reasonable accuracy in the following section we investigated the combined influence of climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought the backward stepwise selection is performed to investigate the combined influence of climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought duration the proposed backward stepwise selection model was evaluated based on the akaike information criterion aic overall a combination of 8 climate catchment and morphological variables are selected table 8 it was observed that the combination of catchment and morphological variables with the climate variables significantly improved the prediction of hydrological drought duration r2 0 58 across the watersheds of srb among all the variables a pcp bfi and s order seems to be the most significant climate catchment and morphological variables which influence the drought duration for sri 1 in the srb 4 4 2 potential influence on medium and long term drought in this section potential influence of control of climate catchment and morphological variables on medium and long term drought duration are discussed it was observed that summer precipitation pcp sum plays an important role in controlling the drought duration for sri 6 in the srb the catchment variables such as elevation catchment area pastureland and wetland are highly significant in controlling the medium term drought table 6 where the pastureland p value 9 74e 06 and elevation p value 1 57e 06 are identified as the most significant catchment variables similar to the short term drought the catchment model for medium term drought also exhibited a higher r2 0 49 value however in the case of morphological model unlike the short term drought circularity ratio cr and relief ratio rr are identified as the most significant morphological variables influencing the medium term drought duration and the morphological model was able to predict 14 r2 0 14 variability in hydrological drought duration the combined model selected six variables from the combination of climate catchment and morphological variables table 8 which influence the average drought duration for sri 6 in the srb the combined model showed a coefficient of determination of 0 51 indicating that the model performance significantly improved through the addition of catchment and morphological variables with the climate variables the result from the combined model showed that the pcp spn is the most important climate variable responsible for medium term drought over srb the percentage of pastureland is identified as the most significant variable pertaining to medium term drought and s order seems to be the only morphological variable that has potential influence on the hydrological drought duration for sri 6 the proposed climate model for long term drought suggests that the mean summer precipitation pcp sum is the only variable that has a potential influence on the long term drought table 5 in the srb the catchment and morphological models selected stream width and stream order as significant variables tables 6 and 7 the combined model also selected the same variables stream width and stream order based on the backward stepwise selection method table 8 however the combined model was merely able to predict 12 variation in hydrological drought duration for sri 12 overall it was observed that the linear models formed through the combination of climate catchment and morphological variables are capable for predicting the duration for short and medium term drought nevertheless long term drought duration showed comparatively less correlation with the variables considered in the study in the following section we performed cart for identifying the threshold of each variable for controlling the hydrological drought duration over the srb 4 5 identification of critical threshold the most influential climate catchment and morphological variables are selected using backward stepwise selection process then we applied the concept of classification and regression tree cart to identify the critical threshold associated with the selected variables using the cart approach we generated three separate decision trees for short medium and long term drought to identify the threshold associated with the variables the model output of cart analysis by relating selected climate catchment and morphological variables and short term drought duration is shown in fig 11 the figure summaries the process of estimating the threshold of variables and the range of response drought duration with respect to each threshold here the range of output drought duration for sri 1 is represented in the form of a box plot the decision tree approach identified bfi s order and a pcp are the significant variables which control the drought duration for sri 1 over the watersheds of srb among them bfi was the most significant variable therefore the first split in the decision tree was based on bfi node 1 and the corresponding threshold is 0 344 for instance when the bfi of the watersheds is less than or equal to 0 344 0 344 the growth of tree is towards the left fig 11 whereas if the value of bfi is greater than 0 344 the tree is advancing to the right side here p 0 001 represents the significance of the correlation between the split based on bfi and the average drought duration for sri 1 the second split node 2 of the decision tree is based on the morphological variable stream order which indicates that stream order is the second most significant variable controlling the short term drought across srb the threshold value of stream order was one for instance if a watershed has a stream order greater than one and the bfi is less than 0 344 the short term drought duration in that particular catchment will vary from 4 months to 8 months fig 11 whereas if the stream order is less than or equal to one the growth of the tree is towards left side the third split in the decision tree node 3 was based on the mean annual precipitation a pcp overall the critical threshold of bfi s order and a pcp are identified and it can be explained as follows in determining the duration of short term drought if the bfi is 0 344 s order is 1 and a pcp is 1308 44 mm then the duration of short term hydrological drought likes to be 12 months based on median 50th percentile solid line within the boxplot and it can vary from 6 months to 22 months when the a pcp is more than 1308 44 mm the average duration of sri drought will range from 2 to 4 5 months the right branch of the node 2 elucidates that when the s order is greater than one and bfi is less than or equal to 0 344 the watersheds in srb will experience a short term drought duration of 6 months median the average annual precipitation in the srb is 1240 mm per year and the threshold associated with annual precipitation is 1308 mm based on the right side branch of the first partition the bfi greater than 0 344 resulted to a drought duration of 15 months for sri 1 however bfi has a positive correlation with the short term drought therefore a minimum value of bfi likely to reduce the short term drought duration in the watersheds the average bfi of srb watersheds is observed as 0 317 which is less than the critical threshold of bfi the results from linear regression analysis identified that s order is negatively correlated with drought duration the decision tree output illustrates that if the s order is greater than one the duration of sri 1 drought reduces to 6 months and about 50 of the watersheds located in srb has s order greater than one fig 12 illustrates the decision tree of average drought duration for sri 6 and it was identified that the variables such as pastureland pcp spn catchment area wetland and s order are significant for predicting the medium term drought duration across the watersheds of srb therefore the final tree consists of multiple nodes as well as thresholds associated with these variables pastureland showed maximum significance and the first split of the tree is based on this variable with a threshold of 0 12 12 the linear analysis indicated that pastureland has a positive correlation with the medium term drought duration in the savannah river basin 73 of the catchments have pastureland of less than 12 and a minimum duration for medium term drought was observed in the catchments where the pastureland is less than 12 and pcp spn is higher than 455 mm this indicates that in those catchments the storage plays an important role in reducing the drought duration because of less evapotranspiration from pastureland and higher precipitation during the spring season on the other hand that the longer drought duration is more prevalent in watersheds with pastureland more than 12 and s order one catchment area and wetland also influence medium term drought with a threshold of 209 km2 and 3 respectively overall the catchment variables seems to have a significant control on the drought duration for sri 6 over the srb finally the decision tree algorithm was applied to the drought duration for sri 12 fig 13 unlike the linear regression approach the decision tree approach could not identify a significant climate variable that influence long term drought it was observed that s order morphological variable and width of channels catchment variable are the important variables which has potential control on the duration of long term drought 5 discussion and concluding remarks in this study a combination of hydrological and statistical models are utilized to quantify the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables and its associated threshold on short medium and long term hydrological drought in the proposed model framework the streamflow pattern over the savannah river basin is simulated based on a well calibrated swat model sohoulande djebou 2019 and the hydrological drought is quantified by applying the concept of standardized runoff index the swat model was selected as it can integrate different climate and catchment characteristics e g topography soil type land use to generate runoff at a higher spatial resolution lin et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 for instance the surface runoff over each hru is estimated based on the modified curve number cn method with daily precipitation data based on soil hydrologic group vegetation type and land management practices this method will produce an accurate representation of hydrology processes in each spatial unit in addition swat model was previously applied to quantify the potential influence of land use change and climate variability on the hydrological fluxes of savannah river basin veettil and mishra 2018 the swat model is calibrated using the monthly discharge data from 1993 2005 and validated for 2006 2013 and the goodness of fit statistics showed an acceptable agreement between observed i e usgs flow and swat simulated flow following the model simulation short medium and long term drought for each catchment was quantified based on the standardized runoff index shukla and wood 2008 the statistical modeling framework incorporates a set of climate catchment and morphological variables to predict the hydrological drought for the watersheds located in savannah river basin the results indicate that the catchment variables has higher influence to trigger the hydrological drought over the savannah river basin compared to climate and morphological variables in addition the combination of these variables can improve the prediction accuracy of short and medium term drought in the savannah river basin moreover the study can be also be extended for an ungauged basin where the availability of hydrological data is insufficient however the dominant factors in determining hydrological drought characteristics is highly dependent on scale for example on a global scale drought duration might be more related to climate compared to catchment variables whereas at a regional river basin scale catchment or morphological variables may have more influence on the hydrological drought overall the proposed modeling framework is useful for identifying the key role of climate catchment and morphological variables on the hydrological drought across the watersheds of savannah river basin the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a the linear models developed based only on climate variables may not be reliable for predicting the hydrological drought duration in the savannah river basin whereas the performance of linear models can be improved by the addition of catchment and morphological variables for example in the case of short term drought the performance of the model based on r2 increased from 0 12 to 0 58 by including the catchment and morphological variables along with the climate variables b the climate catchment and morphological variables which has significant influence on the short term drought includes precipitation base flow index and stream order respectively in the combined model the stream order and baseflow index exhibited higher influence on the short term drought c the catchment variables such as pastureland wetland catchment area and elevation showed significant influence on the average duration of medium term drought which is derived based on sri 6 the catchment model was able to predict 47 variability in the average hydrological drought duration for sri 6 whereas the combined model improved the model performance to 51 the catchment variable pastureland has a potential influence in controlling the medium term drought it was also observed that the average precipitation during the spring season can be considered as a key variable that has potential influence on the average drought duration for sri 6 d the average precipitation during the summer showed a significant control on the long term drought duration which is derived based on sri 12 in the combined model the stream order and width of stream networks can have major influence on the long term drought duration e the morphological variable stream order is identified as the only variable which has significant influence over short medium and long term drought duration over the watersheds of savannah river basin which indicates the importance of including the morphological variables in predicting the hydrological drought in a river basin scale f the classification and regression tree algorithm was used for identifying thresholds associated with climate catchment and morphological variables the results indicate that the variables and associated thresholds influencing the hydrological drought varies for short medium and long term drought credit

droughts in a complex water resource system these thresholds are associated with complex interaction between climate and catchment variables and they are often connected through hierarchical as well as non linear relationships the advantage of selecting a multi factor predictor domain can detect multiple thresholds that may not be observed by analyses limited to single predictors in the present study we developed a conceptual modeling framework by integrating a hydrological model developed based on the soil and water assessment tool swat and statistical models to quantify the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables and their thresholds on hydrological drought duration and severity for the watersheds located in savannah river basin srb the concept of standardized runoff index sri was used to derive the multiscale hydrological drought time series i e sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 to investigate short term medium term and long term drought events based on their duration and severity it was observed that the linear models developed based on the climate variables may not be capable for predicting the duration of multiscale hydrological droughts whereas the performance of statistical models can be significantly improved by the addition of catchment and morphological variables in addition among the morphological variables stream order seems to have a significant control over short medium and long term drought duration across the study area in the second phase of our analysis we employed classification and regression tree cart algorithm for quantifying the thresholds associated with climate catchment and morphological variables that have potential influence on the hydrological drought the result indicates that the variables and its associated threshold vary for short medium and long term drought the proposed modeling framework can be extended for ungauged basins to improve the drought management keywords hydrological drought

world each year domeisen 1995 carlowicz 1996 wilhite 2000 mishra and singh 2010 dai 2011 konapala and mishra 2020 drought has direct or indirect impact on multiple sectors wilhite et al 2007 such as economic loss wilhite 2000 mortality and conflicts garcía herrera et al 2010 hsiang et al 2013 ecology choat et al 2012 agriculture mishra et al 2015 and water resources planning and management rajsekhar et al 2015 mishra and singh 2011 drought affects water quantity lund and reed 1995 and quality van vliet and zwolsman 2008 of surface and groundwater systems mishra and singh 2010 due to the complex interaction between climate catchment and morphological processes the quantification of drought events initiation and termination are often challenging van loon and laaha 2015 veettil and mishra 2018 konapala and mishra 2017 2020 the drought events in the future are anticipated to increase in the continental united states due to the climate change sheffield et al 2012 for instance in 2002 more than 50 of the north american continent witnessed moderate to severe drought lawrimore and stephens 2003 cook et al 2007 the drought severity in the last decades increased not only in the west but also in the southeastern part of the usa clark et al 2016 for example the southeast united states experienced significant drought during 1965 to 1971 1980 to 1982 1985 to 1988 1998 to 2002 weaver 2005 and 2006 to 2009 veettil and mishra 2016 a number of drought indices are used for quantifying different types of drought mishra and singh 2010 such as palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 and standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 in this study we applied the concept of standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 for quantifying the hydrological drought for the watersheds located in savannah river basin hydrological drought has direct impact on multiple stakeholders such as irrigation electricity generation and recreation purpose within a river basin van vliet et al 2012 mishra and singh 2010 therefore better understanding of hydrological drought can be more meaningful for surface and groundwater water resources management hydrological drought occurs when the surface flow river flow and lakes or reservoirs levels decline below long term mean mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 it can be also termed as streamflow drought clausen and pearson 1995 hydrological drought assessment at a catchment scale is often difficult due to limited observed data sets moreover from a water resources management point of view the duration and severity analysis of a hydrological drought is essential the information on duration of hydrological drought is predominantly crucial for lives in an aquatic ecosystem humphries and baldwin 2003 and quantifying the drought severity is more important for abstraction of water from a stream for different purposes e g hydropower production mining and domestic use similar to the other categories of drought the anomalies in atmospheric processes initiates the hydrologic drought the propagation of hydrological drought is not only related to the climate characteristics but it is also influenced by the catchment properties peters et al 2006 tallaksen et al 2009 mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 konapala and mishra 2020 wanders et al 2010 and morphology of stream network bond et al 2008 for instance a decrease in soil moisture storage in a catchment causes depletion in the amount of water contributed to the aquifer system which further causes gradual drying of ground water discharge base flow and tapering of stream flow huntington and niswonger 2012 leading to hydrological drought additional catchment characteristics such as land use type e g forest area grass land and agriculture catchment elevation and soil type also influence initiation of hydrological drought there are few studies that investigated the combined influence of climate and catchment variables on hydrological droughts e g van loon and laaha 2015 konapala and mishra 2020 although the definition of hydrological drought is straightforward the challenge remains to understand the process that triggers these drought events van loon 2015 konapala and mishra 2020 therefore it is important to identify key variables and associated thresholds that controls these hydrological droughts the quantification of thresholds can result from complex interaction between climate and catchment variables and they are often connected through hierarchical as well as non linear relationships the identification of thresholds from a set of multi factor predictor domains can detect multiple thresholds that may not be observed by analyses limited to single predictors the specific objectives of this study are a to investigate the influence of either individually or combined climate catchment and morphological variables responsible for triggering hydrological drought in savannah river basin and b to identify the threshold limits for the climate catchment and morphological variables that triggers the hydrological drought using the concept of decision tree the identification of threshold limit can provide useful information for decision makers to identify appropriate variables that can trigger the short medium and long term hydrological drought 2 study

flow 3 methodology the modeling framework developed for quantifying the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables and associated thresholds on the hydrological drought duration severity for the watersheds of srb is shown in fig 2 the following sections elucidate the specific components incorporated in the modeling framework 3 1 hydrologic model the soil and water assessment tool swat developed by united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1995 neitsch et al 2004 was employed for simulating the hydrological fluxes of srb the swat is a process based semi distributed basin scale model arnold et al 1998 santhi et al 2001 and it operates based on the daily time series of meteorological input the swat model can be used for simulating evapotranspiration plant growth infiltration percolation runoff nutrient loads and erosion neitsch et al 2004 faramarzi et al 2009 from a small catchment scale to a continental scale chu et al 2004 giri et al 2014 the swat model has been tested in different sectors e g agricultural water management water scarcity and water quality management and discussed extensively in the literatures gassman et al 2007 more recently swat model has been applied for improving drought management wu and johnston 2007 zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2011 kamali et al 2015 bucak et al 2017 digital elevation models dems are the basic input data for developing the swat model the delineation of the watershed is performed based on the topographic data stored in the dem pixel cells fig 1b here we used dem prepared by national elevation dataset ned which has a resolution of 30 m in the swat model the delineated river basin is divided into sub basins and each sub basin is further divided into hydrologic response units hrus the hydrological response units are created based on unique land use soil and slope data provided to the model overall 1408 hrus are created over 104 sub basins located in srb surface runoff is estimated by soil conservation service curve number scs cn equation based on daily precipitation data and soil hydrologic group land use and land cover characteristics and antecedent soil moisture a detailed description of the swat model is provided by neitsch et al 2004 in the present study we used arcswat 2012 with arcgis interface esri version 10 2 2 the sufi2 optimization algorithm in the soil and water assessment tool calibration and uncertainty analysis program swat cup developed by abbaspour 2005 was utilized for calibrating the swat model parameters the parameter sensitivity analysis is performed based on the p value and t test which is an inbuilt option in the swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 sufi2 algorithm can narrow down the range of uncertainty by identifying a range of parameters that reduce overall uncertainty in the developed model and model output i e streamflow is quantified by 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu calculated at 2 5 and 97 5 the goodness of fit criteria utilized to analyze the swat model performance are coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliff 1970 r and p factor the overall time period used for evaluating the swat model performance is 1990 2013 the first three years i e 1990 1992 were used as warm up period to initialize important model process and related variables and subsequently this time period is excluded from the analysis finally the model was simulated and evaluated against the observed usgs stream flow data available from 1993 to 2013 we divided the stream flow dataset in to two periods for calibration 1993 2005 and for validation 2006 2013 the model performance and calibrated parameters are explained in section 4 1 3 2 standardized runoff index sri the sri shukla and wood 2008 is based on the concept of standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 in this study sri was used to quantifying the hydrological drought characteristics e g duration and severity for 104 watersheds located in savannah river basin the following steps were used for deriving the sri a the monthly time series of stream flow data was extracted for 104 watersheds located in srb using the well calibrated swat model b these long term streamflow record is fitted to a suitable probability distribution in our study we identified gamma distribution as the best model based on the chi square goodnessof fittest the gamma distribution can be a reasonable descriptor of the monthly flow series compared to other distributions sharma and panu 2014 c once the probability density function is determined the cumulative probability of the streamflow time series at different time scale is computed and d the inverse normal gaussian function with mean zero and variance one is then applied to the cumulative probability distribution function which results in the sri table 1 in this study we selected a threshold of sri 1 to identify moderate to higher drought events for our analysis based on this concept we calculated the drought duration and severity of hydrological drought for each 104 watersheds using theory of runs mishra and singh 2010 subsequently the sri analysis is performed for three time scales to represent short term drought accumulation period of 1 month sri 1 medium term drought accumulation period of 6 months sri 6 and long term drought accumulation period of 12 months sri 12 the average drought duration and severity are calculated with respect to the total number of drought events occurred for each watersheds of srb using a time period 1993 to 2013 3 3 analysis of climate catchment and morphological variables we investigated the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables table 2 on hydrological drought duration and severity by using linear and non linear statistical analysis in the first part of our investigation we applied bivariate correlation analysis for exploring the strength of linear relationship between the drought characteristics and individual climate catchment and morphological variables subsequently we applied multi linear regression analysis and backward stepwise selection method to a group of variables and the non linear cart classification and regression tree approach for quantifying the threshold of each of the selected variables for predicting the hydrological drought duration and severity an overview of these methodologies are discussed in the following section 3 3 1 variables selection in the first phase of our investigation the bivariate correlation analysis was applied to explore the strength of relationship between the drought characteristics and individual climate catchment and morphological variables it is possible that the collinearity may exist between different variables used in the study therefore we generated the correlation matrix of pairwise combinations of all variables based on the pearson correlation coefficient the correlation matrix allowed us to identify the interdependence among the climate catchment and morphological variables initially the linear regression analysis was performed based on individual climate catchment and morphological variables for investigating their role in drought severity and duration then we applied the backward stepwise selection method to select a subset of variables from climate catchment and morphological variable space these selected variables can be considered as key variables for influencing the hydrological drought in the srb subsequently the best model from backward stepwise selection method is selected by using akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 3 3 2 classification and regression trees cart the cart models were developed to identify the threshold associated between climate catchment and morphological variables and hydrological drought we developed classification and regression tree using a recursive partitioning algorithm which classifies the space defined by the input variables e g climate catchment and morphological variables based on the output variables e g drought characteristics the cart is an effective representation of stepwise decision making process of a complex system solomatine 2002 by stratifying the predictor space to a number of simple regions based on the output variable breiman et al 1984 james et al 2013 deshmukh and singh 2016 in addition the method is simple to use and easy to interpret and it can be considered as one of the most appropriate approach among supervised learning techniques james et al 2013 overall the set of splitting rules divide the predictor space into various classes is represented as a tree therefore these types of approaches are known as decision or classification tree methods in this tree like structure the nodes contain the conditions or threshold of the variables that control the hydrological drought across the watersheds whereas the leaves represent the magnitude of hydrological drought duration and severity the following steps are used to develop the decision tree model for quantifying the thresholds associated with climate catchment and morphological variables i the response and predictor variables are first selected for individual watersheds located in srb where the response variables are drought characteristics i e drought duration and severity and predictor variables are climate catchment and morphological variables of particular watersheds ii divide the predictor space that is the set of predictor variables x1 x2 xp into j discrete and non intersecting regions such as r1 r2 rj and iii for every variables that fall into the region rj the tree makes the same prediction which is the mean of the drought characteristic values in the region rj the purpose of dividing predictor space into different regions r1 r2 rj is to minimize the residual sum of squares rss given by 1 rs s min j 1 j i r j y i y r j 2 where y r j is the mean response of the response variable drought characteristics within the jth region generally by considering every possible partition of predictor feature space into distinct regions is computationally challenging therefore decision tree algorithm utilize recursive binary splitting which is based on a top down approach by successively splitting the predictor space represented by two new branches further down on the tree in order to perform the recursive binary splitting we first selected the predictor xj and the threshold s eqs 2 and 3 so that by splitting the predictor space can lead to maximum reduction in rss which is given by eq 4 2 r 1 j s x x j s 3 r 2 j s x x j s 4 i x i r 1 j s y i y r 1 i x i r 2 j s y i y r 2 the final selection of predictor variable and associated threshold is based on the lowest rss for the resulting tree the output of the tree divides data into a number of classes or series of nodes and each node represents the ranges of hydrological drought duration severity in the form of a boxplot the final tree provides the threshold and significance p value value of each variable that has a potential influence on the hydrological drought in the srb 4 results 4 1 swat model performance evaluation the sufi2 algorithm was applied for performing the parameterization and sensitivity analysis of swat model the swat model is calibrated and validated at the 6 gauging stations located in the upper central and lower portion of the srb overall 17 parameters were calibrated for simulating the stream flow and most sensitive parameters are identified based on p value and t test provided in the global sensitivity analysis i e inbuilt option in the swat cup a list of 10 most sensitive parameters are provided in table 3 the goodness of fit statistics r2 nse p factor and r factor between swat based flow and observed flow for four hydrologic stations located in the srb is provided in the table 4 the time series plot between swat simulated flow and observed flow at usgs stream gaging stations 02192000 and 021985000 are shown in fig 3 a detailed explanation on model parameterization and sensitivity analysis is provided in veettil and mishra 2016 4 2 overview of multiscale hydrological droughts in the savannah river basin in the present study the swat model was used to generate streamflow and further sri time series for 104 watersheds located in the srb subsequently the multiscale hydrological drought time series were derived based on sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 based on the streamflow accumulation periods of 1 month 6 months and 12 months respectively the boxplot and spatial distribution of average drought duration and severity of short medium and long term droughts based on sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 for the watersheds located in the srb are shown in fig 4 the average duration of short term drought based on the sri 1 varies between 3 and 23 months for medium term drought based on the sri 6 it varies between 14 and 54 months and for the long term drought the average duration varies between 28 and 89 months derived based on sri 12 it can be clearly observed that the average duration of drought event increases as the temporal scale of sri increased this analysis suggests that the sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 can be used to classify drought duration in to short medium and long term events it was observed that the distribution of average drought duration and severity varies among watersheds for short medium and long term drought in the case of average drought severity short term drought showed a median of 10 fig 4a the average drought severity for short term drought is relatively less in the upper watersheds of srb whereas the maximum severity was observed in the central watershed located farther from the mainstream network the boxplot of average drought duration for sri 1 showed a median of 10 months in the srb similar to the drought severity the average duration of short term drought is comparatively less in the upper part of the srb where the duration of drought events varies from 2 to 9 months fig 4a however for the watersheds located in the lower part of the basin exhibited drought duration up to 23 months for sri 1 drought it was also observed that the short term drought duration and its severity is comparatively less in the most of the watersheds located near to the main stream network on the other hand the watersheds located farther from the mainstream network exhibited higher values of short term drought duration and severity the boxplot of average drought severity for sri 6 is shown in fig 4a which indicates a median value of 32 for srb fig 4a the spatial distribution of average drought duration for sri 6 drought also showed a similar pattern of average drought severity similar to the short term drought the watersheds located in the upper part of the srb exhibits lower values of medium term drought duration and severity whereas drought duration and severity increases towards lower parts of srb most of the watersheds located in the central part of the basin witness higher duration of droughts that varies between 34 and 54 months and severity values between 35 and 47 it was also observed that the percentage of area affected by medium term drought across the watersheds of srb was comparatively higher than short term and long term drought in the case of long term droughts the boxplot of average drought duration and severity showed a median of 37 months and 42 respectively the spatial distribution of average drought duration for sri 12 varies between 28 and 89 months over the srb whereas the severity ranges from 24 to 97 it was observed that the number of watersheds with higher drought duration is less in the srb unlike the medium term drought higher values of long term drought were distributed over the watersheds located in georgia state overall the spatial pattern of short medium and long term drought duration and severity obtained from different sri time series varies within the srb fig 5 illustrates the correlation between average hydrological drought duration and severity derived from these three sri time series for watersheds located in srb it was observed that both drought characteristics are correlated to each other however the correlation strength changes as the timescale of sri time series increases for example stronger linear correlation was observed for sri 1 correlation coefficient 0 91 and it is reduced for sri 6 correlation coefficient 0 82 which further dramatically reduced for sri 12 the scattered plot for sri 12 appeared in two distinct clusters located in lower and higher ends it was observed that the correlation strength between drought severity and duration share a linear relationship for low sri time scales e g sri 1 and sri 6 however at higher time scales e g sri 12 the correlation strength likely to change from linear to non linear relationship this non linear relationship may be attributed to the complex non linear interaction between climate and catchment characteristics including potential role of base flow depending upon the surface water and groundwater interactions this highlights the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables can be different for multiscale hydrological drought duration and severity 4 3 spatial pattern of key climate catchment and morphological variables the difference in spatial patterns of short medium and long term hydrological droughts are likely to be associated with the difference in spatial distribution of climate catchment and morphological variables of a river basin therefore it is important to investigate the spatial distribution of key variables which are strongly correlated with short medium and long term drought across the watersheds of srb the boxplot of important climate catchment and morphological variables across the srb is illustrated in fig 6 in the case of climate variable the magnitude of mean annual precipitation varies between 1045 mm and 2293 mm with a median of 1200 mm the spatial pattern of mean annual precipitation during the period of 1993 2013 over the srb is provided in fig 7 a it was observed that the higher magnitude of annual precipitation is distributed over the upper watersheds of the srb the spatial distribution of rainfall plays an important role on hydrological drought tran et al 2015 beyene et al 2014 van lanen et al 2013 as the deficit in rainfall triggers meteorological drought and further it leads to hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 the higher magnitude of rainfall can be a possible reason for the lower duration of hydrological drought for the watersheds located in the upper part of srb the boxplot of average seasonal precipitation during the spring summer and fall season shows a median of 400 mm 319 mm and 481 mm respectively the spatial pattern of mean precipitation during spring pcp spn summer pcp sum and fall pcp fal season for the srb is shown in fig 7 the pcp spn varies between 308 mm and 750 mm across the watersheds whereas the pcp fal varies between from 300 mm to 975 mm and the pcp sum varies between 280 mm and 595 mm it was observed that during summer season the precipitation is comparatively higher across the watersheds located in lower srb the boxplot of important catchment variables such as base flow index bfi pastureland wetland forestland catchment area and elevation is illustrated in fig 6b and c the spatial distribution of the catchment variable bfi varies between 0 15 and 0 41 for the watersheds located in the srb fig 7e the bfi is a measure of slow and continuous contribution of ground water to the streamflow smakhtin 2001 and in most of the dry season the entire stream flow is contributed by the base flow the bfi has a strong role in controlling the storage capacity and response time of a catchment and it is also a good indicator of the geological characteristics of a catchment bloomfield et al 2009 hidsal et al 2004 smakhtin 2001 here the bfi is derived based on automated base flow separation and recession analysis techniques developed by arnold et al 1995 which utilize a digital filter based automated base flow separation technique which is capable to produce the results similar to the graphical separation technique the boxplot of catchment variables related to the land use classes such as pastureland wetland and forestland are shown in fig 6b the range of these catchment variables are expressed as the ratio between the areas of land use class in a catchment to the total area of the catchment the pastureland wetland forestland ranges from 0 to 0 35 0 to 0 62 and 0 02 to 0 92 respectively across the watersheds of srb the land use plays an important role in controlling the hydrological drought in a watershed for instance the pastureland increases the amount of evapotranspiration and reduce the water yield capacity zhang et al 2016 therefore a larger area of pastureland may lead the catchment to hydrological drought fig 6d illustrates the boxplot of morphological variables such as form factor ff circulatory ratio cr and elongation ratio the morphological variable stream order s order varies between one and four for the watersheds located in the srb fig 7f and it was also observed that the watersheds located close to the main river network exhibit higher values of s order hakala and hartman 2004 4 4 potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables in this section we investigated the potential influence of selected climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought by using linear regression and backward stepwise selection method since multicollinearity exists between different climate catchment and morphological variables used in the study we generated the correlation matrix of pairwise combinations of important variables based on the pearson correlation coefficient fig 8 the variables related to altitude such as maximum elevation maxelev minimum elevation minelev and average elevation elev are strongly correlated across the watersheds of srb therefore we selected elev for further analysis the candidate variables were selected based on their least collinearity nature with other variables as well as the higher pearson correlation with hydrological drought durations for the watersheds of srb the above steps are illustrated with following example the pearson correlation coefficient between the elevation and forestland based on 104 watersheds located in the srb is 0 7 however the correlation strength between elevation and short term hydrological drought duration is higher in comparison to forestland therefore watershed elevations were selected for the analysis the linear and non linear relationship between the candidate variables and the hydrological drought duration for short and medium term drought are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the climate variables including a pcp pcp fal and pcp spn and morphological variable s order showed a negative correlation with average drought duration whereas catchment variables such as bfi pastureland and wetland showed a positive correlation with average drought duration for sri 1 and sri 6 drought duration subsequently we investigated the potential influence of selected climate catchment and morphological variables separately on average drought duration for sri 1 sri 6 and sri 12 drought by applying linear regression these individual models are named as the climate catchment and morphological models tables 5 7 finally we analyzed the relative impact of climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought duration by applying backward stepwise selection method this integrated model is named as combined model table 8 4 4 1 potential influence on short term drought several studies have been carried out to investigate the significant role of climate variables in hydrological drought propagation over a river basin wang et al 2015 sheffield et al 2012 the present study also indicated that the precipitation and evapotranspiration plays an important role in controlling the short term drought duration in the srb table 5 in case of climate model mean annual precipitation a pcp showed comparatively higher significance p value in controlling the hydrological drought duration therefore below normal average precipitation in the srb may lead the watersheds to a short term drought the mean annual evapotranspiration a et also exhibited a considerable significance in the climate model table 5 this situation will further direct to an additional loss of water stored in the soil layer water bodies and lead the region to hydrological drought therefore a combination of lower precipitation with higher evapotranspiration may increase the possibility of short term drought over the watersheds of srb here the climate model for predicting the duration of short term drought produced a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 12 which indicates that the short term drought cannot be predicted appropriately based on only climate variables whereas the catchment model exhibited a r2 value of 0 49 for predicting the short term drought duration over the watersheds table 6 the baseflow index bfi is identified as the most significant catchment variable p value 5 03e 07 for predicting the average duration of short term drought in this study the bfi showed a positive correlation with the short term drought duration which is similar to van loon and laaha 2015 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 barker et al 2015 the bfi has a strong role in controlling the base flow which plays an important role for hydrological drought moreover the contribution of base flow for a long term denotes higher duration of drought in the watersheds this may be a possible reason for the positive correlation of bfi with the short term drought for the srb therefore knowledge of base flow is crucial for developing catchment management strategies such as water quality management reservoir management particularly during the drought period smakhtin 2001 the stream width has a significant influence on the short term drought p value 1 63e 07 with a negative correlation which indicates that decrease in width of stream network may lead to longer duration of short term drought the land use types such as wetland and pastureland also has a major role on short term drought where the wetland exhibited a positive correlation with hydrological drought duration which indicates that the catchments with a larger area of wetland is more susceptible to hydrological drought similarly pastureland also witnessed a positive correlation with short term drought duration for the watersheds of srb this may be due to increase in the evapotranspiration and decreases in the water yield zhang et al 2016 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 due to pasturelands the loss of water through evapotranspiration may reduce the streamflow contribution from agricultural pastureland and finally lead to hydrological drought over the basin bagley et al 2014 similar to the climate model the morphological model also showed a lower value of coefficient of determination 0 18 for predicting the average duration for sri 1 drought table 7 the significant morphological variables influencing the short term drought duration are stream order and relief ratio both the variables exhibited a negative correlation with the short term drought it was observed that most of the watersheds with first or second order streams are considerably influenced by the hydrological drought and similar findings are highlighted in previous studies cowx et al 1984 hakala and hartman 2004 the maximum s order in the srb is four fig 5c and the higher order streams are observed near to the mainstream network this can be a possible reason for distribution of longer duration drought events towards the watersheds located away from the mainstream network although the climate model and morphological models were less accurate in predicting the hydrological drought over the srb the catchment model was able to predict the hydrological drought duration with reasonable accuracy in the following section we investigated the combined influence of climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought the backward stepwise selection is performed to investigate the combined influence of climate catchment and morphological variables on hydrological drought duration the proposed backward stepwise selection model was evaluated based on the akaike information criterion aic overall a combination of 8 climate catchment and morphological variables are selected table 8 it was observed that the combination of catchment and morphological variables with the climate variables significantly improved the prediction of hydrological drought duration r2 0 58 across the watersheds of srb among all the variables a pcp bfi and s order seems to be the most significant climate catchment and morphological variables which influence the drought duration for sri 1 in the srb 4 4 2 potential influence on medium and long term drought in this section potential influence of control of climate catchment and morphological variables on medium and long term drought duration are discussed it was observed that summer precipitation pcp sum plays an important role in controlling the drought duration for sri 6 in the srb the catchment variables such as elevation catchment area pastureland and wetland are highly significant in controlling the medium term drought table 6 where the pastureland p value 9 74e 06 and elevation p value 1 57e 06 are identified as the most significant catchment variables similar to the short term drought the catchment model for medium term drought also exhibited a higher r2 0 49 value however in the case of morphological model unlike the short term drought circularity ratio cr and relief ratio rr are identified as the most significant morphological variables influencing the medium term drought duration and the morphological model was able to predict 14 r2 0 14 variability in hydrological drought duration the combined model selected six variables from the combination of climate catchment and morphological variables table 8 which influence the average drought duration for sri 6 in the srb the combined model showed a coefficient of determination of 0 51 indicating that the model performance significantly improved through the addition of catchment and morphological variables with the climate variables the result from the combined model showed that the pcp spn is the most important climate variable responsible for medium term drought over srb the percentage of pastureland is identified as the most significant variable pertaining to medium term drought and s order seems to be the only morphological variable that has potential influence on the hydrological drought duration for sri 6 the proposed climate model for long term drought suggests that the mean summer precipitation pcp sum is the only variable that has a potential influence on the long term drought table 5 in the srb the catchment and morphological models selected stream width and stream order as significant variables tables 6 and 7 the combined model also selected the same variables stream width and stream order based on the backward stepwise selection method table 8 however the combined model was merely able to predict 12 variation in hydrological drought duration for sri 12 overall it was observed that the linear models formed through the combination of climate catchment and morphological variables are capable for predicting the duration for short and medium term drought nevertheless long term drought duration showed comparatively less correlation with the variables considered in the study in the following section we performed cart for identifying the threshold of each variable for controlling the hydrological drought duration over the srb 4 5 identification of critical threshold the most influential climate catchment and morphological variables are selected using backward stepwise selection process then we applied the concept of classification and regression tree cart to identify the critical threshold associated with the selected variables using the cart approach we generated three separate decision trees for short medium and long term drought to identify the threshold associated with the variables the model output of cart analysis by relating selected climate catchment and morphological variables and short term drought duration is shown in fig 11 the figure summaries the process of estimating the threshold of variables and the range of response drought duration with respect to each threshold here the range of output drought duration for sri 1 is represented in the form of a box plot the decision tree approach identified bfi s order and a pcp are the significant variables which control the drought duration for sri 1 over the watersheds of srb among them bfi was the most significant variable therefore the first split in the decision tree was based on bfi node 1 and the corresponding threshold is 0 344 for instance when the bfi of the watersheds is less than or equal to 0 344 0 344 the growth of tree is towards the left fig 11 whereas if the value of bfi is greater than 0 344 the tree is advancing to the right side here p 0 001 represents the significance of the correlation between the split based on bfi and the average drought duration for sri 1 the second split node 2 of the decision tree is based on the morphological variable stream order which indicates that stream order is the second most significant variable controlling the short term drought across srb the threshold value of stream order was one for instance if a watershed has a stream order greater than one and the bfi is less than 0 344 the short term drought duration in that particular catchment will vary from 4 months to 8 months fig 11 whereas if the stream order is less than or equal to one the growth of the tree is towards left side the third split in the decision tree node 3 was based on the mean annual precipitation a pcp overall the critical threshold of bfi s order and a pcp are identified and it can be explained as follows in determining the duration of short term drought if the bfi is 0 344 s order is 1 and a pcp is 1308 44 mm then the duration of short term hydrological drought likes to be 12 months based on median 50th percentile solid line within the boxplot and it can vary from 6 months to 22 months when the a pcp is more than 1308 44 mm the average duration of sri drought will range from 2 to 4 5 months the right branch of the node 2 elucidates that when the s order is greater than one and bfi is less than or equal to 0 344 the watersheds in srb will experience a short term drought duration of 6 months median the average annual precipitation in the srb is 1240 mm per year and the threshold associated with annual precipitation is 1308 mm based on the right side branch of the first partition the bfi greater than 0 344 resulted to a drought duration of 15 months for sri 1 however bfi has a positive correlation with the short term drought therefore a minimum value of bfi likely to reduce the short term drought duration in the watersheds the average bfi of srb watersheds is observed as 0 317 which is less than the critical threshold of bfi the results from linear regression analysis identified that s order is negatively correlated with drought duration the decision tree output illustrates that if the s order is greater than one the duration of sri 1 drought reduces to 6 months and about 50 of the watersheds located in srb has s order greater than one fig 12 illustrates the decision tree of average drought duration for sri 6 and it was identified that the variables such as pastureland pcp spn catchment area wetland and s order are significant for predicting the medium term drought duration across the watersheds of srb therefore the final tree consists of multiple nodes as well as thresholds associated with these variables pastureland showed maximum significance and the first split of the tree is based on this variable with a threshold of 0 12 12 the linear analysis indicated that pastureland has a positive correlation with the medium term drought duration in the savannah river basin 73 of the catchments have pastureland of less than 12 and a minimum duration for medium term drought was observed in the catchments where the pastureland is less than 12 and pcp spn is higher than 455 mm this indicates that in those catchments the storage plays an important role in reducing the drought duration because of less evapotranspiration from pastureland and higher precipitation during the spring season on the other hand that the longer drought duration is more prevalent in watersheds with pastureland more than 12 and s order one catchment area and wetland also influence medium term drought with a threshold of 209 km2 and 3 respectively overall the catchment variables seems to have a significant control on the drought duration for sri 6 over the srb finally the decision tree algorithm was applied to the drought duration for sri 12 fig 13 unlike the linear regression approach the decision tree approach could not identify a significant climate variable that influence long term drought it was observed that s order morphological variable and width of channels catchment variable are the important variables which has potential control on the duration of long term drought 5 discussion and concluding remarks in this study a combination of hydrological and statistical models are utilized to quantify the potential influence of climate catchment and morphological variables and its associated threshold on short medium and long term hydrological drought in the proposed model framework the streamflow pattern over the savannah river basin is simulated based on a well calibrated swat model sohoulande djebou 2019 and the hydrological drought is quantified by applying the concept of standardized runoff index the swat model was selected as it can integrate different climate and catchment characteristics e g topography soil type land use to generate runoff at a higher spatial resolution lin et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 for instance the surface runoff over each hru is estimated based on the modified curve number cn method with daily precipitation data based on soil hydrologic group vegetation type and land management practices this method will produce an accurate representation of hydrology processes in each spatial unit in addition swat model was previously applied to quantify the potential influence of land use change and climate variability on the hydrological fluxes of savannah river basin veettil and mishra 2018 the swat model is calibrated using the monthly discharge data from 1993 2005 and validated for 2006 2013 and the goodness of fit statistics showed an acceptable agreement between observed i e usgs flow and swat simulated flow following the model simulation short medium and long term drought for each catchment was quantified based on the standardized runoff index shukla and wood 2008 the statistical modeling framework incorporates a set of climate catchment and morphological variables to predict the hydrological drought for the watersheds located in savannah river basin the results indicate that the catchment variables has higher influence to trigger the hydrological drought over the savannah river basin compared to climate and morphological variables in addition the combination of these variables can improve the prediction accuracy of short and medium term drought in the savannah river basin moreover the study can be also be extended for an ungauged basin where the availability of hydrological data is insufficient however the dominant factors in determining hydrological drought characteristics is highly dependent on scale for example on a global scale drought duration might be more related to climate compared to catchment variables whereas at a regional river basin scale catchment or morphological variables may have more influence on the hydrological drought overall the proposed modeling framework is useful for identifying the key role of climate catchment and morphological variables on the hydrological drought across the watersheds of savannah river basin the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a the linear models developed based only on climate variables may not be reliable for predicting the hydrological drought duration in the savannah river basin whereas the performance of linear models can be improved by the addition of catchment and morphological variables for example in the case of short term drought the performance of the model based on r2 increased from 0 12 to 0 58 by including the catchment and morphological variables along with the climate variables b the climate catchment and morphological variables which has significant influence on the short term drought includes precipitation base flow index and stream order respectively in the combined model the stream order and baseflow index exhibited higher influence on the short term drought c the catchment variables such as pastureland wetland catchment area and elevation showed significant influence on the average duration of medium term drought which is derived based on sri 6 the catchment model was able to predict 47 variability in the average hydrological drought duration for sri 6 whereas the combined model improved the model performance to 51 the catchment variable pastureland has a potential influence in controlling the medium term drought it was also observed that the average precipitation during the spring season can be considered as a key variable that has potential influence on the average drought duration for sri 6 d the average precipitation during the summer showed a significant control on the long term drought duration which is derived based on sri 12 in the combined model the stream order and width of stream networks can have major influence on the long term drought duration e the morphological variable stream order is identified as the only variable which has significant influence over short medium and long term drought duration over the watersheds of savannah river basin which indicates the importance of including the morphological variables in predicting the hydrological drought in a river basin scale f the classification and regression tree algorithm was used for identifying thresholds associated with climate catchment and morphological variables the results indicate that the variables and associated thresholds influencing the hydrological drought varies for short medium and long term drought credit
