14405,microalgae technology is attractive for simultaneously treating wastewater and producing valuable biomass however biofuel application demands a very low net energy input that can hardly be fulfilled therefore exploration of a more direct use of microalgae biomass and selection of appropriate microalgae species are necessary to fine tune viable applications this study assesses performance of sequencing batch membrane photobioreactors sb mpbrs for simultaneously polishing secondary effluent by cultivating staurastrum sp a species suitable as aquaculture feed the effect of feed composition high and low phosphorous p on microalgae growth membrane fouling propensity nutrient removal as well as oxygen enrichment capacity were evaluated overall results demonstrate the effectiveness of sb mpbr to cultivate staurastrum sp in secondary effluent by achieving biomass concentration of 0 45 and 0 6 g l and very low nutrients concentrations in the effluents 0 10 and 2 mg l for chemical oxygen demand cod tn and tp respectively the actual biomass productivity of the sm mpbrs are 40 0 and 30 0 g day m3 for the low p and high p feeds corresponding to production costs of 11 3 and 15 1 kg biomass respectively low p feed results in a slightly higher biomass productivity of 33 compare to high p feed but slightly higher fouling propensity the growth in both sb mpbrs seems to be limited by the inorganic carbon supply too short hrt leads to nutrients accumulation of the nutrients and eventually reduced their removal efficiencies overall results show a new cultivation method for aquaculture feed while at the same time polish secondary effluent and enrich its oxygen concentration keywords membrane fouling microalgae assimilation ratio sequencing batch membrane photobioreactor staurastrum sp 1 introduction inadequate treatment of wastewater following domestic and industrial activities releases undesirable organic and inorganic substances into the environment it results in significant impairments of key nutrient cycles including but not limited to nitrogen n and phosphorus p which severely affecting both ecosystem and human well being 1 despite scientific social or political concerns on the issue of sustainable water supply ones still face severe risks in providing high quality water mainly due to rapid economic development accompanied with environmental pollutions one example of negative consequences on the ecosystem is direct discharge of sewage and artificial fertilizers into water bodies that increases nutrient loads n and p to marine and fresh water environment 2 high nutrients concentrations in water bodies lead to eutrophication a culprit of algal blooms and oxygen depletion that impairs aquatic life the situation is worsened by long term effect of heavy metals and refractory organics discharges various wastewater treatment processes have been developed for nutrients removal nonetheless ineffective secondary effluents often still have considerably high nutrients concentrations 3 4 tertiary treatment processes are then often required to further polish the effluent to remove trace nutrients 5 even when they meet the discharge standard the nutrient concentrations can actually still be lowered i e by using microalgae that effectively assimilate nutrients even from very low concentrations 6 microalgae technology can be a prominent process to treat wastewater and at the same time produce useable biomass for other applications integrating wastewater treatment with microalgae cultivation is attractive to ensure the compliance of the discharge standard and to lower the cost of microalgae cultivation for example utilizing wastewater as cultivation medium could reduce the production costs to 1 8 kg from initially 3 kg when using fresh water feed 7 microalgae technologies are attractive owning to the onus in nexus of wastewater management biofuels feedstock resources and co2 fixation growth of microalgae require nutrients which often present in the secondary effluent despite at low concentrations photosynthetic activity of microalgae growth utilize inorganic carbon as biomass building block which may be supplied from air or flue gas 8 9 microalgae can also assimilate toxic compounds 10 11 and adsorb heavy metals such as cadmium 12 thus naturally avoid the formation of emerging secondary pollutants previous study 13 reveals that generation of 1 kg of biofuel from microalgae biomass require 0 33 kg n 0 71 kg p and nearly 4 m3 of water if fresh water used without recycling however 90 of water can be reduced and additional nutrient demand can be eliminated by utilizing secondary effluent as the growth medium 13 another study shows effective growth of chlorella ellipsoidea yj1 in secondary effluent comprising of 7 0 16 7 mg l of tn and as low as 0 05 0 46 mg l of tp ranges 14 and still achieves acceptable biomass biomass lipid content and efficient nutrients removal 14 with this regard secondary effluent is considered attractive medium for growing microalgae despite the high technological promises of converting microalgae biomass to biofuels energy audit suggests that microalgae to biofuel is still away from achieving energyneutral even when using secondary effluent as growth medium and nutrients source 15 a more straight forward option is integrating this technology for production of aquaculture feed such application is more attractive especially when employing native microalgae native microalgae are desirable due to their inherent adaptability compare to isolated pure strain 16 thus more reliable in long term 17 in addition photosynthetic process undergoes by microalgae enriches the dissolved oxygen do that is important for aquatic life microalgae application for aquaculture feed have drawn much attention and some have successfully been commercialized 18 for such applications microalgae wall must be digestible and the feed must be toxic free contain sufficient nutritive biochemical elements 18 few microalgae are known to be the natural feed in aquaculture for example isochrysis galbana sp and tetraselmis suecica sp are of a high quality food for larval bivalves by growing together in seawater 18 scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp are suitable feed for artemia rotifer brachionus plicatilis 19 in addition natural astaxanthin produced in h pluvialis sp is largely commercialized as fish feed including for salmon trout shrimp and prawns 18 staurastrum sp is also the main feed of daphnia sp 20 a small planktonic crustaceans that can be easily raised to feed tropical fish the main constraint on microalgae production for aquaculture is still the high production cost 21 thus replacing fresh water with secondary effluent is attractive enclosed photobioreactor pbr is desirable system due to its flexibility to allow optimization of the growth conditions 22 optimum condition is important to prevent contamination and hence ensuring the culture quality despite of its complexity pbr pilot scale tests show a lower the biomass production cost to 0 7 kg 7 as compared to the open pond system 1 28 kg 23 membrane photobioreactor mpbr an upgrade of the pbr is highly attractive for microalgae cultivation to tackle the numerous challenges in pbr to name but few harvesting and washout 24 although extensive mpbr research 25 advancements are still required to enhance its applicability our previous study 15 proves that sequencing batch membrane photobioreactor sb mpbr effectively polishes real secondary effluent by growing native microalgae however the energy audit on the process shows that the energy input is much higher than the energy from produced lipid nevertheless the results of preliminary cost analysis 0 113 m3 shows high promise of the sb mpbr as a viable technology the objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of sb mpbr for cultivating staurastrum sp and simultaneously removes tn and tp from real secondary effluents as the feeds the effect of phosphorus concentrations in the feed on the biomass growth membrane fouling nutrients removal and oxygen enrichment in the permeate were investigated lastly a preliminary techno economic analysis on the proposed concept was also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae cultivation and growth conditions a 5 l of water containing microalgae was collected from an open pond located nearby the campus as microalgae source for growth inoculum the inoculum pre dominated by was staurastrum sp the microalgae stain was firstly concentrated using 0 01 μm hollow fiber polysulfone membrane o happure china from diluted 5 l into a 30 ml of the final retentate those inoculum was divided equally to feed two sb mpbr two sets of 140 l of secondary effluents were used as the feed they were collected at different times to yield different nutrient compositions 1 with tn and tp of 21 2 1 5 and 5 21 0 5 mg l respectively henceforth referred to as high tp feed and 2 with tn and tp of 20 2 1 5 and 0 9 0 5 mg l respectively low tp feed the feeds were stored in a cold 4 c and dark room to maintain their conditions 2 2 sb mpbr set up and operations the illustration of the sb mpbr is shown in fig 1 a the bioreactor tank had an effective working volume of 12 l the sb mpbrs were operated according to a cycle of 23 h reaction instant feeding instant withdrawing and 1 h filtration fig 1b in the photobioreactor membrane panels were placed at 20 two fluorescence lamps each with light intensity of 1000 lx were placed 10 cm from the bioreactor tanks and aeration was provided at a rate of 3 5 l min fig 1c both sb mpbrs operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 days and biomass retention time brt of 150 days to run under such conditions 2920 ml of water was withdrawn by filtration with the membrane panels to achieve the 4 days hrt the brt was maintained by withdrawing 80 ml of broth daily which later also used for analysis a total volume of 3 l fresh secondary effluent was replaced daily for each sb mpbr a daily makeup of about 0 3 l of medium was necessary to compensate water evaporation losses a constant flux of 40 l m2h was set for the filtration by adjusting the rotation speed of a peristaltic pump a vacuum sensor was used to record the transmembrane pressure tmp automatically with data recording of every 10 s the membrane used for microalgae filtration was lab made phase inverted pvdf membrane detailed elsewhere 26 the membrane sheet was assembled into a panel with an effective membrane area of 0 02 m2 three panels per sb mpbr 2 3 experimental parameters the brt and hrt were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively the hrt parameter was used to determine the input volume of fresh secondary effluent and modified

harvested broth was placed in dry aluminium disks the disks were then placed in an oven at 105 c until it reached constant weight the dry biomass concentration was taken as weight different per volume of the treated samples tn and tp concentration were measured by using hach lange kits merck darmstadt germany with dr 5000 and drb 200 reactor hach lange merck darmstadt germany all tests were done in triplicate the dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored during the cultivation using do meter 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of tp concentration on biomass growth fig 2 presents the variations of biomass concentration reflecting the growth of staurastrum sp in the sb mpbrs fed with the two different feeds both microalgae growth trends show similar concentration for the first 10 days with an almost linear curve these results differ from most of microalgae cultivation under nutrient limitation on semi batch systems typically it consists of exponential growth at the earlier stage in between lag and stationaryphases 15 this finding however is in line with other study 28 for cultivation of spirulina sp in a serial tubular pbr operated under co2 limitation the growth of staurastrum sp seems to be limited by carbon source despite that a constant air flow rate of 3 5 l min was supplied throughout the cultivation this finding indicates that staurastrum sp requires high amount of carbon as building blocks of cells insufficient carbon can significantly affect the growth of microalgae as discussed elsewhere 29 high carbon requirement for staurastrum sp growth becomes a challenge for any process since pumping air as source of co2 is often the biggest energy factor in a microalgae cultivation however this situation can possibly be overcome by providing flue gas aeration which contain higher concentration of co2 than air microalgae have been proven effective to grow under flue gas as co2 source 8 30 further study should explore cultivation of staurastrum sp by supplying flue gas as co2 source to avoid carbon growth limitation as faced in this study sb mpbr fed with high tp feed reaches a maximum concentration of 450 mg l at day 10 after 2 days of stagnant growth at the highest concentration it immediately decreases at day 13 fig 2 however sb mpbr with low tp feed shows a different growth trend with maximum biomass concentration of 600 mg l it then decreases at day 14 after 2 days of stagnant growth this finding suggests that low p feed is a better medium for cultivating staurastrum sp shown by the higher attained biomass concentration the biomass production capacity for the low p and high p feeds are 40 and 30 g day m3 respectively these values are relatively low due to the low concentrations of nutrients coupled with growth limitation by inorganic carbon supply growth under stressed condition of very lowtp helps to increase microalgae fatty acids productivity which is the main component of lipid as found in previous study 31 32 important nutrients in aquaculture feed siron and co workers 32 cultivated phaeodactylum tricornutum in phosphorus deficient pd and phosphorus sufficient ps culture and found that pd culture contained 129 more of fatty acid than the ps culture by the end of the growth phase 3 2 membrane fouling in microalgae broth filtration permeances in sb mpbrs during daily filtration show a slight different trend for both feeds fig 3 tmp represents membrane fouling condition as fouling increases tmp at constant flux filtration in contrast permeance decreases as membrane fouling develops permeance values for sb mpbr with the low tp feed is slightly lower compared to the hightp feed this result is in line with our previous study 15 in which the broth with higher biomass concentration exhibits lower filterability thus required higher tmp to drive filtration the evidence for this statement is stronger at the latter stage of growth for sb mpbr with lowtp feed day 11 13 fig 2 as expected permeances for sb mpbr with low tp feed showed a significant decreased by 16 the permeance profile at day 14 of low tp feed cultivation somehow contradicts with the above statement since the microalgae broth which has slightly lower biomass concentration turned out to have lower permeances see fig 2 therefore another factor that contributed to fouling is suspected namely the accumulation of algogenic organic matter aom in the microalgae broth which are most likely coming from dying microalgae cells aom is proven to be the main foulant 33 as mentioned in earlier study 34 aom increases and accumulates together with increasing biomass concentration therefore tmp for low tp cultivation is generally higher in comparison with the high tp cultivation mainly due to higher biomass concentration and accumulation of aom throughout the cultivation period long srt 150 days applied in this study is also not favored as it promotes aom build up 33 accumulation of aom can be indicated by the cod value of the permeate from both sb mpbrs fig 4 the cod generally represents the concentration of organic matters in the broth since most organic matter can be digested 35 cultivation with low tp feed produced permeate with higher cod value compared to the high tp feed this is in line with the previous finding in which aom increases with the increasing biomass concentration interestingly at the beginning of the cultivation the cod value of the permeate from sb mpbr with low tp feed has already 3 times higher it indicates the different growing behaviors during the batch cultivation prior to the start of the sb mpbrs batch wise cultivation of staurastrum sp in high tp concentration leads to a growth with a less aom production and thus has lower membrane fouling propensity during the experiments it was observed that batch cultivation with high tp feed before converting to sb mpbr showed a bright green color compared to dark green color broth from cultivation with low tp feed staurastrum sp was found to be bright green 36 therefore tp feed concentration may affect the psychological condition however further studies about effect of tp concentration in the feed on the biology growth of microalgae is thus recommended 3 3 effect of tp concentration on nutrients removal tn and tp removal rates of staurastrum sp for sb mpbrs are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively it appears that the nutrients removal efficiency for the hightp feed decreasing throughout the cultivation period from 68 87 to 48 11 and from 46 45 to 10 94 for tn and tp respectively fig 5 the dynamic condition light intensity environment stress in sb mpbr is suspected to affect nutrients assimilation rate of staurastrum sp for example light intensity might become crucial and limits the nutrient assimilation when the biomass concentration is high growth under carbon limitation also affects the nutrient assimilation rates under carbon limiting growth condition tn and tp were not efficiently assimilated by staurastrum sp hrt also plays an important role in nutrients removal capacity the 4 days hrt applied in this study seems to be too short for staurastrum sp for full assimilation of nutrients due to its slow growth rate as shown by low removal efficiency the decreasing trend of nutrient removal efficiency is due to nutrients accumulation from earlier cycles tp removal efficiency for hightp feed decreases significantly from 46 to 11 over time similar condition was mentioned as the effect of cultivation in mpbr 34 in which nutrient accumulation occurred if the nutrient were only partly assimilated and eventually changes the overall medium composition this factor indirectly changes the nutrient assimilation ratio of staurastrum sp tn and tp removal rates for sb mpbr with the lowtp feed ranged from 27 36 to 74 06 and from 27 78 to 50 respectively fig 5 cultivation of staurastrum sp in low tp feed faces similar limiting factors as in the high tp feed however staurastrum sp achieved nutrient removal of 74 06 for tn and 50 for tp at day 7 which are the highest accumulation of phosphorus in low tp feed cultivation is considered as minor factor since p concentration is lower in the feed thus higher removal can be achieved of up to 50 overall staurastrum sp require high amount of carbon for growing and it is favorable for treating low p effluent such as fresh secondary effluent from anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment with tp concentration as low as 0 05 mg l 14 3 4 effect of tp concentration on dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the microalgae broth for both sbmpbrs were found to be in the range of 6 8 ppm during the entire cultivations photosynthetic activity of staurastrum sp actively produces oxygen dissolved in the growth medium and subsequently rises the do level in the culture for both sb mpbrs other source of do is from continuous aeration for co2 supply and membrane fouling control oxygen is a vital element for the survival of heterotrophic aquatic life direct discharge of secondary effluent with high nutrients concentrations and low do level into water bodies not only forms eutrophication that reduce oxygen level combination of eutrophication with originally low do level secondary effluent 2 mg l also significantly inhibits the survival of aquatic life the finding was in line with previous study 37 in which higher microalgae biomass density increases the oxygen generation rate however it is worth noting that accumulation of oxygen and high do level may reach inhibitory concentration that affect the growth of microalgae the condition deteriorated if compounded with intense sunlight which eventually damage the cell via photooxidation 38 the sb mpbrs in this study was placed indoor providing artificial light thus the effect of sunlight was absent the average do level achieved by low tp feed sbmpbr of 7 6 mg l was still within the acceptable range for the growth of microalgae cell previous study 39 enhanced the biomass productivity of outdoor cultures of spirulina sp by reducing do level from 35 20 mg l to below 20 mg l but not lower than 3 mg l are the acceptable for microalgae and others aquatics life studies have been done on the effects of constant low do level on a number of fish adult inangas risk of 50 mortality after 48 h under do level of 2 6 mg l 40 and 38 mortality after 48 h under do level of 1 mg l 41 do level of 1 8 and 1 6 mg l are lethal for common smelts and juvenile trouts 40 in short the rises of do level by microalgae in sb mpbr provide a more desirable condition for aquatic life when the treated effluent is discharged to the water body or utilize as aquaculture medium 3 5 techno economic analysis of microalgae biomass production results from section 3 1 3 4 demonstrate the feasibility of cultivating staurastrum sp in secondary effluent for not only polishing the effluent by removing tn and tp but also producing staurastrum sp applicable for aquaculture feed the oxygen enriched of effluent is also attractive to be used as water source for aquaculture which offer reduction on the aerator typically used to solubilized oxygen from air in aquaculture farm two main economic gains can be identified cost reduction from the feed substitution using produced biomass and cost reduction for do enrichment as reported in our previous study 15 the preliminary cost analysis found that the operational expenditure associated with polishing secondary effluent in sb mpbr is 0 113 m3 of treated feed by combining with the productivity data obtained in the current study 9 12 g day m3 of reactor and retention time of 4 days the estimated biomass production costs are 11 3 15 1 kg biomass this value is quite attractive by comparing with the current market price of fishmeal of 1 7 kg 42 when the microalgae biomass can be treated as lipid or protein rich additive to the current feed it is worth mentioning that the current estimated costs can still be lowered if problems that inhibit the growths can be overcome i e inorganic carbon supply 4 conclusions sb mpbrs were used for simultaneously polishing of secondary effluent by via nutrient removals and aquaculture feed production secondary effluent can be a medium for staurastrum sp cultivation in sb mpbr while at the same time producing oxygen enrich effluent high tp does not give benefit for both nutrient removals and biomass production the low tp feed results in a higher biomass concentration coupled with higher membrane fouling propensity in addition staurastrum sp growth rate was limited by carbon supply too short hrt 4 days leads to low nutrient removals to improve nutrient removals while achieving high biomass yield further study should focus on the strategy to increase co2 transfer into the growth medium i e by using flue gas as co2 source effect of light intensity to the growth of staurastrum sp and optimizing hrt acknowledgments we acknowledge yayasan universiti teknologi petronas malaysia

of biomass concentration reflecting the growth of staurastrum sp in the sb mpbrs fed with the two different feeds both microalgae growth trends show similar concentration for the first 10 days with an almost linear curve these results differ from most of microalgae cultivation under nutrient limitation on semi batch systems typically it consists of exponential growth at the earlier stage in between lag and stationaryphases 15 this finding however is in line with other study 28 for cultivation of spirulina sp in a serial tubular pbr operated under co2 limitation the growth of staurastrum sp seems to be limited by carbon source despite that a constant air flow rate of 3 5 l min was supplied throughout the cultivation this finding indicates that staurastrum sp requires high amount of carbon as building blocks of cells insufficient carbon can significantly affect the growth of microalgae as discussed elsewhere 29 high carbon requirement for staurastrum sp growth becomes a challenge for any process since pumping air as source of co2 is often the biggest energy factor in a microalgae cultivation however this situation can possibly be overcome by providing flue gas aeration which contain higher concentration of co2 than air microalgae have been proven effective to grow under flue gas as co2 source 8 30 further study should explore cultivation of staurastrum sp by supplying flue gas as co2 source to avoid carbon growth limitation as faced in this study sb mpbr fed with high tp feed reaches a maximum concentration of 450 mg l at day 10 after 2 days of stagnant growth at the highest concentration it immediately decreases at day 13 fig 2 however sb mpbr with low tp feed shows a different growth trend with maximum biomass concentration of 600 mg l it then decreases at day 14 after 2 days of stagnant growth this finding suggests that low p feed is a better medium for cultivating staurastrum sp shown by the higher attained biomass concentration the biomass production capacity for the low p and high p feeds are 40 and 30 g day m3 respectively these values are relatively low due to the low concentrations of nutrients coupled with growth limitation by inorganic carbon supply growth under stressed condition of very lowtp helps to increase microalgae fatty acids productivity which is the main component of lipid as found in previous study 31 32 important nutrients in

than the ps culture by the end of the growth phase 3 2 membrane fouling in microalgae broth filtration permeances in sb mpbrs during daily filtration show a slight different trend for both feeds fig 3 tmp represents membrane fouling condition as fouling increases tmp at constant flux filtration in contrast permeance decreases as membrane fouling develops permeance values for sb mpbr with the low tp feed is slightly lower compared to the hightp feed this result is in line with our previous study 15 in which the broth with higher biomass concentration exhibits lower filterability thus required higher tmp to drive filtration the evidence for this statement is stronger at the latter stage of growth for sb mpbr with lowtp feed day 11 13 fig 2 as expected permeances for sb mpbr with low tp feed showed a significant decreased by 16 the permeance profile at day 14 of low tp feed cultivation somehow contradicts with the above statement since the microalgae broth which has slightly lower biomass concentration turned out to have lower permeances see fig 2 therefore another factor that contributed to fouling is suspected namely the accumulation of algogenic organic matter aom in the microalgae broth which are most likely coming from dying microalgae cells aom is proven to be the main foulant 33 as mentioned in earlier study 34 aom increases and accumulates together with increasing biomass concentration therefore tmp for low tp cultivation is generally higher in comparison with the high tp cultivation mainly due to higher biomass concentration and accumulation of aom throughout the cultivation period long srt 150 days applied in this study is also not favored as it promotes aom build up 33 accumulation of aom can be indicated by the cod value of the permeate from both sb mpbrs fig 4 the cod generally represents the concentration of organic matters in the broth since most organic matter can be digested 35 cultivation with low tp feed produced permeate with higher cod value compared to the high tp feed this is in line with the previous finding in which aom increases with the increasing biomass concentration interestingly at the beginning of the cultivation the cod value of the permeate from sb mpbr with low tp feed has already 3 times higher it indicates the different growing behaviors during the batch cultivation prior to the start of the sb mpbrs batch wise cultivation of staurastrum sp in high tp concentration leads to a growth with a less aom production and thus has lower membrane fouling propensity during the experiments it was observed that batch cultivation with high tp feed before converting to sb mpbr showed a bright green color compared to dark green color broth from cultivation with low tp feed staurastrum sp was found to be bright green 36 therefore tp feed concentration may affect the psychological condition however further studies about effect of tp concentration in the feed on the biology growth of microalgae is thus recommended 3 3 effect of tp concentration on nutrients removal tn and tp removal rates of staurastrum sp for sb mpbrs are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively it appears that the nutrients removal efficiency for the hightp feed decreasing throughout the cultivation period from 68 87 to 48 11 and from 46 45 to 10 94 for tn and tp respectively fig 5 the dynamic condition light intensity environment stress in sb mpbr is suspected to affect nutrients assimilation rate of staurastrum sp for example light intensity might become crucial and limits the nutrient assimilation when the biomass concentration is high growth under carbon limitation also affects the nutrient assimilation rates under carbon limiting growth condition tn and tp were not efficiently assimilated by staurastrum sp hrt also plays an important role in nutrients removal capacity the 4 days hrt applied in this study seems to be too short for staurastrum sp for full assimilation of nutrients due to its slow growth rate as shown by low removal efficiency the decreasing trend of nutrient removal efficiency is due to nutrients accumulation from earlier cycles tp removal efficiency for hightp feed decreases significantly from 46 to 11 over time similar condition was mentioned as the effect of cultivation in mpbr 34 in which nutrient accumulation occurred if the nutrient were only partly assimilated and eventually changes the overall medium composition this factor indirectly changes the nutrient assimilation ratio of staurastrum sp tn and tp removal rates for sb mpbr with the lowtp feed ranged from 27 36 to 74 06 and from 27 78 to 50 respectively fig 5 cultivation of staurastrum sp in low tp feed faces similar limiting factors as in the high tp feed however staurastrum sp achieved nutrient removal of 74 06 for tn and 50 for tp at day 7 which are the highest accumulation of phosphorus in low tp feed cultivation is considered as minor factor since p concentration is lower in the feed thus higher removal can be achieved of up to 50 overall staurastrum sp require high amount of carbon for growing and it is favorable for treating low p effluent such as fresh secondary effluent from anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment with tp concentration as low as 0 05 mg l 14 3 4 effect of tp concentration on dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the microalgae broth for both sbmpbrs were found to be in the range of 6 8 ppm during the entire cultivations photosynthetic activity of staurastrum sp actively produces oxygen dissolved in the growth medium and subsequently rises the do level in the culture for both sb mpbrs other source of do is from continuous aeration for co2 supply and membrane fouling control oxygen is a vital element for the survival of heterotrophic aquatic life direct discharge of secondary effluent with high nutrients concentrations and low do level into water bodies not only forms eutrophication that reduce oxygen level combination of eutrophication with originally low do level secondary effluent 2 mg l also significantly inhibits the survival of aquatic life the finding was in line with previous study 37 in which higher microalgae biomass density increases the oxygen generation rate however it is worth noting that accumulation of oxygen and high do level may reach inhibitory concentration that affect the growth of microalgae the condition deteriorated if compounded with intense sunlight which eventually damage the cell via photooxidation 38 the sb mpbrs in this study was placed indoor providing artificial light thus the effect of sunlight was absent the average do level achieved by low tp feed sbmpbr of 7 6 mg l was still within the acceptable range for the growth of microalgae cell previous study 39 enhanced the biomass productivity of outdoor cultures of spirulina sp by reducing do level from 35 20 mg l to below 20 mg l but not lower than 3 mg l are the acceptable for microalgae and others aquatics life studies have been done on the effects of constant low do level on a number of fish adult inangas risk of 50 mortality after 48 h under do level of 2 6 mg l 40 and 38 mortality after 48 h under do level of 1 mg l 41 do level of 1 8 and 1 6 mg l are lethal for common smelts and juvenile trouts 40 in short the rises of do level by microalgae in sb mpbr provide a more desirable condition for aquatic life when the treated effluent is discharged to the water body or utilize as aquaculture medium 3 5 techno economic analysis of microalgae biomass production results from section 3 1 3 4 demonstrate the feasibility of cultivating staurastrum sp in secondary effluent for not only polishing the effluent by removing tn and tp but also producing staurastrum sp applicable for aquaculture feed the oxygen enriched of effluent is also attractive to be used as water source for aquaculture which offer reduction on the aerator typically used to solubilized oxygen from air in aquaculture farm two main economic gains can be identified cost reduction from the feed substitution using produced biomass and cost reduction for do enrichment as reported in our previous study 15 the preliminary cost analysis found that the operational expenditure associated with polishing secondary effluent in sb mpbr is 0 113 m3 of treated feed by combining with the productivity data obtained in the current study 9 12 g day m3 of reactor and retention time of 4 days the estimated biomass production costs are 11 3 15 1 kg biomass this value is quite attractive by comparing with the current market price of fishmeal of 1 7 kg 42 when the microalgae biomass can be treated as lipid or protein rich additive to the current feed it is worth mentioning that the current estimated costs can still be lowered if problems that inhibit the growths can be overcome i e inorganic carbon supply 4 conclusions sb mpbrs were used for simultaneously polishing of secondary effluent by via nutrient removals and aquaculture feed production secondary effluent can be a medium for staurastrum sp cultivation in sb mpbr while at the same time producing oxygen enrich effluent high tp does not give benefit for both nutrient removals and biomass production the low tp feed results in a higher biomass concentration coupled with higher membrane fouling propensity in addition staurastrum sp growth rate was limited by carbon supply too short hrt 4 days leads to low nutrient removals to improve nutrient removals while achieving high biomass yield further study should focus on the strategy to increase co2 transfer into the growth medium i e by using flue gas as co2 source effect of light intensity to the growth of staurastrum sp and optimizing hrt acknowledgments we acknowledge yayasan universiti teknologi petronas malaysia

light and the colour generation of these solutions compared to the industrial effluent the colour generation trend of the wastewater was found to be similar to that of lsa analysis by hplc ftir ms and nmr showed that the colour development of the wastewater mimicked the paper yellowing mechanism with the formation of quinones as a major route uv induced dimerization of vanillin solutions showed a dramatic increase in colour thus results suggest the uv induced polymerization of lignin compounds play a major role in colour development of lignocellulosic wastewater effluents unless the phenol

biofuels green chemicals and materials is currently very topical 1 5 accordingly a consideration of the expected aqueous discharge associated with integrated forest biorefinery process strategies is crucial the biorefinery concept highlights sustainability climate change mitigation and low carbon footprint and hence the development of water treatment systems that are equally environmentally friendly is correspondingly important the utilization of ligno cellulosic biomass in both bioenergy and biomaterial production is commonly conducted via an initial biomass pretreament to overcome the recalcitrance of the lignin hemicellulose matrix so as to solubilize and degrade it providing access for subsequent processing 6 8 the strategies typically include steam explosion dilute acid and organosolv pretreatment usually performed under elevated temperature and strong shear pressure or mechanical amongst these acid catalyzed or auto catalyzed processes are becoming dominant pretreatment strategies for the biorefinery one problem regarding wastewater streams that have originated from wood lignocellulosic processing is the persistent colour of the treated effluent 9 12 additionally there is a concern regarding further yellowing of the treated wastewater that may occur and intensify beyond the point of discharge even after prolonged time periods this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of uv induced colour generation associated with wastewater from the acidic bisulphite pulping process considered in the context of prospective integrated forest biorefineries components of biorefinery effluents that are believed responsible for the colour include residual cellulose hemicelluloses lignin pulping process chemicals and microorganism from the wastewater stream oxidative reactions of these components may result in coloured degradation products usually containing carbonyl co groups and carbon carbon double bonds cc 10 13 14 among those lignin residues have often been linked to effluent colour development 15 16 however evidence is scarce and even more scarce concerning the governing mechanisms successful methods for colour removal from pulp and paper mill effluents 17 24 have been reported these include physicochemical treatment biological treatment and integrated treatments which combine two or more processes 25 27 physicochemical treatments such as coagulation 18 23 electrocoagulation 17 28 29 and adsorption 19 24 can remove up to 90 of colour from the effluents biological treatment with algae can successfully remove 84 of the colour from a pulp and paper industry effluent 30 combining coagulation flocculation with heterogeneous photocatalysis a uv tio2 h2o2process was reported to remove 100 of the chromophores absorbing at 500 nm 20 however most studies have focused on the removal of colour from the effluents not on the identification of substances responsible for the stable colour of the effluents or on the mechanism of colour generation additionally the fate of colour from pulp and paper mill effluent and the kinetics of uv induced colour generation of the treated wastewater have remained unknown improved understanding surrounding the colour producing species as well as the mechanism and rate of colour development in aqueous discharges would be invaluable for the development of robust water treatment process water especially in the context of emerging biorefineries we raise the hypothesis that the colour generation mechanism of pulp mill wastewater is similar to that of the well established high yield pulp paper yellowing light induced yellowing of paper has been studied both on lignocellulosics fiber made paper and on model compounds the behaviour of the active chromophores and intermediates was characterized and precise reaction pathways of the participating species during irradiation were validated 31 32 factors contributing to the oxidation reactions are light heat moisture metal cations cu2 and fe3 and pollutant gases so2 and no2 the discolouration of paper is initiated by photooxidation upon light absorption by some chromophores present in paper lignin reactions were identified as the major cause of photo yellowing 33 34 therefore lignin and depolymerised lignin derivatives are hypothesised to be responsible for the colour development in pulp and paper mills wastewater even long after treatment 10 in this study the effluent from an integrated magnesium bisulphite pulp mill was investigated as a model for aqueous discharge from ligno cellulosic biorefineries the bisulphite pulping process is acidic similar to the stream explosion based wood treatments of chemical based enzymatic and fermentation based biorefineries in the first part of this study the uv induced colour growth rate of the effluent was determined and compared to three model substances namely vanillin lignosulfonic acid lsa and humic acid these model substances represent a simple lignin fragment vanillin a bisulphite pulping by product lsa and a more complex material of combined aliphatic aromatic composition humic acid these model substances are all water soluble in the second part the composition of aqueous solutions and uv irradiation products were investigated using high performance liquid chromatography hplc and spectroscopic analysis finally the mechanism of colour generation is analysed from the results of lignin model compounds reactions that have been analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr electrospray mass spectrometry es ms and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses 2 experimental 2 1 materials the wastewater used in this study was the treated effluent from the kimberly clark australia kca tantanoola pulp and paper mill located at snuggery in south east south australia the tantanoola pulp mill now closed produced 70 kt y 1 of magnefite chemical pulp and its water usage was about 60 m3 t 1 of pulp the logs were debarked before chipping the feedstock consisted of pinus radiata aged 12 to 15 years that was seasoned for 3 months magnesium oxide with less than 2 5 of calcium and molten sulphur the magnesium bisulphate process was carried out at ph 4 5 170 c and for 6 h of batch cooking the effluent from four tissue machines was combined with those of the pulp mill the mill wastewater treatment plant consisted of two primary sedimentation clarifiers and three aerated stabilized basins in series for secondary treatment before discharge into a nearby lake 35 the basic properties of the wastewater are provided in table 1 aqueous solutions of lsa 200 ppm humic acid 50 ppm and vanillin 250 ppm were also studied for uv induced colour generation the concentrations of lsa and humic acid were adjusted so that the colour levels measured as ptco were approximately similar to that of the wastewater with vanillin an exception due to its colourless nature all model compounds were purchased from sigma aldrich pty ltd sydney australia the lsa was lignosulfonic acid sodium salt having a weight average molecular weight mw of 52 000 and number average molecular weight mn of 70 000 the ph of all model compound solutions was in the range 6 7 the exact chemical structure of humic acid is unknown however several models of humic acid have been reported one of which was suggested by steelink 36 2 2 methods a small volume of the sample solution 5 ml was placed in a capped quartz container with diameter of 12 mm and length of 80 mm the uv irradiation experiments were performed using an ultraviolet products cl1000 m s uv crosslinker lamp 302 nm and 254 nm as described by johnston 37 the cl1000 m crosslinker lamp produced mid range uv wavelength centred at 302 nm and the cl1000s uv crosslinker lamp produced shortwave 254 nm with irradiation intensity 0 28 j cm 2 s 1 the initial and irradiated aqueous solutions were then analysed using an hach dr5000 spectrophotometer for colour ptco according to method number 8025 adapted from hongve and åkesson 38 and for uv absorbance over the range 250 650 nm to investigate the changes in composition due to irradiation reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an alphabond phenyl sn 97 061 184 column 4 6 x 300 mm and an isocratic mobile phase acetonitrile and water 40 60 v v with a flow rate of 0 8 cm3 min 1 for vanillin the resulting compounds after irradiation were also analysed by mass spectrometry agilent esi ms and proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr bruker 400 mhz drx using d2o as solvent 3 results and discussion the colour generation of the magnesium bisulphite pulp mill wastewater and aqueous solutions of the model compounds lsa vanillin and humic acid was studied under uv illumination at two wavelengths 254 nm and 302 nm in the first part of this study the effects of uv wavelength and irradiation time on colour generation are quantified in terms of colour wavelength and intensity in the second the chemical changes attributed to the colour generation are investigated using hplc ftir ms and nmr 3 1 effect of irradiation wavelength and time wastewater together with the humic acid lsa and vanillin model solutions were irradiated with uv at two wavelengths 254 nm and 302 nm for different periods the colour development as ptco was measured as a function of irradiation time the plots of colour versus irradiation time for vanillin lsa humic acid and wastewater solutions are illustrated in fig 1 a d after 1 h stabilization period the colour intensity for vanillin lsa and wastewater solutions all increase pseudo linearly with irradiation time the slope of each plot represents the rate constant for colour growth in aqueous solution rate constants for vanillin lsa and wastewater solution were determined to be 15 7 ptco h 1 2 98 ptco h 1 and 2 87 ptco h 1 respectively at 302 nm irradiation the rate constants for all samples at 254 nm were lower than at 302 nm for vanillin the 254 nm and 302 nm colour growth rates were significantly higher than those of the wastewater and lsa solutions the initial vanillin solution is colourless and the development of a yellow colour is easily observed as the solution is irradiated the yellowing rate at 302 nm of vanillin solutions was five times faster than for the lsa and wastewater solutions this is due to the high concentration of chromophoric entities in the vanillin structure generating a more pronounced colour generation the low molecular weight of vanillin compared to lsa presumably leads to higher diffusion in solution and hence more effective collisions allowing more efficient photochemical reaction to occur for lsa colour generation is expected to be due to the lignin chromophores having strong susceptibility to oxidation upon uv irradiation lignin is an uv absorber molecule and energy transferred between 200 nm 400 nm would initiate this process with the development of colour inducing intermediate products chromophoric functional groups responsible for such behaviour are phenolic hydroxyl groups double bonds and carbonyl groups that can facilitate the formation and stabilisation of free radicals under uv radiation 39 in contrast the humic acid solution exhibited a slow reduction in colour upon uv irradiation fig 1 c the colour reduction was non linear with uv irradiation time at both wavelengths tested fig 1 c a similar phenomenon was previously reported for humic acid solutions upon γ irradiation the non linear reduction in colour intensity of the humic acid solutions with γ radiation dose was linked to complex radical formation leading to an oxidative degradation to smaller and more acidic hydrophilic fragments 40 the rate of colour development of the wastewater effluent was very similar to that of lsa fig 1 a b this suggests lignin based components play a dominant role in wastewater colour development the colour development of process wastewater lsa and vanillin aqueous solutions upon uv irradiation was more pronounced at 302 nm than at 254 nm for paper the literature 31 41 frequently relates chromophores of lignin and derivatives as the main progenitors of photoyellowing this is attributed to paper functional groups adsorbing the uv portion of sunlight in the region between 300 nm and 400 nm 13 32 41 42 thus the more pronounced colour development of lignin derivatives in aqueous solutions was probably due to the optimal absorption by the chromophores at 302 nm 3 2 uv spectroscopy the literature on paper yellowing reveals that the chromophoric groups that intensify upon uv irradiation are typically phenolic oh groups quinones α carboxyl groups biphenyls and conjugated double bonds 32 39 the colour generation of the magnesium bisulphite pulp mill wastewater and some model compounds of this study may well follow a similar mechanism to confirm the formation of any possible chromophores the uv spectra of all solutions before and after irradiation were analysed fig 2 vanillin solutions prepared were initially colourless the marked increases in uv absorbance between 350 550 nm upon uv irradiation indicates the presence of newly formed coloured components jethwa et al 36 report that ethanolic solutions of vanillin were converted by the action of sunlight into 6 6 dihydroxy 5 5 dimetoxy 1 1 biphenyl 3 3 dicarbaldehyde dehydrodivanillin the conversion was accompanied by the formation of yellow colour and a slight bitter taste the uv absorption of the newly formed dehydrodivanillin exhibited a wide shoulder at 337 nm 43 for humic acid the uv absorbance between 350 450 nm decreased upon irradiation at all wavelengths measured fig 2 d a reduction of colour of humic acid solutions from dark brown to pale yellow upon γ irradiation was similarly reported by gorączko et al 40 the uv absorbance of humic acid solutions at 270 400 and 600 nm has been related to the degradation of long wavelength absorbing chromophores into simpler aliphatic compounds 40 for wastewater and lsa the slight increases in uv absorption between 350 450 nm are suspected to result from the formation of quinones originating from phenoxyl radicals 32 all quinone metabolites typically have near identical uv vis spectra absorbance maxima between 350 500 nm 32 44 45 3 3 high performance liquid chromatography hplc wastewater and model solutions after uv irradiation were characterised by hplc hplc with a uv detector can separate components in solution and indicate chemical composition changes occurring upon irradiation for the wastewater and lsa solutions complete separation was not achievable due to the complexity number of similar isomers of the mixtures 46 fig 3 a b however the technique proved useful for illustrating changes that occurred in these solutions 46 47 the hplc chromatogram of vanillin exhibited the formation of new compounds upon uv irradiation signified by the occurrence of new peaks in the irradiated vanillin chromatogram fig 3 a the data shows new products have formed upon irradiation with new peaks appearing at retention times rt of 3 7 4 3 and 5 1 min the irradiated vanillin solution was further analysed by ms and nmr uv irradiation of the wastewater and the lsa solution did not show significant changes in the overall pattern of the chromatogram suggesting no major variation in chemical composition fig 3 b c however there were changes in relative intensity of some peaks particularly growing peaks at 4 3 and 3 5 min for lsa a marked decrease in peak intensity at retention time 2 5 min appeared the peak enhancements occurred more markedly for the higher molecular weight components with longer retention times this suggests condensation of lower molecular weight components perhaps by dimerization reaction this observation could also be due to an increase in conjugated double bonds systems which results in better uv detection greater sensitivity the trends in the development of ptco colour the hplc chromatograms and the uv spectra over time both for the lsa and the wastewater solutions are very similar figs 2 and 3 this suggests that the components predominating in the process wastewater may have similarities with lsa the magnesium bisulphite pulping process uses an acidic bisulphite solution as a delignifying medium 48 lignin removal from wood commences with cleavage at the α c atom of the lignin monomer unit followed by the addition of a so3h group to the intermediary carbonium ion the sulfonation reaction increases the hydrophilicity of lignin thus increasing its solubility in aqueous liquor 49 3 4 mass spectrometry ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr of vanillin due to its simple structure the ms and nmr spectra of vanillin before and after uv irradiation can be readily interpreted the formation of dimers is evident from the ms spectra supplementary material the ms of vanillin solution after 302 nm uv irradiation shows the appearance of two new peaks at m z 167 and 301 the peak at m z 301 noticeably increases in intensity with irradiation time this peak represents a dimer of vanillin the structure of this irradiated vanillin product was further analysed by proton nmr spectroscopy fig 4 the initial vanillin exhibits six distinguishable peak clusters easily assigned to the molecular structure fig 4a 50 the nmr spectrum of irradiated vanillin shows a similar pattern with an additional peak at 7 ppm fig 4b the peak at 6 9 ppm is still observed but at a significantly reduced intensity this suggests a marked loss of h2 and or h3 protons also supporting the formation of a dimer the vanillin sample was likely a mixture of monomer and dimer because the peaks of the initial sample are also in the irradiated sample the singlet at 3 6 ppm is split into 3 671 and 3 651 ppm whereas the singlet initially present at 9 575 is altered to 9 642 together with a very small additional peak 3 5 ftir analysis differences in the wastewater and lsa solutions before and after irradiation were investigated using difference spectra δ irradiated sample initial as illustrated in fig 5 for both samples reductions in oh absorption at 3500 cm 1 and c o absorptions alcohols and ethers e g at 1200 cm 1 were found this is consistent with the formation of quinones as this pathway involves changes in hydroxyl and ether groups by radical attack together with the formation of carbonyl groups and double bonds slight increases in absorption peaks at around 1558 cm 1 and 1505 cm 1 for wastewater and at 1557 cm 1 for lsa may be attributed to the co stretching mode of the protonated semiquinone radicals 51 the difference spectra for vanillin were less distinct and these samples were more usefully characterised by the nmr ms and hplc data already presented 3 6 colour generation mechanism for vanillin the formation of dimer as a pathway for colour generation is strongly supported by ms and nmr analysis fig 4 the oh radical is typically one of the primary radicals that forms upon uv irradiation initiating a series of oxidative transformations 52 being electrophilic in nature the oh radical may attack the electron rich aromatic rings in vanillin resulting in a phenolic coupling reaction to form divanillin divanillin of molecular weight 302 is formed upon irradiation and increases in concentration with irradiation time fig 6 a the formation of divanillin is observed via the fragment ion at m z 301 m 1 and from nmr spectra fig 4 a marked decrease of intensity of the peak at 6 9 ppm indicates that the protons at the h2 and or h3 position diminish most likely due to the formation of the biphenyl linkage among the constitutive components of lignin phenols are the most important 53 and vanillin 4 hydroxy 3 methoxybenzaldehyde is a typical representative of this group one of the mechanisms involved in the yellowing of lignocellulosics in aqueous solution includes a phenolic coupling reaction as suggested by the formation of vanillin dimers upon uv irradiation a possible pathway of uv irradiated product of lignocellulosic material namely the phenacyl pathway 32 has been reported fig 6b the trends in hplc chromatograms uv wavelength scan and ftir spectra all support the formation of quinone structures in wastewater and lsa solution as a result of uv irradiation this is consistent with the commonly accepted pathway of paper yellowing 34 carter 13 report that the primary chromophores of lignin typically absorb near uv light 300 400 nm resulting in free radicals this is consistent with our findings which report a slower rate of degradation from irradiation at 254 nm relative to 302 nm because of limited free radical formation these free radicals react with lignin to produce phenoxy and ketyl radicals that may further oxidize to form yellow quinones fig 6 these quinones act as secondary chromophores absorbing light that lead to further colour generation process 13 the acidic bisulphite pulp mills provide an invaluable industrial model for modern biorefineries in the last decade steam explosion pretreatment has become the established pre treatment for subsequent enzymatic treatment and fermentation of the saccharides into useful products such as ethanol lactic acid succinic acid and 1 3 propanediol 54 as typically applied without catalyst addition steam explosion is an auto catalyzed acidic treatment 49 55 effluents from bisulfphite pulp mills are notorious for their colour generation propensity typically leaving the pulp mill as clear effluents after the standard primary and secondary treatments these effluents can become strongly coloured with time here we have demonstrated by using process water and aqueous solutions of model compounds that some lignin derivatives do increase in colour intensity upon uv exposure we have further related the rate of industrial process water yellowing to that of the model lignosulphonate acid lsa supporting the hypothesis this was reinforced by the limited yellowing of humic acid a phenolic compound of different structure relative to lignin and lsa further the mechanism of yellowing was related to uv induced dimerization of phenolic monomers using vanillin as model this study provides understanding that might mitigate effluent colour development in potential modern biorefineries lignin residues are noted in pulp and paper industry for their resistance to secondary water treatment 56 58 this study have shown that the release of lignin phenolic monomers might be the basis of colour development due to their dimerization into colour compound upon uv irradiation a remediation method that could remove or deactivate these reactive moieties could be expected to suppress colour development 4 conclusion this study aimed to gain better understanding of the mechanisms of colour generation of biorefineries process wastewater using model compounds in comparison with the effluent of a bisulphite pulp mill process water and model compound solutions were irradiated at 254 nm and 302 nm for various periods of time it was found that the colour generation is faster upon uv irradiation at 302 nm than that at 254 nm the colour generation rate follows this trend vanillin lignosulfonic acid wastewater solution the colour growth of the wastewater effluent was similar to that of the lsa solutions suggesting lignosulfonates as the precursor for colour generation similar to the yellowing of paper from high yield pulps the effluent from lignocellulosic materials or forest biorefineries are likely to generate colour with time and upon sunlight exposure due to traces of refractory lignin compounds the main mechanism was related to lignin monomer polymerization the uv induced dimerization of vanillin into divanilin was identified by ms and nmr aqueous discharges from the biorefinery industry should have minimal levels of phenolic organics so that colour formation induced by uv sunlight is also minimized

strategies for the biorefinery one problem regarding wastewater streams that have originated from wood lignocellulosic processing is the persistent colour of the treated effluent 9 12 additionally there is a concern regarding further yellowing of the treated wastewater that may occur and intensify beyond the point of discharge even after prolonged time periods this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of uv induced colour generation associated with wastewater from the acidic bisulphite pulping process considered in the context of prospective integrated forest biorefineries components of biorefinery effluents that are believed responsible for the colour include residual cellulose hemicelluloses lignin pulping process chemicals and microorganism from the wastewater stream oxidative reactions of these components may result in coloured degradation products usually containing carbonyl co groups and carbon carbon double bonds cc 10 13 14 among those lignin residues have often been linked to effluent colour development 15 16 however evidence is scarce and even more scarce concerning the governing mechanisms successful methods for colour removal from pulp and paper mill effluents 17 24 have been reported these include physicochemical treatment biological treatment and integrated treatments which combine two or more processes 25 27 physicochemical treatments such as coagulation 18 23 electrocoagulation 17 28 29 and adsorption 19 24 can remove up to 90 of colour from the effluents biological treatment with algae can successfully remove 84 of the colour from a pulp and paper industry effluent 30 combining coagulation flocculation with heterogeneous photocatalysis a uv tio2 h2o2process was reported to remove 100 of the chromophores absorbing at 500 nm 20 however most studies have focused on the removal of colour from the effluents not on the identification of substances responsible for the stable colour of the effluents or on the mechanism of colour generation additionally the fate of colour from pulp and paper mill effluent and the kinetics of uv induced colour generation of the treated wastewater have remained unknown improved understanding surrounding the colour producing species as well as the mechanism and rate of colour development in aqueous discharges would be invaluable for the development of robust water treatment process water especially in the context of emerging biorefineries we raise the hypothesis that the colour generation mechanism of pulp mill wastewater is similar to that of the well established high yield pulp paper yellowing light induced yellowing of paper has been studied both on lignocellulosics fiber made paper and on model compounds the behaviour of the active chromophores and intermediates was characterized and precise reaction pathways of the participating species during irradiation were validated 31 32 factors contributing to the oxidation reactions are light heat moisture metal cations cu2 and fe3 and pollutant gases so2 and no2 the discolouration of paper is initiated by photooxidation upon light absorption by some chromophores present in paper lignin reactions were identified as the major cause of photo yellowing 33 34 therefore lignin and depolymerised lignin derivatives are hypothesised to be responsible for the colour development in pulp and paper mills wastewater even long after treatment 10 in this study the effluent from an integrated magnesium bisulphite pulp mill was investigated as a model for aqueous discharge from ligno cellulosic biorefineries the bisulphite pulping process is acidic similar to the stream explosion based wood treatments of chemical based enzymatic and fermentation based biorefineries in the first part of this study the uv induced colour growth rate of the effluent was determined and compared to three model substances namely vanillin lignosulfonic acid lsa and humic acid these model substances represent a simple lignin fragment vanillin a bisulphite pulping by product lsa and a more complex material of combined aliphatic aromatic composition humic acid these model substances are all water soluble in the second part the composition of aqueous solutions and uv irradiation products were investigated using high performance liquid chromatography hplc and spectroscopic analysis finally the mechanism of colour generation is analysed from the results of lignin model compounds reactions that have been analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr electrospray mass spectrometry es ms and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses 2 experimental 2 1 materials the wastewater used in this study was the treated effluent from the kimberly clark australia kca tantanoola pulp and paper mill located at snuggery in south east south australia the tantanoola pulp mill now closed produced 70 kt y 1 of magnefite chemical pulp and its water usage was about 60 m3 t 1 of pulp the logs were debarked before chipping the feedstock consisted of pinus radiata aged 12 to 15 years that was seasoned for 3 months magnesium oxide with less than 2 5 of calcium and molten sulphur the magnesium bisulphate process was carried out at ph 4 5 170 c and for 6 h of batch cooking the effluent from four tissue machines was combined with those of the pulp mill the mill wastewater treatment plant consisted of two primary sedimentation clarifiers and three aerated stabilized basins in series for secondary treatment before discharge into a nearby lake 35 the basic properties of the wastewater are provided in table 1 aqueous solutions of lsa 200 ppm humic acid 50 ppm and vanillin 250 ppm were also studied for uv induced colour generation the concentrations of lsa and humic acid were adjusted so that the colour levels measured as ptco were approximately similar to that of the wastewater with vanillin an exception due to its colourless nature all model compounds were purchased from sigma aldrich pty ltd sydney australia the lsa was lignosulfonic acid sodium salt having a weight average molecular weight mw of 52 000 and number average molecular weight mn of 70 000 the ph of all model compound solutions was in the range 6 7 the exact chemical structure of humic acid is unknown however several models of humic acid have been reported one of which was suggested by steelink 36 2 2 methods a small volume of the sample solution 5 ml was placed in a capped quartz container with diameter of 12 mm and length of 80 mm the uv irradiation experiments were performed using an ultraviolet products cl1000 m s uv crosslinker lamp 302 nm and 254 nm as described by johnston 37 the cl1000 m crosslinker lamp produced mid range uv wavelength centred at 302 nm and the cl1000s uv crosslinker lamp produced shortwave 254 nm with irradiation intensity 0 28 j cm 2 s 1 the initial and irradiated aqueous solutions were then analysed using an hach dr5000 spectrophotometer for colour ptco according to method number 8025 adapted from hongve and åkesson 38 and for uv absorbance over the range 250 650 nm to investigate the changes in composition due to irradiation reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an alphabond phenyl sn 97 061 184 column 4 6 x 300 mm and an isocratic mobile phase acetonitrile and water 40 60 v v with a flow rate of 0 8 cm3 min 1 for vanillin the resulting compounds after irradiation were also analysed by mass spectrometry agilent esi ms and proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr bruker 400 mhz drx using d2o as solvent 3 results and discussion the colour generation of the magnesium bisulphite pulp mill wastewater and aqueous solutions of the model compounds lsa vanillin and humic acid was studied under uv illumination at two wavelengths 254 nm and 302 nm in the first part of this study the effects of uv wavelength and irradiation time on colour generation are quantified in terms of colour wavelength and intensity in the second the chemical changes attributed to the colour generation are investigated using hplc ftir ms and nmr 3 1 effect of irradiation wavelength and time wastewater together with the humic acid lsa and vanillin model solutions were irradiated with uv at two wavelengths 254 nm and 302 nm for different periods the colour development as ptco was measured as a function of irradiation time the plots of colour versus irradiation time for vanillin lsa humic acid and wastewater solutions are illustrated in fig 1 a d after 1 h stabilization period the colour intensity for vanillin lsa and wastewater solutions all increase pseudo linearly with irradiation time the slope of each plot represents the rate constant for colour growth in aqueous solution rate constants for vanillin lsa and wastewater solution were determined to be 15 7 ptco h 1 2 98 ptco h 1 and 2 87 ptco h 1 respectively at 302 nm irradiation the rate constants for all samples at 254 nm were lower than at 302 nm for vanillin the 254 nm and 302 nm colour growth rates were significantly higher than those of the wastewater and lsa solutions the initial vanillin solution is colourless and the development of a yellow colour is easily observed as the solution is irradiated the yellowing rate at 302 nm of vanillin solutions was five times faster than for the lsa and wastewater solutions this is due to the high concentration of chromophoric entities in the vanillin structure generating a more pronounced colour generation the low molecular weight of vanillin compared to lsa presumably leads to higher diffusion in solution and hence more effective collisions allowing more efficient photochemical reaction to occur for lsa colour generation is expected to be due to the lignin chromophores having strong susceptibility to oxidation upon uv irradiation lignin is an uv absorber molecule and energy transferred between 200 nm 400 nm would initiate this process with the development of colour inducing intermediate products chromophoric functional groups responsible for such behaviour are phenolic hydroxyl groups double bonds and carbonyl groups that can facilitate the formation and stabilisation of free radicals under uv radiation 39 in contrast the humic acid solution exhibited a slow reduction in colour upon uv irradiation fig 1 c the colour reduction was non linear with uv irradiation time at both wavelengths tested fig 1 c a similar phenomenon was previously reported for humic acid solutions upon γ irradiation the non linear reduction in colour intensity of the humic acid solutions with γ radiation dose was linked to complex radical formation leading to an oxidative degradation to smaller and more acidic hydrophilic fragments 40 the rate of colour development of the wastewater effluent was very similar to that of lsa fig 1 a b this suggests lignin based components play a dominant role in wastewater colour development the colour development of process wastewater lsa and vanillin aqueous solutions upon uv irradiation was more pronounced at 302 nm than at 254 nm for paper the literature 31 41 frequently relates chromophores of lignin and derivatives as the main progenitors of photoyellowing this is attributed to paper functional groups adsorbing the uv portion of sunlight in the region between 300 nm and 400 nm 13 32 41 42 thus the more pronounced colour development of lignin derivatives in aqueous solutions was probably due to the optimal absorption by the chromophores at 302 nm 3 2 uv spectroscopy the literature on paper yellowing reveals that the chromophoric groups that intensify upon uv irradiation are typically phenolic oh groups quinones α carboxyl groups biphenyls and conjugated double bonds 32 39 the colour generation of the magnesium bisulphite pulp mill wastewater and some model compounds of this study may well follow a similar mechanism to confirm the formation of any possible chromophores the uv spectra of all solutions before and after irradiation were analysed fig 2 vanillin solutions prepared were initially colourless the marked increases in uv absorbance between 350 550 nm upon uv irradiation indicates the presence of newly formed coloured components jethwa et al 36 report that ethanolic solutions of vanillin were converted by the action of sunlight into 6 6 dihydroxy 5 5 dimetoxy 1 1 biphenyl 3 3 dicarbaldehyde dehydrodivanillin the conversion was accompanied by the formation of yellow colour and a slight bitter taste the uv absorption of the newly formed dehydrodivanillin exhibited a wide shoulder at 337 nm 43 for humic acid the uv absorbance between 350 450 nm decreased upon irradiation at all wavelengths measured fig 2 d a reduction of colour of humic acid solutions from dark brown to pale yellow upon γ irradiation was similarly reported by gorączko et al 40 the uv absorbance of humic acid solutions at 270 400 and 600 nm has been related to the degradation of long wavelength absorbing chromophores into simpler aliphatic compounds 40 for wastewater and lsa the slight increases in uv absorption between 350 450 nm are suspected to result from the formation of quinones originating from phenoxyl radicals 32 all quinone metabolites typically have near identical uv vis spectra absorbance maxima between 350 500 nm 32 44 45 3 3 high performance liquid chromatography hplc wastewater and model solutions after uv irradiation were characterised by hplc hplc with a uv detector can separate components in solution and indicate chemical composition changes occurring upon irradiation for the wastewater and lsa solutions complete separation was not achievable due to the complexity number of similar isomers of the mixtures 46 fig 3 a b however the technique proved useful for illustrating changes that occurred in these solutions 46 47 the hplc chromatogram of vanillin exhibited the formation of new compounds upon uv irradiation signified by the occurrence of new peaks in the irradiated vanillin chromatogram fig 3 a the data shows new products have formed upon irradiation with new peaks appearing at retention times rt of 3 7 4 3 and 5 1 min the irradiated vanillin solution was further analysed by ms and nmr uv irradiation of the wastewater and the lsa solution did not show significant changes in the overall pattern of the chromatogram suggesting no major variation in chemical composition fig 3 b c however there were changes in relative intensity of some peaks particularly growing peaks at 4 3 and 3 5 min for lsa a marked decrease in peak intensity at retention time 2 5 min appeared the peak enhancements occurred more markedly for the higher molecular weight components with longer retention times this suggests condensation of lower molecular weight components perhaps by dimerization reaction this observation could also be due to an increase in conjugated double bonds systems which results in better uv detection greater sensitivity the trends in the development of ptco colour the hplc chromatograms and the uv spectra over time both for the lsa and the wastewater solutions are very similar figs 2 and 3 this suggests that the components predominating in the process wastewater may have similarities with lsa the magnesium bisulphite pulping process uses an acidic bisulphite solution as a delignifying medium 48 lignin removal from wood commences with cleavage at the α c atom of the lignin monomer unit followed by the addition of a so3h group to the intermediary carbonium ion the sulfonation reaction increases the hydrophilicity of lignin thus increasing its solubility in aqueous liquor 49 3 4 mass spectrometry ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr of vanillin due to its simple structure the ms and nmr spectra of vanillin before and after uv irradiation can be readily interpreted the formation of dimers is evident from the ms spectra supplementary material the ms of vanillin solution after 302 nm uv irradiation shows the appearance of two new peaks at m z 167 and 301 the peak at m z 301 noticeably increases in intensity with irradiation time this peak represents a dimer of vanillin the structure of this irradiated vanillin product was further analysed by proton nmr spectroscopy fig 4 the initial vanillin exhibits six distinguishable peak clusters easily assigned to the molecular structure fig 4a 50 the nmr spectrum of irradiated vanillin shows a similar pattern with an additional peak at 7 ppm fig 4b the peak at 6 9 ppm is still observed but at a significantly reduced intensity this suggests a marked loss of h2 and or h3 protons also supporting the formation of a dimer the vanillin sample was likely a mixture of monomer and dimer because the peaks of the initial sample are also in the irradiated sample the singlet at 3 6 ppm is split into 3 671 and 3 651 ppm whereas the singlet initially present at 9 575 is altered to 9 642 together with a very small additional peak 3 5 ftir analysis differences in the wastewater and lsa solutions before and after irradiation were investigated using difference spectra δ irradiated sample initial as illustrated in fig 5 for both samples reductions in oh absorption at 3500 cm 1 and c o absorptions alcohols and ethers e g at 1200 cm 1 were found this is consistent with the formation of quinones as this pathway involves changes in hydroxyl and ether groups by radical attack together with the formation of carbonyl groups and double bonds slight increases in absorption peaks at around 1558 cm 1 and 1505 cm 1 for wastewater and at 1557 cm 1 for lsa may be attributed to the co stretching mode of the protonated semiquinone radicals 51 the difference spectra for vanillin were less distinct and these samples were more usefully characterised by the nmr ms and hplc data already presented 3 6 colour generation mechanism for vanillin the formation of dimer as a pathway for colour generation is strongly supported by ms and nmr analysis fig 4 the oh radical is typically one of the primary radicals that forms upon uv irradiation initiating a series of oxidative transformations 52 being electrophilic in nature the oh radical may attack the electron rich aromatic rings in vanillin resulting in a phenolic coupling reaction to form divanillin divanillin of molecular weight 302 is formed upon irradiation and increases in concentration with irradiation time fig 6 a the formation of divanillin is observed via the fragment ion at m z 301 m 1 and from nmr spectra fig 4 a marked decrease of intensity of the peak at 6 9 ppm indicates that the protons at the h2 and or h3 position diminish most likely due to the formation of the biphenyl linkage among the constitutive components of lignin phenols are the most important 53 and vanillin 4 hydroxy 3 methoxybenzaldehyde is a typical representative of this group one of the mechanisms involved in the yellowing of lignocellulosics in aqueous solution includes a phenolic coupling reaction as suggested by the formation of vanillin dimers upon uv irradiation a possible pathway of uv irradiated product of lignocellulosic material namely the phenacyl pathway 32 has been reported fig 6b the trends in hplc chromatograms uv wavelength scan and ftir spectra all support the formation of quinone structures in wastewater and lsa solution as a result of uv irradiation this is consistent with the commonly accepted pathway of paper yellowing 34 carter 13 report that the primary chromophores of lignin typically absorb near uv light 300 400 nm resulting in free radicals this is consistent with our findings which report a slower rate of degradation from irradiation at 254 nm relative to 302 nm because of limited free radical formation these free radicals react with lignin to produce phenoxy and ketyl radicals that may further oxidize to form yellow quinones fig 6 these quinones act as secondary chromophores absorbing light that lead to further colour generation process 13 the acidic bisulphite pulp mills provide an invaluable industrial model for modern biorefineries in the last decade steam explosion pretreatment has become the established pre treatment for subsequent enzymatic treatment and fermentation of the saccharides into useful products such as ethanol lactic acid succinic acid and 1 3 propanediol 54 as typically applied without catalyst addition steam explosion is an auto catalyzed acidic treatment 49 55 effluents from bisulfphite pulp mills are notorious for their colour generation propensity typically leaving the pulp mill as clear effluents after the standard primary and secondary treatments these effluents can become strongly coloured with time here we have demonstrated by using process water and aqueous solutions of model compounds that some lignin derivatives do increase in colour intensity upon uv exposure we have further related the rate of industrial process water yellowing to that of the model lignosulphonate acid lsa supporting the hypothesis this was reinforced by the limited yellowing of humic acid a phenolic compound of different structure relative to lignin and lsa further the mechanism of yellowing was related to uv induced dimerization of phenolic monomers using vanillin as model this study provides understanding that might mitigate effluent colour development in potential modern biorefineries lignin residues are noted in pulp and paper industry for their resistance to secondary water treatment 56 58 this study have shown that the release of lignin phenolic monomers might be the basis of colour development due to their dimerization into colour compound upon uv irradiation a remediation method that could remove or deactivate these reactive moieties could be expected to suppress colour development 4 conclusion this study aimed to gain better understanding of the mechanisms of colour generation of biorefineries process wastewater using model compounds in comparison with the effluent of a bisulphite pulp mill process water and model compound solutions were irradiated at 254 nm and 302 nm for various periods of time it was found that the colour generation is faster upon uv irradiation at 302 nm than that at 254 nm the colour generation rate follows this trend vanillin lignosulfonic acid wastewater solution the colour growth of the wastewater effluent was similar to that of the lsa solutions suggesting lignosulfonates as the precursor for colour generation similar to the yellowing of paper from high yield pulps the effluent from lignocellulosic materials or forest biorefineries are likely to generate colour with time and upon sunlight exposure due to traces of refractory lignin compounds the main mechanism was related to lignin monomer polymerization the uv induced dimerization of vanillin into divanilin was identified by ms and nmr aqueous discharges from the biorefinery industry should have minimal levels of phenolic organics so that colour formation induced by uv sunlight is also minimized

14407,this work developed and used performance indicators to quantitatively cross compare over 82 liquid phase anaerobic digestion treatment processes technologies results showed that anaerobic membrane reactors generally performed best in terms of reduction of total chemical oxygen demand while upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors exceled with respect to the volumetric reduction of total chemical oxygen demand although packed bed and moving bed reactors showed large variations in reduction of total chemical oxygen demand they generally produced higher methane yields i e 0 25 m3 methane produced per kg total chemical oxygen demand reduced while high performance was desired across all performance indicators it was generally not achieved by any specific reactor type the performance indicators were also used to directly cross compare performance of two separate reactors treating identical wastewater streams result showed that both systems demonstrated good performance relative to the literature but neither was dominant in head to head comparison keywords anaerobic digester cross comparative analysis wastewater treatment 1 introduction the advantages of anaerobic digestion to treat wastewater are well documented anaerobic digestion can robustly process high strength wastewater withstand abrupt disturbances in organic loading rates produce far less biomass does not require energy intensive aeration metabolizes odorous organics that would otherwise escape volatilize under aeration 1 and converts the majority of organic carbon to biogas 2 3 the energy rich biogas if recovered can be used to improve long term economic and environmental sustainability 1 4 indeed a steady rise in fossil fuel prices beginning in the early 1970s has catalyzed a revival in biogas recovery from liquid phase anaerobic digestion especially with industrial wastewaters possessing high organics 1 3 5 6 more recently anaerobic reactors have been combined with low energy aerobic treatment systems e g trickling filters to create low energy systems that treat high strength wastewaters to effluents that meet discharge regulations 1 7 the literature on anaerobic digestion of liquid phase wastewater is broad and with applications spanning types of technology 8 types of wastewater 9 operating parameters 10 toxicants 11 and the production and recovery of bioenergy 12 contributions also address innovations such as interfacing anaerobic digestion with bio electrochemical systems 13 the use of biochar 14 the addition of nutrients 15 the co integration of multiple technologies 16 and even the use of mixed feeds 17 despite this expansive collection of literature reports these analyses remain isolated and focused on application specific criteria while justified these contributions lack standardized criteria to assess relative performance across reactor types although the reports on reductions in organic and or nutrient levels are widespread for example they alone are not adequate to cross compare reactors of different designs the development and use of performance indicators that supports cross comparative analysis addresses this limitation cross comparative analysis is not common in the field of wastewater treatment it is quite common however in other fields such as chemical engineering where reactor optimization is of very high importance as such a quantitative method that provides a basis for cross comparative analysis will provide a unique and useful design and evaluation tool this work evaluates the performance of 82 liquid phase anaerobic digestion treatment processes technologies using performance indicators that provide a quantitative basis for cross comparison the effort has been broken down into four sections first anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies are grouped into one of six reactor types and their key operating principles briefly discussed second baseline metrics that support cross comparison are proposed as performance indicators pis third the pis are used to compare performance and to identify general trends across the literature fourth the pis are used to assess the relative ability of a packed bed anaerobic reactor deploying a novel packing material to process high strength acidic wastewater finally qualitative indicators are presented and used to provide additional information and diagnostic evaluation that complement the performance indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor grouping the literature on anaerobic digestion of high strength wastewater 18 19 spans a broad number of reactor types including the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb anaerobic baffled reactor abr anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr anaerobic plug flow apf anaerobic filter af fluidized bed fb and expanded granular sludge bed reactor egsb 20 hybrid configurations that integrate two or more of these reactor types have also been proposed with the most common utilizing a sludge bed and a fixed film in the lower and upper portions of the reactor respectively 21 27 many of the systems reported in the literature share common characteristics through identification of common features these configurations have been grouped into one of six major reactor types fig 1 1 packed bed pb 2 continuous stirred tank reactor cstr 3 up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb 4 moving bed mb 5 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr and 6 hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge blanket packed bed huasbpb 2 1 1 packed bed pb reactor the pb i e fixed film ff reactors 28 30 employ physically constrained biofilm support media that retain methanogenic microbial biomass within biofilms 31 32 biofilm support media can range from rock plastic wood polyester fibers sand crushed coal anthracite or other natural or synthetic materials 33 they can be deployed as individual units in packed arrangements 34 35 or as solid surfaces that extend the length of the reactor space such as extruded pipes thin rods or vertically oriented corrugated sheets 36 media with high porosity generally provide better performance 37 38 the packed bed design has been reported in many forms i packed bed biofilm reactor pbbr 34 ii up flow anaerobic or anaerobic up flow fixed film uaff or auff reactor 22 39 iii anaerobic down flow stationary fixed film reactor dsff 40 iv up flow anaerobic filter uaf or af 41 v vertical flow biofilm reactor vfbr 36 and vi the horizontal flow biofilm reactor hfbr 42 all share the same basic feature that the wastewater is passed over biofilms attached to fixed support media one significant variation on this theme is the rotating biological contactor wherein the biofilm support media is rotated through an otherwise stationary body of wastewater 43 2 1 2 continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr is a well mixed reactor whose effluent composition is equal to the fluid inside the reactor simple in design well mixed cstrs provide uniform values for temperature and ph 44 46 and when biomass recycle is employed the residence times of biomass sludge and wastewater can be decoupled while cstrs are commonly used in the chemical industry 47 48 their use to treat municipal and industrial wastewaters 49 50 suffers from high energy requirements for mixing especially when applied to viscous solutions 48 49 2 1 3 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor has emerged as a popular reactor for high rate treatment of high strength industrial and municipal wastewaters 51 53 in contrast to the pb reactor the uasb reactor employs a non fixed bed of flocculated biomass at the bottom of the reactor in the form of a high density blanket of granular sludge flocs through which the wastewater percolates 54 55 variations on the usab reactor include the i expanded granular sludge bed egsb 56 ii internal circulation ic reactor 57 and iii modified internal recirculation mic reactor 58 these systems generally deploy higher height diameter ratios to accommodate higher superficial velocities 4 10 m h 1 realized through recycle 59 flow rates of wastewater through the bed must be sufficient to expand the bed and ensure efficient mixing but not sufficiently rapid to transport the flocs out of the reactor 60 uasb reactors are negatively impacted by high concentrations of suspended solids that foul the sludge bed suffer increased bed thickness and impose longer residence times 61 62 as the flocs are held together by extracellular polysaccharides that form mini biofilm communities they are also hindered by wastewaters rich in fatty acids that destabilize the flocs 63 64 2 1 4 moving bed mb reactors like the pb reactor moving bed mb reactors use biofilm support media but similar to the usab reactor the biofilm support media mix freely in suspension through a combination of agitation e g internal recycle and rising biogas bubbles 65 66 in this context mb reactors incorporate features of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors i e mixing of fluid and biofilm communities and pb reactors i e retention of biomass within biofilms 67 variations of the mb are i the fluidized bed fb 68 69 and ii inverse fluidized bed ifb 70 the biofilm support media in these reactors can vary significantly in the fb and ifb reactors the biofilm support media is typically an inert inorganic material such as sand whereas in the mb reactor the biofilm support media is almost exclusively molded plastics 65 the use of molded plastics has emerged in recent years as a biofilm support structure that provides enhanced protection for biofilms that support self selection for biofilm communities that are optimized for degradation of pollutants in wastewater 2 1 5 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr membrane reactors are used to treat wastewater in both aerobic 71 and anaerobic environments 72 in both systems wastewater flows under vacuum through biofilm coated microporous membranes that pass liquid but retain solids thus decoupling the hydraulic retention time hrt from the solids residence time srt 73 74 membrane styles used in mbr s are tubular hollow fiber and flat sheet 75 76 they are also deployed in two principle configurations side stream membrane connected externally to the reactor and submerged membrane submerged inside the reactor 77 78 membrane reactors are classified by pore size micro filtration mf 0 05 to 5 μm ultrafiltration uf 0 005 to 0 5 μm nanofiltration nf 0 001 to 0 005 μm and reverse osmosis ro 0 0001 to 0 001 μm 78 79 although anaerobic membrane reactors are energy intensive their effluents are well poised to meet stringent discharge requirements including tss 80 86 additionally studies have shown that net positive energy systems can be realized when including methane recovery 87 2 1 6 hybrid uasb and packed bed huasbpb reactors the hybrid reactor has evolved to take advantage of both suspended and attached growth 88 these reactors place the usab at the bottom and the pb at the top of the reactor to form a barrier against upward flowing biomass flocs and undigested suspended solids 89 91 they thus retain the advantage of good contact between biomass and wastewater yet eliminate the disadvantage of losing biomass to the effluent at higher flow rates or biogas production rates the pb also provides a zone of attached biomass to improve process stability under transient operating conditions 92 2 2 cross comparative performance indicators pis although the literature is full of reports describing the performance of reactors as a function of operating parameters and feedstocks methods to cross compare performance is lacking performance indicators pis that permit quantitative cross comparison of liquid phase anaerobic digesters therefore are critical to their design and evaluation one of the most important functions of anaerobic reactors is their capacity to reduce the organic strength of wastewater either measured by reduction in total chemical oxygen demand tcod or total five day biochemical oxygen demand tbod5 93 over the last decade rising costs of energy have also weighted the value of energy recovery 94 95 as such both organic reduction and methane yields serve as the vital metrics to provide cross comparison across reactor types their use in the development of pis is now presented 2 2 1 total organic reduction the total organic reduction is measured as the percent reduction in total chemical oxygen demand tcod across the inlet and exit of the wastewater treatment system reported in units of percent the total reduction in chemical oxygen demand is 1 t c o d r e d t c o d f e e d t c o d e f f l u e n t t c o d f e e d 100 eq 1 uses the total form of cod i e tcod in order to account for the chemical oxygen demand cod captured in particulates that will eventually solubilize alternatively the total five day biological oxygen demand tbod5 could be used but given its inherent 5 day time delay the more rapid tcod measurement is used and reported more often in the literature the other useful feature to the tcod is its ability to fully oxidize the sample even in the presence of toxins or other compounds that can interfere with microbial metabolism 2 2 2 volumetric total organic reduction rate although useful as an absolute measurement the total organic reduction as tcod does not account for reaction time or reactor volume two parameters important to cross comparative analysis of reactors to address this the volumetric organic reduction rate v t c o d r e d is proposed reported in units of kg m 3 d 1 the total volumetric chemical oxygen demand or volumetric organic reduction rate is 2 v t c o d r e d k g m 3 d t c o d f t c o d e f f l u e n t h r t t c o d f t c o d e f f l u e n t f i n v r x r where vrxr is the effective reactor volume m3 and hrt is the hydraulic retention time d defined as the ratio of the reactor volume vrxr to inlet flow rate of wastewater fin m3 d 1 2 2 3 methane yield the methane production rate m3 d 1 is also an important metric for cross comparative analysis it is calculated by measuring the rate of total biogas production and multiplying it by the percent of methane present in the headspace gas the volumetric methane production rate is related to the reactor volume vrxr as 3 v c h 4 m 3 d 1 m 3 c h 4 v r x r where c h 4 is rate of methane production m3 d 1 and vrxr is the volume of the reactor m3 although valuable the volumetric methane production rate does not address the efficiency of methane biogas production a value that is dependent on the reduction in total volumetric chemical oxygen demand kg m 3 d 1 and its complete conversion to methane a more useful form methane yield y c h 4 addresses the ability of the system to reduce organic carbon to methane biogas and is calculated as 4 y c h 4 m 3 k g t c o d r e d v c h 4 v t c o d r e d assuming ideal gas behavior at standard temperature and pressure stp the maximum theoretical yield is 0 35 m3 ch4 per kg tcod reduced 96 from this perspective the tcod is preferential to tbod5 due to the ability to accurately determine the theoretical upper limit on biogas production 2 2 4 cross comparative analysis to ensure cross comparative analysis across reactor types the pis should be plotted against the volumetric organic loading rate v o l r a term that quantifies the rate at which oxygen demand chemical or biological is loaded onto the reactor as a function of reactor volume the v o l r is calculated from the organic loading rate o l r which is first calculated as 5 o l r k g d t c o d f f i n where tcodf is the chemical oxygen demand kg m 3 and fin is the volumetric flow rate m3 d 1 of the wastewater feed the v o l r is now obtained when the o l r is evaluated relative to the volume of the reactor specifically 6 v o l r k g m 3 d o l r v r x r where the volumetric organic loading rate v o l r incorporates the strength of feed wastewater reactor volume footprint and feed flow rate time required for treatment as reactor performance with respect to a given metric can drop dramatically at higher organic loading rates plotting the three pis against this term affords a truly balanced cross comparative analysis 2 3 additional performance indicators several metrics often used to evaluate anaerobic digestion of wastewater were not judged useful for the purpose of cross comparative analysis of anaerobic reactor performance one reason is that these metrics often include additional tertiary unit operations that do not utilize anaerobic digestion as such they are not useful for direct cross comparison of anaerobic digesters they can still be used however to add insight to performance analysis these additional metrics are now grouped into two categories regulated and unregulated indicators 2 3 1 regulated indicators ris regulated indicators ris represent those metrics a wastewater treatment system must meet in order to satisfy discharge permit requirements the total biological oxygen demand tbod5 which measures the amount of dissolved molecular oxygen that is reduced i e removed from solution by microbial metabolism during a five day incubation period 97 is one such parameter in practice the tbod5 measures the biological oxygen load imposed by the treated wastewater upon the environment when discharged to surface or underground waters the total suspended solids tss is another regulated pollutant that wastewater treatment systems must also address in order to meet secondary discharge limits in practice the tss represents the amount of organic and inorganic solid material in a wastewater sample that will not pass through a 1 5 μm filter since meeting the tbod5 and tss discharged requirements is typically achieved using additional downstream unit operations they were not used as a direct performance indicator for cross comparative analysis of anaerobic digesters they are useful however to analyze reactor performance 2 3 2 non regulated indicators nris non regulated indicators nris such as the effluent concentration of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp are also metrics increasingly mentioned for regulation at the state and local levels their reduction across the reactors can also be useful to diagnose uncompetitive reactor performance table 1 provides a brief summary of common nri s along with a short description of their value for a greater discussion the reader is directed to a number of literature presentations 98 102 2 4 system description of packed bed reactor deploying a novel biofilm support media in addition to cross comparative analysis of literature reports on anaerobic reactors this work has also applied the proposed performance metrics to evaluate an experimental system deploying a novel biofilm support media to treat acid wastewater the experimental system comprises an initial mixing tank mt followed by a single packed bed column reactor fig 2 the anaerobic column reactor ad was packed with a novel biofilm support media composed of wood based biochar pieces size 4 6 mm embedded onto the surface of circular chitosan biopolymer discs fig 2a c while biochar has been demonstrated to be a superior surface for retention of methanogenic microbial communities 3 chitosan surfaces have been recognized for their antimicrobial properties 110 the combination of a stimulatory biochar surface embedded within an inhibitory chitosan surface was hypothesized to create a biofilm support media that limits overall biofilm growth to a thin film thin film biofilms of methanogenic microbial communities should provide maximum surface area to volume ratio of active biofilms and minimize mass transfer resistance internal recycle was used to improve mixing fig 2 6 the effluent from the ad reactor was intermittently recycled back to the initial mixing tank fig 2 7 for the purpose of passive ph control as described elsewhere 111 this step allows for ph control without adding base externally all liquid and gas phase measurements were conducted using standardized methods as described previously 3 112 with the exception of gas production rates which were measured using a bubble column the novel chitosan biochar packing material was tested over a 6 month period under increasing organic load until the final organic loading rate of 9 45 kg tcod m 3 d 1 was achieved steady state was assumed after both the effluent tcod concentration and headspace methane composition had remained constant for at least three residence times 3 results 3 1 total organic reduction versus the volumetric organic loading rate fig 3 plots the tcodred against the volr for 82 treatment processes 65 papers 82 reactor systems table 2 with these data points identified as one of the six reactor types discussed above fig 1 approximately 70 of the reactors reviewed were able to achieve tcodred values above 80 across all organic loading rates considered combined these two observations suggest that all reactor types should achieve this level as a minimum for competitive performance across volumetric organic loading rates as high as 45 kg cod m3 d 1 proposal of a minimum competitive value of tcodred for values of volr above this value is difficult to predict given the lack of literature reports for organic loading rates this high it should be also be noted that when treating some industrial wastewaters that possess a unique toxicity to anaerobic microorganisms the proposed standard may not be achievable these applications are unique and not amenable to cross comparative analysis 3 1 1 volumetric total organic reduction rate versus volumetric organic loading rate fig 4 plots the volumetric total organic reduction rate vtcodred against the volumetric organic loading rate volr for the same set of anaerobic processes table 2 the ideal baseline case which depicts complete reduction of all organics loaded onto the reactor is plotted as a solid line with slope of 1 0 a linearly fitted trend line ŷ overlaid as a dashed line increasingly deviates from ideality with increasing volumetric organic loading rate biochemically this deviation reflects inadequate or disproportionate distribution of nutrients at higher organic loadings a result of ineffective mixing and fluid channeling values of vtcodred falling above the fitted trend line are proposed to be competitive and reflective of efficient mixing and temperature control particularly at higher volr as demonstrated by the slopes of best fit listed in fig 4 inset reactors employing methods of filtration anmbr and huasbpb approached ideal performance i e slopes of 0 94 and 0 93 at the other extreme the pb reactor had the lowest slope 0 72 and the largest deviation from ideality a result of these reactors being more sensitive to ineffective mixing or fluid channeling at high loading rates also listed in the insert of fig 4 are coefficients of determination r2 for each line of best fit the huasbpb mb and anmbr had the highest r2 values 0 99 0 98 and 0 97 respectively representing lower variations in performance this implies that reactors that utilize physical methods of organic removal will experience a lower degree of performance degradation with increasing volr the lowest r2 and largest variability is observed for the pb reactor which is attributed to the varying efficacy of packing materials used within pb systems consequently pb reactors may have the largest potential for innovation by way of novel packing materials that improve fluid mixing and reduce fluid channeling 3 1 2 methane yield versus the volumetric organic loading rate fig 5 plots the methane yield against the volumetric organic loading rate volr for the same set of anaerobic processes out of the 82 reactor operations reviewed approximately 63 provided data on biogas production and or methane yield m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred of those reported several were above the theoretical maximum this counter intuitive result stems either from measurement errors or gas production rates measured at meso or thermophilic temperatures and further reported without normalizing their values back to standard or normal temperature and pressure stp or ntp given the theoretical maximum methane yield is calculated at stp gas production rates should be corrected to stp before being reported in fig 5 significant variation in reported values was observed to be a likely result of wastewater treatments systems being optimized for reduction of cod and bod5 under stable operation as opposed to being optimized for biogas production for this reason it is proposed that a more robust value of 0 25 m3 per kg tcod reduced i e 70 of theoretical methane yield be proposed as a minimum threshold for yields to be considered competitive for volumetric organic loading rates volr up to 30 kg m3 d 1 the lack of experimental data on biogas production at higher volumetric organic loading rates makes it difficult to extend this minimum to higher organic loading rates maintaining its extension to values up to 45 kg cod m3 d 1 however requires efficient reactor design in terms of mixing and temperature regulation as such this minimum threshold can thus represent a legitimate goal that all reactors that should be designed to achieved the mb pb and anmbr reactors performed better with respect to methane yield fig 5 of the five mb reactors that reported biogas production and or methane yield for example none reported methane yields below the minimum target the pb and anmbr reactors by contrast had 33 3 of their reports fall below the minimum while 50 and 60 of the huasbpb and uasb reactors respectively also failed to surpass the minimum this clearly shows that there is potential improvement across a majority of reactor types in improving biogas production and recovery 3 2 summary across all performance indicators 3 2 1 analysis the data in table 2 and plotted in fig 3 through 5 revealed some noteworthy features with respect to cross comparative performance first the huasbpb and anmbr reactors consistently performed well in terms of tcodred and vtcodred while a wide range of reduction efficiencies were observed for the uasb mb and especially pb reactors the uasb reactors however maintained competitive tcodred at high organic loading rates while the mb reactors produced methane yields consistently greater than 0 25 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred followed closely by the pb and anmbr reactors which both produced competitive methane yields second competitive performance with one pi did not guarantee similar performance with the others for example the biochar packed bed reactor i e data point 22 1 in table 2 fell within the competitive band for vtcodred but below the minimum for tcodred although they did not report a methane yield the work of alvarado lassman et al 2008 using an inverse fluidized bed reactor data point 32 in table 2 and the work of chavez et al 2005 using an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor data point 41 in table 2 were competitive for tcodred and vtcodred more the applications using a hollow centered packed bed reactor data points 29 2 and 29 3 in table 2 were both competitive with respect to tcodred and vtcodred but uncompetitive with respect to methane yield these observations suggest that highly competitive performance across all three pis is not easily achieved for example while anmbrs are expected to achieve lower permeate cod as they can achieve complete rejection of solids and subsequently lower effluent cod this system will not necessarily be more effective at converting all residual solids to methane biogas consequently while meeting all three pis is desired it may not always be practical and as such there are additional metrics that can be used their utility will be discussed through an example 3 2 2 perspective the set of performance indicators proposed in this study are only independent of loading rates feeding rate and reactor volume they do not account for other parameters such as temperature and feed properties that can play a significant role in operational performance consequently their application should consider the following comments the upper thresholds are fixed by thermodynamics and are therefore independent of any operating parameter as such their values represent upper limits and experimental data above them should not be reported in this context the pi s serve as a useful check on experimental data the proposed lower thresholds by contrast are developed from trend lines derived from a large breadth of experimental data reported across the literature as such their values represent reasonable expectations of performance failure to meet them must therefore be explained in terms of sub optimal media type operating conditions or reactor design from this perspective the proposed lower thresholds can be used as a useful decision tool with respect to process evaluation or reactor redesign 3 3 application of performance criteria to evaluate a packed bed reactor deploying a novel biofilm support media the proposed performance indicators pi ri and nris are not only useful for cross comparison between groups of reactors they can also be used to evaluate a single reactor against a group or even a single reactor this versatility is now demonstrated by applying them to evaluate an anaerobic packed bed reactor system employing a novel chitosan biochar biofilm support media designed to treat acidic high strength wastewater the operating conditions are presented in table 3 a performance of the system presented in table 3 b c and plotted in figs 3 through 5 as data point 20 in addition the ris and nris were also used to provide additional insight to the performance of a unique reactor system 3 3 1 comparison against literature the system performed well with respect to all pis at a volr of 9 45 kg tcod m 3 d 1 the total organic reduction rate tcodred reached 91 data point 20 fig 4 a result well within the proposed competitive zone the reactor s vtcodred of 8 59 kg m 3 d 1 data point 20 fig 5 also fell within its proposed competitive zone the reactor s methane yield ych4 was 0 294 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred at ambient temperature 22 c when adjusted to stp this was equivalent to 0 272 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred or 78 of the theoretical maximum and above the minimum for competitive performance data point 20 fig 5 in summary the system cross compared well against the literature over all pis with respect to the ri s the system did not perform as well although a decrease in tss between the mixing tank and the anaerobic column demonstrated a superior ability of the support media to retain biomass also the system effluent contained 731 mg l 1 off tss and 261 mg l 1 tbod5 while these values suggest that the novel chitosan biochar packing material performed well it also shows that additional unit operations will be required in order to meet epa discharge requirements the nri s further revealed some key insights on performance at the given volr 9 45 kg m 3 d 1 the system achieved a tcodred of 91 and all volatile organic acids voas with the exception of acetate and butyrate were completely degraded table 3 as discussed in table 1 volatile organic acids are formed as intermediate products in complex multi step fermentation and anaerobic respiration reactions as such their presence can serve as a useful indicator of incomplete metabolism in this example the accumulation of 61 mg l 1 of acetate suggests the biofilms lacked sufficient populations of methanogens relative to aceto and acidogens while the incomplete consumption of butyrate to 23 mg l 1 further suggested a lack of acetogens relative to acidogens and or an inhibition of acetogenic activity together the presence of these two volatile organic acids serve indicate that the composition of microbial communities especially methanogens were not optimized for methane production a high co2 proportion in gas composition was also observed which likewise suggests a lack of effective methanogenic microbial populations and therefore contributed to a less than ideal methane yield despite good performance in terms of tcodred tn measurements showed an apparent production 12 of nitrogen across the reactor system from 365 to 410 mg n l 1 in reality tn measurements are subject to inherent variations that result from a constant cycle of biofilm production and sloughing as such during biofilm production tn values will fall across the reactor as nitrogen is consumed during biofilm sloughing however tn values will appear to rise across the reactor as excess biofilm components enter the sampled discharge stream and contribute to increased levels of nitrogen therefore in biofilm reactors the soluble tn is proposed to be more precise metric to follow and should be preferentially used as a parameter to identify steady state in the present system the stn was found to increase 17 9 across the mixing tank a result attributed to the release of protein nitrogen during hydrolysis of insoluble protein rich compounds by contrast a small reduction 6 5 in stn was observed across the reactor which is attributed to biomass growth similar results were found for tp where variations due to biofilm sloughing contributed to an apparent increase the stp conversely showed a decrease of approximately 15 across the entire system the results from soluble tn and tp measurements indicated small amounts of consumption suggesting that there was very little net growth of biomass and that the majority of energy obtained from reduction of chemical oxygen demand were in cellular metabolism rather than reproduction and biofilm production finally microscopic analysis of the biofilm support media removed from the reactor at the completion of the experiment fig 2c also revealed positive findings with respect to possessing active thin film biofilms the thickest most visible biofilms accumulated on or around the edges of biochar surface while the edges of the chitosan surface had visibly reduced biomass coverage this likely reduced the amount of biofilm that spanned multiple media surfaces and reduced the formation of thick biofilms that would otherwise hinder nutrient diffusion 3 3 2 head to head comparison as discussed above the performance criteria can also be useful in direct comparison between specific reactors to demonstrate this the chitosan biochar system fig 2 data point 20 was compared against the work of lopez and colleagues data point 10 1 in figs 3 through 5 who treated the same wastewater at a similar organic loading rate olr with two corn cobb biochar packed bed anaerobic reactors 3 the pis presented in table 4 show mixed results tcodred for the chitosan biochar support media was 91 compared to 92 for that achieved with the corn cobb packed bed the chitosan biochar system rested slightly above the trend line for vtcodred with respect to volr while the corn cobb system fell slightly below the proposed trend line this indicates the novel chitosan biochar biofilm support media was more efficient at reducing organics loaded onto the reactor per unit reactor volume and time however the corn cobb packed bed reactor showed considerably higher potential for methane recovery 0 343 m3 kg 1 with methane yields nearing theoretical maximum overall the chitosan biochar packing material yielded better performance in 1 out of 3 pis although all pis were within the proposed competitive bands the corn cobb packing material yielded better performance in two pis but fell out of competitive range in one pi 4 conclusions a quantitative set of performance indicators pis that supports cross comparative performance evaluation of liquid phase anaerobic digesters has been proposed while high performance is desired across all pis results show that this is not easily achieved for example the huasbpb and anmbr reactors consistently performed well in terms of tcodred and vtcodred while the pb reactors experienced large variations this variation is attributed to inefficient mixing at high olrs and differing capabilities of packing material as such potential to increase performance exists through future research on improved biofilm support materials and efficient mixing design uasb reactors competitively reduced total chemical oxygen demand tcodred at high volumetric organic loading rates volr but performed poorly in terms of methane yield in contrast mb reactors consistently produced methane yields greater than the minimum 0 25 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred additional metrics to evaluate reactor performance were discussed which included regulatory and non regulatory indicators ris and nris in addition to providing useful evaluation criteria the nris also proved useful in diagnosing performance issues and determining causes of underperformance application of the performance indicators on two different reactors showed that each system performed well with respect to the literature

14407,this work developed and used performance indicators to quantitatively cross compare over 82 liquid phase anaerobic digestion treatment processes technologies results showed that anaerobic membrane reactors generally performed best in terms of reduction of total chemical oxygen demand while upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors exceled with respect to the volumetric reduction of total chemical oxygen demand although packed bed and moving bed reactors showed large variations in reduction of total chemical oxygen demand they generally produced higher methane yields i e 0 25 m3 methane produced per kg total chemical oxygen demand reduced while high performance was desired across all performance indicators it was generally not achieved by any specific reactor type the performance indicators were also used to directly cross compare performance of two separate reactors treating identical wastewater streams result showed that both systems demonstrated good performance relative to the literature but neither was dominant in head to head comparison keywords anaerobic digester cross comparative analysis wastewater treatment 1 introduction the advantages of anaerobic digestion to treat wastewater are well documented anaerobic digestion can robustly process high strength wastewater withstand abrupt disturbances in organic loading rates produce far less biomass does not require energy intensive aeration metabolizes odorous organics that would otherwise escape volatilize under aeration 1 and converts the majority of organic carbon to biogas 2 3 the energy rich biogas if recovered can be used to improve long term economic and environmental sustainability 1 4 indeed a steady rise in fossil fuel prices beginning in the early 1970s has catalyzed a revival in biogas recovery from liquid phase anaerobic digestion especially with industrial wastewaters possessing high organics 1 3 5 6 more recently anaerobic reactors have been combined with low energy aerobic treatment systems e g trickling filters to create low energy systems that treat high strength wastewaters to effluents that meet discharge regulations 1 7 the literature on anaerobic digestion of liquid phase wastewater is broad and with applications spanning types of technology 8 types of wastewater 9 operating parameters 10 toxicants 11 and the production and recovery of bioenergy 12 contributions also address innovations such as interfacing anaerobic digestion with bio electrochemical systems 13 the use of biochar 14 the addition of nutrients 15 the co integration of multiple technologies 16 and even the use of mixed feeds 17 despite this expansive collection of literature reports these analyses remain isolated and focused on application specific criteria while justified these contributions lack standardized criteria to assess relative performance across reactor types although the reports on reductions in organic and or nutrient levels are widespread for example they alone are not adequate to cross compare reactors of different designs the development and use of performance indicators that supports cross comparative analysis addresses this limitation cross comparative analysis is not common in the field of wastewater treatment it is quite common however in other fields such as chemical engineering where reactor optimization is of very high importance as such a quantitative method that provides a basis for cross comparative analysis will provide a unique and useful design and evaluation tool this work evaluates the performance of 82 liquid phase anaerobic digestion treatment processes technologies using performance indicators that provide a quantitative basis for cross comparison the effort has been broken down into four sections first anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies are grouped into one of six reactor types and their key operating principles briefly discussed second baseline metrics that support cross comparison are proposed as performance indicators pis third the pis are used to compare performance and to identify general trends across the literature fourth the pis are used to assess the relative ability of a packed bed anaerobic reactor deploying a novel packing material to process high strength acidic wastewater finally qualitative indicators are presented and used to provide additional information and diagnostic evaluation that complement the performance indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor grouping the literature on anaerobic digestion of high strength wastewater 18 19 spans a broad number of reactor types including the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb anaerobic baffled reactor abr anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr anaerobic plug flow apf anaerobic filter af fluidized bed fb and expanded granular sludge bed reactor egsb 20 hybrid configurations that integrate two or more of these reactor types have also been proposed with the most common utilizing a sludge bed and a fixed film in the lower and upper portions of the reactor respectively 21 27 many of the systems reported in the literature share common characteristics through identification of common features these configurations have been grouped into one of six major reactor types fig 1 1 packed bed pb 2 continuous stirred tank reactor cstr 3 up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb 4 moving bed mb 5 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr and 6 hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge blanket packed bed huasbpb 2 1 1 packed bed pb reactor the pb i e fixed film ff reactors 28 30 employ physically constrained biofilm support media that retain methanogenic microbial biomass within biofilms 31 32 biofilm support media can range from rock plastic wood polyester fibers sand crushed coal anthracite or other natural or synthetic materials 33 they can be deployed as individual units in packed arrangements 34 35 or as solid surfaces that extend the length of the reactor space such as extruded pipes thin rods or vertically oriented corrugated sheets 36 media with high porosity generally provide better performance 37 38 the packed bed design has been reported in many forms i packed bed biofilm reactor pbbr 34 ii up flow anaerobic or anaerobic up flow fixed film uaff or auff reactor 22 39 iii anaerobic down flow stationary fixed film reactor dsff 40 iv up flow anaerobic filter uaf or af 41 v vertical flow biofilm reactor vfbr 36 and vi the horizontal flow biofilm reactor hfbr 42 all share the same basic feature that the wastewater is passed over biofilms attached to fixed support media one significant variation on this theme is the rotating biological contactor wherein the biofilm support media is rotated through an otherwise stationary body of wastewater 43 2 1 2 continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr is a well mixed reactor whose effluent composition is equal to the fluid inside the reactor simple in design well mixed cstrs provide uniform values for temperature and ph 44 46 and when biomass recycle is employed the residence times of biomass sludge and wastewater can be decoupled while cstrs are commonly used in the chemical industry 47 48 their use to treat municipal and industrial wastewaters 49 50 suffers from high energy requirements for mixing especially when applied to viscous solutions 48 49 2 1 3 upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor has emerged as a popular reactor for high rate treatment of high strength industrial and municipal wastewaters 51 53 in contrast to the pb reactor the uasb reactor employs a non fixed bed of flocculated biomass at the bottom of the reactor in the form of a high density blanket of granular sludge flocs through which the wastewater percolates 54 55 variations on the usab reactor include the i expanded granular sludge bed egsb 56 ii internal circulation ic reactor 57 and iii modified internal recirculation mic reactor 58 these systems generally deploy higher height diameter ratios to accommodate higher superficial velocities 4 10 m h 1 realized through recycle 59 flow rates of wastewater through the bed must be sufficient to expand the bed and ensure efficient mixing but not sufficiently rapid to transport the flocs out of the reactor 60 uasb reactors are negatively impacted by high concentrations of suspended solids that foul the sludge bed suffer increased bed thickness and impose longer residence times 61 62 as the flocs are held together by extracellular polysaccharides that form mini biofilm communities they are also hindered by wastewaters rich in fatty acids that destabilize the flocs 63 64 2 1 4 moving bed mb reactors like the pb reactor moving bed mb reactors use biofilm support media but similar to the usab reactor the biofilm support media mix freely in suspension through a combination of agitation e g internal recycle and rising biogas bubbles 65 66 in this context mb reactors incorporate features of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors i e mixing of fluid and biofilm communities and pb reactors i e retention of biomass within biofilms 67 variations of the mb are i the fluidized bed fb 68 69 and ii inverse fluidized bed ifb 70 the biofilm support media in these reactors can vary significantly in the fb and ifb reactors the biofilm support media is typically an inert inorganic material such as sand whereas in the mb reactor the biofilm support media is almost exclusively molded plastics 65 the use of molded plastics has emerged in recent years as a biofilm support structure that provides enhanced protection for biofilms that support self selection for biofilm communities that are optimized for degradation of pollutants in wastewater 2 1 5 anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr membrane reactors are used to treat wastewater in both aerobic 71 and anaerobic environments 72 in both systems wastewater flows under vacuum through biofilm coated microporous membranes that pass liquid but retain solids thus decoupling the hydraulic retention time hrt from the solids residence time srt 73 74 membrane styles used in mbr s are tubular hollow fiber and flat sheet 75 76 they are also deployed in two principle configurations side stream membrane connected externally to the reactor and submerged membrane submerged inside the reactor 77 78 membrane reactors are classified by pore size micro filtration mf 0 05 to 5 μm ultrafiltration uf 0 005 to 0 5 μm nanofiltration nf 0 001 to 0 005 μm and reverse osmosis ro 0 0001 to 0 001 μm 78 79 although anaerobic membrane reactors are energy intensive their effluents are well poised to meet stringent discharge requirements including tss 80 86 additionally studies have shown that net positive energy systems can be realized when including methane recovery 87 2 1 6 hybrid uasb and packed bed huasbpb reactors the hybrid reactor has evolved to take advantage of both suspended and attached growth 88 these reactors place the usab at the bottom and the pb at the top of the reactor to form a barrier against upward flowing biomass flocs and undigested suspended solids 89 91 they thus retain the advantage of good contact between biomass and wastewater yet eliminate the disadvantage of losing biomass to the effluent at higher flow rates or biogas production rates the pb also provides a zone of attached biomass to improve process stability under transient operating conditions 92 2 2 cross comparative performance indicators pis although the literature is full of reports describing the performance of reactors as a function of operating parameters and feedstocks methods to cross compare performance is lacking performance indicators pis that permit quantitative cross comparison of liquid phase anaerobic digesters therefore are critical to their design and evaluation one of the most important functions of anaerobic reactors is their capacity to reduce the organic strength of wastewater either measured by reduction in total chemical oxygen demand tcod or total five day biochemical oxygen demand tbod5 93 over the last decade rising costs of energy have also weighted the value of energy recovery 94 95 as such both organic reduction and methane yields serve as the vital metrics to provide cross comparison across reactor types their use in the development of pis is now presented 2 2 1 total organic reduction the total organic reduction is measured as the percent reduction in total chemical oxygen demand tcod across the inlet and exit of the wastewater treatment system reported in units of percent the total reduction in chemical oxygen demand is 1 t c o d r e d t c o d f e e d t c o d e f f l u e n t t c o d f e e d 100 eq 1 uses the total form of cod i e tcod in order to account for the chemical oxygen demand cod captured in particulates that will eventually solubilize alternatively the total five day biological oxygen demand tbod5 could be used but given its inherent 5 day time delay the more rapid tcod measurement is used and reported more often in the literature the other useful feature to the tcod is its ability to fully oxidize the sample even in the presence of toxins or other compounds that can interfere with microbial metabolism 2 2 2 volumetric total organic reduction rate although useful as an absolute measurement the total organic reduction as tcod does not account for reaction time or reactor volume two parameters important to cross comparative analysis of reactors to address this the volumetric organic reduction rate v t c o d r e d is proposed reported in units of kg m 3 d 1 the total volumetric chemical oxygen demand or volumetric organic reduction rate is 2 v t c o d r e d k g m 3 d t c o d f t c o d e f f l u e n t h r t t c o d f t c o d e f f l u e n t f i n v r x r where vrxr is the effective reactor volume m3 and hrt is the hydraulic retention time d defined as the ratio of the reactor volume vrxr to inlet flow rate of wastewater fin m3 d 1 2 2 3 methane yield the methane production rate m3 d 1 is also an important metric for cross comparative analysis it is calculated by measuring the rate of total biogas production and multiplying it by the percent of methane present in the headspace gas the volumetric methane production rate is related to the reactor volume vrxr as 3 v c h 4 m 3 d 1 m 3 c h 4 v r x r where c h 4 is rate of methane production m3 d 1 and vrxr is the volume of the reactor m3 although valuable the volumetric methane production rate does not address the efficiency of methane biogas production a value that is dependent on the reduction in total volumetric chemical oxygen demand kg m 3 d 1 and its complete conversion to methane a more useful form methane yield y c h 4 addresses the ability of the system to reduce organic carbon to methane biogas and is calculated as 4 y c h 4 m 3 k g t c o d r e d v c h 4 v t c o d r e d assuming ideal gas behavior at standard temperature and pressure stp the maximum theoretical yield is 0 35 m3 ch4 per kg tcod reduced 96 from this perspective the tcod is preferential to tbod5 due to the ability to accurately determine the theoretical upper limit on biogas production 2 2 4 cross comparative analysis to ensure cross comparative analysis across reactor types the pis should be plotted against the volumetric organic loading rate v o l r a term that quantifies the rate at which oxygen demand chemical or biological is loaded onto the reactor as a function of reactor volume the v o l r is calculated from the organic loading rate o l r which is first calculated as 5 o l r k g d t c o d f f i n where tcodf is the chemical oxygen demand kg m 3 and fin is the volumetric flow rate m3 d 1 of the wastewater feed the v o l r is now obtained when the o l r is evaluated relative to the volume of the reactor specifically 6 v o l r k g m 3 d o l r v r x r where the volumetric organic loading rate v o l r incorporates the strength of feed wastewater reactor volume footprint and feed flow rate time required for treatment as reactor performance with respect to a given metric can drop dramatically at higher organic loading rates plotting the three pis against this term affords a truly balanced cross comparative analysis 2 3 additional performance indicators several metrics often used to evaluate anaerobic digestion of wastewater were not judged useful for the purpose of cross comparative analysis of anaerobic reactor performance one reason is that these metrics often include additional tertiary unit operations that do not utilize anaerobic digestion as such they are not useful for direct cross comparison of anaerobic digesters they can still be used however to add insight to performance analysis these additional metrics are now grouped into two categories regulated and unregulated indicators 2 3 1 regulated indicators ris regulated indicators ris represent those metrics a wastewater treatment system must meet in order to satisfy discharge permit requirements the total biological oxygen demand tbod5 which measures the amount of dissolved molecular oxygen that is reduced i e removed from solution by microbial metabolism during a five day incubation period 97 is one such parameter in practice the tbod5 measures the biological oxygen load imposed by the treated wastewater upon the environment when discharged to surface or underground waters the total suspended solids tss is another regulated pollutant that wastewater treatment systems must also address in order to meet secondary discharge limits in practice the tss represents the amount of organic and inorganic solid material in a wastewater sample that will not pass through a 1 5 μm filter since meeting the tbod5 and tss discharged requirements is typically achieved using additional downstream unit operations they were not used as a direct performance indicator for cross comparative analysis of anaerobic digesters they are useful however to analyze reactor performance 2 3 2 non regulated indicators nris non regulated indicators nris such as the effluent concentration of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp are also metrics increasingly mentioned for regulation at the state and local levels their reduction across the reactors can also be useful to diagnose uncompetitive reactor performance table 1 provides a brief summary of common nri s along with a short description of their value for a greater discussion the reader is directed to a number of literature presentations 98 102 2 4 system description of packed bed reactor deploying a novel biofilm support media in addition to cross comparative analysis of literature reports on anaerobic reactors this work has also applied the proposed performance metrics to evaluate an experimental system deploying a novel biofilm support media to treat acid wastewater the experimental system comprises an initial mixing tank mt followed by a single packed bed column reactor fig 2 the anaerobic column reactor ad was packed with a novel biofilm support media composed of wood based biochar pieces size 4 6 mm embedded onto the surface of circular chitosan biopolymer discs fig 2a c while biochar has been demonstrated to be a superior surface for retention of methanogenic microbial communities 3 chitosan surfaces have been recognized for their antimicrobial properties 110 the combination of a stimulatory biochar surface embedded within an inhibitory chitosan surface was hypothesized to create a biofilm support media that limits overall biofilm growth to a thin film thin film biofilms of methanogenic microbial communities should provide maximum surface area to volume ratio of active biofilms and minimize mass transfer resistance internal recycle was used to improve mixing fig 2 6 the effluent from the ad reactor was intermittently recycled back to the initial mixing tank fig 2 7 for the purpose of passive ph control as described elsewhere 111 this step allows for ph control without adding base externally all liquid and gas phase measurements were conducted using standardized methods as described previously 3 112 with the exception of gas production rates which were measured using a bubble column the novel chitosan biochar packing material was tested over a 6 month period under increasing organic load until the final organic loading rate of 9 45 kg tcod m 3 d 1 was achieved steady state was assumed after both the effluent tcod concentration and headspace methane composition had remained constant for at least three residence times 3 results 3 1 total organic reduction versus the volumetric organic loading rate fig 3 plots the tcodred against the volr for 82 treatment processes 65 papers 82 reactor systems table 2 with these data points identified as one of the six reactor types discussed above fig 1 approximately 70 of the reactors reviewed were able to achieve tcodred values above 80 across all organic loading rates considered combined these two observations suggest that all reactor types should achieve this level as a minimum for competitive performance across volumetric organic loading rates as high as 45 kg cod m3 d 1 proposal of a minimum competitive value of tcodred for values of volr above this value is difficult to predict given the lack of literature reports for organic loading rates this high it should be also be noted that when treating some industrial wastewaters that possess a unique toxicity to anaerobic microorganisms the proposed standard may not be achievable these applications are unique and not amenable to cross comparative analysis 3 1 1 volumetric total organic reduction rate versus volumetric organic loading rate fig 4 plots the volumetric total organic reduction rate vtcodred against the volumetric organic loading rate volr for the same set of anaerobic processes table 2 the ideal baseline case which depicts complete reduction of all organics loaded onto the reactor is plotted as a solid line with slope of 1 0 a linearly fitted trend line ŷ overlaid as a dashed line increasingly deviates from ideality with increasing volumetric organic loading rate biochemically this deviation reflects inadequate or disproportionate distribution of nutrients at higher organic loadings a result of ineffective mixing and fluid channeling values of vtcodred falling above the fitted trend line are proposed to be competitive and reflective of efficient mixing and temperature control particularly at higher volr as demonstrated by the slopes of best fit listed in fig 4 inset reactors employing methods of filtration anmbr and huasbpb approached ideal performance i e slopes of 0 94 and 0 93 at the other extreme the pb reactor had the lowest slope 0 72 and the largest deviation from ideality a result of these reactors being more sensitive to ineffective mixing or fluid channeling at high loading rates also listed in the insert of fig 4 are coefficients of determination r2 for each line of best fit the huasbpb mb and anmbr had the highest r2 values 0 99 0 98 and 0 97 respectively representing lower variations in performance this implies that reactors that utilize physical methods of organic removal will experience a lower degree of performance degradation with increasing volr the lowest r2 and largest variability is observed for the pb reactor which is attributed to the varying efficacy of packing materials used within pb systems consequently pb reactors may have the largest potential for innovation by way of novel packing materials that improve fluid mixing and reduce fluid channeling 3 1 2 methane yield versus the volumetric organic loading rate fig 5 plots the methane yield against the volumetric organic loading rate volr for the same set of anaerobic processes out of the 82 reactor operations reviewed approximately 63 provided data on biogas production and or methane yield m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred of those reported several were above the theoretical maximum this counter intuitive result stems either from measurement errors or gas production rates measured at meso or thermophilic temperatures and further reported without normalizing their values back to standard or normal temperature and pressure stp or ntp given the theoretical maximum methane yield is calculated at stp gas production rates should be corrected to stp before being reported in fig 5 significant variation in reported values was observed to be a likely result of wastewater treatments systems being optimized for reduction of cod and bod5 under stable operation as opposed to being optimized for biogas production for this reason it is proposed that a more robust value of 0 25 m3 per kg tcod reduced i e 70 of theoretical methane yield be proposed as a minimum threshold for yields to be considered competitive for volumetric organic loading rates volr up to 30 kg m3 d 1 the lack of experimental data on biogas production at higher volumetric organic loading rates makes it difficult to extend this minimum to higher organic loading rates maintaining its extension to values up to 45 kg cod m3 d 1 however requires efficient reactor design in terms of mixing and temperature regulation as such this minimum threshold can thus represent a legitimate goal that all reactors that should be designed to achieved the mb pb and anmbr reactors performed better with respect to methane yield fig 5 of the five mb reactors that reported biogas production and or methane yield for example none reported methane yields below the minimum target the pb and anmbr reactors by contrast had 33 3 of their reports fall below the minimum while 50 and 60 of the huasbpb and uasb reactors respectively also failed to surpass the minimum this clearly shows that there is potential improvement across a majority of reactor types in improving biogas production and recovery 3 2 summary across all performance indicators 3 2 1 analysis the data in table 2 and plotted in fig 3 through 5 revealed some noteworthy features with respect to cross comparative performance first the huasbpb and anmbr reactors consistently performed well in terms of tcodred and vtcodred while a wide range of reduction efficiencies were observed for the uasb mb and especially pb reactors the uasb reactors however maintained competitive tcodred at high organic loading rates while the mb reactors produced methane yields consistently greater than 0 25 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred followed closely by the pb and anmbr reactors which both produced competitive methane yields second competitive performance with one pi did not guarantee similar performance with the others for example the biochar packed bed reactor i e data point 22 1 in table 2 fell within the competitive band for vtcodred but below the minimum for tcodred although they did not report a methane yield the work of alvarado lassman et al 2008 using an inverse fluidized bed reactor data point 32 in table 2 and the work of chavez et al 2005 using an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor data point 41 in table 2 were competitive for tcodred and vtcodred more the applications using a hollow centered packed bed reactor data points 29 2 and 29 3 in table 2 were both competitive with respect to tcodred and vtcodred but uncompetitive with respect to methane yield these observations suggest that highly competitive performance across all three pis is not easily achieved for example while anmbrs are expected to achieve lower permeate cod as they can achieve complete rejection of solids and subsequently lower effluent cod this system will not necessarily be more effective at converting all residual solids to methane biogas consequently while meeting all three pis is desired it may not always be practical and as such there are additional metrics that can be used their utility will be discussed through an example 3 2 2 perspective the set of performance indicators proposed in this study are only independent of loading rates feeding rate and reactor volume they do not account for other parameters such as temperature and feed properties that can play a significant role in operational performance consequently their application should consider the following comments the upper thresholds are fixed by thermodynamics and are therefore independent of any operating parameter as such their values represent upper limits and experimental data above them should not be reported in this context the pi s serve as a useful check on experimental data the proposed lower thresholds by contrast are developed from trend lines derived from a large breadth of experimental data reported across the literature as such their values represent reasonable expectations of performance failure to meet them must therefore be explained in terms of sub optimal media type operating conditions or reactor design from this perspective the proposed lower thresholds can be used as a useful decision tool with respect to process evaluation or reactor redesign 3 3 application of performance criteria to evaluate a packed bed reactor deploying a novel biofilm support media the proposed performance indicators pi ri and nris are not only useful for cross comparison between groups of reactors they can also be used to evaluate a single reactor against a group or even a single reactor this versatility is now demonstrated by applying them to evaluate an anaerobic packed bed reactor system employing a novel chitosan biochar biofilm support media designed to treat acidic high strength wastewater the operating conditions are presented in table 3 a performance of the system presented in table 3 b c and plotted in figs 3 through 5 as data point 20 in addition the ris and nris were also used to provide additional insight to the performance of a unique reactor system 3 3 1 comparison against literature the system performed well with respect to all pis at a volr of 9 45 kg tcod m 3 d 1 the total organic reduction rate tcodred reached 91 data point 20 fig 4 a result well within the proposed competitive zone the reactor s vtcodred of 8 59 kg m 3 d 1 data point 20 fig 5 also fell within its proposed competitive zone the reactor s methane yield ych4 was 0 294 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred at ambient temperature 22 c when adjusted to stp this was equivalent to 0 272 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred or 78 of the theoretical maximum and above the minimum for competitive performance data point 20 fig 5 in summary the system cross compared well against the literature over all pis with respect to the ri s the system did not perform as well although a decrease in tss between the mixing tank and the anaerobic column demonstrated a superior ability of the support media to retain biomass also the system effluent contained 731 mg l 1 off tss and 261 mg l 1 tbod5 while these values suggest that the novel chitosan biochar packing material performed well it also shows that additional unit operations will be required in order to meet epa discharge requirements the nri s further revealed some key insights on performance at the given volr 9 45 kg m 3 d 1 the system achieved a tcodred of 91 and all volatile organic acids voas with the exception of acetate and butyrate were completely degraded table 3 as discussed in table 1 volatile organic acids are formed as intermediate products in complex multi step fermentation and anaerobic respiration reactions as such their presence can serve as a useful indicator of incomplete metabolism in this example the accumulation of 61 mg l 1 of acetate suggests the biofilms lacked sufficient populations of methanogens relative to aceto and acidogens while the incomplete consumption of butyrate to 23 mg l 1 further suggested a lack of acetogens relative to acidogens and or an inhibition of acetogenic activity together the presence of these two volatile organic acids serve indicate that the composition of microbial communities especially methanogens were not optimized for methane production a high co2 proportion in gas composition was also observed which likewise suggests a lack of effective methanogenic microbial populations and therefore contributed to a less than ideal methane yield despite good performance in terms of tcodred tn measurements showed an apparent production 12 of nitrogen across the reactor system from 365 to 410 mg n l 1 in reality tn measurements are subject to inherent variations that result from a constant cycle of biofilm production and sloughing as such during biofilm production tn values will fall across the reactor as nitrogen is consumed during biofilm sloughing however tn values will appear to rise across the reactor as excess biofilm components enter the sampled discharge stream and contribute to increased levels of nitrogen therefore in biofilm reactors the soluble tn is proposed to be more precise metric to follow and should be preferentially used as a parameter to identify steady state in the present system the stn was found to increase 17 9 across the mixing tank a result attributed to the release of protein nitrogen during hydrolysis of insoluble protein rich compounds by contrast a small reduction 6 5 in stn was observed across the reactor which is attributed to biomass growth similar results were found for tp where variations due to biofilm sloughing contributed to an apparent increase the stp conversely showed a decrease of approximately 15 across the entire system the results from soluble tn and tp measurements indicated small amounts of consumption suggesting that there was very little net growth of biomass and that the majority of energy obtained from reduction of chemical oxygen demand were in cellular metabolism rather than reproduction and biofilm production finally microscopic analysis of the biofilm support media removed from the reactor at the completion of the experiment fig 2c also revealed positive findings with respect to possessing active thin film biofilms the thickest most visible biofilms accumulated on or around the edges of biochar surface while the edges of the chitosan surface had visibly reduced biomass coverage this likely reduced the amount of biofilm that spanned multiple media surfaces and reduced the formation of thick biofilms that would otherwise hinder nutrient diffusion 3 3 2 head to head comparison as discussed above the performance criteria can also be useful in direct comparison between specific reactors to demonstrate this the chitosan biochar system fig 2 data point 20 was compared against the work of lopez and colleagues data point 10 1 in figs 3 through 5 who treated the same wastewater at a similar organic loading rate olr with two corn cobb biochar packed bed anaerobic reactors 3 the pis presented in table 4 show mixed results tcodred for the chitosan biochar support media was 91 compared to 92 for that achieved with the corn cobb packed bed the chitosan biochar system rested slightly above the trend line for vtcodred with respect to volr while the corn cobb system fell slightly below the proposed trend line this indicates the novel chitosan biochar biofilm support media was more efficient at reducing organics loaded onto the reactor per unit reactor volume and time however the corn cobb packed bed reactor showed considerably higher potential for methane recovery 0 343 m3 kg 1 with methane yields nearing theoretical maximum overall the chitosan biochar packing material yielded better performance in 1 out of 3 pis although all pis were within the proposed competitive bands the corn cobb packing material yielded better performance in two pis but fell out of competitive range in one pi 4 conclusions a quantitative set of performance indicators pis that supports cross comparative performance evaluation of liquid phase anaerobic digesters has been proposed while high performance is desired across all pis results show that this is not easily achieved for example the huasbpb and anmbr reactors consistently performed well in terms of tcodred and vtcodred while the pb reactors experienced large variations this variation is attributed to inefficient mixing at high olrs and differing capabilities of packing material as such potential to increase performance exists through future research on improved biofilm support materials and efficient mixing design uasb reactors competitively reduced total chemical oxygen demand tcodred at high volumetric organic loading rates volr but performed poorly in terms of methane yield in contrast mb reactors consistently produced methane yields greater than the minimum 0 25 m3 ch4 kg 1 tcodred additional metrics to evaluate reactor performance were discussed which included regulatory and non regulatory indicators ris and nris in addition to providing useful evaluation criteria the nris also proved useful in diagnosing performance issues and determining causes of underperformance application of the performance indicators on two different reactors showed that each system performed well with respect to the literature

14408,trihalomethanes thms are carcinogenic compounds formed during water chlorination nature of source water and treatment conditions significantly influence its formation chlorine reactivity and trihalomethanes formation potential of water samples taken from three different sources such as the sea open reservoir and palar river subsoil were assessed for a period from 2013 to 2017 with respect to key determinants uv absorbance 254 nm values of all the water samples n 175 varied from 0 033 to 0 09 with dissolved organic carbon doc ranged between 1 08 1 88 0 69 2 15 0 66 1 98 mg l for seawater open reservoir and palar subsoil water respectively though uv absorbance uv254 was positively correlated with doc content specific uva254 suva254 did not correlate with doc consistent nonlinear increase in chlorine demand with increasing dose and time was observed which differs in magnitude for three water sources thm formation potential followed the order reservoir seawater palar subsoil the seasonal average of thms 5 mg l dose 24 h contact time was the highest for open reservoir water samples ranging from 151 62 southwest monsoon 198 25 μg l post northeast monsoon as compared to that of the seawater max 105 60 μg l and palar subsoil water max 119 66 μg l among the three sources thm in open reservoir water sample only exhibited positive correlation with its doc water quality parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen nitrate total nitrogen failed to establish a clear correlation with thms yield which indicated the overriding influence of simultaneous occurring reactions among all the parameters chlorine demand appeared to be a better surrogate to predict trihalomethanes formation regardless of water sources keywords disinfection by products trihalomethanes chlorination water quality water sources 1 introduction chlorination is one of the most used methods to disinfect drinking water and to control biofouling in industrial water utilities among there are many chemical processes chlorination is the most popular method all over the world this is due to 1 its strong oxidising potential 2 its proven effectiveness against broad spectrum of microorganism 3 its availability at relatively cheaper rate and 4 its ability to provide chlorine residual throughout the water distribution system unlike the other methods such as uv disinfection 1 the variability of chlorine demand cd of water which is referred to the portion of applied chlorine consumed by the chemical and biological constituent present in natural waters makes it difficult to maintain adequate and uniform residual in the water utilities physico chemical properties of water such as temperature ph chlorophyll organic matter nitrogen etc have an significant impact on chlorine demand since the water quality parameters show a considerable degree of temporal variation chlorine demand of water also fluctuates accordingly thus in addition to the chlorine demand assessment simultaneous investigation on essential factors responsible for its variations are crucial in spite of being the easiest and economical method of disinfection chlorination has its disadvantages as well regulatory limit of chlorine in drinking water to be low and thus acute exposure is not generally expected however long term exposure to chlorinated water increases the risk of cancer due to the presence of chlorination by products in the treated water concerns have been expressed since mid seventies about the apparent threat to human health due to the exposure to these chlorination by products cbps the by products formed during the reactions between chlorine and natural organic matters noms is of more concern as they are mostly carcinogens 2 4 exposure to chlorinated water has been shown to increase the risk of bladder colon and rectal cancer the cbps that are of most concerning health issues are trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas recent studies have linked thms to liver and kidney damage retarded fetus growth congenital disabilities and possibly miscarriage 3 5 even at low concentrations these could be toxic carcinogenic teratogenic and possibly mutagenic 6 9 when chlorine undergoes substitution reaction with organic matter such as humic acids fulvic acids proteins and amino acids halogenated organics such as thms and haas are formed 10 11 cbps formation in water is a function of several factors including temperature ph contact time the concentration of bromides residual chlorine and natural dom 4 12 14 thms are considered as the most dominant fractions of all the by products formed in the process of chlorination and u s environmental protection agency usepa has set maximum contamination level goal mclg of 80 μg l for total thms 15 thms consist of four compounds such as chloroform chcl3 bromodichloromethane chbrcl2 dibromochloromethane chbr2cl and bromoform chbr3 generally chloroform is the dominant fraction during freshwater chlorination whereas presence of 65 mg l of bromide in seawater leads to formation of bromoform mainly with a low quantity of dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromodichloromethane bdcm 16 18 bromine containing biocides are likely to produce more halogenated organics than chlorine 19 but have not been extensively studied scrutiny of available literature on thm formation potential of natural water sources from india as well as from all over the world showed that studies in this regard are scanty 1 20 22 moreover reports related to thm production from industrial uses of water particularly seawater are meagrely available chlorination of seawater is a normal practice during its use for various purposes such as cooling water for thermal power plant and swimming pool desalination aquaculture 16 23 26 which has potential to produce cbps that pose human health risk 19 atmospheric volatilisation of the cbps present in the effluents of these water utilities can affect human health through inhalation and also results subsequent photolysis to harmful reactive oxidants 27 28 most of the existing investigations on thm formation potential of natural water have been undertaken for short monitoring duration and more thus studies are required for the results to be useful for the management of water work 29 with the above background investigations were carried out to find out the influence of temporal water quality changes on the chlorine demand and total trihalomethanes tthm formation potential of three distinct types of the water source these water sources are either used for industrial applications or as potable water viz sea swr palar river subsoil plr and open reservoir rsr available at kalpakkam tamil nadu kalpakkam 12 33 n and 80 11 e is an emerging nuclear hub of india with various nuclear facilities such as madras atomic power station maps fast breeder test reactor fbtr prototype fast breeder reactor pfbr indira gandhi centre for atomic research igcar desalination plants fast reactor fuel cycle facility frfcf etc all these installations use seawater as well as freshwater for various purposes seawater is used at 35 m3 s 1 for condenser cooling at maps biofouling has been a constant problem in the cooling system at maps to effectively control the biofouling which is responsible for the reduction in heat transfer blockage of condenser tubes damage to pipelines and pumps etc low dose continuous chlorination is being practiced at maps a residual of 0 1 0 2 mg l is maintained at the outfall discharge the coastal water at kalpakkam is mainly influenced by the active ne monsoon during which about 60 of the annual rainfall 1250 mm is received subsequently during the post monsoon and sw monsoon the coastal condition stabilizes an open reservoir is used for condenser cooling at fbtr feed water for demineralization plants various r d laboratories of igcar as well as for drinking purpose the reservoir receives water from palar river bed through infiltration wells located about 20 km away from kalpakkam 30 and is transported to the reservoir through a 60 cm diameter cast iron pipe palar river stretch located near coast does not hold surface water most of the time and thus sub soil water is collected through infiltration wells the 10 year old reservoir sustains a massive growth of micro and macro vegetation the 30 000 m3 capacity reservoir spreads over an area of about 2 ha with a maximum depth of 3 m 30 it has been reported that sub soil water with higher nutrient concentrations when stored openly exposing to the sun resulted in growth of plants planktonic as well as macrophytes that led to substantial deterioration in water quality from its utility point of view as a condenser cooling medium and as a raw water input for dm plant 31 in the present study a comparative account of chlorine demand and tthm formation potential of seawater palar sub soil water and open reservoir water is provided in details this study also explored the influence of various water quality descriptors on the magnitude of chlorine demand and the trihalomethanes formation potential 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and

electron capture detector gc ecd chemito 1000 mumbai india according to u s environmental protection agency method 501 2 with some modifications at the time interval as mentioned above time intervals chlorinated water samples were quenched with sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 to arrest further chlorine reactions 5 ml of chlorinated water was extracted with 2 ml of pentane and 1 μl of pentane extract

characteristics of the three water sources are given in table 1 seawater temperature ranged from 27 2 to 32 5 29 45 1 26 oc temperature showed a bimodal oscillation with relatively low temperature values during the monsoon period the water temperature was always found to be higher in open reservoir water than that of palar sub soil water it ranged from 24 9 to 33 6 30 14 1 98 and 25 9 34 5 30 38 2 15 oc in the palar sub soil water and open reservoir respectively table 1 the apparent increase in water temperature in the case of the open reservoir as compared to palar subsoil water was due to its direct exposure to atmosphere and sunlight the ph of seawater ranged from 7 8 to 8 4 with an average value of 8 15 0 15 relatively low ph was observed during the ne monsoon and it was stable for almost rest of the year in case of palar sub soil water ph values ranged from 7 1 to 8 2 with the average of 7 5 0 3 the open reservoir water ph values were higher than those of the palar sub soil water it ranged from 7 5 to 9 7 with an average of 8 5 0 5 the distinct variations in ph of these two water bodies could be attributed to the photosynthetic activity by phytoplankton and macrophytes in the reservoir leading to the increase in ph 31 34 ph is an important parameter that significantly influences the efficiency of chlorination at increased ph 8 5 most of the hocl remains in ocl 95 form and hocl is many times more effective than ocl 30 35 conductivity ec of seawater ranged from 38440 to 55900 μs cm 49590 5130 relatively low ec values were observed during the ne monsoon and the higher values were observed during summer sw monsoon ec of the reservoir water was found to be higher than that of sub soil water it ranged from 268 to 1460 482 200 and 143 917 524 185 μs cm for palar sub soil water and open reservoir water respectively relatively low conductivity values in the reservoir as well as that of the sub soil water have coincided with ne monsoon period possibly due to the dilution caused by pure rainwater average value during study period showed an overall increase of about 40 μs cm in conductivity in the open reservoir do content in the seawater ranged from 4 36 to 7 62 5 9 0 75 mg l the open coastal water at this location is well oxygenated due to proper mixing and phytoplankton production throughout the year 36 in aquatic systems oxygenation is the result of an imbalance between the process of photosynthesis degradation of organic matter and reaeration 37 relatively high do values were observed in the reservoir water as compared to palar sub soil water it ranged from 3 33 to 6 96 5 93 0 78 mg l and 3 84 10 55 7 72 1 55 mg l in the sub soil water and reservoir water respectively palar water being subsoil water doesn t come in contact with atmospheric oxygen and consequently do values were relatively low whereas photosynthesis in the open reservoir enhanced the do content in water nitrogenous nutrients such as nitrate ammonia and tn were estimated to find out their impact on chlorine demand and tthm formation nitrate values ranged from bdl 1 94 mg l for seawater it ranged from 0 01 to 2 09 mg l and bdl 0 95 mg l for the sub soil and reservoir water respectively table 1 its concentration in palar water was considerably higher than the open reservoir water average ammonia concentration did not show any visible difference between seawater and palar sub soil water however it was relatively low in the open reservoir tn concentration of the palar sub soil water was found to be relatively high as compared to seawater and open reservoir water the concentration of total nitrogen in palar sub soil water ranged from 0 02 to 1 21 mg l with an average of 0 26 mg l tn values in open reservoir water varied from bdl to 0 82 mg l with an average of 0 15 mg l bromide which is an essential parameter for the formation of thms was estimated for all the three water bodies it ranged from 59 77 to 67 89 mg l in seawater the concentration of bromide observed at the palar sub soil and open reservoir water was remained to be less than 1 mg l with very few values in the palar subsoil water samples exceeding 1 mg l high nutrient content observed in the palar sub soil water was possibly due to the residual fertilizer runoff from the surrounding agricultural land which uses both phosphate and nitrogenous based fertilizers observed significant reduction in phosphate and nitrate concentration from palar to open reservoir water is due to their utilization by microorganisms and macrophytes phosphates and nitrates are the primary nutrient requirements for high productivity in any water body their presence in optimum concentrations in palar water leads to high biological activity and extensive growth of macrophytes such as vallisneria najas and ceratophyllum in the reservoir water in the presence of sunlight an essential element for primary production 31 the luxuriant bio growth in the open reservoir ecosystem makes it entirely a different one from the palar sub soil water system a recent study from the same reservoir reported an increase in organic matter content due to the growth of micro and macrophytes substantiating our above observation on photosynthetic activity 34 3 2 biological parameters biological parameters such as chlorophyll doc and uva254 are essential descriptors for the formation of thms and their spatiotemporal variations affect its quantity and quality in water bodies chlorophyll a the universal pigment that forms a dominant fraction of the phytopigments ranged from 0 03 to 8 22 mg m3 in seawater samples it ranged from bdl 4 58 mg m3 and 1 12 48 97 mg m3 for the palar sub soil and open reservoir water respectively the increase in chlorophyll a content noticed in the open reservoir was due to the micro and macrophyte growth in the open reservoir uva254 and the subsequently calculated suva254 have been correlated with tthm formation potential to find out the role of organics in this process doc values for the seawater ranged from 1 08 to 1 88 mg l with an average value of 1 44 0 20 mg l the palar sub soil water doc values average 126 0 35 mg l were marginally lower than that of the open reservoir average 1 50 0 36 the biological growth in the open reservoir has led to an increase in doc content as compared to the palar sub soil water the uva254 values ranged from 0 033 to 0 075 cm 1 with an average value of 0 056 0 011 cm 1 for seawater the corresponding suva254 values ranged from 2 307 to 6 043 l mg m the variations in uva254 and suva254 values in the palar sub soil water and open reservoir water were almost identical table 1 these two water sources exhibited low uva254 absorption in water such as those containing humic fractions it is often observed that uv absorbance at 254 nm is strongly correlated to doc content 38 in the present study uva254 was positively correlated with doc content in all the three water sources in contrast the suva254 values were negatively associated with doc in seawater and palar water samples tables 2 4 3 3 chlorine demand chlorine demand cd of the water generally decides the dose required for disinfection it is influenced by parameters like organic matter ph temperature uva254 nh3 and other inorganic compounds cd is also a function of both time and initial chlorine dose cd values for all the three source water types at different initial chlorine concentrations 1 3 5 mg l and time intervals 0 25 and 1 h during the study period are given in fig 1 though not linear consistent increase in chlorine demand with increasing dose and time was observed in all the three water sources it ranged from 1 12 to 3 11 1 86 0 49 0 60 2 79 1 27 0 50 and 0 89 2 81 1 70 0 44 mg l for 5 mg l cl2 dose 1 h contact time in the seawater n 46 palar subsoil n 61 and open reservoir samples n 68 respectively table 5 fig 1 also depicts the extremely variable nature of chlorine demand and a strong influence of the applied chlorine dose the variability of cd increased at higher chlorine dose this observation may be due to various factors such as limiting chlorine residual at lower dose and participation of resistant organic molecule at higher chlorine dose the above uncertainties pose higher difficulty in predicting the chlorine demand at a higher dose than at lower dose comparatively low chlorine demand of the palar sub soil water could be due to its low reactive organic matter content as compared to the other two water sources relatively high doc and chl a content in the open reservoir water and seawater due to in situ biological activities resulted in higher cd than the palar sub soil water cd for 1 and 3 mg l doses showed a positive correlation with uva254 and suva254 in seawater however the correlation at 5 mg l dose was insignificant on the contrary the cd at 5 mg l dose showed a positive correlation with chl a content the above observations indicated that the phytopigment might be resistant to chlorine reaction at a lower dose and reacted at a higher dose in seawater in case of palar sub soil water and open reservoir water correlations among cd at 1 3 mg l dose of chlorine and uva suva were insignificant at 5 mg l dose however a positive correlation was observed between cd and uva in the palar water and cd and suva in open reservoir water as per the climatology of the study location annual cycle is divided into three seasons such as south west monsoon swm june september north east monsoon nem october january post monsoon pom february may all the data 2013 2017 were pooled into three seasons such as swm nem and pom seasonal variation in cd 5 mg l dose and 1 h contact time showed a distinct trend in case of palar sub soil and open reservoir water however seasonal impact on the cd variation was minimum for the seawater samples fig 2 this indicates the prominent role of the reactivity of the organic matter which superseded the effect due to the temporal input of organic matter into the seawater the increase in cd for palar sub soil water and open reservoir water during nem and post nem period could be ascribed to the increase in biological growth during these periods in the presence of optimal nutrient concentration in the water sources on the other hand the cd of seawater was relatively high during the swm and nem as compared to that of the palar sub soil and open reservoir water it showed that despite the allocthonous inputs during the monsoon season the dynamics of the coastal water helped to maintain its homogeneity in the physicochemical and biological properties 3 4 tthm formation potential the critical factors that influence the formation of thms include contact time cd temperature ph the concentration of precursors and bromide ions there was considerable disparity in these parameters observed for three different water sources which had significantly affected the load and distribution of thms similar to that of cd a linear increase in total thms level was observed for different chlorine doses and contact times fig 3 among the three water sources the open reservoir water sample was found to have the highest thms formation potential table 5 as expected the palar subsoil water which had relatively low doc chl a uva254 level had the lowest thm forming potential the tthms levels for 0 5 h contact time were relatively high for all the chlorine doses in seawater as compared to that for open reservoir water whereas after 24 h contact time thms trend was opposite it indicated that the tthm formation is not only dependent on the amount of organic matter but also it depends upon the type of organic matter present in water it can also be inferred that fraction of fast reactive organic matter was more in seawater among the three water sources which resulted in an initial high load of thms in seawater and attained the plateau quickly compared to other water samples temporal variations in tthm at different chlorination conditions are given in fig 4 it showed that tthm contents were always higher for reservoir water than for seawater and palar subsoil water samples at all the chlorine doses and contact times the seasonal average values of thms for reservoir water samples for a 5 mg l dose 24 h contact time ranged from 151 62 to 198 25 μg l the highest and the lowest being observed during swm and post nem season seasonal variations of tthm for seawater and palar water samples for the above conditions were within 105 60 to 119 66 μg l in seawater samples tthm obtained for all experimental conditions showed positive correlation with cd values observed at 1 mg l chlorine dose the associations became insignificant among tthm and cd at higher doses similarly in palar water samples tthm formed during chlorine dose of 1 mg l 0 5 24 h 3 mg l 0 5 h and 5 mg l 0 5 h were positively correlated with all the values of the cd interestingly the tthm content and cd values in the open reservoir did not show any positive correlation unlike the other two water sources moreover a few negative associations between tthm and cd were observed in the open reservoir samples indicating the frequent occurrence of organic matter input which was not thm precursors and chlorine was consumed via other oxidative reactions although tthm formation potential of the reservoir was high the magnitude of tthm formation was not quantitatively reciprocated with the increase in the cd it indicated the presence of non thm forming precursor constituents in the organic content of reservoir water the above observation was supported by the fact that tthm contents in the open reservoir showed a positive correlation with doc which was not observed in the other two water sources biochemical composition of algal matters is reported to play vital role in determining the tthm yield 39 previous studies have shown higher tthm formation potential of water bodies with diatoms than green algae under the same chlorination conditions 40 aquatic humic acids contain more aromatic carbon than algal derived carbon and therefore have higher tthm formation potential 41 the above reasons possibly explain the observation of the non collinear behavior of cd and tthm content in the open reservoir water however cd has a substantial effect on the overall yield of tthm of all the natural water studied fig 5 as the chlorine dose is increased chlorine reacted with organic matter via otherwise unfavorable oxidative reactions rather than reactions leading to thms formation it might have led to the non collinearity between cd and tthm formation potential at chlorine dose was increased uva254 and suva254 values which serve as a proxy for aromatic contents in the doc were positively correlated with tthm for all doses and all contact times in the seawater samples however in the palar water all the correlations among the above parameters were insignificant indicating the negligible presence of organics contributing to uva254 on the contrary in the open reservoir samples uva254 was selectively correlated positively with tthm levels at 1 and 3 mg l dose and the suva254 was positively correlated with tthm contents only for 1 mg l dose the above observations could be attributed to the characteristics of organic matter which is determined by its nature of origin while doc from aquatic algae has relatively large nitrogen content low aromatic carbon and low phenolic contents terrestrially derived doc is relatively deficient in nitrogen content but abundant in aromatic and phenolic components it suggest that the aromatic fraction of organic matter which was postulated to be the most reactive precursor varies considerably with the source of origin 42 the longer hydrologic residence time typically in the order of months to years may also be long enough to allow transformation of the nature of doc either from external sources or in situ generation by organisms mash et al 2004 many studies which have correlated uv254 and suva254 with the tthm have suggested that with low to a moderate value of uv254 the usefulness of these parameters as a surrogate for prediction of tthm formation is limited 43 44 the selective positive correlations between tthm and uva254 observed in the present study could be due to the presence of some particular organic matter most probably of non humic non uv absorbing and hydrophilic nature in these water sources these fractions possibly comprised only a small portion of all organic matter due to which tthm did not show a positive correlation with doc especially in the seawater and palar water samples tthm in the open reservoir water showed a negative correlation with tn content many studies have reported the increased formation of thms in the chlorinated water due to the presence of bromide 45 48 however the extent of increase is strongly affected by various parameters such as reaction time chlorine dose temperature and ph 49 50 in the present study the pearson correlation matrix did not show any significant correlation between thm level and bromide concentration in all the three water sources tables 2 4 in seawater samples lowest of the bromide level 59 7 mg l observed during the study was also in excess and sufficient to instantly reduce all the chlorine at studied chlorine concentrations 1 5 mg l thus its temporal variation did not shift the oxidant equilibrium hocl hobr much and thus had an insignificant role on the change of tthm level for palar and open reservoir water other competitive reactions might have played more influential role overriding the effect of bromide on the yield of tthm though the addition of bromide to the experimental samples generally resulted in higher tthm formation 51 it was not straight forward to ascribe temporal variations of bromide with the higher yield of thms in case of our real water samples similarly for other parameters many studies had attempted to experimentally quantify their effect on the thms yield in laboratory conditions however natural temporal variations of these parameters of real water samples failed to establish a clear correlation with the overall thms yield due to the complexity of simultaneously occurring interdependent reactions 4 conclusion distinct variations in chlorine demand and total thms formation was observed for the three water sources studied water quality descriptor such as ph temperature bromide etc failed to establish a strong correlation with chlorine demand and trihalomethanes formation potential due to the numerous simultaneous occurring reactions though uva254 suva254 doc etc have been proven as useful surrogate for the prediction of thm formation during laboratory experiments the randomness of temporal variations in the reactivity of doc in water samples observed during our study made these parameters less useful for the universal prediction of thms formation in the three studied water sources chlorine demand in conjunction with other water quality descriptors seemed to be a better alternative surrogate to predict the thm yield capacity of the water the three water source such as seawater palar and reservoir water were susceptible to the formation of the significant amount of thms and followed the order reservoir seawater palar subsoil variability in chlorine demand was more affected by chlorine dose and the extent of temporal variations was comparable for all the three types of water studied chlorine demand of the palar subsoil water was the lowest followed by seawater and the highest for reservoir water palar and open reservoir water showed the maximum seasonal variations in thms formation compared to seawater for low chlorine dose up to 3 mg l acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the director hseg igcar kalpakkam for their constant inspiration and support in the pursuit of environmental research 
14408,trihalomethanes thms are carcinogenic compounds formed during water chlorination nature of source water and treatment conditions significantly influence its formation chlorine reactivity and trihalomethanes formation potential of water samples taken from three different sources such as the sea open reservoir and palar river subsoil were assessed for a period from 2013 to 2017 with respect to key determinants uv absorbance 254 nm values of all the water samples n 175 varied from 0 033 to 0 09 with dissolved organic carbon doc ranged between 1 08 1 88 0 69 2 15 0 66 1 98 mg l for seawater open reservoir and palar subsoil water respectively though uv absorbance uv254 was positively correlated with doc content specific uva254 suva254 did not correlate with doc consistent nonlinear increase in chlorine demand with increasing dose and time was observed which differs in magnitude for three water sources thm formation potential followed the order reservoir seawater palar subsoil the seasonal average of thms 5 mg l dose 24 h contact time was the highest for open reservoir water samples ranging from 151 62 southwest monsoon 198 25 μg l post northeast monsoon as compared to that of the seawater max 105 60 μg l and palar subsoil water max 119 66 μg l among the three sources thm in open reservoir water sample only exhibited positive correlation with its doc water quality parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen nitrate total nitrogen failed to establish a clear correlation with thms yield which indicated the overriding influence of simultaneous occurring reactions among all the parameters chlorine demand appeared to be a better surrogate to predict trihalomethanes formation regardless of water sources keywords disinfection by products trihalomethanes chlorination water quality water sources 1 introduction chlorination is one of the most used methods to disinfect drinking water and to control biofouling in industrial water utilities among there are many chemical processes chlorination is the most popular method all over the world this is due to 1 its strong oxidising potential 2 its proven effectiveness against broad spectrum of microorganism 3 its availability at relatively cheaper rate and 4 its ability to provide chlorine residual throughout the water distribution system unlike the other methods such as uv disinfection 1 the variability of chlorine demand cd of water which is referred to the portion of applied chlorine consumed by the chemical and biological constituent present in natural waters makes it difficult to maintain adequate and uniform residual in the water utilities physico chemical properties of water such as temperature ph chlorophyll organic matter nitrogen etc have an significant impact on chlorine demand since the water quality parameters show a considerable degree of temporal variation chlorine demand of water also fluctuates accordingly thus in addition to the chlorine demand assessment simultaneous investigation on essential factors responsible for its variations are crucial in spite of being the easiest and economical method of disinfection chlorination has its disadvantages as well regulatory limit of chlorine in drinking water to be low and thus acute exposure is not generally expected however long term exposure to chlorinated water increases the risk of cancer due to the presence of chlorination by products in the treated water concerns have been expressed since mid seventies about the apparent threat to human health due to the exposure to these chlorination by products cbps the by products formed during the reactions between chlorine and natural organic matters noms is of more concern as they are mostly carcinogens 2 4 exposure to chlorinated water has been shown to increase the risk of bladder colon and rectal cancer the cbps that are of most concerning health issues are trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas recent studies have linked thms to liver and kidney damage retarded fetus growth congenital disabilities and possibly miscarriage 3 5 even at low concentrations these could be toxic carcinogenic teratogenic and possibly mutagenic 6 9 when chlorine undergoes substitution reaction with organic matter such as humic acids fulvic acids proteins and amino acids halogenated organics such as thms and haas are formed 10 11 cbps formation in water is a function of several factors including temperature ph contact time the concentration of bromides residual chlorine and natural dom 4 12 14 thms are considered as the most dominant fractions of all the by products formed in the process of chlorination and u s environmental protection agency usepa has set maximum contamination level goal mclg of 80 μg l for total thms 15 thms consist of four compounds such as chloroform chcl3 bromodichloromethane chbrcl2 dibromochloromethane chbr2cl and bromoform chbr3 generally chloroform is the dominant fraction during freshwater chlorination whereas presence of 65 mg l of bromide in seawater leads to formation of bromoform mainly with a low quantity of dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromodichloromethane bdcm 16 18 bromine containing biocides are likely to produce more halogenated organics than chlorine 19 but have not been extensively studied scrutiny of available literature on thm formation potential of natural water sources from india as well as from all over the world showed that studies in this regard are scanty 1 20 22 moreover reports related to thm production from industrial uses of water particularly seawater are meagrely available chlorination of seawater is a normal practice during its use for various purposes such as cooling water for thermal power plant and swimming pool desalination aquaculture 16 23 26 which has potential to produce cbps that pose human health risk 19 atmospheric volatilisation of the cbps present in the effluents of these water utilities can affect human health through inhalation and also results subsequent photolysis to harmful reactive oxidants 27 28 most of the existing investigations on thm formation potential of natural water have been undertaken for short monitoring duration and more thus studies are required for the results to be useful for the management of water work 29 with the above background investigations were carried out to find out the influence of temporal water quality changes on the chlorine demand and total trihalomethanes tthm formation potential of three distinct types of the water source these water sources are either used for industrial applications or as potable water viz sea swr palar river subsoil plr and open reservoir rsr available at kalpakkam tamil nadu kalpakkam 12 33 n and 80 11 e is an emerging nuclear hub of india with various nuclear facilities such as madras atomic power station maps fast breeder test reactor fbtr prototype fast breeder reactor pfbr indira gandhi centre for atomic research igcar desalination plants fast reactor fuel cycle facility frfcf etc all these installations use seawater as well as freshwater for various purposes seawater is used at 35 m3 s 1 for condenser cooling at maps biofouling has been a constant problem in the cooling system at maps to effectively control the biofouling which is responsible for the reduction in heat transfer blockage of condenser tubes damage to pipelines and pumps etc low dose continuous chlorination is being practiced at maps a residual of 0 1 0 2 mg l is maintained at the outfall discharge the coastal water at kalpakkam is mainly influenced by the active ne monsoon during which about 60 of the annual rainfall 1250 mm is received subsequently during the post monsoon and sw monsoon the coastal condition stabilizes an open reservoir is used for condenser cooling at fbtr feed water for demineralization plants various r d laboratories of igcar as well as for drinking purpose the reservoir receives water from palar river bed through infiltration wells located about 20 km away from kalpakkam 30 and is transported to the reservoir through a 60 cm diameter cast iron pipe palar river stretch located near coast does not hold surface water most of the time and thus sub soil water is collected through infiltration wells the 10 year old reservoir sustains a massive growth of micro and macro vegetation the 30 000 m3 capacity reservoir spreads over an area of about 2 ha with a maximum depth of 3 m 30 it has been reported that sub soil water with higher nutrient concentrations when stored openly exposing to the sun resulted in growth of plants planktonic as well as macrophytes that led to substantial deterioration in water quality from its utility point of view as a condenser cooling medium and as a raw water input for dm plant 31 in the present study a comparative account of chlorine demand and tthm formation potential of seawater palar sub soil water and open reservoir water is provided in details this study also explored the influence of various water quality descriptors on the magnitude of chlorine demand and the trihalomethanes formation potential 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and

concentrations were measures by dpd colorimetric method accuracy 0 02 mg l for thms samples were analyzed after 0 5 and 24 h contact time thms were quantified using gas chromatography equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd chemito 1000 mumbai india according to u s environmental protection agency method 501 2 with some modifications at the time interval as mentioned above time intervals chlorinated water samples were quenched with sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 to arrest further chlorine reactions 5 ml of chlorinated water was extracted with 2 ml of pentane and 1 μl of pentane extract

thms species were 0 1 0 25 1 0 5 0 25 0 50 0 μg l and r2 value of the linear fit calibration curves were 0 981 0 993 0 996 0 987 and minimum detection limit were 0 07 0 01 0 01 0 05 μg l for chcl3 chcl2br chclbr2 chbr3 respectively gc parameters and analytical conditions were as described in our earlier paper 16 all thms formation experiments were carried out in triplicate and average values are presented water quality parameters such as electrical conductivity ec ph temperature dissolved oxygen nitrate ammonia total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a were analyzed temperature temp ph and electrical conductivity ec were recorded using a calibrated multi parameter probe ysi inc usa dissolve oxygen do content in water samples were determined according to winkler s titrimetric method 32 dissolved nutrients such as nitrate ammonia total nitrogen tn were estimated following standard methods 32 chlorophyll a concentration was measured spectrophotometrically 33 uv absorbance uva254 was

and guard column ag 22 were used with carbonate bicarbonate eluent for separation and quantification of bromide ion 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical characteristics water quality characteristics of the three water sources are given in table 1 seawater temperature ranged from 27 2 to 32 5 29 45 1 26 oc temperature showed a bimodal oscillation with relatively low temperature values during the monsoon period the water temperature was always found to be higher in open reservoir water than that of palar sub soil water it ranged from 24 9 to 33 6 30 14 1 98 and 25 9 34 5 30 38 2 15 oc in the palar sub soil water and open reservoir respectively table 1 the apparent increase in water temperature in the case of the open reservoir as compared to palar subsoil water was due to its direct exposure to atmosphere and sunlight the ph of seawater ranged from 7 8 to 8 4 with an average value of 8 15 0 15 relatively low ph was observed during the ne monsoon and it was stable for almost rest of the year in case of palar sub soil water ph values ranged from 7 1 to 8 2 with the average of 7 5 0 3 the open reservoir water ph values were higher than those of the palar sub soil water it ranged from 7 5 to 9 7 with an average of 8 5 0 5 the distinct variations in ph of these two water bodies could be attributed to the photosynthetic activity by phytoplankton and macrophytes in the reservoir leading to the increase in ph 31 34 ph is an important parameter that significantly influences the efficiency of chlorination at increased ph 8 5 most of the hocl remains in ocl 95 form and hocl is many times more effective than ocl 30 35 conductivity ec of seawater ranged from 38440 to 55900 μs cm 49590 5130 relatively low ec values were observed during the ne monsoon and the higher values were observed during summer sw monsoon ec of the reservoir water was found to be higher than that of sub soil water it ranged from 268 to 1460 482 200 and 143 917 524 185 μs cm for palar sub soil water and open reservoir water respectively relatively low conductivity values in the reservoir as well as that of the sub soil water have coincided with ne monsoon period possibly due to the dilution caused by pure rainwater average value during study period showed an overall increase of about 40 μs cm in conductivity in the open reservoir do content in the seawater ranged from 4 36 to 7 62 5 9 0 75 mg l the open coastal water at this location is well oxygenated due to proper mixing and phytoplankton production throughout the year 36 in aquatic systems oxygenation is the result of an imbalance between the process of photosynthesis degradation of organic matter and reaeration 37 relatively high do values were observed in the reservoir water as compared to palar sub soil water it ranged from 3 33 to 6 96 5 93 0 78 mg l and 3 84 10 55 7 72 1 55 mg l in the sub soil water and reservoir water respectively palar water being subsoil water doesn t come in contact with atmospheric oxygen and consequently do values were relatively low whereas photosynthesis in the open reservoir enhanced the do content in water nitrogenous nutrients such as nitrate ammonia and tn were estimated to find out their impact on chlorine demand and tthm formation nitrate values ranged from bdl 1 94 mg l for seawater it ranged from 0 01 to 2 09 mg l and bdl 0 95 mg l for the sub soil and reservoir water respectively table 1 its concentration in palar water was considerably higher than the open reservoir water average ammonia concentration did not show any visible difference between seawater and palar sub soil water however it was relatively low in the open reservoir tn concentration of the palar sub soil water was found to be relatively high as compared to seawater and open reservoir water the concentration of total nitrogen in palar sub soil water ranged from 0 02 to 1 21 mg l with an average of 0 26 mg l tn values in open reservoir water varied from bdl to 0 82 mg l with an average of 0 15 mg l bromide which is an essential parameter for the formation of thms was estimated for all the three water bodies it ranged from 59 77 to 67 89 mg l in seawater the concentration of bromide observed at the palar sub soil and open reservoir water was remained to be less than 1 mg l with very few values in the palar subsoil water samples exceeding 1 mg l high nutrient content observed in the palar sub soil water was possibly due to the residual fertilizer runoff from the surrounding agricultural land which uses both phosphate and nitrogenous based fertilizers observed significant reduction in phosphate and nitrate concentration from palar to open reservoir water is due to their utilization by microorganisms and macrophytes phosphates and nitrates are the primary nutrient requirements for high productivity in any water body their presence in optimum concentrations in palar water leads to high biological activity and extensive growth of macrophytes such as vallisneria najas and ceratophyllum in the reservoir water in the presence of sunlight an essential element for primary production 31 the luxuriant bio growth in the open reservoir ecosystem makes it entirely a different one from the palar sub soil water system a recent study from the same reservoir reported an increase in organic matter content due to the growth of micro and macrophytes substantiating our above observation on photosynthetic activity 34 3 2 biological parameters biological parameters such as chlorophyll doc and uva254 are essential descriptors for the formation of thms and their spatiotemporal variations affect its quantity and quality in water bodies chlorophyll a the universal pigment that forms a dominant fraction of the phytopigments ranged from 0 03 to 8 22 mg m3 in seawater samples it ranged from bdl 4 58 mg m3 and 1 12 48 97 mg m3 for the palar sub soil and open reservoir water respectively the increase in chlorophyll a content noticed in the open reservoir was due to the micro and macrophyte growth in the open reservoir uva254 and the subsequently calculated suva254 have been correlated with tthm formation potential to find out the role of organics in this process doc values for the seawater ranged from 1 08 to 1 88 mg l with an average value of 1 44 0 20 mg l the palar sub soil water doc values average 126 0 35 mg l were marginally lower than that of the open reservoir average 1 50 0 36 the biological growth in the open reservoir has led to an increase in doc content as compared to the palar sub soil water the uva254 values ranged from 0 033 to 0 075 cm 1 with an average value of 0 056 0 011 cm 1 for seawater the corresponding suva254 values ranged from 2 307 to 6 043 l mg m the variations in uva254 and suva254 values in the palar sub soil water and open reservoir water were almost identical table 1 these two water sources exhibited low uva254 absorption in water such as those containing humic fractions it is often observed that uv absorbance at 254 nm is strongly correlated to doc content 38 in the present study uva254 was positively correlated with doc content in all the three water sources in contrast the suva254 values were negatively associated with doc in seawater and palar water samples tables 2 4 3 3 chlorine demand chlorine demand cd of the water generally decides the dose required for disinfection it is influenced by parameters like organic matter ph temperature uva254 nh3 and other inorganic compounds cd is also a function of both time and initial chlorine dose cd values for all the three source water types at different initial chlorine concentrations 1 3 5 mg l and time intervals 0 25 and 1 h during the study period are given in fig 1 though not linear consistent increase in chlorine demand with increasing dose and time was observed in all the three water sources it ranged from 1 12 to 3 11 1 86 0 49 0 60 2 79 1 27 0 50 and 0 89 2 81 1 70 0 44 mg l for 5 mg l cl2 dose 1 h contact time in the seawater n 46 palar subsoil n 61 and open reservoir samples n 68 respectively table 5 fig 1 also depicts the extremely variable nature of chlorine demand and a strong influence of the applied chlorine dose the variability of cd increased at higher chlorine dose this observation may be due to various factors such as limiting chlorine residual at lower dose and participation of resistant organic molecule at higher chlorine dose the above uncertainties pose higher difficulty in predicting the chlorine demand at a higher dose than at lower dose comparatively low chlorine demand of the palar sub soil water could be due to its low reactive organic matter content as compared to the other two water sources relatively high doc and chl a content in the open reservoir water and seawater due to in situ biological activities resulted in higher cd than the palar sub soil water cd for 1 and 3 mg l doses showed a positive correlation with uva254 and suva254 in seawater however the correlation at 5 mg l dose was insignificant on the contrary the cd at 5 mg l dose showed a positive correlation with chl a content the above observations indicated that the phytopigment might be resistant to chlorine reaction at a lower dose and reacted at a higher dose in seawater in case of palar sub soil water and open reservoir water correlations among cd at 1 3 mg l dose of chlorine and uva suva were insignificant at 5 mg l dose however a positive correlation was observed between cd and uva in the palar water and cd and suva in open reservoir water as per the climatology of the study location annual cycle is divided into three seasons such as south west monsoon swm june september north east monsoon nem october january post monsoon pom february may all the data 2013 2017 were pooled into three seasons such as swm nem and pom seasonal variation in cd 5 mg l dose and 1 h contact time showed a distinct trend in case of palar sub soil and open reservoir water however seasonal impact on the cd variation was minimum for the seawater samples fig 2 this indicates the prominent role of the reactivity of the organic matter which superseded the effect due to the temporal input of organic matter into the seawater the increase in cd for palar sub soil water and open reservoir water during nem and post nem period could be ascribed to the increase in biological growth during these periods in the presence of optimal nutrient concentration in the water sources on the other hand the cd of seawater was relatively high during the swm and nem as compared to that of the palar sub soil and open reservoir water it showed that despite the allocthonous inputs during the monsoon season the dynamics of the coastal water helped to maintain its homogeneity in the physicochemical and biological properties 3 4 tthm formation potential the critical factors that influence the formation of thms include contact time cd temperature ph the concentration of precursors and bromide ions there was considerable disparity in these parameters observed for three different water sources which had significantly affected the load and distribution of thms similar to that of cd a linear increase in total thms level was observed for different chlorine doses and contact times fig 3 among the three water sources the open reservoir water sample was found to have the highest thms formation potential table 5 as expected the palar subsoil water which had relatively low doc chl a uva254 level had the lowest thm forming potential the tthms levels for 0 5 h contact time were relatively high for all the chlorine doses in seawater as compared to that for open reservoir water whereas after 24 h contact time thms trend was opposite it indicated that the tthm formation is not only dependent on the amount of organic matter but also it depends upon the type of organic matter present in water it can also be inferred that fraction of fast reactive organic matter was more in seawater among the three water sources which resulted in an initial high load of thms in seawater and attained the plateau quickly compared to other water samples temporal variations in tthm at different chlorination conditions are given in fig 4 it showed that tthm contents were always higher for reservoir water than for seawater and palar subsoil water samples at all the chlorine doses and contact times the seasonal average values of thms for reservoir water samples for a 5 mg l dose 24 h contact time ranged from 151 62 to 198 25 μg l the highest and the lowest being observed during swm and post nem season seasonal variations of tthm for seawater and palar water samples for the above conditions were within 105 60 to 119 66 μg l in seawater samples tthm obtained for all experimental conditions showed positive correlation with cd values observed at 1 mg l chlorine dose the associations became insignificant among tthm and cd at higher doses similarly in palar water samples tthm formed during chlorine dose of 1 mg l 0 5 24 h 3 mg l 0 5 h and 5 mg l 0 5 h were positively correlated with all the values of the cd interestingly the tthm content and cd values in the open reservoir did not show any positive correlation unlike the other two water sources moreover a few negative associations between tthm and cd were observed in the open reservoir samples indicating the frequent occurrence of organic matter input which was not thm precursors and chlorine was consumed via other oxidative reactions although tthm formation potential of the reservoir was high the magnitude of tthm formation was not quantitatively reciprocated with the increase in the cd it indicated the presence of non thm forming precursor constituents in the organic content of reservoir water the above observation was supported by the fact that tthm contents in the open reservoir showed a positive correlation with doc which was not observed in the other two water sources biochemical composition of algal matters is reported to play vital role in determining the tthm yield 39 previous studies have shown higher tthm formation potential of water bodies with diatoms than green algae under the same chlorination conditions 40 aquatic humic acids contain more aromatic carbon than algal derived carbon and therefore have higher tthm formation potential 41 the above reasons possibly explain the observation of the non collinear behavior of cd and tthm content in the open reservoir water however cd has a substantial effect on the overall yield of tthm of all the natural water studied fig 5 as the chlorine dose is increased chlorine reacted with organic matter via otherwise unfavorable oxidative reactions rather than reactions leading to thms formation it might have led to the non collinearity between cd and tthm formation potential at chlorine dose was increased uva254 and suva254 values which serve as a proxy for aromatic contents in the doc were positively correlated with tthm for all doses and all contact times in the seawater samples however in the palar water all the correlations among the above parameters were insignificant indicating the negligible presence of organics contributing to uva254 on the contrary in the open reservoir samples uva254 was selectively correlated positively with tthm levels at 1 and 3 mg l dose and the suva254 was positively correlated with tthm contents only for 1 mg l dose the above observations could be attributed to the characteristics of organic matter which is determined by its nature of origin while doc from aquatic algae has relatively large nitrogen content low aromatic carbon and low phenolic contents terrestrially derived doc is relatively deficient in nitrogen content but abundant in aromatic and phenolic components it suggest that the aromatic fraction of organic matter which was postulated to be the most reactive precursor varies considerably with the source of origin 42 the longer hydrologic residence time typically in the order of months to years may also be long enough to allow transformation of the nature of doc either from external sources or in situ generation by organisms mash et al 2004 many studies which have correlated uv254 and suva254 with the tthm have suggested that with low to a moderate value of uv254 the usefulness of these parameters as a surrogate for prediction of tthm formation is limited 43 44 the selective positive correlations between tthm and uva254 observed in the present study could be due to the presence of some particular organic matter most probably of non humic non uv absorbing and hydrophilic nature in these water sources these fractions possibly comprised only a small portion of all organic matter due to which tthm did not show a positive correlation with doc especially in the seawater and palar water samples tthm in the open reservoir water showed a negative correlation with tn content many studies have reported the increased formation of thms in the chlorinated water due to the presence of bromide 45 48 however the extent of increase is strongly affected by various parameters such as reaction time chlorine dose temperature and ph 49 50 in the present study the pearson correlation matrix did not show any significant correlation between thm level and bromide concentration in all the three water sources tables 2 4 in seawater samples lowest of the bromide level 59 7 mg l observed during the study was also in excess and sufficient to instantly reduce all the chlorine at studied chlorine concentrations 1 5 mg l thus its temporal variation did not shift the oxidant equilibrium hocl hobr much and thus had an insignificant role on the change of tthm level for palar and open reservoir water other competitive reactions might have played more influential role overriding the effect of bromide on the yield of tthm though the addition of bromide to the experimental samples generally resulted in higher tthm formation 51 it was not straight forward to ascribe temporal variations of bromide with the higher yield of thms in case of our real water samples similarly for other parameters many studies had attempted to experimentally quantify their effect on the thms yield in laboratory conditions however natural temporal variations of these parameters of real water samples failed to establish a clear correlation with the overall thms yield due to the complexity of simultaneously occurring interdependent reactions 4 conclusion distinct variations in chlorine demand and total thms formation was observed for the three water sources studied water quality descriptor such as ph temperature bromide etc failed to establish a strong correlation with chlorine demand and trihalomethanes formation potential due to the numerous simultaneous occurring reactions though uva254 suva254 doc etc have been proven as useful surrogate for the prediction of thm formation during laboratory experiments the randomness of temporal variations in the reactivity of doc in water samples observed during our study made these parameters less useful for the universal prediction of thms formation in the three studied water sources chlorine demand in conjunction with other water quality descriptors seemed to be a better alternative surrogate to predict the thm yield capacity of the water the three water source such as seawater palar and reservoir water were susceptible to the formation of the significant amount of thms and followed the order reservoir seawater palar subsoil variability in chlorine demand was more affected by chlorine dose and the extent of temporal variations was comparable for all the three types of water studied chlorine demand of the palar subsoil water was the lowest followed by seawater and the highest for reservoir water palar and open reservoir water showed the maximum seasonal variations in thms formation compared to seawater for low chlorine dose up to 3 mg l acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the director hseg

substrate was removed by using an air knife the mpd saturated membrane was immersedinthe organic solution 0 1 wt of tmc in n hexane for 90 s due to the immiscible nature of the two organic and aqueous

ofs the chemical composition of the tw ofs is investigated by ftir spectroscopy as seen in fig 1 the characteristic peaks of wheel polyoxometalate w pom appeared at 758 841 1410 1602 cm 1 which are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric vibration of mo o bands 31 29 furthermore characteristic peaks in ftir spectra of tw ofs two new peaks at 804 and 954 cm 1were observed which are ascribed to the cationic organic linker in addition the aliphatic c h groups of the ligandwere appeared in 2950 cm 1 and confirmed the coordination of cationic ligand to the w pom structure and successful synthesis of tw ofs purity and chemical composition of the as synthesized tw ofs was investigated by edx analysis and results are shown in fig 1 the peaks of c n o and mo elements in edx spectra confirmed the chemical composition and purity of synthesized tw ofs sem images of the synthesized w pom and tw ofs in fig 1 shows that the bare w pom possessed a hexagonal morphology with a diameter of 4 5 μm and tw ofs have uniform sphere like nanostructures with the average diameters of 90 nm in the synthesis of polyoxometalate based open frameworks the rigidity hydrogen bonding ability and geometry of organic cationic linker has a significant influence on the overall structure of the pom based open framework 32 in this study tmab was used as a monofunctional cationic linker after encapsulation of w pom with tmab organic linker the formed tw ofs cannot be dissolved in water in contrast to the pristine w pom which indicates that the hydrophilic surface of w pom has been efficiently covered by the hydrophobic alkyl chains of tmab 3 2 characterization of tfn membranes the atr ftir spectra of the tfc and the tfn membranes with different tw ofsloading are shown in fig 2 for the pes substrate all peaks observed were similar to the one reported earlier the peaks at 1151 cm 1 assigned to coc aryl ether group stretching and doublet from the asymmetric o so group appearedat 1296 and 1325 cm 1 33 in comparison to the pes support new peaks appear on the spectrum of the tfc and tfn membranes two broad peaks at 1570 and 1680 cm 1 representative of the amide co nh stretch strongly evincing a pa film formed on the pes support via interfacial polymerization 34 to further confirm whether tw ofs exist in the pa layer ftir spectra of tfc and tfn membranes were compared as shown in fig 2 two emerging peaks ranging from 1370 cm 1 to 1620 cm 1 in the spectra of tfn membranes attributed to the absorption of tw ofs functional groups andconfirmed the successful incorporation of tw ofs within polyamide rejection layer the effect of nanofiller incorporation on membrane hydrophilicity was evaluated by contact angle measurements and results are presented in fig 2 as can be seen increasing tw ofs loading from 0 to 500 ppm decreased the contact angle of composite membranes from 75 3 of tfc membrane to 58 7 of tfntw 3 membrane compared with control tfc membrane tfnmembranes benefited from the hydrophilic functional groups of tw ofs which enhance the water affinity ofmembrane surface in order to further study the influence of tw ofs nanofillers on the surface morphology of the pa layer sem images of the top layer were made for the tfc and nanofillers incorporated tfn membranes fig 3 for the control tfc membrane the top surface image was shown a typical ridge and valley structure due to reactions between tmc and mpd monomers the appearance of such morphology for pa active layer is closely related to the monomers concentration aqueous and organic phases diffusion rate of mpd monomers and physicochemical properties i e hydrophilicity and porosity of support layer 24 during the interfacial polymerization since the tmc monomer isnot soluble in the aqueous phase only mpd would diffuse from the aqueous phase to the organic phase 35 therefore is expected the rate of reaction final morphology of pa layer and permeability of the tfc membranes controlled bythe mpd molecules reaction conditions such as solubility and diffusion into the organic side so any variation in this condition will alter the separation properties of the final prepared membrane the surface morphology of membranes prepared by incorporating of tw ofs in mpd aqueous solution was visibly altered indicating that nanofillers may affect interfacial polymerization process the sem images of tfn membranes clearly showed that pa layer is defect free and tw ofs well dispersed in the thin layer without any agglomeration decreasingthe size of ridge and valley structure in tfn membranes makes a much smoother surface in comparison the pure tfc membranes which potentially decreases the membrane fouling tendency the 3d afm images also confirmed the formation of smooth pa films for tfn membranes additionally as the tw ofs loading increases the ridge and valley structure becomes smaller in tfn membranesdiffusion of mpd monomers to the reaction zone is impeded due to the presence of nanofillers in the aqueous phase as a result a thinner pa active layer with smaller ridges and valleys and higher water permeation forms at the interface 35 3 3 performance of membranes in ro test modified tfn membranes were tested in reverse osmosis against an unmodified tfc fo membrane as controls and results are presented in table 1 tfn membranes were found to be more permeable and selective than tfc membrane as can be seen the water permeability in tfn membranes were significantly increased when more tw ofs was incorporated in the active layer thickness and hydrophilicity of pa skin layer formed on top of the support layer of tfn membranes may be responsible for the improvement in water flux thickness and hydrophilicity of the pa layer have been found to control the water permeability of tfc membrane in the ro process 36 in tfn membrane with increasing theconcentration oftw ofs the water permeability enhanced due to a significant decline in the thickness of the pa layer 37 38 in addition this improvement may be attributed to the improved hydrophilicity of pa layer in tfn membranes as shown in fig 2 it is well known that in membranes with high hydrophilicity water molecules can easily attracting inside the membrane matrix and pass through the membrane 39 furthermore the sub nanometer pores in the tw ofs structure may provide an additional shortage water pathway the effect of tw ofs loadings on the transport properties of tfn membranes was also investigated in terms of salt rejection with raising tw ofs loadings in thepa layer tfn membrane displayeda negligible change in the rejection properties the salt rejection of the unmodified membrane was 94 4 while it decreased very slightly to 91 7 for the tfntw 3 membrane 3 4 osmotic performance fig 4 a compares the water flux of tfc and tfn membranes using di water as feed solution and 1 m nacl as draw solution in fo and pro modes clearly tfn membranesexhibit higher water flux both in fo and pro modes with a slightincrease inreverse salt flux this enhancement in water flux of tfn membranes can be attributed to the rejection layer property hydrophilicity thickness and roughness changes upon the addition of tw ofs in the mpd monomer solution these changes contribute to the higher hydrophilicity and the thinner active layer of tfn membranes in comparison totfc membrane figs 2 and 3 in addition nanopores in tw ofs structure may have formed short water pathways that facilitated the water flux of tfn membranes the reverse solute diffusion of the tfc and tfn membranes were investigated using an online ec meter and results are presented in fig 4b as canbe seen the reverse salt flux in fo and pro modes increased from 6 4 to 11 4 gmh for tfc membrane and from9 3 15 8gmh for tfntw 3membrane respectively this may be attributed to the pores formed between the tw ofs and pa matrix which lead to accretion of reverse salt flux observed trends for water flux and reverse solute diffusion in both fo and pro orientations matched well with the water permeability and salt rejection of the tfn membranes in ro experiment the reverse salt flux water flux ratio of control tfc and modified membranes for both fo and pro modes are presented in fig 5 a in general an improvement in selectivity of membrane by incorporation of tw ofs was observed however modified membrane with 300 ppm tw ofs incorporation shown a slight reduction of selectivity which can be attributed to the non selective voids ofpa layer where ions can easily permeate with lower resistance the effect of draw solution concentration on the performance of tfntw 2 as the best performing membrane was investigated and results are shown in fig 5b from fig 5b it could be found that the water fluxes of the tfntw 2 membrane under fo and pro modes havea similar trend but the mean water flux increment for fo mode is lower than pro mode which can be attributed to the more severe icp phenomenon in support layer in fo mode 25 3 5 fouling characterizations fouling test was conducted to evaluate the effect of tw ofs incorporation on fouling propensity of fo membranes fig 6 shows the fouling properties of the tfc and tfntw 2 membranes in fo mode with respect to the decrease in water flux in the presence of bsa as model organic foulant as can be seen the water flux for tfc and tfntw 2 membranes gradually decreased the decline in water flux is a result of the adhesion and accommodation of foulant and therefore fouling on the membrane surface 40 compared with the control tfc membrane the tfntw 2 membrane exhibits a higher flux stability and lower deviation from the baseline against bsa foulant which indicates a higher anti fouling propensity of the tfntw 2 membrane the enhanced antifouling property in modified membranes can be attributed to the hydrophilic and smooth pa layer 41 42 the pa layer of the tfntw 2 membrane contained many small leaf like structure while the tfc membrane pa layer included ridge and valley features with rough surfaces fig 3a and b these ridge and valley structures can enhance membrane fouling through i accumulation of foulants in valley structures and ii greater surface area for foulant attachment 43 furthermore in membrane with high hydrophilicity the layer of strongly bound water molecules on membrane surface can provides an barrier for foulant adhesion that improves anti fouling ability 44 typically pa layer with smooth and hydrophilic surface can significantly prevent the growth of organic foulant on the membrane surface 45 to provide a useful information about the effect of tw ofs incorporation on the performance of tfn membranes we show in table 2 the fo performances of the tw ofs modified membrane and the unmodified membrane in the present study in comparison with other membranes with different composition reported in the literature according to table 2 the introduction of tw ofs within the pa layer of tfn membrane significantly enhanced the fo water flux while exhibiting relatively high selectivity the current study confirmed the significant advantages of tw ofs in controlling the water flux and salt rejection in fo process over the conventional nanomaterials 4 conclusion in this study porous and hydrophilic tw ofs was synthesized and then incorporated in the active layer of a tfn membrane using in situ interfacial polymerization of mpd and tmc monomers ftir and sem analysis verified the presence of tw ofs in the top active layer of tfn membranes also the effect of tw ofs incorporation on pa layer morphology and hydrophilicity was studied using contact angle measurements sem and afm images the changes in water permeability selectivity and water flux of tfn membranes were investigated in ro and fo experiments results show that formation of a hydrophilic and thin active layer can significantly enhance the water flux in tfn membranes so that by incorporation 500 ppm of tw ofs in tfntw 3 the water flux reached to 41 7 lmh showed more than 80 improvement clearly tw ofs can be used as a new class of materials for tfn membranes with demonstrated advantages of good fo performance high hydrophilicity and high selectivity the newly developed method in this study could be potentially used as an effective and low cost modification technique for commercial pa membranes we also expect further potential of thepresented method for membrane modification in the field of renewable energy production by using pressure retarded osmosis from saline water acknowledgment we would like to

modification of separation performance of composite membranes in fo process despite this progress there is still a major problem the poor compatibility between hardinorganic nanoparticles and the soft polymer matrixcan cause detrimental effects on the membrane selectivity 24 surface modification of these nanomaterials with organic ligands is one of the strategies can be used to solve the above mentioned issues 25 in addition tfn membrane fabricated by these nanomaterials has higher surface water permeability and hydrophilicity in comparison to the conventional nanomaterials without surface modification 26 the design and synthesis of porous materials are of increasing interest because of the unique properties these materials have in sorption separation and catalysis polyoxometalate based open frameworks pom ofs are a new type of hybrid material consisting of polyoxometalate clusters as inorganic building blocks coordinated by organiccationic ligands as linkers 27 in a similar vein to mofs and zeolites pom ofs materials are porous with high surface areas and thermal stabilities 28 the presence of organic cationic linkers in pom ofs can enhance their compatibility with the soft polymer matrixwhen compared to conventional inorganic nanoparticles for this purpose the pom ofs was selected as the nanofiller due to its high surface area good thermal and hydrothermal stability 28 hydrophilic nature 29 as well as the presence of uniform tubular pores that might improve the water permeability of membranes for improving the compatibility of nanofiller with the polymer matrix

substrate was removed by using an air knife the mpd saturated membrane was immersedinthe organic solution 0 1 wt of tmc in n hexane for 90 s due to the immiscible nature of the two organic and aqueous

ofs the chemical composition of the tw ofs is investigated by ftir spectroscopy as seen in fig 1 the characteristic peaks of wheel polyoxometalate w pom appeared at 758 841 1410 1602 cm 1 which are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric vibration of mo o bands 31 29 furthermore characteristic peaks in ftir spectra of tw ofs two new peaks at 804 and 954 cm 1were observed which are ascribed to the cationic organic linker in addition the aliphatic c h groups of the ligandwere appeared in 2950 cm 1 and confirmed the coordination of cationic ligand to the w pom structure and successful synthesis of tw ofs purity and chemical composition of the as synthesized tw ofs was investigated by edx analysis and results are shown in fig 1 the peaks of c n o and mo elements in edx spectra confirmed the chemical composition and purity of synthesized tw ofs sem images of the synthesized w pom and tw ofs in fig 1 shows that the bare w pom possessed a hexagonal morphology with a diameter of 4 5 μm and tw ofs have uniform sphere like nanostructures with the average diameters of 90 nm in the synthesis of polyoxometalate based open frameworks the rigidity hydrogen bonding ability and geometry of organic cationic linker has a significant influence on the overall structure of the pom based open framework 32 in this study tmab was used as a monofunctional cationic linker after encapsulation of w pom with tmab organic linker the formed tw ofs cannot be dissolved in water in contrast to the pristine w pom which indicates that the hydrophilic surface of w pom has been efficiently covered by the hydrophobic alkyl chains of tmab 3 2 characterization of tfn membranes the atr ftir spectra of the tfc and the tfn membranes with different tw ofsloading are shown in fig 2 for the pes substrate all peaks observed were similar to the one reported earlier the peaks at 1151 cm 1 assigned to coc aryl ether group stretching and doublet from the asymmetric o so group appearedat 1296 and 1325 cm 1 33 in comparison to the pes support new peaks appear on the spectrum of the tfc and tfn membranes two broad peaks at 1570 and 1680 cm 1 representative of the amide co nh stretch strongly evincing a pa film formed on the pes support via interfacial polymerization 34 to further confirm whether tw ofs exist in the pa layer ftir spectra of tfc and tfn membranes were compared as shown in fig 2 two emerging peaks ranging from 1370 cm 1 to 1620 cm 1 in the spectra of tfn membranes attributed to the absorption of tw ofs functional groups andconfirmed the successful incorporation of tw ofs within polyamide rejection layer the effect of nanofiller incorporation on membrane hydrophilicity was evaluated by contact angle measurements and results are presented in fig 2 as can be seen increasing tw ofs loading from 0 to 500 ppm decreased the contact angle of composite membranes from 75 3 of tfc membrane to 58 7 of tfntw 3 membrane compared with control tfc membrane tfnmembranes benefited from the hydrophilic functional groups of tw ofs which enhance the water affinity ofmembrane surface in order to further study the influence of tw ofs nanofillers on the surface morphology of the pa layer sem images of the top layer were made for the tfc and nanofillers incorporated tfn membranes fig 3 for the control tfc membrane the top surface image was shown a typical ridge and valley structure due to reactions between tmc and mpd monomers the appearance of such morphology for pa active layer is closely related to the monomers concentration aqueous and organic phases diffusion rate of mpd monomers and physicochemical properties i e hydrophilicity and porosity of support layer 24 during the interfacial polymerization since the tmc monomer isnot soluble in the aqueous phase only mpd would diffuse from the aqueous phase to the organic phase 35 therefore is expected the rate of reaction final morphology of pa layer and permeability of the tfc membranes controlled bythe mpd molecules reaction conditions such as solubility and diffusion into the organic side so any variation in this condition will alter the separation properties of the final prepared membrane the surface morphology of membranes prepared by incorporating of tw ofs in mpd aqueous solution was visibly altered indicating that nanofillers may affect interfacial polymerization process the sem images of tfn membranes clearly showed that pa layer is defect free and tw ofs well dispersed in the thin layer without any agglomeration decreasingthe size of ridge and valley structure in tfn membranes makes a much smoother surface in comparison the pure tfc membranes which potentially decreases the membrane fouling tendency the 3d afm images also confirmed the formation of smooth pa films for tfn membranes additionally as the tw ofs loading increases the ridge and valley structure becomes smaller in tfn membranesdiffusion of mpd monomers to the reaction zone is impeded due to the presence of nanofillers in the aqueous phase as a result a thinner pa active layer with smaller ridges and valleys and higher water permeation forms at the interface 35 3 3 performance of membranes in ro test modified tfn membranes were tested in reverse osmosis against an unmodified tfc fo membrane as controls and results are presented in table 1 tfn membranes were found to be more permeable and selective than tfc membrane as can be seen the water permeability in tfn membranes were significantly increased when more tw ofs was incorporated in the active layer thickness and hydrophilicity of pa skin layer formed on top of the support layer of tfn membranes may be responsible for the improvement in water flux thickness and hydrophilicity of the pa layer have been found to control the water permeability of tfc membrane in the ro process 36 in tfn membrane with increasing theconcentration oftw ofs the water permeability enhanced due to a significant decline in the thickness of the pa layer 37 38 in addition this improvement may be attributed to the improved hydrophilicity of pa layer in tfn membranes as shown in fig 2 it is well known that in membranes with high hydrophilicity water molecules can easily attracting inside the membrane matrix and pass through the membrane 39 furthermore the sub nanometer pores in the tw ofs structure may provide an additional shortage water pathway the effect of tw ofs loadings on the transport properties of tfn membranes was also investigated in terms of salt rejection with raising tw ofs loadings in thepa layer tfn membrane displayeda negligible change in the rejection properties the salt rejection of the unmodified membrane was 94 4 while it decreased very slightly to 91 7 for the tfntw 3 membrane 3 4 osmotic performance fig 4 a compares the water flux of tfc and tfn membranes using di water as feed solution and 1 m nacl as draw solution in fo and pro modes clearly tfn membranesexhibit higher water flux both in fo and pro modes with a slightincrease inreverse salt flux this enhancement in water flux of tfn membranes can be attributed to the rejection layer property hydrophilicity thickness and roughness changes upon the addition of tw ofs in the mpd monomer solution these changes contribute to the higher hydrophilicity and the thinner active layer of tfn membranes in comparison totfc membrane figs 2 and 3 in addition nanopores in tw ofs structure may have formed short water pathways that facilitated the water flux of tfn membranes the reverse solute diffusion of the tfc and tfn membranes were investigated using an online ec meter and results are presented in fig 4b as canbe seen the reverse salt flux in fo and pro modes increased from 6 4 to 11 4 gmh for tfc membrane and from9 3 15 8gmh for tfntw 3membrane respectively this may be attributed to the pores formed between the tw ofs and pa matrix which lead to accretion of reverse salt flux observed trends for water flux and reverse solute diffusion in both fo and pro orientations matched well with the water permeability and salt rejection of the tfn membranes in ro experiment the reverse salt flux water flux ratio of control tfc and modified membranes for both fo and pro modes are presented in fig 5 a in general an improvement in selectivity of membrane by incorporation of tw ofs was observed however modified membrane with 300 ppm tw ofs incorporation shown a slight reduction of selectivity which can be attributed to the non selective voids ofpa layer where ions can easily permeate with lower resistance the effect of draw solution concentration on the performance of tfntw 2 as the best performing membrane was investigated and results are shown in fig 5b from fig 5b it could be found that the water fluxes of the tfntw 2 membrane under fo and pro modes havea similar trend but the mean water flux increment for fo mode is lower than pro mode which can be attributed to the more severe icp phenomenon in support layer in fo mode 25 3 5 fouling characterizations fouling test was conducted to evaluate the effect of tw ofs incorporation on fouling propensity of fo membranes fig 6 shows the fouling properties of the tfc and tfntw 2 membranes in fo mode with respect to the decrease in water flux in the presence of bsa as model organic foulant as can be seen the water flux for tfc and tfntw 2 membranes gradually decreased the decline in water flux is a result of the adhesion and accommodation of foulant and therefore fouling on the membrane surface 40 compared with the control tfc membrane the tfntw 2 membrane exhibits a higher flux stability and lower deviation from the baseline against bsa foulant which indicates a higher anti fouling propensity of the tfntw 2 membrane the enhanced antifouling property in modified membranes can be attributed to the hydrophilic and smooth pa layer 41 42 the pa layer of the tfntw 2 membrane contained many small leaf like structure while the tfc membrane pa layer included ridge and valley features with rough surfaces fig 3a and b these ridge and valley structures can enhance membrane fouling through i accumulation of foulants in valley structures and ii greater surface area for foulant attachment 43 furthermore in membrane with high hydrophilicity the layer of strongly bound water molecules on membrane surface can provides an barrier for foulant adhesion that improves anti fouling ability 44 typically pa layer with smooth and hydrophilic surface can significantly prevent the growth of organic foulant on the membrane surface 45 to provide a useful information about the effect of tw ofs incorporation on the performance of tfn membranes we show in table 2 the fo performances of the tw ofs modified membrane and the unmodified membrane in the present study in comparison with other membranes with different composition reported in the literature according to table 2 the introduction of tw ofs within the pa layer of tfn membrane significantly enhanced the fo water flux while exhibiting relatively high selectivity the current study confirmed the significant advantages of tw ofs in controlling the water flux and salt rejection in fo process over the conventional nanomaterials 4 conclusion in this study porous and hydrophilic tw ofs was synthesized and then incorporated in the active layer of a tfn membrane using in situ interfacial polymerization of mpd and tmc monomers ftir and sem analysis verified the presence of tw ofs in the top active layer of tfn membranes also the effect of tw ofs incorporation on pa layer morphology and hydrophilicity was studied using contact angle measurements sem and afm images the changes in water permeability selectivity and water flux of tfn membranes were investigated in ro and fo experiments results show that formation of a hydrophilic and thin active layer can significantly enhance the water flux in tfn membranes so that by incorporation 500 ppm of tw ofs in tfntw 3 the water flux reached to 41 7 lmh showed more than 80 improvement clearly tw ofs can be used as a new class of materials for tfn membranes with demonstrated advantages of good fo performance high hydrophilicity and high selectivity the newly developed method in this study could be potentially used as an effective and low cost modification technique for commercial pa membranes we also expect further potential of thepresented method for membrane modification in the field of renewable energy production by using pressure retarded osmosis from saline water acknowledgment we would like to
