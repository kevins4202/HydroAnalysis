1890,hydrological models are powerful tools for estimating streamflow however they typically simplify the representation of the evapotranspiration et process which increases the uncertainty in et estimation and further introduces extra error in streamflow simulation this study constrains the uncertainty of et and improves the accuracy of streamflow estimation by replacing the classical et module with a data driven submodel in process based hydrological models the data driven et submodel was first built based on the fluxnet2015 dataset and the random forest rf algorithm and then integrated into two classic hydrological models with different runoff generation mechanisms the xinanjiang xaj model which is driven by the saturation excess runoff mechanism and the soil and water assessment tool swat model which is based on the infiltration excess runoff mechanism the sensitivity of streamflow to et under the xaj and swat models as well as the performance of the hybrid hydrological models named the etrf xaj model and the etrf swat model was evaluated using the et and streamflow observations in nine u s watersheds the results showed that streamflow was more sensitive to et in the xaj model the etrf xaj model obviously outperformed the xaj model while the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies this similar result was also founded in different climatic zones and seasons this phenomenon can be attributed to the stronger link between et and streamflow under saturation excess runoff mechanisms the etrf xaj model effectively improved the original xaj model which underestimated peak flow this study highlights that the hybrid model has great potential for improved streamflow simulation while building the well performed hybrid model highly relies on the physical framework of the hydrological model keywords streamflow evapotranspiration hybrid model swat xaj machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resource management such as reservoir operation water environment treatment water quality simulation and agricultural irrigation cheng et al 2020 fathian et al 2019 ju et al 2020 kisi et al 2012 liu et al 2022 ni et al 2020 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 however accurately predicting streamflow is a great challenge due to the nonlinear and nonstationarity properties of streamflow and its sensitivity to both meteorological and human factors ostad ali askari 2022 zhang et al 2021 with the efforts of hydrologists hydrological models have become a powerful tool for simulating and predicting streamflow curry and zwiers 2018 liu et al 2020b nafchi et al 2022 schuol et al 2008 yang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2013 hydrological models include subprocesses like evapotranspiration et soil infiltration runoff generation and confluence liu et al 2015 plate 2009 shayannejad et al 2022 hydrologists have paid much attention to improving the accuracy of streamflow estimates by calibrating model parameter values early studies focused on retrieving model parameters using streamflow observations gassman et al 2007 nirupama et al 1995 schuol et al 2008 recent studies have demonstrated that streamflow measurements from hydrological stations are prone to the issue of pseudo accurate streamflow estimation wherein parameters are falsely adjusted owing to the neglect of the internal physical process guo et al 2017 rajib et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2017 et is a crucial component of the hydrological cycle accounting for over two thirds of the global precipitation loss jing et al 2019 talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 as a result et and streamflow have a complementary relationship and alterations in et related processes can significantly impact the overall watershed response guo et al 2017 many studies have attempted to improve streamflow simulations by incorporating et information some researchers have employed et observations to calibrate model parameters kunnath poovakka et al 2016 talebmorad et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless most hydrological models have focused on streamflow simulation and have adopted simplified et schemes introducing extra structural error in streamflow estimation fang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to validate the rationality of the et submodel in the hydrological model hydrological models estimate actual et using potential evapotranspiration and soil water stress abedi koupai et al 2022 zhao et al 2013 several potential evapotranspiration models exist including mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination types li et al 2016 the performance of these methods varies greatly due to different assumptions input data requirements and applicable climatic zones grismer et al 2002 lu et al 2005 moreover potential evapotranspiration is defined under an idealized situation and lacks actual observations in reality lhomme 1997 similarly the concept of soil water stress is defined from various perspectives zhao et al 2013 hence it is difficult to obtain accurate et based on potential evapotranspiration and soil water stress the data driven approach has achieved remarkable success in recent years due to the rapid growth of computational power availability of large datasets and advancements in data storage and sharing technologies razavi 2021 this method directly extracts the relationship between input features and output variables some researchers have developed data driven et models by applying flux data and have demonstrated their superior accuracy over traditional physically based models hu et al 2021 li et al 2018a wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 coupling the process based hydrological model with the data driven et submodel is possibly a reasonable solution to decrease the uncertainty of the et model and obtain a better streamflow estimation reichstein et al 2019 introduced a modelling strategy known as the hybrid approach which combines the physical foundations and interpretable compartments of process based models with the data adaptiveness of data driven models this approach leverages the strengths of both modelling strategies to provide a comprehensive and flexible framework for modelling complex systems process based hydrological models and data driven models are often viewed as distinct fields with different scientific paradigms and it is unclear how to couple them therefore integrating data driven et models into hydrological models represents a paradigm shift and poses certain challenges one of these challenges is ensuring that the data driven model accurately captures the complex relationship between environmental variables and et additionally it is equally crucial to verify that the hydrological model appropriately represents the movement of water in the system bennett and nijssen 2021 have successfully integrated the machine learning methods of turbulent heat fluxes into process based hydrological models pbhms and found a significant advantage in latent heat flux simulation compared to calibrated standalone benchmark simulations however only this focuses on the soundness of the et module and does not pay attention to the rationality of other hydrological processes it is urgent to explore whether the hybrid hydrological model with a data driven et submodel can acquire better streamflow estimation by coupling the models researchers can assess both the accuracy of et simulations and the performance of streamflow simulations providing a comprehensive evaluation of the hybrid hydrological model this study proposes using data driven et models in other hydrological models to explore more forms of hybrid hydrological models the estimation of streamflow is greatly influenced by the runoff generation mechanism robles morua et al 2012 there are two runoff generation mechanisms the saturation excess runoff mechanism horton 1993 and the infiltration excess runoff mechanism dunne and leopold 1978 in this study we selected two classical hydrological models xinanjiang xaj zhao 1992 and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 as the foundational models to build hybrid hydrological models the xaj model uses the saturation excess runoff mechanism while the swat model employs the infiltration excess runoff mechanism we trained the data driven et model using the fluxnet2015 dataset and the random forest rf algorithm and integrated it into the xaj model and swat model we analyzed the relationship between et and streamflow under the different runoff mechanisms furthermore we evaluated the hybrid models in watersheds with different climates including five humid watersheds and four arid watersheds the key contribution of this study is to explore the form of hybrid hydrological models and investigate the feasibility of the hybrid hydrological model for acquiring better streamflow estimation this study has two aspects of novelty 1 we proposed a new form for the hybrid hydrological model by integrating the well trained data driven et into the process based hydrological model and demonstrated that the hybrid hydrological models can improve the estimation accuracy of et and streamflow 2 we revealed that the runoff generation mechanism has a great impact on the performance of the hybrid model et greatly influences streamflow under the saturation excess runoff mechanism a careful selection of runoff generation mechanism is thus required when building the hybrid model the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the study area dataset data driven et model hybrid hydrological models and sensitivity analysis section 3 describes the effects of et on streamflow section 4 lists our discussion and recommendations for further research section 5 provides our conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area nine u s watersheds were selected to evaluate the performance of hybrid hydrological models in this study fig 1 these nine watersheds included the willamette river watershed wrw san joaquin river watershed sjrw yellowstone river watershed yrw cimarron river watershed crw trinity river watershed trw raccoon river watershed rrw illinois river watershed irw alabama river watershed arw and muskingum river watershed mrw table 1 the watershed selection was considered the availability of meteorological data satellite data and streamflow data to calibrate and validate models these nine distinct watersheds are located in different regions with drainage areas ranging from 9400 km2 to 103991 km2 the nine watersheds were divided into four arid watersheds and five humid watersheds based on the climate classification proposed by sayre et al 2020 the streamflow measurement at the watershed outlet was obtained from the u s geological survey usgs stream gages the main land use type of the nine watersheds was grassland gra cropland cro and woodland wol 2 2 data we selected fifteen north american flux sites from the fluxnet2015 dataset to build the data driven et model only data with a quality score above 0 9 was used in model development these sites spanned six land cover types gra cro evergreen needleleaf forest enf deciduous needleleaf forest dbf woody savanna wsa and open shrubland osh the world moisture domains product based on the value of the aridity index ai sayre et al 2020 was adopted to evaluate the climate zone condition of each flux site the ai divides two main climatic classes arid domains ai 0 05 0 65 and humid domains ai 0 65 sayre et al 2020 the study area sites are in arid and humid zones table 2 the hydrological models were forced with meteorological data hydrological data watershed characteristic data and satellite data precipitation p wind speed u air temperature ta maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin solar radiation rs and relative humidity rmd were downloaded from the nasa power system daily potential evapotranspiration data were acquired from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam product the gleam product uses the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 to calculate potential evapotranspiration digital elevation model dem data were used for watershed delineation from geospatial data cloud since the swat model is semi distributed spatial land use cover data and soil data are also required for subbasin division the land use cover data were downloaded from globeland30 the soil data came from state soil geographic statsgo data which was adopted in the swat database the fluxcom dataset jung et al 2019 was selected to validate the et precision of hydrological models on the regional scale daily and 0 5 resolution et data were adopted in this study this dataset ceres gpcp offers global et information during the period from 2001 to 2014 our simulation period was 2007 to 2020 using 3 years of initialization 2007 2009 as warm up period therefore we used the data from 2010 to 2014 to validate et accuracy streamflow data were obtained from usgs stream gages at the outlet of each watershed the calibration and validation simulation periods for daily streamflow were from 2010 to 2017 and 2018 to 2020 respectively the leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo were retrieved from modis products mcd15a2h mod13q1 myd13q1 and mcd43a3 respectively mcd15a2h products are an 8 day composite dataset with a 500 m pixel size mod13q1 myd13q1 products are composited every 16 days at a 250 m resolution mcd43a3 products are 500 m pixel daily images generated using 16 days of data modis products have issues of significant discontinuities and noise due to cloud and snow cover and instrument failure we removed outliers and null values and filled in the missing values using linear interpolation then the savitzky golay sg filter method savitzky and golay 1964 was used to reduce the noise interference of the modis products finally the filtered modis data were interpolated into a daily scale and resampled to a 1 km 1 km resolution 2 3 data driven et model this study used the rf method to build the data driven et model rf is a kind of ensemble learning approach it relies on the construction of decision trees on the training dataset to obtain its predictions and its output is the mode for the classification method or mean predictions for the regression method of each decision tree wang et al 2021a zhao et al 2019 each independent decision tree is created using a training set constructed by the bootstrap sampling method the rf method requires four parameters the number of decision trees n estimators the maximum depth of the tree max depth the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node min samples split and the minimum number of samples needed to be at a leaf node min samples leaf we set n estimators as 50 max depth as 10 min samples leaf as 2 and min samples split as 2 using the grid search method this study adopted the regression method to average many such trees for predictions f rf x 1 b b 1 b t b x where frf is the output of the random forest b is the number of decision trees tb is the output of a single decision tree and x is the input features et is a vital component of the watershed hydrological cycle and the interaction between the surface water and energy cycles wang et al 2017 employed ta rmd u and ndvi as input data for the machine learning algorithms to estimate latent heat flux xu et al 2018 estimated et based on five variables including rs p lai ta and rmd dou and yang 2018 selected ta soil temperature ts rn and rmd to drive machine learning models based on a review of the literature and data availability we chose u ta rmd rn lai and ndvi as input data for the et model 2 et f u t a r m d r n l a i n d v i it should be noted that we trained the data driven et model using the meteorological data and et observations from flux sites and estimated watershed et using the meteorological data from nasa power system the xaj model uses the average watershed et the swat model obtains the average et of each hydrological response unit hru 2 4 hybrid hydrological models the hybrid hydrological models were built by replacing the original et modules in the xaj model and swat model with a data driven et model the details of the hybrid hydrological model are shown as follows 2 4 1 etrf xaj model the xaj model is a conceptual hydrological model and adopts the saturation excess runoff mechanism the underlying assumptions of the xaj model are suitable only for humid and semi humid watersheds but its mathematical form can also be used in semi arid watersheds huang et al 2016 the xaj model has been widely tested in various climate zones guan et al 2019 huang et al 2016 rahman et al 2015 yang et al 2020a and in many regionalization studies qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 it consists of four modules et runoff generation runoff separation and runoff routing the soil is divided into three layers upper lower and deep layers the et is calculated based on potential evapotranspiration and three layers of soil moisture the et and soil water content at each layer are calculated first then they are accumulated to obtain the total et and soil water content only total et and soil water content are included in the streamflow calculation the rf method directly obtains the total et instead of the et in the three layers therefore the etrf xaj model considered only one layer of soil the specific modifications variables and parameters are shown in fig 2 table 3 and table 4 other modules remained unchanged the xaj model adopts the tension water capacity curve to calculate runoff yield under rainfall and soil storage deficits cheng et al 2020 the runoff components include three components i e surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff based on the free water capacity distribution curve yao et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 in the runoff routing module the united line is used to calculate surface runoff and the linear reservoir routing scheme is used to calculate interflow and groundwater the runoff yield is calculated as follows 3 r p e t w m w 0 p e t a w m m p e t w m w 0 w m 1 p e t a wmm 1 b p e t a w m m where r is the runoff from the previous area mm p is the precipitation mm et is the evapotranspiration mm wm is the areal mean tension water capacity mm w0 is the initial soil water mm a is the value of the tension water capacity curve corresponding to w0 mm wmm is the maximum tension water capacity over the catchment mm and b is the exponential number of storage capacity distribution curve we used markov chain monte carlo mcmc brooks 1998 to calibrate the xaj model and etrf xaj model the basis of mcmc simulation is a markov chain that makes a random walk through the search space and converges to a stationary distribution vrugt 2016 the mcmc method can facilitate the selection of suitable likelihood functions thus enhancing hydrological modelling by providing better estimations of parameters and quantities and enabling more accurate evaluations of uncertainty joseph and guillaume 2013 the study utilized a classical nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to depict the likelihood function 4 nse 1 i 1 n q obs q sim 2 i 1 n q obs q ave 2 where q o b s and q s i m are the observed and simulated values respectively q a v g is the mean observed value and n is the number of data values 2 4 2 etrf swat model swat is a semi distributed hydrological model it divides the entire watershed into several subbasins based on terrain features then these subbasins are subdivided into a number of hrus based on the properties of land uses soils and slopes the swat model uses the infiltration excess runoff mechanism it provides two methods for estimating surface runoff the soil conservation service scs curve number scs 1972 method and the green ampt infiltration green and ampt 1911 method the scs curve number method is used to simulate the distribution of precipitation on the soil surface between runoff and infiltration in simulations with sub daily and daily time steps the green ampt infiltration method requires partitioning precipitation at the soil surface into runoff and infiltration for sub daily time step simulations this study used the scs curve number method to evaluate the daily surface runoff which can be calculated as follows 5 qsurf p i a 2 p i a s 6 s swat 25 4 1000 cn 10 7 s swat s max 1 sw s w exp w 1 w 2 s w 8 s swat s prev e 0 exp cncoef s prev s max p q surf where qsurf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess mm p is precipitation mm ia is the initial abstractions which include surface storage interception and infiltration before runoff mm and sswat is the retention parameter mm the initial abstraction ia is commonly approximated as 0 2 sswat cn is the curve number for the day the scs method defines three antecedent moisture conditions cn1 dry condition wilting point cn2 average condition and cn3 wet condition field capacity smax is the maximum value the retention parameter can achieve on a given day mm sw is the soil moisture of the entire profile excluding the amount of water held in the profile at wilting point mm and w1 and w2 are shape coefficients sprev is the retention parameter for the previous day mm e0 is the potential evapotranspiration for the day mm day cncoef is the weighting coefficient the swat model contains three alternative schemes for potential evapotranspiration estimation including the penman monteith allen et al 1989 monteith 1965 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 and priestley taylor methods the potential evapotranspiration data by the xaj model are obtained based on the priestley taylor method so the swat model was also calculated using the priestley taylor method the priestley taylor method requires ta rs and rmd in the swat model the et contains three components canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration the model first evaporates precipitation intercepted by the plant canopy canopy interception is a part of the initial abstractions using the scs curve number method next swat calculates the maximum transpiration and soil evaporation of each soil layer the et is obtained by summing the actual plant transpiration and soil evaporation of each layer the swat model calculates the et not only by considering the information on soil stratification but also by dividing it into plant transpiration and soil evaporation the data driven et model does not output plant transpiration and soil evaporation at each layer to integrate the data driven et model into the swat model the ratio of plant transpiration and soil evaporation at each layer to total evapotranspiration in the original swat model was adopted to partition the output of the data driven et model fig 3 a and 3b in addition an extra constraint that the data driven et should be lower than the potential evapotranspiration was adopted in this work because the potential evapotranspiration in the swat model represents the maximum evapotranspiration in the watershed and is associated with a number of hydrological processes such as revaping to the soil profile plant roots evaporation and seepage from the ponds and reservoir and the master soil percolation component the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup is a computer program for calibrating the swat model and etrf swat model swat cup is a standalone software developed for parameter sensitivity analysis calibration validation and model uncertainty analyses we utilized the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 2007 of the swat cup model to calibrate the streamflow sufi 2 carries out a combined optimization and uncertainty analysis using a global search algorithm and can cope with a large number of parameters through latin hypercube sampling the nse was selected as the objective function to compare the measured and simulated streamflow values the model parameters are shown in table 5 2 5 sensitivity analysis the key to the hybrid models in this study is the modification of the et submodel therefore it was necessary to characterize the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff mechanisms the sensitivity curve method was employed for both the xaj and the swat models this method has been widely applied because of its convenient calculation and straightforward interpretability goyal 2004 guo et al 2017 jeevananda reddy 1995 long et al 2011 webster et al 2016 only et was perturbing and all other variables remained unchanged the perturbation levels of et relative to its historical baseline consisted of four equally spaced levels of 10 5 5 and 10 with each perturbation level being used as a factor in the whole time series of the corresponding daily historical data 3 results 3 1 the accuracy of et estimation the performance of the data driven et model was assessed using evaluation metrics such as the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and median absolute percentage error mdape as shown in fig 4 the results found that the data driven et model achieved excellent performance in the training set the r2 reached 0 89 and the rmse and mdape were as low as 0 38 mm day 1 and 25 44 respectively high accuracy was also achieved in the valid set and test set with an r2 of 0 82 an rmse of 0 49 mm day 1 and a mdape of 31 we further analyzed the performance of the data driven et model in the humid and arid zones in the test dataset see table 1 for the humid and arid conditions of the sites as shown in fig 5 the r2 was 0 85 the rmse was 0 55 mm day 1 and the mdape was 28 05 in the humid zones and the r2 was 0 81 the rmse was 0 45 mm day 1 and the mdape was 31 12 in the arid zones overall the data driven et model performed well in both humid and arid zones and its accuracy was slightly higher in the humid zones than in the arid zones finally we used fluxcom data to evaluate the et accuracy of different models in nine watersheds the coupling of the data driven et model with both the xaj and swat models resulted in satisfactory accuracy for et estimates in nine watersheds figs 6 7 the robustness of the three models in estimating et can be ranked from high to low as follows data driven model swat model and xaj model the et results obtained from the etrf xaj model and the etrf swat model exhibited little difference this result is mainly because the two models have different input forms and may exists some errors the average watershed et is directly computed in the etrf xaj model while the et for each hru is first calculated and then the regional et is obtained by area weighted averaging in the etrf swat model the etrf xaj model had obvious advantages over the xaj model for simulating et fig 6 except for the mrw the etrf xaj model of other watersheds performed best in three metrics in the mrw the r2 increased by 0 11 while the rmse and mdape increased by 0 14 mm day 1 and 12 15 respectively fig 6i this result indicated that the model has achieved a better fit to the data but there may be a decrease in the accuracy of the model in estimating the actual values the most apparent modification advantage was in the wrw in which the r2 increased by 0 65 and the rmse and mdape decreased by 1 18 mm day 1 and 50 08 respectively fig 6a the etrf swat model significantly outperformed the swat model except for the wrw fig 7 in the wrw the r2 rmse and mdape of the swat model reached 0 82 0 62 mm day 1 and 34 45 respectively fig 7a the accuracy of the etrf swat model was slightly lower than that of the swat model and tends to overestimate the results however it also achieved good performance with an r2 of 0 73 an rmse of 0 91 mm day 1 and a mdape of 43 90 except for the arw the etrf swat model of the other seven watersheds performed best in three metrics in the arw the r2 increased by 0 13 and the rmse and mdape increased by 0 27 mm day 1 and 14 39 respectively fig 7h the etrf swat model had the greatest advantage in the mrw fig 7i the r2 increased by 0 29 the rmse decreased by 0 17 mm day 1 and the mdape decreased by 3 38 3 2 sensitivity of streamflow to et under different runoff generation mechanisms as shown in fig 8 et was negatively correlated with the streamflow estimates in the xaj model and swat model notably the xaj model compared to the swat model consistently displayed stronger sensitivity to changes in et across all nine watersheds the et increased by 10 in the nine watersheds and the average daily streamflow in the xaj model and swat model decreased by 12 8 and 4 2 respectively the magnitude of sensitivity varied between watersheds with the crw exhibiting the strongest sensitivity and the wrw displaying the weakest in the crw an et decrease of 10 in the xaj model corresponded to a streamflow reduction of 68 32 which was primarily attributed to low flow values in the denominator of the change rate calculation 3 3 accuracy of streamflow estimation three metrics including the r2 nse and rmse were utilized to assess the accuracy of streamflow estimation as shown in fig 9 the four hydrological models achieved satisfactory performance in most cases the etrf xaj model outperformed the other three models during peak flow periods such as on september 10 2014 in the rrw july 4 2015 and january 7 2016 in the irw and march 10 2020 in the mrw during these times the four hydrological models underestimated the peak flow and the etrf xaj model could improve this situation in the calibration period the swat model significantly outperformed the xaj model in the wrw yrw crw trw rrw and mrw while the opposite result was found in the sjrw irw and arw the results in the validation period were consistent with those in the calibration period except for the trw and irw this result indicated that increasing the complexity of hydrological model structures does not necessarily lead to better results in streamflow simulation indeed previous studies have shown that simpler models can perform just as well or better than more complex models and the choice of model structure should depend on the specific application and available data beven and binley 1992 nash and sutcliffe 1970 wagener et al 2003 the etrf xaj model outperformed the xaj model in the nine watersheds fig 10 the most significant improvement occurred in the crw this finding is consistent with the sensitivity analysis which revealed that et had the most substantial impact on streamflow in the crw the r2 and nse of the etrf xaj model were 0 13 and 0 16 greater than those of the xaj model respectively while the rmse was reduced by 8 32 m3 s during the calibration period a more prominent improvement occurred during the validation period the r2 and nse of the etrf xaj model were 0 14 and 0 18 higher than those of the xaj model respectively while the rmse was reduced by 33 25 m3 s this phenomenon implied that the et module in the xaj model had a great impact on streamflow the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies which indicated that the streamflow was insensitive to et in the framework of the swat model we further analyzed the streamflow simulation accuracy of the four models in humid and arid watersheds both the etrf xaj and etrf swat models in streamflow simulation outperformed their corresponding base models xaj and swat in humid and arid watersheds fig 11 furthermore etrf xaj led to a greater improvement in accuracy than the xaj model in humid watersheds the etrf xaj model improved the r2 and nse values by 0 04 and 0 06 respectively and the rmse decreased by 57 57 m3 s compared to the xaj model the etrf swat model had only a decreased rmse of 2 04 m3 s compared to the swat model in arid watersheds the etrf xaj model improved the r2 and nse values by 0 06 and 0 07 respectively and reduced the rmse by 21 39 m3 s compared to the xaj model the etrf swat model exhibited little improvement relative to the swat model with an increase in the r2 and nse values by 0 1 and a decrease in the rmse by 2 67 m3 s furthermore in arid and humid watersheds the etrf xaj model can effectively improve the issue of peak flow underestimation in the xaj model finally we examined the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff generations in different seasons the etrf xaj model performed best among the four models fig 12 the three statistical metrics for the etrf xaj model were better than those for the xaj model while the etrf swat model was the same as the swat model in spring the etrf xaj model had the most significant modification advantage compared to the xaj model the r2 and nse of the etrf xaj model were 0 05 and 0 11 greater than those of the xaj model respectively while the rmse was reduced by 45 37 m3 s the four models had the best applicability in spring and the worst applicability in winter in spring the average changes in the r2 nse and rmse of the four models varied in the ranges of 0 46 0 89 0 32 0 87 and 49 81 m3 s 616 64 m3 s respectively in winter the average changes in the r2 nse and rmse of the four models varied in the ranges of 0 04 0 92 18 83 0 91 and 22 26 m3 s 613 52 m3 s respectively the average nse of the four models was relatively low in winter mainly due to outliers yrw and crw the simulated values of the four models were greatly overestimated in the yrw and crw 4 discussion 4 1 response of streamflow to et under different runoff generation mechanisms hydrological models typically rely on a single runoff generation mechanism liu et al 2020b this study chose two classical models xaj and swat to analyze the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff generation mechanisms the xaj model and the swat model not only differ in the runoff generation mechanisms but also in their model structure concept model vs semi distributed model hydrological models with different structures can achieve the same level of accuracy li et al 2018b shi et al 2011 a more complex model structure does not necessarily result in better runoff simulation gan et al 1997 reported that the performance gap among the different hydrological models was mainly due to differences in the runoff generation mechanisms in this study we tried to unify the input data of the xaj model and swat model as much as possible we used the tyson polygon method to derive regional averages for p data potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the priestley taylor method in the xaj model and swat model the xaj model is a lumped hydrological model while the swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model therefore additional land use data and soil data were employed in the swat model for subbasin delineation previous research has shown that it is not the lumped or semi distributed model structure but rather the runoff mechanisms that affect streamflow estimation franchini and pacciani 1991 gan et al 1997 johnson et al 2003 the data driven et model has obvious advantages over the hydrological models in obtaining et figs 6 and 7 the et accuracy was improved while the performance of streamflow varied differently between models the etrf xaj model improved the streamflow estimation compared to the xaj model while the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies figs 9 12 the sensitivity analysis for all nine watersheds demonstrated that the et in the xaj model had a stronger influence on streamflow estimation than in the swat model fig 8 we further analyzed the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff generation mechanisms from the perspective of runoff yield equations eq 3 indicates that et can directly affect runoff yield in the xaj model the swat model calculated streamflow based on eqs 5 8 the critical parameter of the swat model for runoff generation is cn cn is defined as three antecedent moisture conditions including dry conditions average conditions and wet conditions it is calculated by sswat the swat model applied two different methods for calculating sswat eqs 7 and 8 respectively according to eqs 5 8 the swat model had no direct link between et and streamflow et had an indirect influence on streamflow through soil moisture this study showed that the xaj model that applies the saturation excess runoff mechanism has a genuine capacity for increasing the accuracy of streamflow by better representing et this conclusion holds across different seasons and climatic zones our findings are consistent with those of robles morua et al 2012 who demonstrated that annual and seasonal et rates are correlated with the proportion of runoff mechanisms specifically they found that et increases when saturation excess dominates and decreases when infiltration excess is more significant it partially explained how et affects streamflow under different runoff generation mechanisms this study further showed that et greatly influences streamflow under the saturation excess runoff mechanism these findings can inform the development of hybrid models and contribute to our understanding of the relationship between et and streamflow 4 2 evaluation of hybrid strategies for hydrological models it should be acknowledged that the form of the hybrid hydrological model is flexible because many subprocesses and parameters in hydrological models can affect streamflow estimation typically hybrid models are classified into three types surrogate modelling one way coupling and modular coupling abrahart et al 2012 razavi 2021 this study applied a modular coupling method the method of surrogate modelling and one way coupling is detailed in razavi 2021 compared to the first two methods the advantage of our study fully leverages the physical information in the hydrological model and considers the uncertainty of the model structure modular coupling attempts to add hydrological information to a neural network or uses a neural network as a module submodel of a hydrological model razavi 2021 one method is taking the non standard output of the hydrological model as the input for machine learning another modular coupling method involves taking machine learning as a module sub model of the hydrological model the first method increases the information abundance of input data in the data driven model using physical models humphrey et al 2016 kim et al 2023 okkan et al 2021 ren et al 2018 however the extra information from the output of physical models is highly likely to be biased and thus the first modular coupling method risks introducing incorrect information our study focused on the adverse effect of the simplified et module in the hydrological model and overcame this issue by replacing the classical et module with a data driven submodel in process based hydrological models we integrated the data driven et model into the hydrological models using the second modular coupling method in comparison with the first modular coupling method the physical interpretability of the second modular coupling method is more clear our method retained the backbone of the hydrological model and used machine learning to replace semi empirical formulas in submodules where sufficient observations were available bennett and nijssen 2021 coupled the et module into hydrological models it paid more attention only to evaporation and convective heat transport and did not consider the impact of this sub module on other modules the greatest strength of our study was embedding the data driven et submodel into hydrological models and then enhancing the streamflow which is an overall response depending on the watershed water balance with the easy availability of high quality and more advanced algorithms it provided more opportunities for a data driven model kraft et al 2021 proposed a hybrid form of global hydrological modelling that utilizes terrestrial water storage variations runoff et and snow water equivalent in machine learning to replace complex physical subprocesses loritz et al 2022 that integrated canopy conductance inferred from sap flow data in a hydrological model leads to more realistic soil moisture estimates than using the conventional jarvis stewart equation dong et al 2023 used two data driven reservoir operation schemes to predict reservoir releases and storage in hydrologic models these studies applied more data information to build a hybrid model but this is far from enough more forms of the hybrid model are worth exploring hybrid hydrological models combine physical and data driven models to improve their overall performance in simulating hydrological processes however there are some disadvantages the data driven model requires a large number of training datasets to obtain reliable forecasts this can be a limitation in data sparse regions or for small watersheds where data collection is limited furthermore process based hydrological models may not capture all the complexities of hydrological processes while data driven models may not generalize well outside the calibration range 4 3 uncertainty in hybrid hydrological models to summarize this study offers a form of hybrid hydrological models that replace the et module in classical hydrological models with data driven et and tests the feasibility of the hybrid hydrological model for acquiring better streamflow estimation however the study has some limitations firstly input data elements of the data driven et model are deficient previous studies considered the impact of p and soil moisture on the et process xu et al 2018 hu et al 2021 there was no good quality et observations when p occurred because the signals of h2o and co2 of the eddy covariance system are typically contaminated by p in addition the correlation between p and et is mainly on a monthly scale feng et al 2020 while the data driven et model in this study is on a daily timescale therefore it is an acceptance to ignore the p in this study the soil moisture is available at the flux sites however it is challenging to consider the effect of soil moisture on the data driven et model in the framework of hydrological models the flux sites do not offer the measurement depth of soil moisture the xaj and swat models separate soil into several layers moreover the xaj model directly calculates the total soil moisture in the whole watershed when training the et model using in situ soil moisture observations and integrating the well trained et model in hydrological models we cannot directly apply soil moisture estimation from hydrological models to calculate et therefore the data driven et model in this study did not include soil moisture in further study we can integrate data from multiple sources such as remote sensing data smos ascat and amsr2 and ground based soil moisture datasets this study applied two typical hydrological models in nine watersheds these watershed areas ranged from 9400 km2 to 103991 km2 for large catchments a semi distributed version of the xaj model may be required the semi distributed xaj model provides advantages over the lumped xaj model in representing the effect of spatially variable inputs and catchment properties hinge et al 2022 however many previous studies have demonstrated the robustness of the lumped xaj model qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 based on the above references we think the lumped xaj model may be suitable for large catchments this study also obtained satisfactory accuracy using the lumped xaj model in the nine watersheds further research can consider the application of a semi distributed xaj model to construct a hybrid hydrological model lastly two typical hydrological models were employed to test the impact of et on streamflow at daily scales in the future more models can be used to comprehensively investigate the effects of et on streamflow under different runoff generation conditions the annual monthly and hourly et model coupled with the hydrological model is important for water management the applicability of the coupling and hybrid models at different time scales can be further explored 5 conclusion this study aimed to improve the accuracy of streamflow estimation by integrating a data driven et submodel into the xaj and swat models with different runoff generation mechanisms a data driven et model was established using the rf method in combination with fifteen north american flux sites from the fluxnet2015 dataset and modis products we used the fluxcom dataset to estimate the accuracy of et for the four hydrological models we further evaluated the streamflow estimation using usgs stream gages in the nine u s watersheds and different seasons the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 we proposed a new form of a hybrid hydrological model by integrating the well trained data driven et into the process based hydrological models and demonstrated that the hybrid hydrological models achieved satisfactory accuracy in evaluating et and streamflow the hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of the model but also confirms the rationality of the internal physical process in the hydrological models 2 the improvement of hybrid models highly relies on different runoff mechanisms the etrf xaj model outperformed the xaj model in streamflow estimation while the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies the sensitivity curve method showed that the sensitivity of streamflow to et in xaj was consistently stronger than that in swat in the runoff yield calculation et directly affects the runoff yield in the xaj model whereas et has an indirect influence on streamflow in the swat model 3 when peak flow occurred the etrf xaj model effectively corrected the underestimate of the original xaj model this study provides new insight into hydrological modelling and indicates that hybrid models have great potential for simulating streamflow credit

1890,hydrological models are powerful tools for estimating streamflow however they typically simplify the representation of the evapotranspiration et process which increases the uncertainty in et estimation and further introduces extra error in streamflow simulation this study constrains the uncertainty of et and improves the accuracy of streamflow estimation by replacing the classical et module with a data driven submodel in process based hydrological models the data driven et submodel was first built based on the fluxnet2015 dataset and the random forest rf algorithm and then integrated into two classic hydrological models with different runoff generation mechanisms the xinanjiang xaj model which is driven by the saturation excess runoff mechanism and the soil and water assessment tool swat model which is based on the infiltration excess runoff mechanism the sensitivity of streamflow to et under the xaj and swat models as well as the performance of the hybrid hydrological models named the etrf xaj model and the etrf swat model was evaluated using the et and streamflow observations in nine u s watersheds the results showed that streamflow was more sensitive to et in the xaj model the etrf xaj model obviously outperformed the xaj model while the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies this similar result was also founded in different climatic zones and seasons this phenomenon can be attributed to the stronger link between et and streamflow under saturation excess runoff mechanisms the etrf xaj model effectively improved the original xaj model which underestimated peak flow this study highlights that the hybrid model has great potential for improved streamflow simulation while building the well performed hybrid model highly relies on the physical framework of the hydrological model keywords streamflow evapotranspiration hybrid model swat xaj machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resource management such as reservoir operation water environment treatment water quality simulation and agricultural irrigation cheng et al 2020 fathian et al 2019 ju et al 2020 kisi et al 2012 liu et al 2022 ni et al 2020 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 however accurately predicting streamflow is a great challenge due to the nonlinear and nonstationarity properties of streamflow and its sensitivity to both meteorological and human factors ostad ali askari 2022 zhang et al 2021 with the efforts of hydrologists hydrological models have become a powerful tool for simulating and predicting streamflow curry and zwiers 2018 liu et al 2020b nafchi et al 2022 schuol et al 2008 yang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2013 hydrological models include subprocesses like evapotranspiration et soil infiltration runoff generation and confluence liu et al 2015 plate 2009 shayannejad et al 2022 hydrologists have paid much attention to improving the accuracy of streamflow estimates by calibrating model parameter values early studies focused on retrieving model parameters using streamflow observations gassman et al 2007 nirupama et al 1995 schuol et al 2008 recent studies have demonstrated that streamflow measurements from hydrological stations are prone to the issue of pseudo accurate streamflow estimation wherein parameters are falsely adjusted owing to the neglect of the internal physical process guo et al 2017 rajib et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2017 et is a crucial component of the hydrological cycle accounting for over two thirds of the global precipitation loss jing et al 2019 talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 as a result et and streamflow have a complementary relationship and alterations in et related processes can significantly impact the overall watershed response guo et al 2017 many studies have attempted to improve streamflow simulations by incorporating et information some researchers have employed et observations to calibrate model parameters kunnath poovakka et al 2016 talebmorad et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 nevertheless most hydrological models have focused on streamflow simulation and have adopted simplified et schemes introducing extra structural error in streamflow estimation fang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to validate the rationality of the et submodel in the hydrological model hydrological models estimate actual et using potential evapotranspiration and soil water stress abedi koupai et al 2022 zhao et al 2013 several potential evapotranspiration models exist including mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination types li et al 2016 the performance of these methods varies greatly due to different assumptions input data requirements and applicable climatic zones grismer et al 2002 lu et al 2005 moreover potential evapotranspiration is defined under an idealized situation and lacks actual observations in reality lhomme 1997 similarly the concept of soil water stress is defined from various perspectives zhao et al 2013 hence it is difficult to obtain accurate et based on potential evapotranspiration and soil water stress the data driven approach has achieved remarkable success in recent years due to the rapid growth of computational power availability of large datasets and advancements in data storage and sharing technologies razavi 2021 this method directly extracts the relationship between input features and output variables some researchers have developed data driven et models by applying flux data and have demonstrated their superior accuracy over traditional physically based models hu et al 2021 li et al 2018a wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 coupling the process based hydrological model with the data driven et submodel is possibly a reasonable solution to decrease the uncertainty of the et model and obtain a better streamflow estimation reichstein et al 2019 introduced a modelling strategy known as the hybrid approach which combines the physical foundations and interpretable compartments of process based models with the data adaptiveness of data driven models this approach leverages the strengths of both modelling strategies to provide a comprehensive and flexible framework for modelling complex systems process based hydrological models and data driven models are often viewed as distinct fields with different scientific paradigms and it is unclear how to couple them therefore integrating data driven et models into hydrological models represents a paradigm shift and poses certain challenges one of these challenges is ensuring that the data driven model accurately captures the complex relationship between environmental variables and et additionally it is equally crucial to verify that the hydrological model appropriately represents the movement of water in the system bennett and nijssen 2021 have successfully integrated the machine learning methods of turbulent heat fluxes into process based hydrological models pbhms and found a significant advantage in latent heat flux simulation compared to calibrated standalone benchmark simulations however only this focuses on the soundness of the et module and does not pay attention to the rationality of other hydrological processes it is urgent to explore whether the hybrid hydrological model with a data driven et submodel can acquire better streamflow estimation by coupling the models researchers can assess both the accuracy of et simulations and the performance of streamflow simulations providing a comprehensive evaluation of the hybrid hydrological model this study proposes using data driven et models in other hydrological models to explore more forms of hybrid hydrological models the estimation of streamflow is greatly influenced by the runoff generation mechanism robles morua et al 2012 there are two runoff generation mechanisms the saturation excess runoff mechanism horton 1993 and the infiltration excess runoff mechanism dunne and leopold 1978 in this study we selected two classical hydrological models xinanjiang xaj zhao 1992 and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 as the foundational models to build hybrid hydrological models the xaj model uses the saturation excess runoff mechanism while the swat model employs the infiltration excess runoff mechanism we trained the data driven et model using the fluxnet2015 dataset and the random forest rf algorithm and integrated it into the xaj model and swat model we analyzed the relationship between et and streamflow under the different runoff mechanisms furthermore we evaluated the hybrid models in watersheds with different climates including five humid watersheds and four arid watersheds the key contribution of this study is to explore the form of hybrid hydrological models and investigate the feasibility of the hybrid hydrological model for acquiring better streamflow estimation this study has two aspects of novelty 1 we proposed a new form for the hybrid hydrological model by integrating the well trained data driven et into the process based hydrological model and demonstrated that the hybrid hydrological models can improve the estimation accuracy of et and streamflow 2 we revealed that the runoff generation mechanism has a great impact on the performance of the hybrid model et greatly influences streamflow under the saturation excess runoff mechanism a careful selection of runoff generation mechanism is thus required when building the hybrid model the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the study area dataset data driven et model hybrid hydrological models and sensitivity analysis section 3 describes the effects of et on streamflow section 4 lists our discussion and recommendations for further research section 5 provides our conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area nine u s watersheds were selected to evaluate the performance of hybrid hydrological models in this study fig 1 these nine watersheds included the willamette river watershed wrw san joaquin river watershed sjrw yellowstone river watershed yrw cimarron river watershed crw trinity river watershed trw raccoon river watershed rrw illinois river watershed irw alabama river watershed arw and muskingum river watershed mrw table 1 the watershed selection was considered the availability of meteorological data satellite data and streamflow data to calibrate and validate models these nine distinct watersheds are located in different regions with drainage areas ranging from 9400 km2 to 103991 km2 the nine watersheds were divided into four arid watersheds and five humid watersheds based on the climate classification proposed by sayre et al 2020 the streamflow measurement at the watershed outlet was obtained from the u s geological survey usgs stream gages the main land use type of the nine watersheds was grassland gra cropland cro and woodland wol 2 2 data we selected fifteen north american flux sites from the fluxnet2015 dataset to build the data driven et model only data with a quality score above 0 9 was used in model development these sites spanned six land cover types gra cro evergreen needleleaf forest enf deciduous needleleaf forest dbf woody savanna wsa and open shrubland osh the world moisture domains product based on the value of the aridity index ai sayre et al 2020 was adopted to evaluate the climate zone condition of each flux site the ai divides two main climatic classes arid domains ai 0 05 0 65 and humid domains ai 0 65 sayre et al 2020 the study area sites are in arid and humid zones table 2 the hydrological models were forced with meteorological data hydrological data watershed characteristic data and satellite data precipitation p wind speed u air temperature ta maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin solar radiation rs and relative humidity rmd were downloaded from the nasa power system daily potential evapotranspiration data were acquired from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam product the gleam product uses the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 to calculate potential evapotranspiration digital elevation model dem data were used for watershed delineation from geospatial data cloud since the swat model is semi distributed spatial land use cover data and soil data are also required for subbasin division the land use cover data were downloaded from globeland30 the soil data came from state soil geographic statsgo data which was adopted in the swat database the fluxcom dataset jung et al 2019 was selected to validate the et precision of hydrological models on the regional scale daily and 0 5 resolution et data were adopted in this study this dataset ceres gpcp offers global et information during the period from 2001 to 2014 our simulation period was 2007 to 2020 using 3 years of initialization 2007 2009 as warm up period therefore we used the data from 2010 to 2014 to validate et accuracy streamflow data were obtained from usgs stream gages at the outlet of each watershed the calibration and validation simulation periods for daily streamflow were from 2010 to 2017 and 2018 to 2020 respectively the leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo were retrieved from modis products mcd15a2h mod13q1 myd13q1 and mcd43a3 respectively mcd15a2h products are an 8 day composite dataset with a 500 m pixel size mod13q1 myd13q1 products are composited every 16 days at a 250 m resolution mcd43a3 products are 500 m pixel daily images generated using 16 days of data modis products have issues of significant discontinuities and noise due to cloud and snow cover and instrument failure we removed outliers and null values and filled in the missing values using linear interpolation then the savitzky golay sg filter method savitzky and golay 1964 was used to reduce the noise interference of the modis products finally the filtered modis data were interpolated into a daily scale and resampled to a 1 km 1 km resolution 2 3 data driven et model this study used the rf method to build the data driven et model rf is a kind of ensemble learning approach it relies on the construction of decision trees on the training dataset to obtain its predictions and its output is the mode for the classification method or mean predictions for the regression method of each decision tree wang et al 2021a zhao et al 2019 each independent decision tree is created using a training set constructed by the bootstrap sampling method the rf method requires four parameters the number of decision trees n estimators the maximum depth of the tree max depth the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node min samples split and the minimum number of samples needed to be at a leaf node min samples leaf we set n estimators as 50 max depth as 10 min samples leaf as 2 and min samples split as 2 using the grid search method this study adopted the regression method to average many such trees for predictions f rf x 1 b b 1 b t b x where frf is the output of the random forest b is the number of decision trees tb is the output of a single decision tree and x is the input features et is a vital component of the watershed hydrological cycle and the interaction between the surface water and energy cycles wang et al 2017 employed ta rmd u and ndvi as input data for the machine learning algorithms to estimate latent heat flux xu et al 2018 estimated et based on five variables including rs p lai ta and rmd dou and yang 2018 selected ta soil temperature ts rn and rmd to drive machine learning models based on a review of the literature and data availability we chose u ta rmd rn lai and ndvi as input data for the et model 2 et f u t a r m d r n l a i n d v i it should be noted that we trained the data driven et model using the meteorological data and et observations from flux sites and estimated watershed et using the meteorological data from nasa power system the xaj model uses the average watershed et the swat model obtains the average et of each hydrological response unit hru 2 4 hybrid hydrological models the hybrid hydrological models were built by replacing the original et modules in the xaj model and swat model with a data driven et model the details of the hybrid hydrological model are shown as follows 2 4 1 etrf xaj model the xaj model is a conceptual hydrological model and adopts the saturation excess runoff mechanism the underlying assumptions of the xaj model are suitable only for humid and semi humid watersheds but its mathematical form can also be used in semi arid watersheds huang et al 2016 the xaj model has been widely tested in various climate zones guan et al 2019 huang et al 2016 rahman et al 2015 yang et al 2020a and in many regionalization studies qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 it consists of four modules et runoff generation runoff separation and runoff routing the soil is divided into three layers upper lower and deep layers the et is calculated based on potential evapotranspiration and three layers of soil moisture the et and soil water content at each layer are calculated first then they are accumulated to obtain the total et and soil water content only total et and soil water content are included in the streamflow calculation the rf method directly obtains the total et instead of the et in the three layers therefore the etrf xaj model considered only one layer of soil the specific modifications variables and parameters are shown in fig 2 table 3 and table 4 other modules remained unchanged the xaj model adopts the tension water capacity curve to calculate runoff yield under rainfall and soil storage deficits cheng et al 2020 the runoff components include three components i e surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff based on the free water capacity distribution curve yao et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 in the runoff routing module the united line is used to calculate surface runoff and the linear reservoir routing scheme is used to calculate interflow and groundwater the runoff yield is calculated as follows 3 r p e t w m w 0 p e t a w m m p e t w m w 0 w m 1 p e t a wmm 1 b p e t a w m m where r is the runoff from the previous area mm p is the precipitation mm et is the evapotranspiration mm wm is the areal mean tension water capacity mm w0 is the initial soil water mm a is the value of the tension water capacity curve corresponding to w0 mm wmm is the maximum tension water capacity over the catchment mm and b is the exponential number of storage capacity distribution curve we used markov chain monte carlo mcmc brooks 1998 to calibrate the xaj model and etrf xaj model the basis of mcmc simulation is a markov chain that makes a random walk through the search space and converges to a stationary distribution vrugt 2016 the mcmc method can facilitate the selection of suitable likelihood functions thus enhancing hydrological modelling by providing better estimations of parameters and quantities and enabling more accurate evaluations of uncertainty joseph and guillaume 2013 the study utilized a classical nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to depict the likelihood function 4 nse 1 i 1 n q obs q sim 2 i 1 n q obs q ave 2 where q o b s and q s i m are the observed and simulated values respectively q a v g is the mean observed value and n is the number of data values 2 4 2 etrf swat model swat is a semi distributed hydrological model it divides the entire watershed into several subbasins based on terrain features then these subbasins are subdivided into a number of hrus based on the properties of land uses soils and slopes the swat model uses the infiltration excess runoff mechanism it provides two methods for estimating surface runoff the soil conservation service scs curve number scs 1972 method and the green ampt infiltration green and ampt 1911 method the scs curve number method is used to simulate the distribution of precipitation on the soil surface between runoff and infiltration in simulations with sub daily and daily time steps the green ampt infiltration method requires partitioning precipitation at the soil surface into runoff and infiltration for sub daily time step simulations this study used the scs curve number method to evaluate the daily surface runoff which can be calculated as follows 5 qsurf p i a 2 p i a s 6 s swat 25 4 1000 cn 10 7 s swat s max 1 sw s w exp w 1 w 2 s w 8 s swat s prev e 0 exp cncoef s prev s max p q surf where qsurf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess mm p is precipitation mm ia is the initial abstractions which include surface storage interception and infiltration before runoff mm and sswat is the retention parameter mm the initial abstraction ia is commonly approximated as 0 2 sswat cn is the curve number for the day the scs method defines three antecedent moisture conditions cn1 dry condition wilting point cn2 average condition and cn3 wet condition field capacity smax is the maximum value the retention parameter can achieve on a given day mm sw is the soil moisture of the entire profile excluding the amount of water held in the profile at wilting point mm and w1 and w2 are shape coefficients sprev is the retention parameter for the previous day mm e0 is the potential evapotranspiration for the day mm day cncoef is the weighting coefficient the swat model contains three alternative schemes for potential evapotranspiration estimation including the penman monteith allen et al 1989 monteith 1965 hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 and priestley taylor methods the potential evapotranspiration data by the xaj model are obtained based on the priestley taylor method so the swat model was also calculated using the priestley taylor method the priestley taylor method requires ta rs and rmd in the swat model the et contains three components canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration the model first evaporates precipitation intercepted by the plant canopy canopy interception is a part of the initial abstractions using the scs curve number method next swat calculates the maximum transpiration and soil evaporation of each soil layer the et is obtained by summing the actual plant transpiration and soil evaporation of each layer the swat model calculates the et not only by considering the information on soil stratification but also by dividing it into plant transpiration and soil evaporation the data driven et model does not output plant transpiration and soil evaporation at each layer to integrate the data driven et model into the swat model the ratio of plant transpiration and soil evaporation at each layer to total evapotranspiration in the original swat model was adopted to partition the output of the data driven et model fig 3 a and 3b in addition an extra constraint that the data driven et should be lower than the potential evapotranspiration was adopted in this work because the potential evapotranspiration in the swat model represents the maximum evapotranspiration in the watershed and is associated with a number of hydrological processes such as revaping to the soil profile plant roots evaporation and seepage from the ponds and reservoir and the master soil percolation component the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup is a computer program for calibrating the swat model and etrf swat model swat cup is a standalone software developed for parameter sensitivity analysis calibration validation and model uncertainty analyses we utilized the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 2007 of the swat cup model to calibrate the streamflow sufi 2 carries out a combined optimization and uncertainty analysis using a global search algorithm and can cope with a large number of parameters through latin hypercube sampling the nse was selected as the objective function to compare the measured and simulated streamflow values the model parameters are shown in table 5 2 5 sensitivity analysis the key to the hybrid models in this study is the modification of the et submodel therefore it was necessary to characterize the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff mechanisms the sensitivity curve method was employed for both the xaj and the swat models this method has been widely applied because of its convenient calculation and straightforward interpretability goyal 2004 guo et al 2017 jeevananda reddy 1995 long et al 2011 webster et al 2016 only et was perturbing and all other variables remained unchanged the perturbation levels of et relative to its historical baseline consisted of four equally spaced levels of 10 5 5 and 10 with each perturbation level being used as a factor in the whole time series of the corresponding daily historical data 3 results 3 1 the accuracy of et estimation the performance of the data driven et model was assessed using evaluation metrics such as the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and median absolute percentage error mdape as shown in fig 4 the results found that the data driven et model achieved excellent performance in the training set the r2 reached 0 89 and the rmse and mdape were as low as 0 38 mm day 1 and 25 44 respectively high accuracy was also achieved in the valid set and test set with an r2 of 0 82 an rmse of 0 49 mm day 1 and a mdape of 31 we further analyzed the performance of the data driven et model in the humid and arid zones in the test dataset see table 1 for the humid and arid conditions of the sites as shown in fig 5 the r2 was 0 85 the rmse was 0 55 mm day 1 and the mdape was 28 05 in the humid zones and the r2 was 0 81 the rmse was 0 45 mm day 1 and the mdape was 31 12 in the arid zones overall the data driven et model performed well in both humid and arid zones and its accuracy was slightly higher in the humid zones than in the arid zones finally we used fluxcom data to evaluate the et accuracy of different models in nine watersheds the coupling of the data driven et model with both the xaj and swat models resulted in satisfactory accuracy for et estimates in nine watersheds figs 6 7 the robustness of the three models in estimating et can be ranked from high to low as follows data driven model swat model and xaj model the et results obtained from the etrf xaj model and the etrf swat model exhibited little difference this result is mainly because the two models have different input forms and may exists some errors the average watershed et is directly computed in the etrf xaj model while the et for each hru is first calculated and then the regional et is obtained by area weighted averaging in the etrf swat model the etrf xaj model had obvious advantages over the xaj model for simulating et fig 6 except for the mrw the etrf xaj model of other watersheds performed best in three metrics in the mrw the r2 increased by 0 11 while the rmse and mdape increased by 0 14 mm day 1 and 12 15 respectively fig 6i this result indicated that the model has achieved a better fit to the data but there may be a decrease in the accuracy of the model in estimating the actual values the most apparent modification advantage was in the wrw in which the r2 increased by 0 65 and the rmse and mdape decreased by 1 18 mm day 1 and 50 08 respectively fig 6a the etrf swat model significantly outperformed the swat model except for the wrw fig 7 in the wrw the r2 rmse and mdape of the swat model reached 0 82 0 62 mm day 1 and 34 45 respectively fig 7a the accuracy of the etrf swat model was slightly lower than that of the swat model and tends to overestimate the results however it also achieved good performance with an r2 of 0 73 an rmse of 0 91 mm day 1 and a mdape of 43 90 except for the arw the etrf swat model of the other seven watersheds performed best in three metrics in the arw the r2 increased by 0 13 and the rmse and mdape increased by 0 27 mm day 1 and 14 39 respectively fig 7h the etrf swat model had the greatest advantage in the mrw fig 7i the r2 increased by 0 29 the rmse decreased by 0 17 mm day 1 and the mdape decreased by 3 38 3 2 sensitivity of streamflow to et under different runoff generation mechanisms as shown in fig 8 et was negatively correlated with the streamflow estimates in the xaj model and swat model notably the xaj model compared to the swat model consistently displayed stronger sensitivity to changes in et across all nine watersheds the et increased by 10 in the nine watersheds and the average daily streamflow in the xaj model and swat model decreased by 12 8 and 4 2 respectively the magnitude of sensitivity varied between watersheds with the crw exhibiting the strongest sensitivity and the wrw displaying the weakest in the crw an et decrease of 10 in the xaj model corresponded to a streamflow reduction of 68 32 which was primarily attributed to low flow values in the denominator of the change rate calculation 3 3 accuracy of streamflow estimation three metrics including the r2 nse and rmse were utilized to assess the accuracy of streamflow estimation as shown in fig 9 the four hydrological models achieved satisfactory performance in most cases the etrf xaj model outperformed the other three models during peak flow periods such as on september 10 2014 in the rrw july 4 2015 and january 7 2016 in the irw and march 10 2020 in the mrw during these times the four hydrological models underestimated the peak flow and the etrf xaj model could improve this situation in the calibration period the swat model significantly outperformed the xaj model in the wrw yrw crw trw rrw and mrw while the opposite result was found in the sjrw irw and arw the results in the validation period were consistent with those in the calibration period except for the trw and irw this result indicated that increasing the complexity of hydrological model structures does not necessarily lead to better results in streamflow simulation indeed previous studies have shown that simpler models can perform just as well or better than more complex models and the choice of model structure should depend on the specific application and available data beven and binley 1992 nash and sutcliffe 1970 wagener et al 2003 the etrf xaj model outperformed the xaj model in the nine watersheds fig 10 the most significant improvement occurred in the crw this finding is consistent with the sensitivity analysis which revealed that et had the most substantial impact on streamflow in the crw the r2 and nse of the etrf xaj model were 0 13 and 0 16 greater than those of the xaj model respectively while the rmse was reduced by 8 32 m3 s during the calibration period a more prominent improvement occurred during the validation period the r2 and nse of the etrf xaj model were 0 14 and 0 18 higher than those of the xaj model respectively while the rmse was reduced by 33 25 m3 s this phenomenon implied that the et module in the xaj model had a great impact on streamflow the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies which indicated that the streamflow was insensitive to et in the framework of the swat model we further analyzed the streamflow simulation accuracy of the four models in humid and arid watersheds both the etrf xaj and etrf swat models in streamflow simulation outperformed their corresponding base models xaj and swat in humid and arid watersheds fig 11 furthermore etrf xaj led to a greater improvement in accuracy than the xaj model in humid watersheds the etrf xaj model improved the r2 and nse values by 0 04 and 0 06 respectively and the rmse decreased by 57 57 m3 s compared to the xaj model the etrf swat model had only a decreased rmse of 2 04 m3 s compared to the swat model in arid watersheds the etrf xaj model improved the r2 and nse values by 0 06 and 0 07 respectively and reduced the rmse by 21 39 m3 s compared to the xaj model the etrf swat model exhibited little improvement relative to the swat model with an increase in the r2 and nse values by 0 1 and a decrease in the rmse by 2 67 m3 s furthermore in arid and humid watersheds the etrf xaj model can effectively improve the issue of peak flow underestimation in the xaj model finally we examined the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff generations in different seasons the etrf xaj model performed best among the four models fig 12 the three statistical metrics for the etrf xaj model were better than those for the xaj model while the etrf swat model was the same as the swat model in spring the etrf xaj model had the most significant modification advantage compared to the xaj model the r2 and nse of the etrf xaj model were 0 05 and 0 11 greater than those of the xaj model respectively while the rmse was reduced by 45 37 m3 s the four models had the best applicability in spring and the worst applicability in winter in spring the average changes in the r2 nse and rmse of the four models varied in the ranges of 0 46 0 89 0 32 0 87 and 49 81 m3 s 616 64 m3 s respectively in winter the average changes in the r2 nse and rmse of the four models varied in the ranges of 0 04 0 92 18 83 0 91 and 22 26 m3 s 613 52 m3 s respectively the average nse of the four models was relatively low in winter mainly due to outliers yrw and crw the simulated values of the four models were greatly overestimated in the yrw and crw 4 discussion 4 1 response of streamflow to et under different runoff generation mechanisms hydrological models typically rely on a single runoff generation mechanism liu et al 2020b this study chose two classical models xaj and swat to analyze the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff generation mechanisms the xaj model and the swat model not only differ in the runoff generation mechanisms but also in their model structure concept model vs semi distributed model hydrological models with different structures can achieve the same level of accuracy li et al 2018b shi et al 2011 a more complex model structure does not necessarily result in better runoff simulation gan et al 1997 reported that the performance gap among the different hydrological models was mainly due to differences in the runoff generation mechanisms in this study we tried to unify the input data of the xaj model and swat model as much as possible we used the tyson polygon method to derive regional averages for p data potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the priestley taylor method in the xaj model and swat model the xaj model is a lumped hydrological model while the swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model therefore additional land use data and soil data were employed in the swat model for subbasin delineation previous research has shown that it is not the lumped or semi distributed model structure but rather the runoff mechanisms that affect streamflow estimation franchini and pacciani 1991 gan et al 1997 johnson et al 2003 the data driven et model has obvious advantages over the hydrological models in obtaining et figs 6 and 7 the et accuracy was improved while the performance of streamflow varied differently between models the etrf xaj model improved the streamflow estimation compared to the xaj model while the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies figs 9 12 the sensitivity analysis for all nine watersheds demonstrated that the et in the xaj model had a stronger influence on streamflow estimation than in the swat model fig 8 we further analyzed the effect of et on streamflow under different runoff generation mechanisms from the perspective of runoff yield equations eq 3 indicates that et can directly affect runoff yield in the xaj model the swat model calculated streamflow based on eqs 5 8 the critical parameter of the swat model for runoff generation is cn cn is defined as three antecedent moisture conditions including dry conditions average conditions and wet conditions it is calculated by sswat the swat model applied two different methods for calculating sswat eqs 7 and 8 respectively according to eqs 5 8 the swat model had no direct link between et and streamflow et had an indirect influence on streamflow through soil moisture this study showed that the xaj model that applies the saturation excess runoff mechanism has a genuine capacity for increasing the accuracy of streamflow by better representing et this conclusion holds across different seasons and climatic zones our findings are consistent with those of robles morua et al 2012 who demonstrated that annual and seasonal et rates are correlated with the proportion of runoff mechanisms specifically they found that et increases when saturation excess dominates and decreases when infiltration excess is more significant it partially explained how et affects streamflow under different runoff generation mechanisms this study further showed that et greatly influences streamflow under the saturation excess runoff mechanism these findings can inform the development of hybrid models and contribute to our understanding of the relationship between et and streamflow 4 2 evaluation of hybrid strategies for hydrological models it should be acknowledged that the form of the hybrid hydrological model is flexible because many subprocesses and parameters in hydrological models can affect streamflow estimation typically hybrid models are classified into three types surrogate modelling one way coupling and modular coupling abrahart et al 2012 razavi 2021 this study applied a modular coupling method the method of surrogate modelling and one way coupling is detailed in razavi 2021 compared to the first two methods the advantage of our study fully leverages the physical information in the hydrological model and considers the uncertainty of the model structure modular coupling attempts to add hydrological information to a neural network or uses a neural network as a module submodel of a hydrological model razavi 2021 one method is taking the non standard output of the hydrological model as the input for machine learning another modular coupling method involves taking machine learning as a module sub model of the hydrological model the first method increases the information abundance of input data in the data driven model using physical models humphrey et al 2016 kim et al 2023 okkan et al 2021 ren et al 2018 however the extra information from the output of physical models is highly likely to be biased and thus the first modular coupling method risks introducing incorrect information our study focused on the adverse effect of the simplified et module in the hydrological model and overcame this issue by replacing the classical et module with a data driven submodel in process based hydrological models we integrated the data driven et model into the hydrological models using the second modular coupling method in comparison with the first modular coupling method the physical interpretability of the second modular coupling method is more clear our method retained the backbone of the hydrological model and used machine learning to replace semi empirical formulas in submodules where sufficient observations were available bennett and nijssen 2021 coupled the et module into hydrological models it paid more attention only to evaporation and convective heat transport and did not consider the impact of this sub module on other modules the greatest strength of our study was embedding the data driven et submodel into hydrological models and then enhancing the streamflow which is an overall response depending on the watershed water balance with the easy availability of high quality and more advanced algorithms it provided more opportunities for a data driven model kraft et al 2021 proposed a hybrid form of global hydrological modelling that utilizes terrestrial water storage variations runoff et and snow water equivalent in machine learning to replace complex physical subprocesses loritz et al 2022 that integrated canopy conductance inferred from sap flow data in a hydrological model leads to more realistic soil moisture estimates than using the conventional jarvis stewart equation dong et al 2023 used two data driven reservoir operation schemes to predict reservoir releases and storage in hydrologic models these studies applied more data information to build a hybrid model but this is far from enough more forms of the hybrid model are worth exploring hybrid hydrological models combine physical and data driven models to improve their overall performance in simulating hydrological processes however there are some disadvantages the data driven model requires a large number of training datasets to obtain reliable forecasts this can be a limitation in data sparse regions or for small watersheds where data collection is limited furthermore process based hydrological models may not capture all the complexities of hydrological processes while data driven models may not generalize well outside the calibration range 4 3 uncertainty in hybrid hydrological models to summarize this study offers a form of hybrid hydrological models that replace the et module in classical hydrological models with data driven et and tests the feasibility of the hybrid hydrological model for acquiring better streamflow estimation however the study has some limitations firstly input data elements of the data driven et model are deficient previous studies considered the impact of p and soil moisture on the et process xu et al 2018 hu et al 2021 there was no good quality et observations when p occurred because the signals of h2o and co2 of the eddy covariance system are typically contaminated by p in addition the correlation between p and et is mainly on a monthly scale feng et al 2020 while the data driven et model in this study is on a daily timescale therefore it is an acceptance to ignore the p in this study the soil moisture is available at the flux sites however it is challenging to consider the effect of soil moisture on the data driven et model in the framework of hydrological models the flux sites do not offer the measurement depth of soil moisture the xaj and swat models separate soil into several layers moreover the xaj model directly calculates the total soil moisture in the whole watershed when training the et model using in situ soil moisture observations and integrating the well trained et model in hydrological models we cannot directly apply soil moisture estimation from hydrological models to calculate et therefore the data driven et model in this study did not include soil moisture in further study we can integrate data from multiple sources such as remote sensing data smos ascat and amsr2 and ground based soil moisture datasets this study applied two typical hydrological models in nine watersheds these watershed areas ranged from 9400 km2 to 103991 km2 for large catchments a semi distributed version of the xaj model may be required the semi distributed xaj model provides advantages over the lumped xaj model in representing the effect of spatially variable inputs and catchment properties hinge et al 2022 however many previous studies have demonstrated the robustness of the lumped xaj model qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 based on the above references we think the lumped xaj model may be suitable for large catchments this study also obtained satisfactory accuracy using the lumped xaj model in the nine watersheds further research can consider the application of a semi distributed xaj model to construct a hybrid hydrological model lastly two typical hydrological models were employed to test the impact of et on streamflow at daily scales in the future more models can be used to comprehensively investigate the effects of et on streamflow under different runoff generation conditions the annual monthly and hourly et model coupled with the hydrological model is important for water management the applicability of the coupling and hybrid models at different time scales can be further explored 5 conclusion this study aimed to improve the accuracy of streamflow estimation by integrating a data driven et submodel into the xaj and swat models with different runoff generation mechanisms a data driven et model was established using the rf method in combination with fifteen north american flux sites from the fluxnet2015 dataset and modis products we used the fluxcom dataset to estimate the accuracy of et for the four hydrological models we further evaluated the streamflow estimation using usgs stream gages in the nine u s watersheds and different seasons the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 we proposed a new form of a hybrid hydrological model by integrating the well trained data driven et into the process based hydrological models and demonstrated that the hybrid hydrological models achieved satisfactory accuracy in evaluating et and streamflow the hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of the model but also confirms the rationality of the internal physical process in the hydrological models 2 the improvement of hybrid models highly relies on different runoff mechanisms the etrf xaj model outperformed the xaj model in streamflow estimation while the etrf swat and swat models had similar accuracies the sensitivity curve method showed that the sensitivity of streamflow to et in xaj was consistently stronger than that in swat in the runoff yield calculation et directly affects the runoff yield in the xaj model whereas et has an indirect influence on streamflow in the swat model 3 when peak flow occurred the etrf xaj model effectively corrected the underestimate of the original xaj model this study provides new insight into hydrological modelling and indicates that hybrid models have great potential for simulating streamflow credit

1891,porous asphalt pa pavements are used as an alternative for non permeable pavements to tackle hydroplaning issues and reduce splash and spray the key aspect of designing a pa pavement is its hydraulic performance this study introduces a novel numerical approach combining the discrete element method dem and computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the hydraulic performance of pa different from the traditional methods of scanning the internal asphalt matrix using x rays this study uses a photogrammetry analysis technique to convert the aggregate structure into a dem dem modelling was then used to create a random aggregate structure with different sizes to simulate the asphalt samples for testing the information about the sample structure was transferred to cfd for the hydraulic performance simulation the effects of the air voids content air voids distribution and sample structure on the vertical and horizontal hydraulic performance were investigated the results showed that the proposed approach is capable of producing virtual test samples resembling the laboratory pa sample structure for hydraulic performance tests it was found that the outlet flow rate was mainly affected by the total air voids content of the sample higher content and evenly distributed air voids over the depth of the pa samples led to better hydraulic conductivity samples created and tested using dem cfd methodology could also effectively predict the flow rate at the outlet and demonstrate the flow movement between connected pores inside the sample structure keywords dem cfd porous asphalt open graded asphalt hydraulic performance virtual simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydroplaning is one of the main issues affecting traffic safety during heavy rain events in recent years rainfall events have been reported to significantly increase in frequency and intensity due to global warming yaduvanshi et al 2021 this requires consideration of improving the design of the pavement surface to adapt to the situation the application of dense graded asphalt or concrete materials is still the most popular approach to pavement design kuang et al 2011 with this type of design rain on the pavement surface runs off the surface from a high elevation to a lower position in the event of heavy rains water could accumulate on the surface creating problems of water spray and lowering the driver vision or increasing skid problems for vehicles agonafir et al 2022 one of the solutions that allows water to percolate inside the pavement wearing course is the application of porous asphalt pavements also known as permeable asphalt pavements pa torres et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 compared to impervious pavements pas have significant benefits in reducing water surface run off thus delaying peak discharge and recharging the ground water level huang et al 2016 tedoldi et al 2016 yong et al 2013 pa pavements are also effective in relieving the urban heat island effect wang et al 2021 additionally the water stored in the pores of the porous structure or soil underneath could function as a heat mitigation island to reduce the heat of the pavement in urban areas lu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 showed that pa pavements are significantly effective in reducing not only the peak run off but also its constitutive factors such as the total flood volume and flooding nodes in a field study by the same authors zhu et al 2019 it was shown as pa pavements could effectively reduce the hysteresis of the flood peak hence resulting in a reduction of surface run off greater than 50 compared to non permeable pavements in addition to experimental studies numerical works simulating the hydraulic performance of pa pavements have also been conducted the numerical simulation aims to overcome the limitations of expensive experimental setups that normally provide small scale results that would hardly be expanded for large scale applications such as for pavement design of pas in various weather conditions chung et al 2014 used the image tomography method to reconstruct the porous structure in 3d by ct imaging and probabilistic methods the model showed similar results between the original and rebuilt models of cfd simulations akand et al 2016 built a 2d pervious concrete model using 2d image analysis and finite element modelling coupled with cfd simulation the difference in permeability values obtained from laboratory experiments and the cfd simulation was less than 8 in another study pieralisi et al 2017 combined the dem and cfd methods to study the influence of the composition and compaction process on the permeability of pervious concrete and the study showed the capability of this method to predict the permeability of virtual porous samples many studies investigated the clogging potential of porous pavements andrés valeri et al 2016 brugin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 investigated the optimization of the anti clogging performance on pervious pavement structures via numerical evaluation the authors proposed a coupling method by using the dem method for porous asphalt modelling and the cfd method for clogging development simulation the study showed that the results obtained from different virtual cfd simulations on clogging development were similar and that the gradation of the aggregates has a significant impact against clogging however the hydraulic performance of permeable asphalt pavements has been reported to be significantly affected by the aggregate gradation and aggregate shape ling et al 2022 therefore the use of spherical balls as used in the work of zhang et al 2021 to simulate the aggregate shape might lead to inaccuracies in the value of hydraulic conductivity manrique sanchez et al 2022 proposed a novel methodology for the random generation of 2d porous microstructures to capture the mechanical response from an actual 3d porous mixture they observed that a realistic microstructure for the aggregate shape angularity and gradation was difficult to achieve and that the proposed methodology was able to mitigate those limitations based on the literature review it is evident that one of the gaps is the application of dem and image analysis to achieve a realistic aggregate structure of porous asphalt pavements to support the cfd simulation note that in the latest research of hu et al 2021 regarding combining dem cfd modelling for pa only spherical balls were used to resemble the aggregate shape and size hence oversimplifying the pa sample structure however significant literature is available that shows how shape size and air voids connection inside the sample significantly affect the hydraulic performance of the mix yu et al 2019 shan et al 2022 thus further research on modelling the hydraulic performance of pas using realistic aggregate shapes is necessary the novelty of this study relies on the development of a novel numerical approach combining the discrete element method dem and computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the hydraulic performance of pa different from the traditional methods of scanning aggregate structure using x rays sidiq et al 2019 sidiq et al 2020 this study uses an original photogrammetry analysis technique to convert the real natural aggregate shapes into thedem with this novel approach the dem method was then used to create an aggregate structure with different particle sizes to replicate exactly the particle size distribution of asphalt samples given the importance that the shape of the aggregate has on the internal voids structure and therefore on the hydraulic performance it is believed that this original approach has potential to better predict the hydraulic behaviour of permeable pavements the information of the sample structure was transferred to cfd for hydraulic performance modelling the study conducted numerical tests based on a 2 d model the effect of the air voids content air voids distribution and sample internal structure on the vertical and horizontal hydraulic performance was investigated the findings and conclusions obtained from this study could contribute to laying the basis for further future developments using 3d analysis of pa pavement modelling additionally virtual large scale simulations using a semi automatic method for generating the pavement structure based on the available library of aggregate structures previously captured from real aggregates using photogrammetry can be evaluated a flowchart of this study s activities is summarized in fig 1 2 porous asphalt sample preparation 2 1 laboratory sample preparation the open graded asphalt oga mix used in this study was designed following the guidelines of the victorian department of transport australia section 417 open graded asphalt 2018 the virgin aggregate was supplied in various fractions from a quarry of a local asphalt contractor in victoria australia hydrated lime was used at 1 of the aggregate mass as filler a polymer modified binder pmb was used for the oga mix the basic properties of the binder are shown in table 1 the aggregate gradation of the mix is presented in fig 2 the binder content of the mix was chosen at 6 5 of the total mix mass the oga mix was mixed at 160 c and compacted at the same temperature after conditioningthe loose mix in the oven forone hour the cylinder samples were compacted to achieve the air voids target of 18 1 the compacted samples were cut into slices for further image analysis to build the virtual 2d samples used for numerical modelling of the hydraulic performance 2 2 virtual sample reconstruction from laboratory samples the cut slices from the compacted samples have dimensions of 5 cm in height and approximately 13 cm in length fig 3 a and b the slices were photographed to build a slice image fig 3c to enhance the clarity of the image quality and save computational time it was decided to trim 2d samples to dimensions of 5 cm in height and 4 cm in length and use them as the final image for modelling next the image was processed and transformed to black and white colors fig 3d this step aims to highlight the skeleton boundaries of the aggregates inside in the sample allowing a distinction between the aggregates and bituminous mastic bitumen and filler in the sample in fig 3d the white colour present for aggregates and black colour presents binder and voids in the final step black and white images in pixel format were converted to scalable vector graphics svg format to generate the vector graphic shape vgs aiming to create links between all vertices and form the boundary of the aggregates inside the sample fig 3e this vgs format allows the reconstruction of the sample when imported into ansys fluent software for cfd simulation note that a few features at different levels or covered by bitumen might not be recognized properly by image processing methodology based on the morphology and structure of aggregates as shown in fig 3c and d due to the variety of colours from the background aggregate particles with smaller sizes covered by bitumen were hard to detect by analysing the colour of pixels moreover aggregates lower than the cutting plane were still detected and reconstructed by the image processing algorithm 2 3 virtual sample reconstruction from single aggregate imaging and dem in parallel to the 2d image analysis as an input for cfd simulation virtual 2d samples were also constructed for cfd simulation by using a novel imaging technique this was aimed at comparing the hydraulic performance of the virtual samples and the lab samples to build the virtual 2d images several steps were conducted including taking and processing the aggregate morphology step 1 building the virtual 3d sample with the real aggregate gradation information step 2 and creating a 2d sample for cfd simulation from the virtual 3d sample step 3 in step 1 natural aggregates ranging from three sieve size groups of 4 75 mm to 6 7 mm 6 7 mm to 9 5 mm and 9 5 mm to 13 2 mm were used for each group 13 aggregate particles were obtained to create virtual aggregates because the aggregate morphology was captured using a mobile phone camera videos of aggregates smaller than 4 75 mm were not taken instead it was assumed that these aggregates share a similar structure with the larger aggregate but at a smaller size depending on their sieve size analysis i e a smaller scale of an aggregate larger than 4 75 mm to further save on computational time aggregates smaller than 1 18 mm were not accounted for in the model note that open graded asphalt mixes only include a negligible amount of fine material the details of the gradation and volumetric fraction for the 3d virtual image creation are shown in table 2 to reconstruct the aggregate skeleton in 3 d the aggregate was placed in front of the smartphone camera for video recording at 4 k resolution and 60 frames per second fig 4 a the aggregate was hung in the air by a transparent string that was linked to a low power engine allowing a rotational speed of 5 revolutions per minute which is slow enough for the camera to fully capture the surfaces and edges of the aggregate fig 4b next the recorded videos of the rotating aggregate were imported into photogrammetry software named 3df zephyr for analysis the software allows users to extract the images of the aggregate at different angles as illustrated in fig 4c up to 50 images of the aggregate at different angles were taken out from the video file for loose point cloud generation in this stage the original pixels from the images were pinned in the air to sketch the rough skeleton of the analysed aggregate without linking all points after re editing the initial point cloud most of the irrelevant pixels from the background of the image were deleted to improve the stability of the dense point cloud dpc generation the generation of dpc can rebuild the structure of the aggregate which was filmed by the camera and all faces of the aggregate at different angles were shown by dpc in the last photogrammetry process a technique known as texture meshing chen et al 2019 was applied to link all floating points for the composition of vertices edges and faces with the 3 d coordinates of x y and z as a complete 3d model fig 4d in step 2 dem software named pfc itasca consulting group 2014 was employed to build the virtual 3d sample with the real aggregate gradation information from the particle size distribution of the aggregates note that a dem model consists of bodies aggregate particles and mechanical contacts because the bodies are the main subject of focus in this study and no mechanical performance was assessed the employment of a simple linear contact model is reasonable for the creation of virtual samples the procedure for making a3d virtual sample is illustrated in fig 5 first pebbles were generated to fill up the photogrammetry made aggregate skeleton to improve the model accuracy i e gaps between the surface of the skeleton and the surface of the pebble while considering computational power limits different settings for pebble size and placement were tested as shown in fig 5a known as step 2 1 a template of clump bodies was created to load all scanned aggregate skeletons into the dem for the final 3d pa model reconstruction by repeating the procedure in step 2 1 fig 5b after the aggregates were generated they were compacted in a virtual space controlled by a wall on the top of the sample resulting in 3d virtual samples as illustrated in fig 5c note that during compaction a function of the air voids was coded to assure that the top wall compaction wall stopped when the air voids inside the sample reached 35 to keep the voids content of all samples similar within 1 tolerance 2d slices taken from the dem sample with 35 void content were adjusted by removing small sized aggregates the chosen air voids content for the 3d dem samples allowed the final cut sample in 2d to retain a similar air voids content to the laboratory image processed samples of 50 note that the higher air voids content in the 3d dem sample compared to the lab compacted samples 18 1 air voids is a result of the simplification in the 3d model i e exclusion of smaller aggregate particles in the 3d dem and the exclusion of the bituminous mastic in the laboratory processed images see fig 3 in step 3 the compacted sample was cut into multiple 2d slices fig 6 a and b the images of these 2d slices were again captured and converted to svg format using a similar technique to the one shown in the previous sections to create virtual samples from laboratory images by fixing embedded intersection issues 2d modelling for the slice section of the virtual pa sample was established fig 6c and imported into ansys for cfd simulation 3 cfd simulation this study used cfd techniques to simulate the hydraulic behavior inside pa samples by solving the navier stokes equations numerically the commercial software ansys fluent was used for cfd simulations based on the finite volume method ansys fluent 2009 neill and hashemi 2018 this method divides a volume into a set of smaller volumes which are presented by spatial differential equations the fluid governing equations are transformed into algebraic equations and solved numerically the simulations were run using a desktop computer with an i9 12900 k processor 4 90 ghz frequency and 64 gb of ram using 16 cores in parallel first the virtual pa samples prepared as described in section 2 were imported directly into the ansys fluent system in the cfd simulations the aggregates were assigned as rigid walls the fluid volumes were assigned only for the voids between the aggregates due to the complication of the void structures and the aggregate surface an all triangles methods atm of mesh was applied in which all mesh elements are shaped into triangles the mesh sizes were chosen from 0 0001 to 0 0002 m fig 7 the selection of the mesh types and sizes was made after various attempts to balance between the accuracy and computational time of the simulation to balance the computational time computing power limit and reliability of the simulation the coupled method was applied as the solver for pressure velocity coupling compared with other options for cfd simulation in ansys fluent the coupled method offers a more robust and efficient implementation for steady state flows in a single phase ansys fluent 2009 the single phase simulation has been reported to be able to optimize the design parameters such as different porous structures and operating conditions with less numerically expensive and computational cost dastane et al 2019 two equation model for turbulent flow were applied in this study due to the complicated porous microstructure the water flow between voids could be better represented by two equation model than by the laminar flow using one equation model the turbulence model with two equations also provided the stability and reliability of the simulation ansys fluent 2009 thus it was chosen in this study considering the stability and reliability of the cfd simulation the shear stress transport sst k ω model was used as the physical model this model is suitable for complex porous microstructures as the model takes fewer iterations for a single timestep calculation compared to the other available models in ansys fluent ansys fluent 12 0 theory guide 2009 menter 2009 this feature significantly saves computational time for simulations such as the ones in this study in which a fine mesh was needed to capture the complex microstructure of the voids and provide stability as well as convergence of the simulation at the same time to investigate how outlet velocity changes when water flows through pa samples by calculating reynold s number of virtual water flows eq 1 two equation models for turbulent flow were applied in this simulation considering the stability and reliability of the cfd simulation the shear stress transport sst k ω model was used as the solver 1 re ρ u l μ where re is reynold s number ρ is the density of the fluid u is the flow speed l is the characteristic linear dimension and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid the following transport equations were used for the shear stress transport sst k ω model 2 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k 3 t ρ ω x i ρ ω u i x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω s ω the turbulence kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω are obtained from eqs 2 and 3 where u i is the velocity component and g k is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradients g ω is the generation of ω γ k is the effective diffusivity of k γ ω is the effective diffusivity of ω y k and y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term and s k and s ω are the user defined source terms which were used as default in this case the sst k ω model is similar but developed to effectively blend the robust and accurate formulation of the k ω model in the near wall region with the free stream independence of the k model in the far field menter 2009 the k model is converted by a k formulation to achieve this performance compared with the standard k ω model for a wider class of flows the sst k ω model is more accurate and reliable considering the case complexity the continuity for the sst k ω model is more stable and the divergence is under control during the simulation it takes fewer iterations for each timestep to reach the minimum stability criteria which effectively saves the actual time cost on virtual cfd simulation which is why the sst k ω model was used in this study further model equations can be found in the appendix including the constants used in the equations table a1 two separate cfd models were built for water flow simulation in the vertical and horizontal directions aiming to investigate the behaviour of water flowing inside the pa sample and the hydraulic conductivity under different boundary conditions fig 8 for the vertical flow direction the top boundary was chosen as the inlet and the boundaries on the left and right sides of the samples were considered as walls the bottom boundary of the sample includes the outlet for the horizontal flow direction the top boundary remained the inlet and the boundaries on the left and right were considered outlets the bottom boundary was changed to a solid wall that is not permeable simulating the situation of pa laid on top of an impermeable pavement course this study used a velocity type of inlet with a water speed of 0 1 m s to simulate the flow behaviour under actual conditions an atmospheric pressure of 101 325 kpa and gravity of 9 8 m s2 were applied during the simulation for the fluid setup water was selected as the liquid type flowing through the designed field the water density was 998 2 kg m3 based on the assumption that the test was conducted at 20 c the constant viscosity of water was 0 001003 kg s 1 m this study used a single phase simulation meaning that the sample was fully saturated before the simulation which represents the typical constant head permeability test for hydraulic performance investigation of porous materials such as porous concrete martins filho et al 2022 neithalath et al 2006 and porous asphalt aboufoul et al 2019 hall 2004 finally an adaptive timestep method was used which resulted in timestep sizes ranging from 0 0011 to 0 0035 s for the simulations due to the difference in the tested sample 4 results and discussion 4 1 internal structure of the samples samples for cfd simulations prepared from the laboratory samples lpa and dem simulation dpa are shown in fig 9 visually the dem constructed sample looks similar to the laboratory samples in terms of the aggregate distribution and gradation with only a few differences related to the size of the small particles and aggregate edges note that the dpa samples only considered aggregates larger than 1 18 mm due to the high computational time of dem simulation for this reason particles smaller than 1 18 mm are only seen in the case of the lpa samples furthermore the laboratory sample shows aggregates with rougher edges than the dpa samples due to the resolution of the dem simulation when balancing the resolution of aggregate reconstruction and the computational time the lpa samples had an air voids content of 52 8 51 6 and 52 1 with an average value of 52 the dpa samples had air void contents of 50 4 50 2 and 50 7 with an average value of 51 in the range of 1 air voids compared to the lpa samples which is the typical tolerance for pa samples because of the anisotropy characteristic of the porous microstructure the results showed similarity in terms of the total air voids for the lpa and dpa samples which validates the sample preparation step of lpa and dpa for further investigation next examination of the air voids distribution was conducted by plotting the air voids of each 2 5 mm depth from the top to the bottom of the samples the results are depicted in figs 10 and 11 the lpa samples showed slightly more consistency in air voids distribution than the dpa samples especially from 5 to 15 mm of the sample s depth while the dpa samples showed more consistency in the air voids distribution at the bottom of the samples e g 45 mm to 50 mm depth in addition the air void distributions of the lpa and dpa samples overlapped or were similar it was also observed that due to the uneven surface at the top and bottom of the pa sample in both the lpa and dpa cases the air voids in all samples at depths from 0 to 2 5 mm were generally higher than those in the inner part of the samples a similar phenomenon was found at the bottom of the sample for both lpa and dpa in summary the dpa samples have similar air voids and air voids distribution to the lpa samples with only minor differences because of the randomness of the sample creation manufacturing in both lpa and dpa samples and the balancing strategy between accuracy and computational time for the dem simulation note that the high air void of the 2d lpa samples is due to the limitation of image analysis in which the information of binder and small particles is missing in the lpa samples but included in the air void content this occurred because the binder and small particles covered by the binder have similar colors and are counted as one group in the black and white imaging process see section 2 2 due to those limitations the 2d reconstruction for porous structures might lose some accuracy which leads to a much higher void content when cutting to an individual slice on the other hand producing dem samples with different air voids can be flexible and easily achieved thanks to the ability of the method to reproduce the pa samples or any asphalt concrete sample in general with the given gradation and the air void target of the sample in this study the 3d dpa samples from the compacted 35 porosity 3d pa cube were adjusted to their compacted air voids to achieve air voids similar to those of the lpa samples reconstructed two dimensionally in the next step of the study cfd simulation was conducted to investigate and compare the hydraulic performance of the lpa and dpa samples 4 2 hydraulic performance the hydraulic performance of the lpa and dpa samples was evaluated based on the discharge flow rate over time m s the flow rate was captured for both vertical and horizontal boundary conditions figs 12 and 13 show the results of the outlet flow rate over time while fig 14 shows the flow velocity inside the samples under vertical boundary conditions the flow rate of the dpa samples at the outlet tended to reach a stable flow rate quicker than that of the lpa samples fig 12a compared with the lpa samples the shape of the aggregate from the dpa samples is smoother and the average particle size is larger than that of the lpa samples because of the exclusion of particles smaller than 1 18 mm which produced less tortuosity on the water flow path between air voids due to the smooth geometric surface dpa samples more easily reach the steady flow condition than lpa samples after 0 1 s the outlet flow rate for the samples regardless of lpa or dpa reached a stable stage except in the case of the lpa1 and dpa1 samples in which the flow rate fluctuated during the whole simulation due to the unsteady turbulent flow and dynamic pressure inside the sample overall the average flow rate of dpa samples was merely 3 lower than that of lpa samples but not significantly different based on the t test analysis with a significance level of 0 05 based on past literature it was found that the results from virtual cfd simulations might not 100 match those from laboratory tests the research done by chung et al 2014 shows an approach to reconstructing the 3d model using a ct scanner and finite element method fem for flow motion simulation and hydraulic conductivity calculation the results show that the permeability from the simulation is 8 9 to 14 75 lower than that from laboratory experiments alshareedah and nassiri 2021 also conclude that the prediction from the dem cfd has 20 fewer errors than the experimental results in terms of horizontal hydraulic performance the lpa samples tend to reach a stable flow rate faster than the dpa samples at approximately 0 03 s fig 12b however the dpa samples had a significantly higher flow rate than the lpa samples the average velocity of the lpa samples ranged from 0 11 to 0 16 m s while the value from the dpa samples ranged from 0 15 to 0 25 m s on average the outlet velocity of dpa samples was approximately 59 higher than that of the lpa samples based on three replicates fig 13b the dpa samples showed a higher velocity of flow at the lower part of the sample than the lpa samples this result is related to the particle arrangement and the air voids connectivity inside the sample structure in addition a smoother aggregate surface and fewer small particles e g 1 18 mm of the dpa samples also contributed to the higher flow rate results due to less tortuosity of the water flow path between air voids the air voids distribution was also seen to affect the flow rate the dpa samples had a higher air voids content near the top of the samples from 5 mm to 15 mm allowing water to move fast horizontally or at higher water velocity fig 14c this also resulted in a higher flow rate of dpa samples compared to the lpa samples the steps needed to capture the aggregate skeleton using photogrammetry 2d modelling using image morphology and 2d simulation using the cfd method can all be affected by the computing power available the effect is mainly driven by two factors or steps capturing the reconstruction of the aggregate skeleton virtually and modelling it by using image morphology for 2d reconstruction the boundaries of individual aggregates were identified by detecting pixels and through the generation of a dense points cloud using photogrammetry this approach might lose some accuracy during the skeleton generation phase and the smoothness level for the finalized geometry of a single aggregate might need to be reduced to match the current computing power as shown in fig 15 a the original 3d skeleton reconstructed via photogrammetry had over 9 000 faces for a single aggregate to minimize the computing power requirements needed for the reconstruction of the entire asphalt specimen simplifications and smoothing techniques were used for the aggregate skeleton for each virtual aggregate the geometry was simplified by 98 6 of the original number of elements this explains why the edges of the slices made by the dem method were smoother than those of the laboratory prepared slices it was reported in the literature that the image processing technique or image processing step is not enough to capture pores morphological and internal structural characteristics of porous media but an algorithm with a more detailed element design that can robustly model the feature extraction would be required isa et al 2022 similarly in this research the use of image morphology technology for 2d model reconstruction of porous asphalt slices might lose accuracy compared to the real specimen as fig 3 shows all pixels detected and used for the boundary reconstruction by the program were assumed to be at the same depth level and from the same plane however some pixels belonged to deeper layers hence possibly leading to an inaccurate model reconstruction finally there are some unavoidable spatial limitations for 2d simulation when using the cfd method bakshi et al 2018 pointed out that compared with 2d cfd simulation important qualitative and quantitative trends such as bubble size distribution pattern formation in bubbles and the superficial rate of gas flow can be captured without changing any parameters for the individual cases the final result captured from the 2d simulation might be inaccurate due to the missing movement of flow in the z direction i e depth cfd simulation with the 2d pa model could not properly demonstrate the updating change in flow rate when water flows in connected pores 4 3 effect of water flow inlet intensity on hydraulic performance the low impact development lid performance has been widely used for the storm water management model swmm to reduce the flow conveyed to the traditional networks madrazo uribeetxebarria et al 2021 this study applied a second water flow rate of 0 2 m s velocity at the inlet to test all lpa and dpa samples in the vertical direction then the results were compared with the flow rate of 0 1 m s to determine the lid performance of the virtual asphalt 2d sample slices as shown in fig 16 all lpa and dpa samples were tested at 0 2 m s inlet velocity up to 0 15 s following a similar trend to what already identified at section 4 2 the flow for all lpa and dpa samples begins from the initial inlet velocity value and consequently fluctuates due to the internal voids structure lpa2 reaches the highest peak flow velocity among the lpa samples at 0 015 s then the flow stabilizes at around 0 25 m s lpa1 and lpa3 show similar behaviour to lpa3 after reaching the peak the flow becomes stable after approximately 0 06 s on the other hand dpa samples behave differently when the inlet velocity is doubled from 0 1 m s to 0 2 m s in dpa samples dpa3 has the highest flow velocity following a different trend from dpa1 and dpa2 the flow for dpa3 seems to fluctuate during the simulation dpa1 and dpa2 show similar trends to the one observed for lap samples where a peak value is followed by a steadier flow lid performance is a complex phenomenon determined by the rainfall intensity and tested porous structure which might not be mimicked properly using a single phase cfd model moraveji and ardehali 2013 mentioned that a two phase model better approximates the experimental data than a single phase model for cfd simulation compared to multiphase water air flow simulations analysing velocity of the water at the outlet passing through a 2d pa sample using single phase flow can be difficult to observe since water is the only material in the fluid domain as shown in fig 12 the water reaches the domain outlet once the simulation starts without any flow motion so the initial reading at the outlet does not start from 0 m s moreover due to the single phase model the interactions between different phases such as water and air cannot be simulated to resemble the testing environment of the laboratory the dark blue sections in fig 14 are voids that are initially full of stationary water because of the single phase model water in those voids does not participate in any motion including turbulences which might affect the final hydraulic readings at the outlet 4 4 limitations of 2d modelling 2d modelling using image morphology might be limited to achieve an accurate void structure to investigate this three samples slices were taken from a 3d dem sample compacted with 18 air voids as shown in fig 17 the samples have dimensions of 4 cm in width and 5 cm in height after being reconstructed using the image morphology algorithm the closest void content of the samples was 23 7 approximately 5 7 different from the target air voids content of 18 timoumi et al 2023 illustrated that there are several critical points and limitations using morpho granulometric techniques the complexity of diameter definitions such as volume surface and perimeter might be hidden by using an image processing algorithm and insufficient to reconstruct the morphological complexity the skeleton of the aggregate could not be properly defined and reconstructed due to the high complexity of the image by timoumi et al 2023 leading to a difference in the air voids of granular compacted samples similarly as seen in fig 16 although the slices were cut from the same 3d sample with 18 air voids the final void content after reconstruction ranged from 23 7 to 26 8 one can notice that a large number of lines and points with very tiny spacing could not be accurately identified by image processing this explains why it is difficult to maintain high accuracy of model reconstruction to achieve the right porosity close to the original 3d model similarly the voids reconstruction for all lpa and dpa samples used in this study was affected first due to the difference in background colour the aggregates covered by bitumen become hard to scan and capture properly which might lose the 2d modelling accuracy after reconstruction small size aggregates were hard to detect and capture especially for lpa samples there are over 10 of aggregates with smaller size than 2 36 mm detection of these aggregates is limited by the limited number of pixels additionally the 2d model created using image processing methodology is a reconstruction process based on the quality of the image and pixels and how accurately the shape of the aggregates can be described at the end of all the phases of model reconstruction the slices taken from the 18 laboratory made pa sample achieved approximately 50 air voids content to match that situation slices taken from the 3d dem made sample had to be simplified by deleting some small sized aggregates to maintain the whole porous structure at approximately 50 voids content because of the colour of bitumen tiny sized aggregates cannot be detected which is why after image processing of laboratory slices the actual air voids content after reconstruction reaches 50 5 conclusion this study proposes an original approach to conducting simulations on the hydraulic behaviour of porous asphalt pavement traditionally the virtual samples are reconstructed by using the x ray scanning technique to capture the internal structure of the laboratory prepared sample before conducting the cfd simulation differently this study proposes a novel approach to capture the aggregate morphology and use that information to reconstruct the virtual samples using a dem simulation before using the dem reconstructed samples for conducting the cfd simulation based on the results the following conclusions are drawn using a camera from a smartphone to capture the image morphology for a single aggregate skeleton for dem reconstruction is more timesaving and more equipment accessible the resolution of images taken by a smartphone was found to be sufficient to be used for further analysis with high reliability for virtual modelling in pa samples for building a database image morphology technology takes less time to deal with a large number of aggregates and each reconstructed model can be re edited to manually control the quality while matching the computing power limit using the dem method for reconstructing virtual pa in 2d with similar air voids to laboratory produced samples is feasible dem produced samples can be constructed with similar aggregate size aggregate gradation and sample skeleton structure to the laboratory produced samples due to the high porosity of all pa samples the vertical hydraulic performance of the pa samples was not sensitive to the change in the air voids distribution along the depth of the sample aggregate shape aggregate surface properties and aggregate skeleton structure as long as the total air voids were similar which resulted in less than 3 difference in average vertical hydraulic conductivity among lpa and dpa samples on the other hand the horizontal hydraulic performance of the pa samples was significantly affected by the air void distribution air void connectivity and aggregate surface smoothness overall the results from this study show promise for conducting hydraulic performance using the proposed approach however hydraulic performance using 2d simulation is limited to high air void samples due to the nonpermeable of 2d samples at lower air voids e g 18 thus further study using the proposed approach in this study is recommended to extend the work to 3d simulations to analyse the different scenarios of the hydraulic performance of porous asphalt concrete more realistically further the outcomes from the 3d hydraulic simulation will need to be compared with the hydraulic performance of laboratory prepared samples

1891,porous asphalt pa pavements are used as an alternative for non permeable pavements to tackle hydroplaning issues and reduce splash and spray the key aspect of designing a pa pavement is its hydraulic performance this study introduces a novel numerical approach combining the discrete element method dem and computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the hydraulic performance of pa different from the traditional methods of scanning the internal asphalt matrix using x rays this study uses a photogrammetry analysis technique to convert the aggregate structure into a dem dem modelling was then used to create a random aggregate structure with different sizes to simulate the asphalt samples for testing the information about the sample structure was transferred to cfd for the hydraulic performance simulation the effects of the air voids content air voids distribution and sample structure on the vertical and horizontal hydraulic performance were investigated the results showed that the proposed approach is capable of producing virtual test samples resembling the laboratory pa sample structure for hydraulic performance tests it was found that the outlet flow rate was mainly affected by the total air voids content of the sample higher content and evenly distributed air voids over the depth of the pa samples led to better hydraulic conductivity samples created and tested using dem cfd methodology could also effectively predict the flow rate at the outlet and demonstrate the flow movement between connected pores inside the sample structure keywords dem cfd porous asphalt open graded asphalt hydraulic performance virtual simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydroplaning is one of the main issues affecting traffic safety during heavy rain events in recent years rainfall events have been reported to significantly increase in frequency and intensity due to global warming yaduvanshi et al 2021 this requires consideration of improving the design of the pavement surface to adapt to the situation the application of dense graded asphalt or concrete materials is still the most popular approach to pavement design kuang et al 2011 with this type of design rain on the pavement surface runs off the surface from a high elevation to a lower position in the event of heavy rains water could accumulate on the surface creating problems of water spray and lowering the driver vision or increasing skid problems for vehicles agonafir et al 2022 one of the solutions that allows water to percolate inside the pavement wearing course is the application of porous asphalt pavements also known as permeable asphalt pavements pa torres et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 compared to impervious pavements pas have significant benefits in reducing water surface run off thus delaying peak discharge and recharging the ground water level huang et al 2016 tedoldi et al 2016 yong et al 2013 pa pavements are also effective in relieving the urban heat island effect wang et al 2021 additionally the water stored in the pores of the porous structure or soil underneath could function as a heat mitigation island to reduce the heat of the pavement in urban areas lu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 showed that pa pavements are significantly effective in reducing not only the peak run off but also its constitutive factors such as the total flood volume and flooding nodes in a field study by the same authors zhu et al 2019 it was shown as pa pavements could effectively reduce the hysteresis of the flood peak hence resulting in a reduction of surface run off greater than 50 compared to non permeable pavements in addition to experimental studies numerical works simulating the hydraulic performance of pa pavements have also been conducted the numerical simulation aims to overcome the limitations of expensive experimental setups that normally provide small scale results that would hardly be expanded for large scale applications such as for pavement design of pas in various weather conditions chung et al 2014 used the image tomography method to reconstruct the porous structure in 3d by ct imaging and probabilistic methods the model showed similar results between the original and rebuilt models of cfd simulations akand et al 2016 built a 2d pervious concrete model using 2d image analysis and finite element modelling coupled with cfd simulation the difference in permeability values obtained from laboratory experiments and the cfd simulation was less than 8 in another study pieralisi et al 2017 combined the dem and cfd methods to study the influence of the composition and compaction process on the permeability of pervious concrete and the study showed the capability of this method to predict the permeability of virtual porous samples many studies investigated the clogging potential of porous pavements andrés valeri et al 2016 brugin et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 investigated the optimization of the anti clogging performance on pervious pavement structures via numerical evaluation the authors proposed a coupling method by using the dem method for porous asphalt modelling and the cfd method for clogging development simulation the study showed that the results obtained from different virtual cfd simulations on clogging development were similar and that the gradation of the aggregates has a significant impact against clogging however the hydraulic performance of permeable asphalt pavements has been reported to be significantly affected by the aggregate gradation and aggregate shape ling et al 2022 therefore the use of spherical balls as used in the work of zhang et al 2021 to simulate the aggregate shape might lead to inaccuracies in the value of hydraulic conductivity manrique sanchez et al 2022 proposed a novel methodology for the random generation of 2d porous microstructures to capture the mechanical response from an actual 3d porous mixture they observed that a realistic microstructure for the aggregate shape angularity and gradation was difficult to achieve and that the proposed methodology was able to mitigate those limitations based on the literature review it is evident that one of the gaps is the application of dem and image analysis to achieve a realistic aggregate structure of porous asphalt pavements to support the cfd simulation note that in the latest research of hu et al 2021 regarding combining dem cfd modelling for pa only spherical balls were used to resemble the aggregate shape and size hence oversimplifying the pa sample structure however significant literature is available that shows how shape size and air voids connection inside the sample significantly affect the hydraulic performance of the mix yu et al 2019 shan et al 2022 thus further research on modelling the hydraulic performance of pas using realistic aggregate shapes is necessary the novelty of this study relies on the development of a novel numerical approach combining the discrete element method dem and computational fluid dynamics cfd to model the hydraulic performance of pa different from the traditional methods of scanning aggregate structure using x rays sidiq et al 2019 sidiq et al 2020 this study uses an original photogrammetry analysis technique to convert the real natural aggregate shapes into thedem with this novel approach the dem method was then used to create an aggregate structure with different particle sizes to replicate exactly the particle size distribution of asphalt samples given the importance that the shape of the aggregate has on the internal voids structure and therefore on the hydraulic performance it is believed that this original approach has potential to better predict the hydraulic behaviour of permeable pavements the information of the sample structure was transferred to cfd for hydraulic performance modelling the study conducted numerical tests based on a 2 d model the effect of the air voids content air voids distribution and sample internal structure on the vertical and horizontal hydraulic performance was investigated the findings and conclusions obtained from this study could contribute to laying the basis for further future developments using 3d analysis of pa pavement modelling additionally virtual large scale simulations using a semi automatic method for generating the pavement structure based on the available library of aggregate structures previously captured from real aggregates using photogrammetry can be evaluated a flowchart of this study s activities is summarized in fig 1 2 porous asphalt sample preparation 2 1 laboratory sample preparation the open graded asphalt oga mix used in this study was designed following the guidelines of the victorian department of transport australia section 417 open graded asphalt 2018 the virgin aggregate was supplied in various fractions from a quarry of a local asphalt contractor in victoria australia hydrated lime was used at 1 of the aggregate mass as filler a polymer modified binder pmb was used for the oga mix the basic properties of the binder are shown in table 1 the aggregate gradation of the mix is presented in fig 2 the binder content of the mix was chosen at 6 5 of the total mix mass the oga mix was mixed at 160 c and compacted at the same temperature after conditioningthe loose mix in the oven forone hour the cylinder samples were compacted to achieve the air voids target of 18 1 the compacted samples were cut into slices for further image analysis to build the virtual 2d samples used for numerical modelling of the hydraulic performance 2 2 virtual sample reconstruction from laboratory samples the cut slices from the compacted samples have dimensions of 5 cm in height and approximately 13 cm in length fig 3 a and b the slices were photographed to build a slice image fig 3c to enhance the clarity of the image quality and save computational time it was decided to trim 2d samples to dimensions of 5 cm in height and 4 cm in length and use them as the final image for modelling next the image was processed and transformed to black and white colors fig 3d this step aims to highlight the skeleton boundaries of the aggregates inside in the sample allowing a distinction between the aggregates and bituminous mastic bitumen and filler in the sample in fig 3d the white colour present for aggregates and black colour presents binder and voids in the final step black and white images in pixel format were converted to scalable vector graphics svg format to generate the vector graphic shape vgs aiming to create links between all vertices and form the boundary of the aggregates inside the sample fig 3e this vgs format allows the reconstruction of the sample when imported into ansys fluent software for cfd simulation note that a few features at different levels or covered by bitumen might not be recognized properly by image processing methodology based on the morphology and structure of aggregates as shown in fig 3c and d due to the variety of colours from the background aggregate particles with smaller sizes covered by bitumen were hard to detect by analysing the colour of pixels moreover aggregates lower than the cutting plane were still detected and reconstructed by the image processing algorithm 2 3 virtual sample reconstruction from single aggregate imaging and dem in parallel to the 2d image analysis as an input for cfd simulation virtual 2d samples were also constructed for cfd simulation by using a novel imaging technique this was aimed at comparing the hydraulic performance of the virtual samples and the lab samples to build the virtual 2d images several steps were conducted including taking and processing the aggregate morphology step 1 building the virtual 3d sample with the real aggregate gradation information step 2 and creating a 2d sample for cfd simulation from the virtual 3d sample step 3 in step 1 natural aggregates ranging from three sieve size groups of 4 75 mm to 6 7 mm 6 7 mm to 9 5 mm and 9 5 mm to 13 2 mm were used for each group 13 aggregate particles were obtained to create virtual aggregates because the aggregate morphology was captured using a mobile phone camera videos of aggregates smaller than 4 75 mm were not taken instead it was assumed that these aggregates share a similar structure with the larger aggregate but at a smaller size depending on their sieve size analysis i e a smaller scale of an aggregate larger than 4 75 mm to further save on computational time aggregates smaller than 1 18 mm were not accounted for in the model note that open graded asphalt mixes only include a negligible amount of fine material the details of the gradation and volumetric fraction for the 3d virtual image creation are shown in table 2 to reconstruct the aggregate skeleton in 3 d the aggregate was placed in front of the smartphone camera for video recording at 4 k resolution and 60 frames per second fig 4 a the aggregate was hung in the air by a transparent string that was linked to a low power engine allowing a rotational speed of 5 revolutions per minute which is slow enough for the camera to fully capture the surfaces and edges of the aggregate fig 4b next the recorded videos of the rotating aggregate were imported into photogrammetry software named 3df zephyr for analysis the software allows users to extract the images of the aggregate at different angles as illustrated in fig 4c up to 50 images of the aggregate at different angles were taken out from the video file for loose point cloud generation in this stage the original pixels from the images were pinned in the air to sketch the rough skeleton of the analysed aggregate without linking all points after re editing the initial point cloud most of the irrelevant pixels from the background of the image were deleted to improve the stability of the dense point cloud dpc generation the generation of dpc can rebuild the structure of the aggregate which was filmed by the camera and all faces of the aggregate at different angles were shown by dpc in the last photogrammetry process a technique known as texture meshing chen et al 2019 was applied to link all floating points for the composition of vertices edges and faces with the 3 d coordinates of x y and z as a complete 3d model fig 4d in step 2 dem software named pfc itasca consulting group 2014 was employed to build the virtual 3d sample with the real aggregate gradation information from the particle size distribution of the aggregates note that a dem model consists of bodies aggregate particles and mechanical contacts because the bodies are the main subject of focus in this study and no mechanical performance was assessed the employment of a simple linear contact model is reasonable for the creation of virtual samples the procedure for making a3d virtual sample is illustrated in fig 5 first pebbles were generated to fill up the photogrammetry made aggregate skeleton to improve the model accuracy i e gaps between the surface of the skeleton and the surface of the pebble while considering computational power limits different settings for pebble size and placement were tested as shown in fig 5a known as step 2 1 a template of clump bodies was created to load all scanned aggregate skeletons into the dem for the final 3d pa model reconstruction by repeating the procedure in step 2 1 fig 5b after the aggregates were generated they were compacted in a virtual space controlled by a wall on the top of the sample resulting in 3d virtual samples as illustrated in fig 5c note that during compaction a function of the air voids was coded to assure that the top wall compaction wall stopped when the air voids inside the sample reached 35 to keep the voids content of all samples similar within 1 tolerance 2d slices taken from the dem sample with 35 void content were adjusted by removing small sized aggregates the chosen air voids content for the 3d dem samples allowed the final cut sample in 2d to retain a similar air voids content to the laboratory image processed samples of 50 note that the higher air voids content in the 3d dem sample compared to the lab compacted samples 18 1 air voids is a result of the simplification in the 3d model i e exclusion of smaller aggregate particles in the 3d dem and the exclusion of the bituminous mastic in the laboratory processed images see fig 3 in step 3 the compacted sample was cut into multiple 2d slices fig 6 a and b the images of these 2d slices were again captured and converted to svg format using a similar technique to the one shown in the previous sections to create virtual samples from laboratory images by fixing embedded intersection issues 2d modelling for the slice section of the virtual pa sample was established fig 6c and imported into ansys for cfd simulation 3 cfd simulation this study used cfd techniques to simulate the hydraulic behavior inside pa samples by solving the navier stokes equations numerically the commercial software ansys fluent was used for cfd simulations based on the finite volume method ansys fluent 2009 neill and hashemi 2018 this method divides a volume into a set of smaller volumes which are presented by spatial differential equations the fluid governing equations are transformed into algebraic equations and solved numerically the simulations were run using a desktop computer with an i9 12900 k processor 4 90 ghz frequency and 64 gb of ram using 16 cores in parallel first the virtual pa samples prepared as described in section 2 were imported directly into the ansys fluent system in the cfd simulations the aggregates were assigned as rigid walls the fluid volumes were assigned only for the voids between the aggregates due to the complication of the void structures and the aggregate surface an all triangles methods atm of mesh was applied in which all mesh elements are shaped into triangles the mesh sizes were chosen from 0 0001 to 0 0002 m fig 7 the selection of the mesh types and sizes was made after various attempts to balance between the accuracy and computational time of the simulation to balance the computational time computing power limit and reliability of the simulation the coupled method was applied as the solver for pressure velocity coupling compared with other options for cfd simulation in ansys fluent the coupled method offers a more robust and efficient implementation for steady state flows in a single phase ansys fluent 2009 the single phase simulation has been reported to be able to optimize the design parameters such as different porous structures and operating conditions with less numerically expensive and computational cost dastane et al 2019 two equation model for turbulent flow were applied in this study due to the complicated porous microstructure the water flow between voids could be better represented by two equation model than by the laminar flow using one equation model the turbulence model with two equations also provided the stability and reliability of the simulation ansys fluent 2009 thus it was chosen in this study considering the stability and reliability of the cfd simulation the shear stress transport sst k ω model was used as the physical model this model is suitable for complex porous microstructures as the model takes fewer iterations for a single timestep calculation compared to the other available models in ansys fluent ansys fluent 12 0 theory guide 2009 menter 2009 this feature significantly saves computational time for simulations such as the ones in this study in which a fine mesh was needed to capture the complex microstructure of the voids and provide stability as well as convergence of the simulation at the same time to investigate how outlet velocity changes when water flows through pa samples by calculating reynold s number of virtual water flows eq 1 two equation models for turbulent flow were applied in this simulation considering the stability and reliability of the cfd simulation the shear stress transport sst k ω model was used as the solver 1 re ρ u l μ where re is reynold s number ρ is the density of the fluid u is the flow speed l is the characteristic linear dimension and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid the following transport equations were used for the shear stress transport sst k ω model 2 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k 3 t ρ ω x i ρ ω u i x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω s ω the turbulence kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω are obtained from eqs 2 and 3 where u i is the velocity component and g k is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradients g ω is the generation of ω γ k is the effective diffusivity of k γ ω is the effective diffusivity of ω y k and y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term and s k and s ω are the user defined source terms which were used as default in this case the sst k ω model is similar but developed to effectively blend the robust and accurate formulation of the k ω model in the near wall region with the free stream independence of the k model in the far field menter 2009 the k model is converted by a k formulation to achieve this performance compared with the standard k ω model for a wider class of flows the sst k ω model is more accurate and reliable considering the case complexity the continuity for the sst k ω model is more stable and the divergence is under control during the simulation it takes fewer iterations for each timestep to reach the minimum stability criteria which effectively saves the actual time cost on virtual cfd simulation which is why the sst k ω model was used in this study further model equations can be found in the appendix including the constants used in the equations table a1 two separate cfd models were built for water flow simulation in the vertical and horizontal directions aiming to investigate the behaviour of water flowing inside the pa sample and the hydraulic conductivity under different boundary conditions fig 8 for the vertical flow direction the top boundary was chosen as the inlet and the boundaries on the left and right sides of the samples were considered as walls the bottom boundary of the sample includes the outlet for the horizontal flow direction the top boundary remained the inlet and the boundaries on the left and right were considered outlets the bottom boundary was changed to a solid wall that is not permeable simulating the situation of pa laid on top of an impermeable pavement course this study used a velocity type of inlet with a water speed of 0 1 m s to simulate the flow behaviour under actual conditions an atmospheric pressure of 101 325 kpa and gravity of 9 8 m s2 were applied during the simulation for the fluid setup water was selected as the liquid type flowing through the designed field the water density was 998 2 kg m3 based on the assumption that the test was conducted at 20 c the constant viscosity of water was 0 001003 kg s 1 m this study used a single phase simulation meaning that the sample was fully saturated before the simulation which represents the typical constant head permeability test for hydraulic performance investigation of porous materials such as porous concrete martins filho et al 2022 neithalath et al 2006 and porous asphalt aboufoul et al 2019 hall 2004 finally an adaptive timestep method was used which resulted in timestep sizes ranging from 0 0011 to 0 0035 s for the simulations due to the difference in the tested sample 4 results and discussion 4 1 internal structure of the samples samples for cfd simulations prepared from the laboratory samples lpa and dem simulation dpa are shown in fig 9 visually the dem constructed sample looks similar to the laboratory samples in terms of the aggregate distribution and gradation with only a few differences related to the size of the small particles and aggregate edges note that the dpa samples only considered aggregates larger than 1 18 mm due to the high computational time of dem simulation for this reason particles smaller than 1 18 mm are only seen in the case of the lpa samples furthermore the laboratory sample shows aggregates with rougher edges than the dpa samples due to the resolution of the dem simulation when balancing the resolution of aggregate reconstruction and the computational time the lpa samples had an air voids content of 52 8 51 6 and 52 1 with an average value of 52 the dpa samples had air void contents of 50 4 50 2 and 50 7 with an average value of 51 in the range of 1 air voids compared to the lpa samples which is the typical tolerance for pa samples because of the anisotropy characteristic of the porous microstructure the results showed similarity in terms of the total air voids for the lpa and dpa samples which validates the sample preparation step of lpa and dpa for further investigation next examination of the air voids distribution was conducted by plotting the air voids of each 2 5 mm depth from the top to the bottom of the samples the results are depicted in figs 10 and 11 the lpa samples showed slightly more consistency in air voids distribution than the dpa samples especially from 5 to 15 mm of the sample s depth while the dpa samples showed more consistency in the air voids distribution at the bottom of the samples e g 45 mm to 50 mm depth in addition the air void distributions of the lpa and dpa samples overlapped or were similar it was also observed that due to the uneven surface at the top and bottom of the pa sample in both the lpa and dpa cases the air voids in all samples at depths from 0 to 2 5 mm were generally higher than those in the inner part of the samples a similar phenomenon was found at the bottom of the sample for both lpa and dpa in summary the dpa samples have similar air voids and air voids distribution to the lpa samples with only minor differences because of the randomness of the sample creation manufacturing in both lpa and dpa samples and the balancing strategy between accuracy and computational time for the dem simulation note that the high air void of the 2d lpa samples is due to the limitation of image analysis in which the information of binder and small particles is missing in the lpa samples but included in the air void content this occurred because the binder and small particles covered by the binder have similar colors and are counted as one group in the black and white imaging process see section 2 2 due to those limitations the 2d reconstruction for porous structures might lose some accuracy which leads to a much higher void content when cutting to an individual slice on the other hand producing dem samples with different air voids can be flexible and easily achieved thanks to the ability of the method to reproduce the pa samples or any asphalt concrete sample in general with the given gradation and the air void target of the sample in this study the 3d dpa samples from the compacted 35 porosity 3d pa cube were adjusted to their compacted air voids to achieve air voids similar to those of the lpa samples reconstructed two dimensionally in the next step of the study cfd simulation was conducted to investigate and compare the hydraulic performance of the lpa and dpa samples 4 2 hydraulic performance the hydraulic performance of the lpa and dpa samples was evaluated based on the discharge flow rate over time m s the flow rate was captured for both vertical and horizontal boundary conditions figs 12 and 13 show the results of the outlet flow rate over time while fig 14 shows the flow velocity inside the samples under vertical boundary conditions the flow rate of the dpa samples at the outlet tended to reach a stable flow rate quicker than that of the lpa samples fig 12a compared with the lpa samples the shape of the aggregate from the dpa samples is smoother and the average particle size is larger than that of the lpa samples because of the exclusion of particles smaller than 1 18 mm which produced less tortuosity on the water flow path between air voids due to the smooth geometric surface dpa samples more easily reach the steady flow condition than lpa samples after 0 1 s the outlet flow rate for the samples regardless of lpa or dpa reached a stable stage except in the case of the lpa1 and dpa1 samples in which the flow rate fluctuated during the whole simulation due to the unsteady turbulent flow and dynamic pressure inside the sample overall the average flow rate of dpa samples was merely 3 lower than that of lpa samples but not significantly different based on the t test analysis with a significance level of 0 05 based on past literature it was found that the results from virtual cfd simulations might not 100 match those from laboratory tests the research done by chung et al 2014 shows an approach to reconstructing the 3d model using a ct scanner and finite element method fem for flow motion simulation and hydraulic conductivity calculation the results show that the permeability from the simulation is 8 9 to 14 75 lower than that from laboratory experiments alshareedah and nassiri 2021 also conclude that the prediction from the dem cfd has 20 fewer errors than the experimental results in terms of horizontal hydraulic performance the lpa samples tend to reach a stable flow rate faster than the dpa samples at approximately 0 03 s fig 12b however the dpa samples had a significantly higher flow rate than the lpa samples the average velocity of the lpa samples ranged from 0 11 to 0 16 m s while the value from the dpa samples ranged from 0 15 to 0 25 m s on average the outlet velocity of dpa samples was approximately 59 higher than that of the lpa samples based on three replicates fig 13b the dpa samples showed a higher velocity of flow at the lower part of the sample than the lpa samples this result is related to the particle arrangement and the air voids connectivity inside the sample structure in addition a smoother aggregate surface and fewer small particles e g 1 18 mm of the dpa samples also contributed to the higher flow rate results due to less tortuosity of the water flow path between air voids the air voids distribution was also seen to affect the flow rate the dpa samples had a higher air voids content near the top of the samples from 5 mm to 15 mm allowing water to move fast horizontally or at higher water velocity fig 14c this also resulted in a higher flow rate of dpa samples compared to the lpa samples the steps needed to capture the aggregate skeleton using photogrammetry 2d modelling using image morphology and 2d simulation using the cfd method can all be affected by the computing power available the effect is mainly driven by two factors or steps capturing the reconstruction of the aggregate skeleton virtually and modelling it by using image morphology for 2d reconstruction the boundaries of individual aggregates were identified by detecting pixels and through the generation of a dense points cloud using photogrammetry this approach might lose some accuracy during the skeleton generation phase and the smoothness level for the finalized geometry of a single aggregate might need to be reduced to match the current computing power as shown in fig 15 a the original 3d skeleton reconstructed via photogrammetry had over 9 000 faces for a single aggregate to minimize the computing power requirements needed for the reconstruction of the entire asphalt specimen simplifications and smoothing techniques were used for the aggregate skeleton for each virtual aggregate the geometry was simplified by 98 6 of the original number of elements this explains why the edges of the slices made by the dem method were smoother than those of the laboratory prepared slices it was reported in the literature that the image processing technique or image processing step is not enough to capture pores morphological and internal structural characteristics of porous media but an algorithm with a more detailed element design that can robustly model the feature extraction would be required isa et al 2022 similarly in this research the use of image morphology technology for 2d model reconstruction of porous asphalt slices might lose accuracy compared to the real specimen as fig 3 shows all pixels detected and used for the boundary reconstruction by the program were assumed to be at the same depth level and from the same plane however some pixels belonged to deeper layers hence possibly leading to an inaccurate model reconstruction finally there are some unavoidable spatial limitations for 2d simulation when using the cfd method bakshi et al 2018 pointed out that compared with 2d cfd simulation important qualitative and quantitative trends such as bubble size distribution pattern formation in bubbles and the superficial rate of gas flow can be captured without changing any parameters for the individual cases the final result captured from the 2d simulation might be inaccurate due to the missing movement of flow in the z direction i e depth cfd simulation with the 2d pa model could not properly demonstrate the updating change in flow rate when water flows in connected pores 4 3 effect of water flow inlet intensity on hydraulic performance the low impact development lid performance has been widely used for the storm water management model swmm to reduce the flow conveyed to the traditional networks madrazo uribeetxebarria et al 2021 this study applied a second water flow rate of 0 2 m s velocity at the inlet to test all lpa and dpa samples in the vertical direction then the results were compared with the flow rate of 0 1 m s to determine the lid performance of the virtual asphalt 2d sample slices as shown in fig 16 all lpa and dpa samples were tested at 0 2 m s inlet velocity up to 0 15 s following a similar trend to what already identified at section 4 2 the flow for all lpa and dpa samples begins from the initial inlet velocity value and consequently fluctuates due to the internal voids structure lpa2 reaches the highest peak flow velocity among the lpa samples at 0 015 s then the flow stabilizes at around 0 25 m s lpa1 and lpa3 show similar behaviour to lpa3 after reaching the peak the flow becomes stable after approximately 0 06 s on the other hand dpa samples behave differently when the inlet velocity is doubled from 0 1 m s to 0 2 m s in dpa samples dpa3 has the highest flow velocity following a different trend from dpa1 and dpa2 the flow for dpa3 seems to fluctuate during the simulation dpa1 and dpa2 show similar trends to the one observed for lap samples where a peak value is followed by a steadier flow lid performance is a complex phenomenon determined by the rainfall intensity and tested porous structure which might not be mimicked properly using a single phase cfd model moraveji and ardehali 2013 mentioned that a two phase model better approximates the experimental data than a single phase model for cfd simulation compared to multiphase water air flow simulations analysing velocity of the water at the outlet passing through a 2d pa sample using single phase flow can be difficult to observe since water is the only material in the fluid domain as shown in fig 12 the water reaches the domain outlet once the simulation starts without any flow motion so the initial reading at the outlet does not start from 0 m s moreover due to the single phase model the interactions between different phases such as water and air cannot be simulated to resemble the testing environment of the laboratory the dark blue sections in fig 14 are voids that are initially full of stationary water because of the single phase model water in those voids does not participate in any motion including turbulences which might affect the final hydraulic readings at the outlet 4 4 limitations of 2d modelling 2d modelling using image morphology might be limited to achieve an accurate void structure to investigate this three samples slices were taken from a 3d dem sample compacted with 18 air voids as shown in fig 17 the samples have dimensions of 4 cm in width and 5 cm in height after being reconstructed using the image morphology algorithm the closest void content of the samples was 23 7 approximately 5 7 different from the target air voids content of 18 timoumi et al 2023 illustrated that there are several critical points and limitations using morpho granulometric techniques the complexity of diameter definitions such as volume surface and perimeter might be hidden by using an image processing algorithm and insufficient to reconstruct the morphological complexity the skeleton of the aggregate could not be properly defined and reconstructed due to the high complexity of the image by timoumi et al 2023 leading to a difference in the air voids of granular compacted samples similarly as seen in fig 16 although the slices were cut from the same 3d sample with 18 air voids the final void content after reconstruction ranged from 23 7 to 26 8 one can notice that a large number of lines and points with very tiny spacing could not be accurately identified by image processing this explains why it is difficult to maintain high accuracy of model reconstruction to achieve the right porosity close to the original 3d model similarly the voids reconstruction for all lpa and dpa samples used in this study was affected first due to the difference in background colour the aggregates covered by bitumen become hard to scan and capture properly which might lose the 2d modelling accuracy after reconstruction small size aggregates were hard to detect and capture especially for lpa samples there are over 10 of aggregates with smaller size than 2 36 mm detection of these aggregates is limited by the limited number of pixels additionally the 2d model created using image processing methodology is a reconstruction process based on the quality of the image and pixels and how accurately the shape of the aggregates can be described at the end of all the phases of model reconstruction the slices taken from the 18 laboratory made pa sample achieved approximately 50 air voids content to match that situation slices taken from the 3d dem made sample had to be simplified by deleting some small sized aggregates to maintain the whole porous structure at approximately 50 voids content because of the colour of bitumen tiny sized aggregates cannot be detected which is why after image processing of laboratory slices the actual air voids content after reconstruction reaches 50 5 conclusion this study proposes an original approach to conducting simulations on the hydraulic behaviour of porous asphalt pavement traditionally the virtual samples are reconstructed by using the x ray scanning technique to capture the internal structure of the laboratory prepared sample before conducting the cfd simulation differently this study proposes a novel approach to capture the aggregate morphology and use that information to reconstruct the virtual samples using a dem simulation before using the dem reconstructed samples for conducting the cfd simulation based on the results the following conclusions are drawn using a camera from a smartphone to capture the image morphology for a single aggregate skeleton for dem reconstruction is more timesaving and more equipment accessible the resolution of images taken by a smartphone was found to be sufficient to be used for further analysis with high reliability for virtual modelling in pa samples for building a database image morphology technology takes less time to deal with a large number of aggregates and each reconstructed model can be re edited to manually control the quality while matching the computing power limit using the dem method for reconstructing virtual pa in 2d with similar air voids to laboratory produced samples is feasible dem produced samples can be constructed with similar aggregate size aggregate gradation and sample skeleton structure to the laboratory produced samples due to the high porosity of all pa samples the vertical hydraulic performance of the pa samples was not sensitive to the change in the air voids distribution along the depth of the sample aggregate shape aggregate surface properties and aggregate skeleton structure as long as the total air voids were similar which resulted in less than 3 difference in average vertical hydraulic conductivity among lpa and dpa samples on the other hand the horizontal hydraulic performance of the pa samples was significantly affected by the air void distribution air void connectivity and aggregate surface smoothness overall the results from this study show promise for conducting hydraulic performance using the proposed approach however hydraulic performance using 2d simulation is limited to high air void samples due to the nonpermeable of 2d samples at lower air voids e g 18 thus further study using the proposed approach in this study is recommended to extend the work to 3d simulations to analyse the different scenarios of the hydraulic performance of porous asphalt concrete more realistically further the outcomes from the 3d hydraulic simulation will need to be compared with the hydraulic performance of laboratory prepared samples

1892,storm events lead to mobilization of particles as well as organic contaminants that can pose a risk to river ecosystems assessment of total loads of particle bound and dissolved contaminants in rivers is challenging especially during rain events since multiple often unknown contamination sources may be triggered among them tributaries combined sewer overflows direct soil and road runoff and the riverbed sediment we investigated whether cytotoxicity i e reduction of the cell viability of human cell lines could be used as a proxy for the total chemical mixture to assess the transport of organic contaminant mixtures either in particle associated form or in the aqueous phase time proportional composite samples were collected in the ammer river southwestern germany during two storm events in june 2021 all samples were screened for 127 organic contaminants and cytotoxicity in the water and particle phase separately in total 56 organic compounds were found of which 14 and 34 were detected only in the water and particle extracts respectively and eight compounds were present in both phases thermodynamic equilibrium between the aqueous phase and suspended solids was observed for four compounds namely triphenyl phosphate octocrylene galaxolide and p chlorocresol substances that were not in equilibrium were mainly constituents of plastics and tire rubber and their high concentrations in the particle phase were probably due to extractions from the particles themselves linear correlations between tss and total compound concentrations were found for 17 pahs and two musk fragrances suggesting stable particle loadings and aqueous concentrations over the course of the rain event most likely due to particle delivery from a particle source with a constant degree of contamination the total cytotoxicity of water plus particles in the river correlated linearly with tss during storm events inflowing water and particles from all sources appeared to be integrated such that the total cytotoxicity of all contaminants per mass of particles and volume of water in the river was stable throughout storm events from this relationship a threshold of 0 5 g l 1 tss was derived above which particle facilitated transport exceeded dissolved cumulative contaminant transport in the ammer river indicating the relevance of particle facilitated contaminant transport keywords water quality river suspended solids organic contaminants cytotoxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river pollution is a major concern worldwide as an increasing number of organic contaminants enters surface waters luo et al 2014 schwarzenbach et al 2006 organic contaminants in fluvial systems partition between water suspended particles and the riverbed sediment suspended solids are an important transport medium for many compounds as particles carry or contain legacy and emerging pollutants esser et al 2020 hagemann et al 2020 müller et al 2021 niu et al 2021 hydrophobic contaminants are transported mainly associated to particles while hydrophilic and ionizable compounds are rather transported in their dissolved forms niu et al 2020 during storm events suspended solid concentrations in rivers are high due to mobilization of particles from riverbeds or riverbanks liu et al 2018 moreover stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows csos contribute to the particle and contaminant input into rivers furén et al 2022 spahr et al 2020 pamuru et al 2022 zgheib et al 2011 zgheib et al 2012 particles can also be introduced by

transported further downstream ciszewski and grygar 2016 salomons et al 1987 suspended particles in rivers consequently represent an integral signal of a wide range of particles from different sources carrying different mixtures of pollutants walling 2005 the monitoring of particle associated and dissolved contaminant fluxes in catchments during storm events is time consuming and labor intensive moreover the dissolved fraction of hydrophobic compounds is often difficult to quantify because concentrations are close to detection limits easy to measure proxies are required to overcome these obstacles and allow determination of contaminant fluxes in different catchments turbid water samples contain particle associated and dissolved organic contaminants according to the mass balance eq 1 1 c i total c i particle tss c i dissolved c i total is the total concentration of a compound i in a sample e g in µg l 1 c i particle is the concentration of the compound per mass of particles e g in µg g 1 tss is the total suspended solids concentration e g in g l 1 and c i dissolved is the dissolved concentration of the compound e g in µg l 1 if total concentrations of the compound i are plotted versus tss a linear relation can be obtained where c i particle corresponds to the slope and c i dissolved to the y intercept this correlation provides information on particle contaminant loads integrative for the upstream catchment as well as the dissolved fraction of the compound based on contaminant bulk concentration i e the sum of dissolved and particle associated contaminant concentrations and tss measurements tss may be replaced by turbidity measurements if relationships have been established between the two variables in the respective river rügner et al 2013 linear contaminant tss correlations have already been identified for pahs chiffre et al 2016 schwientek et al 2013a pcbs rügner et al 2019 and metals nasrabadi et al 2018 these correlations were shown to be catchment specific and reflect the urban pressure geological background and sediment quality of the catchments rügner et al 2014 schwientek et al 2013a schwientek et al 2017 in contrast sediment samples from the river bed only display particles at a specific spot with a considerable heterogeneity within the river network chiffre et al 2016 tss contaminant relationships are valid if the dissolved and particle associated concentrations remain stable over time and the ratio of ci particle ci dissolved may be interpreted as the partition coefficient k d e g in l kg 1 of the contaminant i between solids and the aqueous phase rügner et al 2019 partitioning of nonionic organic compounds between different phases depends on various factors such as physicochemical properties of the chemicals characteristics of the particles and the hydrological conditions the latter in particular are highly dynamic during storm events and various non point sources can contribute to the water and particle associated contaminant flux in rivers during storm events the partitioning of compounds between particles and water has rarely been studied in rivers müller et al 2021 target chemical analyses cannot capture all chemicals present in rivers as some compounds occur in concentrations below analytical detection limits and there are numerous unknown chemicals and transformation products in vitro bioassays can be used to quantify effects of all known and unknown compounds present in a sample escher et al 2021 cytotoxicity is a measure of how a cell or organism responds to the exposure to all chemicals in environmental samples with each chemical having a different contribution potency escher and neale 2021 effects and cytotoxicity of single chemicals in complex mixtures are typically additive escher et al 2020 therefore cytotoxicity can be interpreted as an effect scale measure of all organic contaminants in rivers a combination of in vitro bioassays and chemical target analyses can be used to determine how much of the cytotoxicity can be explained by the measured contaminants in the sample so called iceberg modelling neale et al 2020 niu et al 2021 different cytotoxicity measurements have been successfully applied in various environmental studies and matrices such as water sediment and suspended particles becouze lareure et al 2016 hollert et al 2000 milačič et al 2017 müller et al 2021 neale et al 2020 tuikka et al 2011 cytotoxicity can be easily compared between the water and particle phase of rivers thus providing insights into the importance of water versus particles as transport medium for all organic contaminants present in the river a stable tss cytotoxicity relationship would enable a direct comparison of the relevance of water and particle fractions for the effect based sum of all substances present in the river we hypothesize that river discharge at the catchment outlet integrates various particle and contaminant sources such that a relationship between particle concentrations and the sum of all contaminants cytotoxicity can be derived therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze whether hydrophobic contaminants in a river are in thermodynamic equilibrium between the aqueous and particle fraction during storm events 2 to correlate the total concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants with suspended particle concentrations and 3 to elucidate whether suspended particle concentrations are a suitable proxy for mixture effects expressed as cytotoxicity in a river during storm events to this end river samples were collected in southwestern germany ammer river during high discharge events target analysis of hydrophobic organic contaminants was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and four human cell lines were used to measure the cytotoxicity of contaminant mixtures extracted separately from the water phase and suspended solids iceberg modelling was applied to quantify the contribution of the detected chemicals to the observed cytotoxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site the ammer river 4th order stream is a tributary of the neckar river

in summer during heavy storm events significant water inflow from urban areas and combined sewer overflows in the upper catchment dominate the water flow in the river resulting in distinct flood and turbidity peaks propagating through the catchment as described in previous studies at the ammer river schwientek et al 2013a schwientek et al 2013b the gauging station in pfäffingen was selected for our investigations because it integrates the water and particle flux from the upper catchment fig 1a two rain events of different intensity were investigated in this study fig 1b 2 2 field instrumentation and sampling in situ probes uit gmbh dresden germany were installed at the riverbank of the pfäffingen gauging station fig 1a the probes continuously recorded turbidity with an optical

using a daily weather forecast two storm events of varying intensity were sampled in june 2021 fig 1b in total 24 river samples were collected during the high discharge events covering both the increasing and decreasing discharge limbs two autosamplers isco 3700 teledyne isco inc lincoln ne usa with eleven 950 ml transparent glass bottles were installed next to each other at the pfäffingen

for the water extracts while only one cell line h4iie was deployed for extracts from the solids due to the limited number of extracted particles the aim of this study was to assess the cytotoxicity from these different cell lines though the applied cell lines are frequently applied to measure the activation of specific effects table b1 the percentage area covered by cells on the bottom of the

experimental literature data and various models niu et al 2020 and can be found in table b2 the mean f oc value from all samples was used for the calculations and describes the fraction of the particulate organic carbon difference of total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon in relation to the total suspended solids concentration the mean f oc value of 3 56 0 63 is comparable to previous studies at this sampling site that found f oc values of 2 4 during storm events glaser et al 2020c schwientek et al 2013a the equilibrium contaminant concentration of substance i on the

dissolved or tudissolved for interpretation of river in processes we only used the chemical data that were obtained from the sample set of the e2 storm event 12 samples we hypothesize that the

during two storm events in june 2021 samples were collected at the gauging station in pfäffingen with tss values ranging from 0 01 to 1 4 g l 1 table b4 the water and particle extracts were both screened for 127 organic compounds out of which 56 were detected 34 compounds were exclusively found in the particle extracts and 14 in the water extracts table b2 eight compounds were found in both phases with log k ow values between 2 01 and 6 88 they included polymer and fluid additives triphenyl phosphate 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone benzothiazole benzyl benzoate ingredients of personal care and household products octocrylene pesticides biocides p chlorocresol 1 naphthol and one musk fragrance galaxolide fig 2 shows the measured concentration of particle associated compounds plotted against the theoretical equilibrium concentration on particles calculated from the water concentration and the k d using eq 6 four substances including galaxolide triphenyl phosphate octocrylene and p chlorocresol appeared close to thermodynamic equilibrium between the particles and the water as the measured particulate contaminant concentrations were close to the estimated equilibrium concentrations the deviation is smaller than a factor of 10 i e they fall between the 10 1 and 1 10 lines in fig 2 for triphenyl phosphate log k ow of 4 59 equilibrium conditions were already described in previous investigations of storm events müller et al 2021 as well as for baseflow conditions niu et al 2021 the measured ci particle of four of the eight chemicals exceeded ci particle equilibrium below the 1 10 line with the exception of 1 naphthol all substances below the 1 10 line are fluid or polymer additives this suggests that the high concentrations of fluid polymer additives and consequently the higher measured ci particle of these compounds could have resulted from the presence of rubber particles or other microplastics with a particle size of 0 7 µm our filter size which were also extracted by ase a higher measured particle associated contaminant concentration compared to the expected concentration was previously determined for tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp log k ow of 2 8 likely due to particle associated tcpp input into the ammer river müller et al 2021 tcpp is used as flame retardant and polymer additive e g in polyurethane foams and rubber cristale et al 2013 and may therefore be extracted directly from plastic particles 3 2 relationship between contaminants and tss total substance concentrations were calculated with eq 1 using the measured tss values dissolved compound concentrations and compound concentrations per mass of particles 19 substances showed a correlation between total concentration and tss table a1 r2 0 75 of these 19 compounds only galaxolide was detected in the water phase while 17 pahs and the musk fragrance tonalide were detected only in the particle extracts for the sum of 15 pahs pah15 representing the 16 u s epa priority pahs excluding naphthalene a strong correlation with tss r2 0 96 was obtained with a mean particle loading of 9 5 mg pah kg 1 and an intercept near zero subsequently forced through zero fig 3 a consistent with pahs not being present in the water this mean particle loading is within the range of values derived in earlier studies at the pfäffingen gauging station with a mean particle loading of 5 8 mg pah kg 1 measured between 2011 and 2014 rügner et al 2014 schwientek et al 2013a and 5 7 mg pah kg 1 in 2019 glaser et al 2020c previous investigations at the ammer river already revealed that water and particles schwientek and selle 2016 as well as associated pahs glaser et al 2020c liu et al 2019 schwientek et al 2017 were originally introduced into the river via urban areas in the upper catchment this stable particle loading across storm events over the past decade indicates a stable particle source with consistent loading over the years schwientek et al 2013a demonstrated that stable pah particle loadings obtained from regressions are in the same range as the median particle concentration of the ammer riverbed sediment 6 9 mg pah kg 1 and that the slope of tss pah regressions represents the average of spatially heterogenous contamination of sediments in river networks this finding has also been confirmed for other catchments nasrabadi et al 2018 rügner et al 2014 therefore the gradual mobilization of riverbed sediment during storms leads to a stable linear relationship between tss and pahs the musk fragrances galaxolide and tonalide showed a strong correlation with tss r2 0 89 fig 3 b and c which has not been described previously for these substances the mean particle loading was 0 99 and 0 033 µg g 1 for galaxolide and tonalide respectively the correlation of galaxolide had an intercept of 0 091 0 07 µg l 1 this value is four times smaller than the measured galaxolide concentration of 0 38 0 11 µg l 1 in the water phase we probably overestimated the measured freely dissolved concentration of this very hydrophobic compound because it is likely bound to colloids and doc neither of which can be separated from the water phase by our filtration method niu et al 2021 in contrast tonalide was not detected in the water phase potentially due to the higher expected biodegradability of tonalide t1 2 7 4 d table b2 compared to galaxolide t1 2 25 d a linear correlation between the total concentration of a compound and tss indicates that the particle loading is constant throughout the quickly changing environmental parameters and conditions of a storm event a correlation between contaminants and tss might imply that musk fragrance contaminated particles were mobilized from the riverbed during storm events a constant delivery of particles with stable tonalide and galaxolide loadings via urban areas located in the upper catchment could also result in a constant particle loading during storm events however it is not possible to trace individual particles from specific sources along the stream as they are in contrast to water subject to fast particle exchange processes with the riverbed sediment glaser et al 2020c liu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 triphenyl phosphate and octocrylene did not show a relationship with tss but concentrations were in thermodynamic equilibrium between water and particles fig 2 notably a correlation was obtained for both substances when only samples from the decreasing q limb were considered fig 4 r2 0 72 the categorization of samples from the same storm event e2 with respect to increasing and decreasing discharge conditions can be found in figure a1 this categorization was made in previous studies due to the attributed higher shear stress at the beginning of the event glaser et al 2020c this finding might indicate that particle loadings as well as concentrations in the aqueous phase for these substances were not constant at the beginning of the event an explanation could be a first flush event introducing stormwater with high contaminant concentrations into the river peter et al 2020 at a later time point of event e2 the particle loadings of triphenyl phosphate and octocrylene were predominantly constant resulting in a tss contaminant relationship as exemplarily shown in fig 4 a and b the shear stress is smaller for decreasing discharge conditions likely leading to less particle mobilization in close vicinity to the sampling site particles from the decreasing discharge limb might therefore originate from further upstream in the catchment either from contaminated sediment and or additional inflow of contaminated particles for alpha tocopherol acetate which was only detected associated to particles and not in the water phase a strong correlation r2 0 98 was also only observed for samples from the decreasing discharge limb figure a6 this substance is a widely used pharmaceutical vitamin e that is well removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants mladenov et al 2022 alpha tocopherol acetate may thus serve as tracer for untreated wastewater and combined sewer overflows in the upper catchment of the ammer river moreover all of the 17 detected pahs with tss contaminant relationship show higher particle loadings cparticle with decreasing discharge compared to increasing discharge conditions table a1 riverbed sediment is known to be more contaminated closer to urban inflows into rivers liang et al 2016 schwientek et al 2017 particles arriving at a later time during the decreasing discharge limb therefore likely represent the urban particle signal of the upper catchment our findings indicate that not all hydrophobic contaminants transported during storm events are correlated linearly with tss different contaminant sources contributing to the integrative particle associated contaminant flux during storm events might be inferred from tss contaminant relationships 3 3 relationship between cytotoxicity and tss we hypothesize that the rivers discharge at the catchment outlet integrates various particle and contaminant sources as well as potential thermodynamic disequilibrium of individual substances such that a relationship between tss and the sum of all contaminants can be derived figure a3 depicts the mean tudissolved for all samples no significant difference was found between the medians of the different cell lines after application of the kruskal wallis test p 0 05 thus the tudissolved values obtained from the different cell lines in the same samples are comparable within their error margin therefore we concluded that the mean of the cytotoxicity obtained from different cell lines yields a representative cytotoxicity value to assess whether cytotoxicity constitutes a representative parameter for the detected substances the mixture effect of the detected chemicals tuchem was compared to the observed cytotoxicity tubio by applying iceberg modelling results are exemplarily discussed for the mcf7 and h4iie cell lines and cover samples from both storm events measured ic10 values for the samples can be found in table b5 tubio predicted tuchem and explained effect for the cell lines h4iie and mcf7 can be found in table b6 for the mcf7 cell line arec32 see table b1 17 of the measured 56 compounds were cytotoxic of which 11 were found in the water extracts less than 0 5 of the observed cytotoxicity tubio could be explained by the mixture effect of the detected chemicals tuchem for the h4iie cell line ahr calux see table b1 22 of the detected compounds were cytotoxic of which 11 were found in the water and 15 in the particle extracts in the water phase a maximum of 0 6 of tuchem could explain tubio for the particles however the fraction of tuchem that could explain the tubio was significantly larger with up to 14 8 the small fraction that could explain the observed effect fits very well to previous studies of surface water and particulate matter muz et al 2020 neale et al 2020 the contribution of individual detected compounds to tuchem for the particles and water is displayed in figure a4 and figure a5 respectively for all obtained samples for the water the main mixture effect drivers were p chlorocresol and galaxolide these two substances could explain up to 98 8 of the mixture effect for both cell lines sample e2 p5 figure a5 b and d this finding differs from another study that evaluated rain events in 44 agricultural streams in germany neale et al 2020 where 2 4 dinitrophenol was identified as the main mixture effect driver for the aqueous cytotoxicity obtained from h4iie and carbendazim for the mcf7 cell line this is due to the fact that more compounds were detected 290 in their investigation with a focus on hydrophilic compounds that are expected to be predominantly in the water phase the higher number of detected compounds also resulted in a higher fraction of tuchem that could explain tubio on average 4 1 for ahr could be explained neale et al 2020 the particle extracts of our study suggest that benz a anthracene octocrylene benzo ghi perylene and benzo a pyrene were the main mixture effect drivers for the h4iie cell line and dominated the mixture effect up to 92 8 figure a4 b the large contribution of the pahs to the cytotoxicity is not surprising given the high pah concentration in the river and their high hydrophobicity which leads to high baseline toxicity the uv filter octocrylene was found to be an important mixture effect driver in this study this substance has also been previously detected in many german river sediments kaiser et al 2012 rodil and moeder 2008 and identified as mixture effect driver for the activation of arec32 in german and australian river sediment muz et al 2020 for the particle samples the largest proportion of the detected mixture effect could not be explained 85 figure a4 a most likely due to many compounds that are not included in the target list tutotal calculated with eq 7 from tudissolved and tuparticle correlated linearly with tss r2 0 85 in the river just as tuparticle multiplied with tss tuparticle tss r2 0 81 fig 5 tuparticle obtained from the slope of the regression of 0 091 lbioassay gparticle 1 se 0 009 was very similar to the median tuparticle of the measured samples 0 076 lbioassay gparticle 1 σ 0 17 both particle loadings are in the same order of magnitude which shows that the tuparticle from the tutotal tss correlation is representative for all tuparticle measurements the mixture effect of all compounds associated to particles and in the water phase tuparticle and tudissolved remained constant regardless of the hydrological conditions in the river niu et al 2021 measured the cytotoxicity in the ammer riverbed sediment at different sampling sites in the river network the obtained values were between 0 01 and 503 lbioassay gsediment 1 table b7 this large range shows that tu measurements of the riverbed sediment are highly heterogeneous in the river network tuparticle obtained from the correlation of tutotal with tss however integrates the signal of all particle releasing processes in the catchment but the large variability of previous riverbed sediment mixture toxicity measurements restricts valid statements regarding the integrative measure of the slope for the riverbed sediment the main mixture effect drivers in our study were pahs besides octocrylene but the number of measured pahs 20 is significantly smaller than the number of pahs 100 that exist in the environment therefore the presented results might underestimate the contribution of this substance group to the measured cytotoxicity tubio in general cytotoxicity increases with hydrophobicity lee et al 2021 future research should focus on the role of hydrophobicity of detected compounds for the mixture effect a systematic evaluation of a compounds concentration and potency as a function of the measured mixture effect would allow us to determine if the total mixture effects represent mainly hydrophobic compounds which typically are more potent leading to a larger contribution to tu despite smaller concentrations the extrapolation towards zero from the regression between tutotal and tss leads to a y intercept of 0 042 se 0 006 lbioassay lwater 1 which corresponds to tudissolved as shown in fig 5 this value fits the median of the cell line measurements 0 046 lbioassay lwater 1 σ 0 017 the correlation between tss and tutotal provides insights into the weighting of the bioactive compounds of the respective medium water vs particle in comparison to the sum of bioactive compounds tutotal in the river for this purpose the tss concentration at which tuparticle is equal to tudissolved 50 contribution of both fractions to tutotal was determined using tudissolved derived from the linear regression 0 042 lbioassay lwater 1 and rearranging equation 7 for toxic units leads to a tss value of 0 5 g l 1 for the ammer river below a tss of 0 5 g l 1 50 of tutotal can be explained by bioactive contaminants that dominate in the water fraction tudissolved above a tss of 0 5 g l 1 50 of tutotal can be explained by bioactive compounds attached to the particles a particle concentration of 0 5 g l 1 does not require severe flooding conditions in the ammer river in fact only smaller storm events leading to a river discharge of 9 m3 s 1 data of this study not shown which is 9 times the mean discharge are sufficient to reach this tss value this threshold is not very large considering a high discharge of 11 7 m3 s 1 with a recurrence interval of two years hq2 for the gauging station in pfäffingen https www hvz baden wuerttemberg de pegel html id our results highlight the importance of particle associated mixture effect transport during storm events especially when cytotoxicity is placed in the context of risk assessment for surface water quality monitoring the so called effect based trigger ebt values are a tool to distinguish between poor and acceptable water quality using in vitro bioassays escher and neale 2021 suggest that the ebt for cytotoxicity is defined as 1 of cytotoxicity in any original water sample to define this water as acceptable water quality this value corresponds to an ic10 of 10 concentration that causes 10 reduction of cell viability and growth and is equivalent to tudissolved 0 1 according to this classification the tudissolved of the ammer river 0 042 lbioassay lwater 1 can be classified as acceptable water quality however transferring the ebt to turbid water samples tutotal shows that water quality for tss values larger than 0 6 g l 1 is already classified as poor consequently particle associated contaminant transport is highly relevant for water quality monitoring especially in light of the expected increase in storm events due to climate change ipcc 2018 4 conclusions and implications suspended particles are an important transport pathway for organic contaminants during storm events this study presents a novel approach to get insights into the importance of particle associated contaminant transport during storm events on the catchment scale by measuring organic contaminants as well as the cytotoxicity as a proxy for the total chemical mixture seventeen pahs and two musk fragrance compounds showed a linear correlation with tss concentrations indicating a gradual release of hydrophobic particle associated organic contaminants likely from the riverbed sediment or other sources in the upper catchment not all hydrophobic contaminants exhibited a linear tss contaminant relationship because they may be freshly introduced into the river the river discharge at the catchment outlet thus integrates various particle and contaminant sources our study is the first to show that cytotoxicity correlated linearly with tss during the studied storm events this cytotoxicity tss correlation allows to derive information on the importance of the particle associated mixture effect of all particle bound contaminants present in a river which is of great importance also from a risk assessment perspective for the investigated storm events the cytotoxicity in the water phase did not exceed the proposed effect based trigger values ebt in contrast particle associated cytotoxicity exceeded the ebts indicating poor river water quality we analyzed organic contaminants and cytotoxicity in the particulate and dissolved phases separately given the linear correlation between the sum concentrations and tss and the intercept and slope as a measure of the contribution of the water phase and the suspended solids future investigations may rely on total extractions of the unfractionated water sample thus avoiding time consuming and labor intensive separation of water and particulate phase moreover the toxic potential of metals for cytotoxic effects should be considered furthermore future studies should address river monitoring over larger time spans to cover seasonal variability of stormwater quality this study is based on data from two storm events of summer 2021 repeated investigations at the same sampling site are needed especially since stormwater runoff has been shown to be seasonally highly variable neale et al 2020 moreover different catchments with different land use types should be compared to examine whether cytotoxicity in rivers correlates with agricultural or urban pressures information on the contaminant loads transported in the water versus attached to particles could be obtained from the cumulated effect based contaminant flux e g on an annual basis from a management perspective an assessment of annual loads for both transport media could enhance the development and implementation of

1892,storm events lead to mobilization of particles as well as organic contaminants that can pose a risk to river ecosystems assessment of total loads of particle bound and dissolved contaminants in rivers is challenging especially during rain events since multiple often unknown contamination sources may be triggered among them tributaries combined sewer overflows direct soil and road runoff and the riverbed sediment we investigated whether cytotoxicity i e reduction of the cell viability of human cell lines could be used as a proxy for the total chemical mixture to assess the transport of organic contaminant mixtures either in particle associated form or in the aqueous phase time proportional composite samples were collected in the ammer river southwestern germany during two storm events in june 2021 all samples were screened for 127 organic contaminants and cytotoxicity in the water and particle phase separately in total 56 organic compounds were found of which 14 and 34 were detected only in the water and particle extracts respectively and eight compounds were present in both phases thermodynamic equilibrium between the aqueous phase and suspended solids was observed for four compounds namely triphenyl phosphate octocrylene galaxolide and p chlorocresol substances that were not in equilibrium were mainly constituents of plastics and tire rubber and their high concentrations in the particle phase were probably due to extractions from the particles themselves linear correlations between tss and total compound concentrations were found for 17 pahs and two musk fragrances suggesting stable particle loadings and aqueous concentrations over the course of the rain event most likely due to particle delivery from a particle source with a constant degree of contamination the total cytotoxicity of water plus particles in the river correlated linearly with tss during storm events inflowing water and particles from all sources appeared to be integrated such that the total cytotoxicity of all contaminants per mass of particles and volume of water in the river was stable throughout storm events from this relationship a threshold of 0 5 g l 1 tss was derived above which particle facilitated transport exceeded dissolved cumulative contaminant transport in the ammer river indicating the relevance of particle facilitated contaminant transport keywords water quality river suspended solids organic contaminants cytotoxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river pollution is a major concern worldwide as an increasing number of organic contaminants enters surface waters luo et al 2014 schwarzenbach et al 2006 organic contaminants in fluvial systems partition between water suspended particles and the riverbed sediment suspended solids are an important transport medium for many compounds as particles carry or contain legacy and emerging pollutants esser et al 2020 hagemann et al 2020 müller et al 2021 niu et al 2021 hydrophobic contaminants are transported mainly associated to particles while hydrophilic and ionizable compounds are rather transported in their dissolved forms niu et al 2020 during storm events suspended solid concentrations in rivers are high due to mobilization of particles from riverbeds or riverbanks liu et al 2018 moreover stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows csos contribute to the particle and contaminant input into rivers furén et al 2022 spahr et al 2020 pamuru et al 2022 zgheib et al 2011 zgheib et al 2012 particles can also be introduced by runoff from agricultural areas with potential pesticide contamination knauer et al 2017 by street runoff containing e g tire wear fuchte et al 2022 rauert et al 2022 or by inflow from urban or industrial areas carrying e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs zhang et al 2009 storm induced mobilization of particles causes contaminants to be widely dispersed in river networks and be transported further downstream ciszewski and grygar 2016 salomons et al 1987 suspended particles in rivers consequently represent an integral signal of a wide range of particles from different sources carrying different mixtures of pollutants walling 2005 the monitoring of particle associated and dissolved contaminant fluxes in catchments during storm events is time consuming and labor intensive moreover the dissolved fraction of hydrophobic compounds is often difficult to quantify because concentrations are close to detection limits easy to measure proxies are required to overcome these obstacles and allow determination of contaminant fluxes in different catchments turbid water samples contain particle associated and dissolved organic contaminants according to the mass balance eq 1 1 c i total c i particle tss c i dissolved c i total is the total concentration of a compound i in a sample e g in µg l 1 c i particle is the concentration of the compound per mass of particles e g in µg g 1 tss is the total suspended solids concentration e g in g l 1 and c i dissolved is the dissolved concentration of the compound e g in µg l 1 if total concentrations of the compound i are plotted versus tss a linear relation can be obtained where c i particle corresponds to the slope and c i dissolved to the y intercept this correlation provides information on particle contaminant loads integrative for the upstream catchment as well as the dissolved fraction of the compound based on contaminant bulk concentration i e the sum of dissolved and particle associated contaminant concentrations and tss measurements tss may be replaced by turbidity measurements if relationships have been established between the two variables in the respective river rügner et al 2013 linear contaminant tss correlations have already been identified for pahs chiffre et al 2016 schwientek et al 2013a pcbs rügner et al 2019 and metals nasrabadi et al 2018 these correlations were shown to be catchment specific and reflect the urban pressure geological background and sediment quality of the catchments rügner et al 2014 schwientek et al 2013a schwientek et al 2017 in contrast sediment samples from the river bed only display particles at a specific spot with a considerable heterogeneity within the river network chiffre et al 2016 tss contaminant relationships are valid if the dissolved and particle associated concentrations remain stable over time and the ratio of ci particle ci dissolved may be interpreted as the partition coefficient k d e g in l kg 1 of the contaminant i between solids and the aqueous phase rügner et al 2019 partitioning of nonionic organic compounds between different phases depends on various factors such as physicochemical properties of the chemicals characteristics of the particles and the hydrological conditions the latter in particular are highly dynamic during storm events and various non point sources can contribute to the water and particle associated contaminant flux in rivers during storm events the partitioning of compounds between particles and water has rarely been studied in rivers müller et al 2021 target chemical analyses cannot capture all chemicals present in rivers as some compounds occur in concentrations below analytical detection limits and there are numerous unknown chemicals and transformation products in vitro bioassays can be used to quantify effects of all known and unknown compounds present in a sample escher et al 2021 cytotoxicity is a measure of how a cell or organism responds to the exposure to all chemicals in environmental samples with each chemical having a different contribution potency escher and neale 2021 effects and cytotoxicity of single chemicals in complex mixtures are typically additive escher et al 2020 therefore cytotoxicity can be interpreted as an effect scale measure of all organic contaminants in rivers a combination of in vitro bioassays and chemical target analyses can be used to determine how much of the cytotoxicity can be explained by the measured contaminants in the sample so called iceberg modelling neale et al 2020 niu et al 2021 different cytotoxicity measurements have been successfully applied in various environmental studies and matrices such as water sediment and suspended particles becouze lareure et al 2016 hollert et al 2000 milačič et al 2017 müller et al 2021 neale et al 2020 tuikka et al 2011 cytotoxicity can be easily compared between the water and particle phase of rivers thus providing insights into the importance of water versus particles as transport medium for all organic contaminants present in the river a stable tss cytotoxicity relationship would enable a direct comparison of the relevance of water and particle fractions for the effect based sum of all substances present in the river we hypothesize that river discharge at the catchment outlet integrates various particle and contaminant sources such that a relationship between particle concentrations and the sum of all contaminants cytotoxicity can be derived therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze whether hydrophobic contaminants in a river are in thermodynamic equilibrium between the aqueous and particle fraction during storm events 2 to correlate the total concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants with suspended particle concentrations and 3 to elucidate whether suspended particle concentrations are a suitable proxy for mixture effects expressed as cytotoxicity in a river during storm events to this end river samples were collected in southwestern germany ammer river during high discharge events target analysis of hydrophobic organic contaminants was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and four human cell lines were used to measure the cytotoxicity of contaminant mixtures extracted separately from the water phase and suspended solids iceberg modelling was applied to quantify the contribution of the detected chemicals to the observed cytotoxicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site the ammer river 4th order stream is a tributary of the neckar river located in southwestern germany the ammer river flows over a distance of 22 km from the city of herrenberg to the city of tübingen fig 1 a the river is characterized by a mean annual discharge q of 0

in summer during heavy storm events significant water inflow from urban areas and combined sewer overflows in the upper catchment dominate the water flow in the river resulting in distinct flood and turbidity peaks propagating through the catchment as described in previous studies at the ammer river schwientek et al 2013a schwientek et al 2013b the gauging station in pfäffingen was selected for our investigations because it integrates the water and particle flux from the upper catchment fig 1a two rain events of different intensity were investigated in this study fig 1b 2 2 field instrumentation and sampling in situ probes uit gmbh dresden germany were installed at the riverbank of the pfäffingen gauging station fig 1a the probes continuously recorded turbidity with an optical backscatter sensor at a wavelength of 880 nm water temperature electrical conductivity and water level the latter was converted to discharge using pre established rating curves glaser et al 2020a using a daily weather forecast two storm events of varying intensity were sampled in june 2021 fig 1b in total 24 river samples were collected during the high discharge events covering both the increasing and decreasing discharge limbs two autosamplers isco 3700 teledyne isco inc lincoln ne usa with eleven 950 ml transparent glass bottles were installed next to each other at the pfäffingen gauging station and operated simultaneously the teflon tubing inlets were placed in close proximity to the in situ probes to ensure comparability between the data obtained from the probes and the samples collected with the autosamplers the autosamplers were programmed to collect 30 minute composite samples of 800 ml 400 ml every 15 min all bottles were pre cleaned with methanol and deionized water few hours maximum 12 h after the peak discharge an additional grab sample was collected to capture the tailing of the recession discharge curve of each event all samples were stored at 4 c in

for the water extracts while only one cell line h4iie was deployed for extracts from the solids due to the limited number of extracted particles the aim of this study was to assess the cytotoxicity from these different cell lines though the applied cell lines are frequently applied to measure the activation of specific effects table b1 the percentage area covered by cells on the bottom of the wells of the 384 well plate defines the cell confluency which can be used as a surrogate for the number of cells cell viability confluency was measured in each plate immediately after dosing and after

particulate organic carbon difference of total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon in relation to the total suspended solids concentration the mean f oc value of 3 56 0 63 is comparable to previous studies at this sampling site that found f oc values of 2 4 during storm events glaser et al 2020c schwientek et al 2013a the equilibrium contaminant concentration of substance i on the

dissolved or tudissolved for interpretation of river in processes we only used the chemical data that were obtained from the sample set of the e2 storm event 12 samples we hypothesize that the

during two storm events in june 2021 samples were collected at the gauging station in pfäffingen with tss values ranging from 0 01 to 1 4 g l 1 table b4 the water and particle extracts were both screened for 127 organic compounds out of which 56 were detected 34 compounds were exclusively found in the particle extracts and 14 in the water extracts table b2 eight compounds were found in both phases with log k ow values between 2 01 and 6 88 they included polymer and fluid additives triphenyl phosphate 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone benzothiazole benzyl benzoate ingredients of personal care and household products octocrylene pesticides biocides p chlorocresol 1 naphthol and one musk fragrance galaxolide fig 2 shows the measured concentration of particle associated compounds plotted against the theoretical equilibrium concentration on particles calculated from the water concentration and the k d using eq 6 four substances including galaxolide triphenyl phosphate octocrylene and p chlorocresol appeared close to thermodynamic equilibrium between the particles and the water as the measured particulate contaminant concentrations were close to the estimated equilibrium concentrations the deviation is smaller than a factor of 10 i e they fall between the 10 1 and 1 10 lines in fig 2 for triphenyl phosphate log k ow of 4 59 equilibrium conditions were already described in previous investigations of storm events müller et al 2021 as well as for baseflow conditions niu et al 2021 the measured ci particle of four of the eight chemicals exceeded ci particle equilibrium below the 1 10 line with the exception of 1 naphthol all substances below the 1 10 line are fluid or polymer additives this suggests that the high concentrations of fluid polymer additives and consequently the higher measured ci particle of these compounds could have resulted from the presence of rubber particles or other microplastics with a particle size of 0 7 µm our filter size which were also extracted by ase a higher measured particle associated contaminant concentration compared to the expected concentration was previously determined for tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp log k ow of 2 8 likely due to particle associated tcpp input into the ammer river müller et al 2021 tcpp is used as flame retardant and polymer additive e g in polyurethane foams and rubber cristale et al 2013 and may therefore be extracted directly from plastic particles 3 2 relationship between contaminants and tss total substance concentrations were calculated with eq 1 using the measured tss values dissolved compound concentrations and compound concentrations per mass of particles 19 substances showed a correlation between total concentration and tss table a1 r2 0 75 of these 19 compounds only galaxolide was detected in the water phase while 17 pahs and the musk fragrance tonalide were detected only in the particle extracts for the sum of 15 pahs pah15 representing the 16 u s epa priority pahs excluding naphthalene a strong correlation with tss r2 0 96 was obtained with a mean particle loading of 9 5 mg pah kg 1 and an intercept near zero subsequently forced through zero fig 3 a consistent with pahs not being present in the water this mean particle loading is within the range of values derived in earlier studies at the pfäffingen gauging station with a mean particle loading of 5 8 mg pah kg 1 measured between 2011 and 2014 rügner et al 2014 schwientek et al 2013a and 5 7 mg pah kg 1 in 2019 glaser et al 2020c previous investigations at the ammer river already revealed that water and particles schwientek and selle 2016 as well as associated pahs glaser et al 2020c liu et al 2019 schwientek et al 2017 were originally introduced into the river via urban areas in the upper catchment this stable particle loading across storm events over the past decade indicates a stable particle source with consistent loading over the years schwientek et al 2013a demonstrated that stable pah particle loadings obtained from regressions are in the same range as the median particle concentration of the ammer riverbed sediment 6 9 mg pah kg 1 and that the slope of tss pah regressions represents the average of spatially heterogenous contamination of sediments in river networks this finding has also been confirmed for other catchments nasrabadi et al 2018 rügner et al 2014 therefore the gradual mobilization of riverbed sediment during storms leads to a stable linear relationship between tss and pahs the musk fragrances galaxolide and tonalide showed a strong correlation with tss r2 0 89 fig 3 b and c which has not been described previously for these substances the mean particle loading was 0 99 and 0 033 µg g 1 for galaxolide and tonalide respectively the correlation of galaxolide had an intercept of 0 091 0 07 µg l 1 this value is four times smaller than the measured galaxolide concentration of 0 38 0 11 µg l 1 in the water phase we probably overestimated the measured freely dissolved concentration of this very hydrophobic compound because it is likely bound to colloids and doc neither of which can be separated from the water phase by our filtration method niu et al 2021 in contrast tonalide was not detected in the water phase potentially due to the higher expected biodegradability of tonalide t1 2 7 4 d table b2 compared to galaxolide t1 2 25 d a linear correlation between the total concentration of a compound and tss indicates that the particle loading is constant throughout the quickly changing environmental parameters and conditions of a storm event a correlation between contaminants and tss might imply that musk fragrance contaminated particles were mobilized from the riverbed during storm events a constant delivery of particles with stable tonalide and galaxolide loadings via urban areas located in the upper catchment could also result in a constant particle loading during storm events however it is not possible to trace individual particles from specific sources along the stream as they are in contrast to water subject to fast particle exchange processes with the riverbed sediment glaser et al 2020c liu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 triphenyl phosphate and octocrylene did not show a relationship with tss but concentrations were in thermodynamic equilibrium between water and particles fig 2 notably a correlation was obtained for both substances when only samples from the decreasing q limb were considered fig 4 r2 0 72 the categorization of samples from the same storm event e2 with respect to increasing and decreasing discharge conditions can be found in figure a1 this categorization was made in previous studies due to the attributed higher shear stress at the beginning of the event glaser et al 2020c this finding might indicate that particle loadings as well as concentrations in the aqueous phase for these substances were not constant at the beginning of the event an explanation could be a first flush event introducing stormwater with high contaminant concentrations into the river peter et al 2020 at a later time point of event e2 the particle loadings of triphenyl phosphate and octocrylene were predominantly constant resulting in a tss contaminant relationship as exemplarily shown in fig 4 a and b the shear stress is smaller for decreasing discharge conditions likely leading to less particle mobilization in close vicinity to the sampling site particles from the decreasing discharge limb might therefore originate from further upstream in the catchment either from contaminated sediment and or additional inflow of contaminated particles for alpha tocopherol acetate which was only detected associated to particles and not in the water phase a strong correlation r2 0 98 was also only observed for samples from the decreasing discharge limb figure a6 this substance is a widely used pharmaceutical vitamin e that is well removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants mladenov et al 2022 alpha tocopherol acetate may thus serve as tracer for untreated wastewater and combined sewer overflows in the upper catchment of the ammer river moreover all of the 17 detected pahs with tss contaminant relationship show higher particle loadings cparticle with decreasing discharge compared to increasing discharge conditions table a1 riverbed sediment is known to be more contaminated closer to urban inflows into rivers liang et al 2016 schwientek et al 2017 particles arriving at a later time during the decreasing discharge limb therefore likely represent the urban particle signal of the upper catchment our findings indicate that not all hydrophobic contaminants transported during storm events are correlated linearly with tss different contaminant sources contributing to the integrative particle associated contaminant flux during storm events might be inferred from tss contaminant relationships 3 3 relationship between cytotoxicity and tss we hypothesize that the rivers discharge at the catchment outlet integrates various particle and contaminant sources as well as potential thermodynamic disequilibrium of individual substances such that a relationship between tss and the sum of all contaminants can be derived figure a3 depicts the mean tudissolved for all samples no significant difference was found between the medians of the different cell lines after application of the kruskal wallis test p 0 05 thus the tudissolved values obtained from the different cell lines in the same samples are comparable within their error margin therefore we concluded that the mean of the cytotoxicity obtained from different cell lines yields a representative cytotoxicity value to assess whether cytotoxicity constitutes a representative parameter for the detected substances the mixture effect of the detected chemicals tuchem was compared to the observed cytotoxicity tubio by applying iceberg modelling results are exemplarily discussed for the mcf7 and h4iie cell lines and cover samples from both storm events measured ic10 values for the samples can be found in table b5 tubio predicted tuchem and explained effect for the cell lines h4iie and mcf7 can be found in table b6 for the mcf7 cell line arec32 see table b1 17 of the measured 56 compounds were cytotoxic of which 11 were found in the water extracts less than 0 5 of the observed cytotoxicity tubio could be explained by the mixture effect of the detected chemicals tuchem for the h4iie cell line ahr calux see table b1 22 of the detected compounds were cytotoxic of which 11 were found in the water and 15 in the particle extracts in the water phase a maximum of 0 6 of tuchem could explain tubio for the particles however the fraction of tuchem that could explain the tubio was significantly larger with up to 14 8 the small fraction that could explain the observed effect fits very well to previous studies of surface water and particulate matter muz et al 2020 neale et al 2020 the contribution of individual detected compounds to tuchem for the particles and water is displayed in figure a4 and figure a5 respectively for all obtained samples for the water the main mixture effect drivers were p chlorocresol and galaxolide these two substances could explain up to 98 8 of the mixture effect for both cell lines sample e2 p5 figure a5 b and d this finding differs from another study that evaluated rain events in 44 agricultural streams in germany neale et al 2020 where 2 4 dinitrophenol was identified as the main mixture effect driver for the aqueous cytotoxicity obtained from h4iie and carbendazim for the mcf7 cell line this is due to the fact that more compounds were detected 290 in their investigation with a focus on hydrophilic compounds that are expected to be predominantly in the water phase the higher number of detected compounds also resulted in a higher fraction of tuchem that could explain tubio on average 4 1 for ahr could be explained neale et al 2020 the particle extracts of our study suggest that benz a anthracene octocrylene benzo ghi perylene and benzo a pyrene were the main mixture effect drivers for the h4iie cell line and dominated the mixture effect up to 92 8 figure a4 b the large contribution of the pahs to the cytotoxicity is not surprising given the high pah concentration in the river and their high hydrophobicity which leads to high baseline toxicity the uv filter octocrylene was found to be an important mixture effect driver in this study this substance has also been previously detected in many german river sediments kaiser et al 2012 rodil and moeder 2008 and identified as mixture effect driver for the activation of arec32 in german and australian river sediment muz et al 2020 for the particle samples the largest proportion of the detected mixture effect could not be explained 85 figure a4 a most likely due to many compounds that are not included in the target list tutotal calculated with eq 7 from tudissolved and tuparticle correlated linearly with tss r2 0 85 in the river just as tuparticle multiplied with tss tuparticle tss r2 0 81 fig 5 tuparticle obtained from the slope of the regression of 0 091 lbioassay gparticle 1 se 0 009 was very similar to the median tuparticle of the measured samples 0 076 lbioassay gparticle 1 σ 0 17 both particle loadings are in the same order of magnitude which shows that the tuparticle from the tutotal tss correlation is representative for all tuparticle measurements the mixture effect of all compounds associated to particles and in the water phase tuparticle and tudissolved remained constant regardless of the hydrological conditions in the river niu et al 2021 measured the cytotoxicity in the ammer riverbed sediment at different sampling sites in the river network the obtained values were between 0 01 and 503 lbioassay gsediment 1 table b7 this large range shows that tu measurements of the riverbed sediment are highly heterogeneous in the river network tuparticle obtained from the correlation of tutotal with tss however integrates the signal of all particle releasing processes in the catchment but the large variability of previous riverbed sediment mixture toxicity measurements restricts valid statements regarding the integrative measure of the slope for the riverbed sediment the main mixture effect drivers in our study were pahs besides octocrylene but the number of measured pahs 20 is significantly smaller than the number of pahs 100 that exist in the environment therefore the presented results might underestimate the contribution of this substance group to the measured cytotoxicity tubio in general cytotoxicity increases with hydrophobicity lee et al 2021 future research should focus on the role of hydrophobicity of detected compounds for the mixture effect a systematic evaluation of a compounds concentration and potency as a function of the measured mixture effect would allow us to determine if the total mixture effects represent mainly hydrophobic compounds which typically are more potent leading to a larger contribution to tu despite smaller concentrations the extrapolation towards zero from the regression between tutotal and tss leads to a y intercept of 0 042 se 0 006 lbioassay lwater 1 which corresponds to tudissolved as shown in fig 5 this value fits the median of the cell line measurements 0 046 lbioassay lwater 1 σ 0 017 the correlation between tss and tutotal provides insights into the weighting of the bioactive compounds of the respective medium water vs particle in comparison to the sum of bioactive compounds tutotal in the river for this purpose the tss concentration at which tuparticle is equal to tudissolved 50 contribution of both fractions to tutotal was determined using tudissolved derived from the linear regression 0 042 lbioassay lwater 1 and rearranging equation 7 for toxic units leads to a tss value of 0 5 g l 1 for the ammer river below a tss of 0 5 g l 1 50 of tutotal can be explained by bioactive contaminants that dominate in the water fraction tudissolved above a tss of 0 5 g l 1 50 of tutotal can be explained by bioactive compounds attached to the particles a particle concentration of 0 5 g l 1 does not require severe flooding conditions in the ammer river in fact only smaller storm events leading to a river discharge of 9 m3 s 1 data of this study not shown which is 9 times the mean discharge are sufficient to reach this tss value this threshold is not very large considering a high discharge of 11 7 m3 s 1 with a recurrence interval of two years hq2 for the gauging station in pfäffingen https www hvz baden wuerttemberg de pegel html id our results highlight the importance of particle associated mixture effect transport during storm events especially when cytotoxicity is placed in the context of risk assessment for surface water quality monitoring the so called effect based trigger ebt values are a tool to distinguish between poor and acceptable water quality using in vitro bioassays escher and neale 2021 suggest that the ebt for cytotoxicity is defined as 1 of cytotoxicity in any original water sample to define this water as acceptable water quality this value corresponds to an ic10 of 10 concentration that causes 10 reduction of cell viability and growth and is equivalent to tudissolved 0 1 according to this classification the tudissolved of the ammer river 0 042 lbioassay lwater 1 can be classified as acceptable water quality however transferring the ebt to turbid water samples tutotal shows that water quality for tss values larger than 0 6 g l 1 is already classified as poor consequently particle associated contaminant transport is highly relevant for water quality monitoring especially in light of the expected increase in storm events due to climate change ipcc 2018 4 conclusions and implications suspended particles are an important transport pathway for organic contaminants during storm events this study presents a novel approach to get insights into the importance of particle associated contaminant transport during storm events on the catchment scale by measuring organic contaminants as well as the cytotoxicity as a proxy for the total chemical mixture seventeen pahs and two musk fragrance compounds showed a linear correlation with tss concentrations indicating a gradual release of hydrophobic particle associated organic contaminants likely from the riverbed sediment or other sources in the upper catchment not all hydrophobic contaminants exhibited a linear tss contaminant relationship because they may be freshly introduced into the river the river discharge at the catchment outlet thus integrates various particle and contaminant sources our study is the first to show that cytotoxicity correlated linearly with tss during the studied storm events this cytotoxicity tss correlation allows to derive information on the importance of the particle associated mixture effect of all particle bound contaminants present in a river which is of great importance also from a risk assessment perspective for the investigated storm events the cytotoxicity in the water phase did not exceed the proposed effect based trigger values ebt in contrast particle associated cytotoxicity exceeded the ebts indicating poor river water quality we analyzed organic contaminants and cytotoxicity in the particulate and dissolved phases separately given the linear correlation between the sum concentrations and tss and the intercept and slope as a measure of the contribution of the water phase and the suspended solids future investigations may rely on total extractions of the unfractionated water sample thus avoiding time consuming and labor intensive separation of water and particulate phase moreover the toxic potential of metals for cytotoxic effects should be considered furthermore future studies should address river monitoring over larger time spans to cover seasonal variability of stormwater quality this study is based on data from two storm events of summer 2021 repeated investigations at the same sampling site are needed especially since stormwater runoff has been shown to be seasonally highly variable neale et al 2020 moreover different catchments with different land use types should be compared to examine whether cytotoxicity in rivers correlates with agricultural or urban pressures information on the contaminant loads transported in the water versus attached to particles could be obtained from the cumulated effect based contaminant flux e g on an annual basis from a management perspective an assessment of annual loads for both transport media could enhance the development and implementation of control measures to protect aquatic ecosystems from pollution credit authorship contribution statement clarissa glaser conceptualization investigation formal analysis visualization writing original

1893,a reliable estimation of long term change in terrestrial water storage tws is critical for a sustainable management of freshwater resources and infrastructures although the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites provide unprecedented accurate tws anomaly twsa observation since 2002 the limited time span and the gaps between the grace and grace follow on datasets hinder their climatological applications here we apply lightgbm a more accurate and efficient machine learning model to merge the land surface model simulation human activities land properties and establish a dynamic machine learning model that can reasonably depict the impacts of climate variation and human interventions on twsa we apply the hybrid model to reconstruct the historical twsa during 1981 2020 over china which shows reliable results and is consistent with other independent datasets including drought index tws change based on water balance and water withdrawal dataset the reconstructed twsa shows significant drier wetter trend in north south china during the past 40 years while the tws variability has increased over 60 regions we find the change of twsa is mainly attributed to the climate variation in humid regions but the human interventions dominate the decline of twsa in arid and semiarid areas such as the yellow and hai river basins contributing about 70 our findings imply the potential of using artificial intelligence to represent human interventions which is still uncertain in physical models our physical machine learning model can be applied in long term prediction and projection of twsa and its components as well keywords terrestrial water storage human interventions climate change machine learning dynamic model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws including soil moisture groundwater water stored in reservoirs snow ice surface water in rivers and lakes is a critical state variable of global water cycle and freshwater resources its variation not only provides an important indicator for hydrological extreme events such as droughts in india china and africa abhishek et al 2021 ahmed et al 2014 van loon 2015 wu et al 2020 and floods in thailand and china abhishek and kinouchi 2021 long et al 2014 but also provides nontrivial information for long term climate prediction yuan and zhu 2018 zhu et al 2019 as the unique large scale tws anomaly twsa observation the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites scanlon et al 2016 schmidt et al 2006 wahr et al 2004 have provided unprecedented accurate data for hydrological monitoring and processes understanding since their launch in 2002 based on the grace data it is found that due to the joint influences of natural and anthropological factors the spatiotemporal distribution of twsa has varied dramatically in the past 20 years especially over china rodell et al 2018 xu et al 2021 distinguishing the impacts of different factors on long term change of twsa can facilitate sustainable management of water abhishek and kinouchi 2021 wu et al 2020 the grace twsa datasets have been broadly applied in investigating hydrological changes scanlon et al 2018 pointed out the human activities e g irrigation and climate change led to the decrease of tws over 25 basins such as ob volga and yellow river basins but the increases of tws happened over 27 basins such as amazon niger and mississippi river basins which is mostly attributed to climate variations similarly lv et al 2020 found that the increase of irrigation accelerated the depletion of tws over northern china such as yellow and hai river basins which will further intensify in the future jia et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2021 however the ascending trend in the yangtze river basin reflects both the impacts of climate variation and human interventions such as the filling of water conservancy facilities likes the three gorges project chao et al 2021 scanlon et al 2018 the significant increase of the reservoir storage capacity leads to the reduction of runoff and the increases of tws over the yangtze river basin xiong et al 2022b to continue monitoring global twsa change the new generations of grace grace follow on grace fo has been launched since may 2018 although the series of grace observation have played crucial roles in hydrological understanding they are not able to be applied in long term climatological studies due to the limited records 2002 present and the gap between grace and grace fo sun et al 2019 therefore statistical and physical approaches have been widely applied to fill the missing values and extend grace period of observation for example statistical relationships between climate variability and tws were established to reconstruct historical twsa which perform well in reflecting the climate driven change especially in humid regions humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 li et al 2020 similarly land surface models lsms and hydrological models built on dynamic processes are also popular approaches to simulate tws and its components which can efficiently depict the variation of tws under climate change xia et al 2017 however lsms always underestimate both decreasing trends related to human activities and increasing trends related primarily to climate change over global major river basins due to the lack of surface water and groundwater components and inaccurate representation of human intervention in most lsms scanlon et al 2018 recently sun et al 2019 used a data driven method to efficiently correct the mismatch between lsms simulation and grace observation due to the irrigation induced groundwater depletion and generated a more reliable historical dataset of twsa in india this suggests a promising approach to combine lsm simulation and grace observation to study the changes in twsa the rapid developments in artificial intelligence ai have provided black box methods learning from complex and high dimensional data which is suitable for the application where the understanding of the underlying hydrological processes is insufficient sit et al 2020 the trained artificial neural network ann was applied to reasonably fill the gap of grace fo over chao phraya river basins where the impact of human activities is nontrivial abhishek et al 2021 similarly long et al 2014 applied a ann to extend the grace data for a karst plateau in southwest china where the interactions among different tws components are complicated in addition similar method has been used to reconstruct the global historical tws which is reliable in area with humid climate and without human interventions sun et al 2020 besides pure data driven method jing et al 2020 applied a hybrid method in which machine learning is utilized to calibrate lsm simulation to fill the gap of grace observation in nile notwithstanding ai methods perform well in reconstructing historical tws in specific regions there are two defects that are always mentioned firstly although the ai methods can partly learn tws change under human intervention from grace observation it is obvious that human activities are not able to be directly considered which should not be overlooked especially in china where environments have experienced significant changes in the past 40 years due to human activities such as ecological restoration lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 and irrigation liu et al 2022 pan et al 2017 zhang and yuan 2020 in addition the lack of interpretability is another common criticism for the data driven reconstruction of tws to overcome the drawbacks we apply a machine learning model as the bridge to connect lsm land properties and human activities datasets to establish a reliable dynamic machine learning twsa model which can directly learn the impacts of human interventions on twsa from human activities datasets and grace observation meanwhile our hybrid model is more interpretable than pure data driven model because lsm and human activities datasets make the black box more transparent in this study the model is validated and applied to reconstruct 1981 2020 twsa over china and it is applied to investigate the influence of climate change and human interventions on tws change and hydrological extreme events through a series of experiments 2 data and methods 2 1 observation and climate reanalysis datasets the grace and grace fo 0 25 degree mascon products provided by the center for space research csr save et al 2016 are applied as the china twsa observation which spans 19 years from 2002 to 2020 totally 192 months ignoring missing values besides twsa observation the global land surface satellite glass monthly leaf area index lai during 1981 2018 liang et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 and modis version 6 yuan et al 2011 monthly lai datasets during 2018 2020 are chosen as land property input of machine learning model in addition annual land cover lc from esa cci european space agency climate change initiative during 1992 2020 bontemps et al 2013 and xu et al 2020 during 1981 1992 fig 1 a are chosen as the machine learning model input as well which can effectively depict the change of lc in china such as urbanization ecological restoration fig 1 b however due to the existence of systematic deviation between datasets from different sources we use the climatology of overlapping years 2000 2018 for lai and 1992 2015 for lc as the benchmark for bias correction the details are provided in the text s1 the 5th generation of ecmwf reanalysis era5 monthly temperature and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly precipitation during 1981 2020 have been used as the inputs of machine learning models as well comparing to era5 monthly precipitation the gpcc is more accurate fig s5 especially in the northwest because it is derived from gauge observation sun et al 2018 additionally crujra climate research unit and japanese reanalysis climate forcings harris et al 2020 are chosen as the atmospheric drivers for lsm 2 2 survey data we have collected human activities datasets including population irrigation area and gross domestic product gdp 1981 2020 from the national bureau of statistics of china https data stats gov cn and the original gdp has been converted to the real gdp eliminating the impact of inflation chen et al 2022 however since survey datasets are annual provincial data we utilize the gridded datasets including historical irrigation datasets hid siebert et al 2015 gridded population of the world version 4 columbia university 2016 and gridded gdp over china liu et al 2005 as the references and remap the yearbook datasets into the 0 25 degree grid please refer to text s1 for details in addition the gridded water withdrawal dataset over china and reservoirs capacity 1987 2020 from the national bureau of statistics of china have been applied to validate our reconstruction 2 3 land surface model and machine learning model in this study the community land model clm5 is applied to provide long term twsa simulations over china which performs well in depicting the natural hydrological processes lawrence et al 2019 in the clm5 the tws includes snow ice surface water and soil moisture which is divided into 20 hydrologically active layers down to 8 6 m comparing with other lsms the clm5 is able to reliably estimate the change of deep soil moisture although the groundwater is an important component of tws abhishek et al 2021 clm5 removes the aquifer module from clm4 5 because the uncertainty in aquifer dynamic might reduce the accuracy of land surface simulation at a large scale lawrence et al 2019 the model is driven by crujra to provide one degree simulation tws and it is interpolated to 0 25 degrees with bilinear interpolation to reduce the uncertainty of dynamic models the era5 40 year global reanalysis dataset released by china meteorological administration cra40 shen et al 2022 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 kobayashi and iwasaki 2016 are used in our work however because the reanalysis datasets do not provide a standard output variable for tws we sum up terrestrial water components including subsurface water surface water canopy water and snow water equivalent swe to calculate the tws liang et al 2019 similar to the grace we choose the climatology of 2004 2009 to calculate the twsa of clm5 cra40 era5 and jra55 respectively since the grace only provides a monthly observation dataset from 2002 machine learning which does not need too many samples is more appropriate than deep learning the machine learning model lightgbm ke et al 2017 proposed by microsoft is applied in this study as the bond connecting lsm simulation climate variables land properties and human activities datasets fig 2 comparing with other machine learning models it is designed to be more efficient and accurate which is broadly used in climate reconstruction and prediction zhong et al 2021 zhong et al 2022 during the training of machine learning three types of data are usually required namely training set validation set and test set respectively thus we divide 192 month grace observation into three parts of which 36 months july 2008 august 2011 are used as the test set 14 months as the validation set and 142 months as the training set in order to enhance the robustness of the model we conduct 10 fold cross validation through sliding validation set which is widely used in machine learning xiong et al 2022a for example the first fold selects the first 14 months as the validation set and the second fold selects the 14 months observation from 7th to 21st month as the validation set finally we choose the 10 folds mean as the model output because the major hydrological processes might be different in different regions our models are trained independently for 10 major river basins over china respectively fig 1 a i e songhua liao northwest hai huai yellow yangtze southeast pearl southwest river basins https www ncdc ac cn furthermore each 0 25 degree grid in the basin is regarded as a sample to overcome the lack of observation in this study we choose 21 variables as the inputs which can be classified into climate anthropological and land cover factors fig 1 a and their exact names and importance have been listed into table 1 notably we establish different machine learning models for different tws products i e clm5 era5 cra40 and jra55 respectively and the ensemble mean is applied as the reconstruction in this work additionally we have conducted a series of sensitivity analyses about various parameters of lightgbm and we choose the best parameters in our results please refer to test s2 for more detail in general the climate variation has greater impact on tws in humid regions such as southeast and pearl basins fig 1 a while the human interventions and land cover change play more important roles in arid and semi arid areas fig 1 a the human activities such as irrigation and industrial domestic water consumption influence the variation of regional tws through complicated processes which is difficult to be depicted in the dynamic models but can be observed through the grace the hybrid model applies the grace observation as the target and human activities datasets i e population irrigation gdp as the inputs to implicitly present the impact of human interventions on tws to distinguish the natural and anthropogenic impacts on the twsa we utilize our the hybrid model to conduct a series of sensitivity experiments involving human lc 1981 human lc 2020 human 1981 human 2020 lc 1981 and lc 2020 table 2 singh et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 the human lc 1981 represents human interventions i e irrigation population and gdp and lc features i e lai and land cover that are fixed in 1981 therefore only climate variations are able to influence the twsa in the human lc 1981 experiment similarly the human or lc 1981 experiment represents that the human activities or land cover datasets are fixed in 1981 and the changes of climate and land cover or human activities influence the twsa in the experiment the human lc 2020 human 2020 and lc 2020 are similar to the above experiments but are fixed at 2020 through comparing the results of different experiments the anthropogenic effect is able to be quantified over different basins however the change of land cover is influenced by both of natural and anthropogenic factors and we cannot distinguish different impacts on land cover 2 4 others tws including various components of land water is a crucial signal of hydrological drought houborg et al 2012 various hydrological drought indices can be used for cross validation jing et al 2020 different types of indices focusing on different parts of hydrological cycle have been used for different applications for example the set of standardized drought indices originate from the standardized precipitation index spi van loon 2015 which is based on the anomaly of precipitation to identify meteorological and hydrological drought given that precipitation is not the only factor influencing drought standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei involving precipitation and evapotranspiration has been utilized in many studies vicente serrano et al 2010 similar drought indices such as standardized runoff index sri standardized streamflow index ssi and standardized groundwater level index sgi are concerned on hydrological drought conditions but the lack of high quality hydrological measurement always limits the application over a large scale van loon 2015 similar to the spei palmer drought severity index pdsi is another widely used index which reflects agricultural drought conditions ma et al 2014 in this study we choose the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi barichivich et al 2021 which is able to effectively determine long term drought especially at middle latitudes to validate our reconstructed historical tws in pre grace period before 2002 we calculate the twsa drought index wang et al 2020 as following 1 c m 1 n m 1 n m twsa m 2 td i m twsa i m c m 3 tdi i td i x td s td where c m is the monthly climatology m 1 2 3 12 and td i m is twsa deviation td which is obtained by subtracting climatology for month m from twsai m finally the td is normalized by removing the mean td and dividing by standard deviation of td eq 2 besides an observation based global gridded runoff dataset grun ghiggi et al 2019 and evapotranspiration et dataset provided by the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam which maximizes the recovery of evaporation information contained in current satellite observations martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 are applied in our study to calculate the tws change twsc based on the terrestrial water balance eq 4 4 δ t w s i pr i r i et i where the δ t w s i is the monthly tws change twsc of the ith month pr i is the monthly precipitation of the ith month based on era5 r i is the monthly runoff of the ith month based on grun and the monthly et of the ith month are based on gleam datasets the monthly twsc based on water balance are utilized to validate the reconstruction during 1981 2002 as well the reconstructed monthly twsc are based on eq 5 5 δ t w s i tws i 1 tws i where the δ t w s i is the twsc of the i th month the tws i 1 is the reconstructed tws of the i 1th month and the tws i is the reconstructed tws of the i th month zhu and yuan 2021 zhang et al 2018 the contribution of climate variation to the change of twsa and twsa variability is calculated through eq 6 6 contri h l 1981 2016 2020 h l 1981 1981 1985 act 2016 2020 act 1981 1985 where h l 1981 2016 2020 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on human lc 1981 during 2016 2020 h l 1981 1981 1985 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on human lc 1981 during 1981 1985 a c t 1981 2016 2020 a c t 2016 2020 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on actual historical run during 2016 2020 and act 1981 1985 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on actual historical run during 1981 1985 in addition we apply the mann kendall mann 1945 to calculate the long term trend eqs 7 9 7 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 4 n 8 r i 1 i f x i x j 0 i f x i x j j 1 2 i 9 uf k s k e s k var s k k 1 2 n where x i is the twsa at i th month and when the uf k is greater less than 0 the trend is upward downward and when the index exceeds the threshold i e 1 96 in our work it indicated the trend is significant p 0 05 mann 1945 3 results 3 1 reconstruction of historical twsa fig 3 shows the reconstructed historical non seasonal twsa from 1981 to 2020 over different river basins of china and the shaded area is the test set july 2008 to august 2011 the averaged anomaly correlation coefficient acc of the 10 basins over china in test set is 0 68 which is higher than previous works i e humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 we find that the dynamic models and humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 were not able to depict the decline of tws during grace era in semi arid regions such as hai and yellow river basins fig 3 c e which is closely related to the human interventions lv et al 2020 comparing with them our results reasonably capture the feature of long term tws variation e g the decrease in hai and yellow basin and the increase in yangtze basin which is influenced by the climate change and human interventions over different basins li et al 2021 reasonably displays the trends of twsa over different basins during grace era and they extended the trend before grace era i e the green line in fig 3 however due to the impacts of climate change and human interventions the trends are not consistent in different periods especially in china therefore dynamic machine learning hybrid approach which is able to efficiently represent the nonlinear processes has been applied to reliably reconstruct the twsa over china in this work the spatial distribution of acc and root mean square error rmse in the test set also show that our reconstruction performs better than previous products over most of china fig 4 the mean of acc over china is 0 71 and the rmse is 24 78 mm notably the biases of previous products are mainly located over south china north china plain where human interventions are intensive and the groundwater is depleted feng et al 2013 and over south tibet and tianshan area where the tws is dominated by the glacial melting fig 4 b our approach efficiently reduces the rmse and improves the acc over these regions especially in south china to further validate our reconstructed tws in the period of pre grace before 2002 we compare our reconstructed monthly tdi with sc pdsi fig 5 and the acc between them is 0 59 0 86 higher than that of previous reconstructed datasets as well which means our twsa reconstruction reliably depict the twsa variation over different basins in historical periods besides we also applied the twsc based on water budget to validate our historical reconstruction twsa during 1981 2002 fig 6 the averaged acc of our reconstruction is 0 31 over china which is higher than humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 0 01 and li et al 2021 0 02 as well but the acc is smaller in the northwest than other regions which means there is still room for improvement although our reconstruction is able to capture the fluctuations of tws drought fig 5i it is smoother than the grace twsa especially in northwest basin fig 3i due to the uncertainty of monthly precipitation fig s5 and dynamic simulated twsa fig s6 during the training the mean squared error mse and mean absolute error mae are applied as the loss functions in the lightgbm to establish a unified model considering the large uncertainty of precipitation and simulated twsa based on dynamic models the machine learning hybrid model tends to predict smaller amplitude for smaller mse and mae comparing with the era5 gpcc monthly precipitation is more reliable fig s5 because it is derived from quality controlled station data therefore the standard deviation of reconstruction based on gpcc is larger than the reconstruction based on era5 especially in the northwest fig s7 which means it more reasonably capture the fluctuations in the twsa however because of the sparse situ observation in northwest fig s5 the uncertainty of precipitation is still great which lead to the underestimation of fluctuation of twsa especially in the northwest fig 3i generally we deem that our results reliably depict the long term change of tws over china in general the tws increases in humid regions such as pearl southeast and yangtze river basins while it decline in arid and semi arid regions likes yellow hai and huai river basins especially after 2000 s fig 3 compared with the tws during 1981 1985 it has significantly declined in northern china during 2016 2020 while the increase has happened in the southern china and northern tibet fig 7 a moreover the variability standard deviation of tws increases over 60 regions of china including area where tws has decreased a larger variability or standard deviation usually means the extreme events risk may increase fig 7 b 3 2 the driver of tws variation to distinguish the impacts of anthropogenic and natural factors on the change of twsa we conduct a series of sensitivity experiments with and without land cover and human activities change by the hybrid model table 2 the natural experiments nat without land cover and human activities change are to fix the human activities and land covers features in a specific year e g 1981 or 2020 in our study while the actual historical experiment with human activities change refers to our actual reconstructed tws in which all features change with time fig 8 represents the first modes of empirical orthogonal function eof of nat in which human interventions and lc features are fixed in 1981 and clm5 simulation which depicts the climate driven twsa change we find the spatial patterns of them are similar r 0 92 p 0 01 which are related with atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo fig 8 c the other eof modes of the nat resemble the land surface model simulation s modes as well therefore we think our nat experiments are able to efficiently reflect the impact of climate change and exclude the influences of human interventions on the twsa over china in our study the nat involves six experiments human lc 1981 human lc 2020 human 1981 human 2020 lc 1981 and lc 2020 fig 9 table 2 through series of experiments we find that the twsa change is mainly dominated by climate change in songhua where there is no obvious difference between the nat and historical experiments fig 9 a while human activities cause the decline in arid and semi arid regions such as liao hai huai yellow northwest and southwest basins where the tws of human 1981 and human lc 1981 are higher than historical run fig 9 b c d e i and j additionally acc between the withdrawal and tws is about 0 62 p 0 01 over arid and semi arid basins fig 9 which also means the human intervention is the important cause of the twsa decline over these regions however we find the tws has increased significantly in yangtze since 2000 s which is related to human activities especially the three gorges project scanlon et al 2018 xiong et al 2022b although there is no dam information in our dynamic machine learning model the impact of reservoirs can be learned from grace observation and other human activity indices such as the increases of population and real gdp fig s8 similar phenomena have happened in southeast and pearl basins fig s8 where water withdrawal has decline in 2010 s and both of climate change and human intervention cause the slight increase of tws fig 9 g h additionally we compare the trends of historical tws with the nat tws human lc 1981 and the mann kendall mann 1945 is applied to calculate the long term trend fig 10 shows the trend of tws over four typical basins i e northwest yellow yangtze and hai river basins standing for different effects of climate condition and human interventions the results show that climate change is the main reason of the tws increase over northwest from the 1990 s fig 10 a while the human activities and the land cover change lead to the increase of evapotranspiration lv et al 2019 caused the decline of its increase trend in past 10 years i e 2010 2020 fig 10 b meanwhile human interventions and climate change have exacerbated the decline of tws in yellow and hai river basins fig 10 c d g h however human activities lead to the increase in twsa over yangtze especially after 2003 fig 10 e f in addition the human activities reduce the standard deviation of inner annual tws over china fig 11 presents the contribution of climate variation to the difference of tws and tws variability between 1981 1985 and 2016 2020 the negative values represents the change of twsa caused by climate change is different from that of actual tws change we find that the climate variation contributes about 20 to the increase of tws over yangtze basin and over 30 in northern tibet while it mainly leads to the change of tws variability over 60 china except middle of yangtze lower yellow basins northeast and west china fig 11 b 3 3 the change of hydrologcial drought in the last we analyze the change of seasonal drought over china and the influence of human activities on it here we choose 1 5 as the severe drought threshold wang et al 2020 fig 12 comparing with 1981 1985 the frequency of drought has increased over northern china during 2016 2020 while it has decreased in southern china not shown which is similar to the change of tws mainly attributing to human intervention and lc change fig 11 a in fig 12 we present the tdi probability density function pdf over four typical river basins i e songhua yellow yangtze and hai river basins which stand for different climate and human activities characteristics compared with the tdi in 1981 1985 the climate variation and human activities lead to the increase of seasonal drought in songhua while the human activities lead to the decline of severe wet events in 2016 2020 in the yangtze basin the extreme drought events increase due to the climate change but the human interventions have significantly wetted the region and reduced the total drought area duration multiply by area by about 52 fig 10 c yang et al 2020 on the contrary frequent human activities have increased the total drought area in the yellow river and the hai river basin fig 12 b d cheng et al 2021 yang et al 2020 notably the drier climate in northern china such as in yellow and hai river basins might lead to the increase of irrigation which consequently exacerbates the reduction of tws fig 9 c and e 4 discussion in this work we establish a dynamic machine learning model to reasonably depict china historical twsa in this model the lsms simulations are based on clm5 cra40 jra55 and era5 respectively the groundwater is a nontrivial part of tws abhishek et al 2021 but the aquifer module is removed from the clm5 by the model developers due to the uncertainty in aquifer dynamic the era5 jra55 and cra40 do not provide the groundwater output either but our reconstruction is able to reflect the influence of groundwater change implicitly because the actual tws based on grace is incorporated in our hybrid model the high accs between our reconstruction and independent datasets imply that our results reasonably depict the historical variation of twsa in china figs 4 6 additionally the reconstruction can be applied to fill the gap between grace and grace fo july 2017 june 2018 during the gap the time series of twsa from different sources humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 are similar in different basins fig s9 but for the long timescale i e 2002 2020 comparing to humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the hybrid model is able to depict the impacts of human interventions on twsa such as the decrease in semi arid areas and the increase in yangtze basin the huge differences between li et al 2021 and our reconstruction are in the pre grace period before 2002 in li et al 2021 the time series are decomposed into three components involving trend seasonal cycle and residual however due to the climate change and human interventions the trends are different in different periods especially in china therefore using the non linear methods e g ai can more objectively represent the historical variation of twsa over china however there is still room for improvement in our result the acc is lower in the northwest than other regions fig 6 although our reconstruction is able to depict the change of tdi fig 5 it always underestimates the amplitude of twsa in northwest fig 3i due to the uncertainty of climate forcings i e precipitation and simulated twsa by dynamic models i e clm5 era5 cra40 and jra55 comparing with the reconstruction based on era5 the standard deviation reconstruction based on gpcc is larger fig s7 which means it is able to depict the fluctuations in the twsa over northwest because gpcc monthly precipitation is more reliable than era5 fig s5 the reconstruction can be further improved if we have more accurate climate forcings and reliable dynamic models which can reasonably represent the natural variation of tws in northwest furthermore reservoir regulation and groundwater depletion influence regional tws variation through hydrological processes although a high resolution comprehensive geospatial reservoirs dataset is available song et al 2022 there is a lack of publically available gridded historical reservoir capacity data over china in our work the human activities datasets e g irrigation population and gdp is able to implicitly reflect the impact of reservoir regulations over china e g yangtze southeast and hai river basins fig s8 nevertheless more reliable datasets such as historical reservoirs capacities and groundwater depletion are helpful for further improvement of historical tws estimation over basins with intensive human interventions such as north china plain besides the machine learning model lightgbm is applied to establish a hybrid model connecting the dynamic model and human intervention datasets in the hybrid model each column is independent which is similar to most lsms that do not depict the upstream and downstream effects such as lateral flows ji et al 2017 by using deep learning methods such as cnn convolutional neural network transformer and gan generative adversarial networks which have been widely applied in weather forecast ravuri et al 2021 and climate prediction ham et al 2019 it is possible to extract spatial information however deep learning models usually require a large sample of data for training the limited twsa observation i e 192 months makes it not appropriate to apply complex deep learning model in this study 5 conclusions this study applies the state of the art machine learning model lightgbm as the bond connecting the physical lsm land properties and human survey datasets to establish a hybrid twsa model and use the dynamic machine learning model to reconstruct china s twsa in the past 40 years which is able to efficiently reflect the impacts of climate variation and human interventions on twsa the acc and rmse of our reconstruction are 0 71 and 24 78 mm which perform better in the test set than previous works humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 in addition the reconstruction is validated through other independent datasets i e drought index water withdrawal data and twsc based on terrestrial water balance with independent datasets in the pre grace and higher acc mean the reconstruction more reliably depicts the change of twsa over china with the reconstructed historical twsa we find that flooding drought in south north has intensified in china over past 40 years the tws decreases significantly over 43 areas of china which are mainly located in northern china and the tws increases significantly over 28 region which are mainly located in southern china and northern tibet in western china subsequently the hybrid model is applied to conduct series of sensitivity analyses to distinguish the impacts of climate change and human activities on the twsa the results represent that the trend of tws is closely related to the human interventions and land cover change accounting for about 70 while the change of tws variability is closely related to the climate variation frequent human activities have increased the total drought area in semi arid regions but the human interventions such as the filling of water conservancy facilities xiong et al 2022b have significantly wetted yangtze and reduced the total drought area by about 52 besides reconstruction our method can be used in prediction and projection as well recently more researches focus on the predictability of tws and its components on annual inter annual even decadal scale jensen et al 2020 yuan and zhu 2018 zhu et al 2019 but these works were almost based on model simulation which do not accurately depict the impact of human activities therefore the assessment of predictabilities or prediction skills has uncertainty in future our dynamic machine learning model can provide more reasonable long term prediction and projection of tws and its components which not only involves the climate information but also considers the impact of human activities credit authorship contribution statement enda zhu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft yaqiang wang

1893,a reliable estimation of long term change in terrestrial water storage tws is critical for a sustainable management of freshwater resources and infrastructures although the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites provide unprecedented accurate tws anomaly twsa observation since 2002 the limited time span and the gaps between the grace and grace follow on datasets hinder their climatological applications here we apply lightgbm a more accurate and efficient machine learning model to merge the land surface model simulation human activities land properties and establish a dynamic machine learning model that can reasonably depict the impacts of climate variation and human interventions on twsa we apply the hybrid model to reconstruct the historical twsa during 1981 2020 over china which shows reliable results and is consistent with other independent datasets including drought index tws change based on water balance and water withdrawal dataset the reconstructed twsa shows significant drier wetter trend in north south china during the past 40 years while the tws variability has increased over 60 regions we find the change of twsa is mainly attributed to the climate variation in humid regions but the human interventions dominate the decline of twsa in arid and semiarid areas such as the yellow and hai river basins contributing about 70 our findings imply the potential of using artificial intelligence to represent human interventions which is still uncertain in physical models our physical machine learning model can be applied in long term prediction and projection of twsa and its components as well keywords terrestrial water storage human interventions climate change machine learning dynamic model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws including soil moisture groundwater water stored in reservoirs snow ice surface water in rivers and lakes is a critical state variable of global water cycle and freshwater resources its variation not only provides an important indicator for hydrological extreme events such as droughts in india china and africa abhishek et al 2021 ahmed et al 2014 van loon 2015 wu et al 2020 and floods in thailand and china abhishek and kinouchi 2021 long et al 2014 but also provides nontrivial information for long term climate prediction yuan and zhu 2018 zhu et al 2019 as the unique large scale tws anomaly twsa observation the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites scanlon et al 2016 schmidt et al 2006 wahr et al 2004 have provided unprecedented accurate data for hydrological monitoring and processes understanding since their launch in 2002 based on the grace data it is found that due to the joint influences of natural and anthropological factors the spatiotemporal distribution of twsa has varied dramatically in the past 20 years especially over china rodell et al 2018 xu et al 2021 distinguishing the impacts of different factors on long term change of twsa can facilitate sustainable management of water abhishek and kinouchi 2021 wu et al 2020 the grace twsa datasets have been broadly applied in investigating hydrological changes scanlon et al 2018 pointed out the human activities e g irrigation and climate change led to the decrease of tws over 25 basins such as ob volga and yellow river basins but the increases of tws happened over 27 basins such as amazon niger and mississippi river basins which is mostly attributed to climate variations similarly lv et al 2020 found that the increase of irrigation accelerated the depletion of tws over northern china such as yellow and hai river basins which will further intensify in the future jia et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2021 however the ascending trend in the yangtze river basin reflects both the impacts of climate variation and human interventions such as the filling of water conservancy facilities likes the three gorges project chao et al 2021 scanlon et al 2018 the significant increase of the reservoir storage capacity leads to the reduction of runoff and the increases of tws over the yangtze river basin xiong et al 2022b to continue monitoring global twsa change the new generations of grace grace follow on grace fo has been launched since may 2018 although the series of grace observation have played crucial roles in hydrological understanding they are not able to be applied in long term climatological studies due to the limited records 2002 present and the gap between grace and grace fo sun et al 2019 therefore statistical and physical approaches have been widely applied to fill the missing values and extend grace period of observation for example statistical relationships between climate variability and tws were established to reconstruct historical twsa which perform well in reflecting the climate driven change especially in humid regions humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 li et al 2020 similarly land surface models lsms and hydrological models built on dynamic processes are also popular approaches to simulate tws and its components which can efficiently depict the variation of tws under climate change xia et al 2017 however lsms always underestimate both decreasing trends related to human activities and increasing trends related primarily to climate change over global major river basins due to the lack of surface water and groundwater components and inaccurate representation of human intervention in most lsms scanlon et al 2018 recently sun et al 2019 used a data driven method to efficiently correct the mismatch between lsms simulation and grace observation due to the irrigation induced groundwater depletion and generated a more reliable historical dataset of twsa in india this suggests a promising approach to combine lsm simulation and grace observation to study the changes in twsa the rapid developments in artificial intelligence ai have provided black box methods learning from complex and high dimensional data which is suitable for the application where the understanding of the underlying hydrological processes is insufficient sit et al 2020 the trained artificial neural network ann was applied to reasonably fill the gap of grace fo over chao phraya river basins where the impact of human activities is nontrivial abhishek et al 2021 similarly long et al 2014 applied a ann to extend the grace data for a karst plateau in southwest china where the interactions among different tws components are complicated in addition similar method has been used to reconstruct the global historical tws which is reliable in area with humid climate and without human interventions sun et al 2020 besides pure data driven method jing et al 2020 applied a hybrid method in which machine learning is utilized to calibrate lsm simulation to fill the gap of grace observation in nile notwithstanding ai methods perform well in reconstructing historical tws in specific regions there are two defects that are always mentioned firstly although the ai methods can partly learn tws change under human intervention from grace observation it is obvious that human activities are not able to be directly considered which should not be overlooked especially in china where environments have experienced significant changes in the past 40 years due to human activities such as ecological restoration lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 and irrigation liu et al 2022 pan et al 2017 zhang and yuan 2020 in addition the lack of interpretability is another common criticism for the data driven reconstruction of tws to overcome the drawbacks we apply a machine learning model as the bridge to connect lsm land properties and human activities datasets to establish a reliable dynamic machine learning twsa model which can directly learn the impacts of human interventions on twsa from human activities datasets and grace observation meanwhile our hybrid model is more interpretable than pure data driven model because lsm and human activities datasets make the black box more transparent in this study the model is validated and applied to reconstruct 1981 2020 twsa over china and it is applied to investigate the influence of climate change and human interventions on tws change and hydrological extreme events through a series of experiments 2 data and methods 2 1 observation and climate reanalysis datasets the grace and grace fo 0 25 degree mascon products provided by the center for space research csr save et al 2016 are applied as the china twsa observation which spans 19 years from 2002 to 2020 totally 192 months ignoring missing values besides twsa observation the global land surface satellite glass monthly leaf area index lai during 1981 2018 liang et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 and modis version 6 yuan et al 2011 monthly lai datasets during 2018 2020 are chosen as land property input of machine learning model in addition annual land cover lc from esa cci european space agency climate change initiative during 1992 2020 bontemps et al 2013 and xu et al 2020 during 1981 1992 fig 1 a are chosen as the machine learning model input as well which can effectively depict the change of lc in china such as urbanization ecological restoration fig 1 b however due to the existence of systematic deviation between datasets from different sources we use the climatology of overlapping years 2000 2018 for lai and 1992 2015 for lc as the benchmark for bias correction the details are provided in the text s1 the 5th generation of ecmwf reanalysis era5 monthly temperature and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly precipitation during 1981 2020 have been used as the inputs of machine learning models as well comparing to era5 monthly precipitation the gpcc is more accurate fig s5 especially in the northwest because it is derived from gauge observation sun et al 2018 additionally crujra climate research unit and japanese reanalysis climate forcings harris et al 2020 are chosen as the atmospheric drivers for lsm 2 2 survey data we have collected human activities datasets including population irrigation area and gross domestic product gdp 1981 2020 from the national bureau of statistics of china https data stats gov cn and the original gdp has been converted to the real gdp eliminating the impact of inflation chen et al 2022 however since survey datasets are annual provincial data we utilize the gridded datasets including historical irrigation datasets hid siebert et al 2015 gridded population of the world version 4 columbia university 2016 and gridded gdp over china liu et al 2005 as the references and remap the yearbook datasets into the 0 25 degree grid please refer to text s1 for details in addition the gridded water withdrawal dataset over china and reservoirs capacity 1987 2020 from the national bureau of statistics of china have been applied to validate our reconstruction 2 3 land surface model and machine learning model in this study the community land model clm5 is applied to provide long term twsa simulations over china which performs well in depicting the natural hydrological processes lawrence et al 2019 in the clm5 the tws includes snow ice surface water and soil moisture which is divided into 20 hydrologically active layers down to 8 6 m comparing with other lsms the clm5 is able to reliably estimate the change of deep soil moisture although the groundwater is an important component of tws abhishek et al 2021 clm5 removes the aquifer module from clm4 5 because the uncertainty in aquifer dynamic might reduce the accuracy of land surface simulation at a large scale lawrence et al 2019 the model is driven by crujra to provide one degree simulation tws and it is interpolated to 0 25 degrees with bilinear interpolation to reduce the uncertainty of dynamic models the era5 40 year global reanalysis dataset released by china meteorological administration cra40 shen et al 2022 and japanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 kobayashi and iwasaki 2016 are used in our work however because the reanalysis datasets do not provide a standard output variable for tws we sum up terrestrial water components including subsurface water surface water canopy water and snow water equivalent swe to calculate the tws liang et al 2019 similar to the grace we choose the climatology of 2004 2009 to calculate the twsa of clm5 cra40 era5 and jra55 respectively since the grace only provides a monthly observation dataset from 2002 machine learning which does not need too many samples is more appropriate than deep learning the machine learning model lightgbm ke et al 2017 proposed by microsoft is applied in this study as the bond connecting lsm simulation climate variables land properties and human activities datasets fig 2 comparing with other machine learning models it is designed to be more efficient and accurate which is broadly used in climate reconstruction and prediction zhong et al 2021 zhong et al 2022 during the training of machine learning three types of data are usually required namely training set validation set and test set respectively thus we divide 192 month grace observation into three parts of which 36 months july 2008 august 2011 are used as the test set 14 months as the validation set and 142 months as the training set in order to enhance the robustness of the model we conduct 10 fold cross validation through sliding validation set which is widely used in machine learning xiong et al 2022a for example the first fold selects the first 14 months as the validation set and the second fold selects the 14 months observation from 7th to 21st month as the validation set finally we choose the 10 folds mean as the model output because the major hydrological processes might be different in different regions our models are trained independently for 10 major river basins over china respectively fig 1 a i e songhua liao northwest hai huai yellow yangtze southeast pearl southwest river basins https www ncdc ac cn furthermore each 0 25 degree grid in the basin is regarded as a sample to overcome the lack of observation in this study we choose 21 variables as the inputs which can be classified into climate anthropological and land cover factors fig 1 a and their exact names and importance have been listed into table 1 notably we establish different machine learning models for different tws products i e clm5 era5 cra40 and jra55 respectively and the ensemble mean is applied as the reconstruction in this work additionally we have conducted a series of sensitivity analyses about various parameters of lightgbm and we choose the best parameters in our results please refer to test s2 for more detail in general the climate variation has greater impact on tws in humid regions such as southeast and pearl basins fig 1 a while the human interventions and land cover change play more important roles in arid and semi arid areas fig 1 a the human activities such as irrigation and industrial domestic water consumption influence the variation of regional tws through complicated processes which is difficult to be depicted in the dynamic models but can be observed through the grace the hybrid model applies the grace observation as the target and human activities datasets i e population irrigation gdp as the inputs to implicitly present the impact of human interventions on tws to distinguish the natural and anthropogenic impacts on the twsa we utilize our the hybrid model to conduct a series of sensitivity experiments involving human lc 1981 human lc 2020 human 1981 human 2020 lc 1981 and lc 2020 table 2 singh et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 the human lc 1981 represents human interventions i e irrigation population and gdp and lc features i e lai and land cover that are fixed in 1981 therefore only climate variations are able to influence the twsa in the human lc 1981 experiment similarly the human or lc 1981 experiment represents that the human activities or land cover datasets are fixed in 1981 and the changes of climate and land cover or human activities influence the twsa in the experiment the human lc 2020 human 2020 and lc 2020 are similar to the above experiments but are fixed at 2020 through comparing the results of different experiments the anthropogenic effect is able to be quantified over different basins however the change of land cover is influenced by both of natural and anthropogenic factors and we cannot distinguish different impacts on land cover 2 4 others tws including various components of land water is a crucial signal of hydrological drought houborg et al 2012 various hydrological drought indices can be used for cross validation jing et al 2020 different types of indices focusing on different parts of hydrological cycle have been used for different applications for example the set of standardized drought indices originate from the standardized precipitation index spi van loon 2015 which is based on the anomaly of precipitation to identify meteorological and hydrological drought given that precipitation is not the only factor influencing drought standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei involving precipitation and evapotranspiration has been utilized in many studies vicente serrano et al 2010 similar drought indices such as standardized runoff index sri standardized streamflow index ssi and standardized groundwater level index sgi are concerned on hydrological drought conditions but the lack of high quality hydrological measurement always limits the application over a large scale van loon 2015 similar to the spei palmer drought severity index pdsi is another widely used index which reflects agricultural drought conditions ma et al 2014 in this study we choose the self calibrating pdsi sc pdsi barichivich et al 2021 which is able to effectively determine long term drought especially at middle latitudes to validate our reconstructed historical tws in pre grace period before 2002 we calculate the twsa drought index wang et al 2020 as following 1 c m 1 n m 1 n m twsa m 2 td i m twsa i m c m 3 tdi i td i x td s td where c m is the monthly climatology m 1 2 3 12 and td i m is twsa deviation td which is obtained by subtracting climatology for month m from twsai m finally the td is normalized by removing the mean td and dividing by standard deviation of td eq 2 besides an observation based global gridded runoff dataset grun ghiggi et al 2019 and evapotranspiration et dataset provided by the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam which maximizes the recovery of evaporation information contained in current satellite observations martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 are applied in our study to calculate the tws change twsc based on the terrestrial water balance eq 4 4 δ t w s i pr i r i et i where the δ t w s i is the monthly tws change twsc of the ith month pr i is the monthly precipitation of the ith month based on era5 r i is the monthly runoff of the ith month based on grun and the monthly et of the ith month are based on gleam datasets the monthly twsc based on water balance are utilized to validate the reconstruction during 1981 2002 as well the reconstructed monthly twsc are based on eq 5 5 δ t w s i tws i 1 tws i where the δ t w s i is the twsc of the i th month the tws i 1 is the reconstructed tws of the i 1th month and the tws i is the reconstructed tws of the i th month zhu and yuan 2021 zhang et al 2018 the contribution of climate variation to the change of twsa and twsa variability is calculated through eq 6 6 contri h l 1981 2016 2020 h l 1981 1981 1985 act 2016 2020 act 1981 1985 where h l 1981 2016 2020 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on human lc 1981 during 2016 2020 h l 1981 1981 1985 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on human lc 1981 during 1981 1985 a c t 1981 2016 2020 a c t 2016 2020 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on actual historical run during 2016 2020 and act 1981 1985 is the mean or standard deviation of twsa based on actual historical run during 1981 1985 in addition we apply the mann kendall mann 1945 to calculate the long term trend eqs 7 9 7 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 4 n 8 r i 1 i f x i x j 0 i f x i x j j 1 2 i 9 uf k s k e s k var s k k 1 2 n where x i is the twsa at i th month and when the uf k is greater less than 0 the trend is upward downward and when the index exceeds the threshold i e 1 96 in our work it indicated the trend is significant p 0 05 mann 1945 3 results 3 1 reconstruction of historical twsa fig 3 shows the reconstructed historical non seasonal twsa from 1981 to 2020 over different river basins of china and the shaded area is the test set july 2008 to august 2011 the averaged anomaly correlation coefficient acc of the 10 basins over china in test set is 0 68 which is higher than previous works i e humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 we find that the dynamic models and humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 were not able to depict the decline of tws during grace era in semi arid regions such as hai and yellow river basins fig 3 c e which is closely related to the human interventions lv et al 2020 comparing with them our results reasonably capture the feature of long term tws variation e g the decrease in hai and yellow basin and the increase in yangtze basin which is influenced by the climate change and human interventions over different basins li et al 2021 reasonably displays the trends of twsa over different basins during grace era and they extended the trend before grace era i e the green line in fig 3 however due to the impacts of climate change and human interventions the trends are not consistent in different periods especially in china therefore dynamic machine learning hybrid approach which is able to efficiently represent the nonlinear processes has been applied to reliably reconstruct the twsa over china in this work the spatial distribution of acc and root mean square error rmse in the test set also show that our reconstruction performs better than previous products over most of china fig 4 the mean of acc over china is 0 71 and the rmse is 24 78 mm notably the biases of previous products are mainly located over south china north china plain where human interventions are intensive and the groundwater is depleted feng et al 2013 and over south tibet and tianshan area where the tws is dominated by the glacial melting fig 4 b our approach efficiently reduces the rmse and improves the acc over these regions especially in south china to further validate our reconstructed tws in the period of pre grace before 2002 we compare our reconstructed monthly tdi with sc pdsi fig 5 and the acc between them is 0 59 0 86 higher than that of previous reconstructed datasets as well which means our twsa reconstruction reliably depict the twsa variation over different basins in historical periods besides we also applied the twsc based on water budget to validate our historical reconstruction twsa during 1981 2002 fig 6 the averaged acc of our reconstruction is 0 31 over china which is higher than humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 0 01 and li et al 2021 0 02 as well but the acc is smaller in the northwest than other regions which means there is still room for improvement although our reconstruction is able to capture the fluctuations of tws drought fig 5i it is smoother than the grace twsa especially in northwest basin fig 3i due to the uncertainty of monthly precipitation fig s5 and dynamic simulated twsa fig s6 during the training the mean squared error mse and mean absolute error mae are applied as the loss functions in the lightgbm to establish a unified model considering the large uncertainty of precipitation and simulated twsa based on dynamic models the machine learning hybrid model tends to predict smaller amplitude for smaller mse and mae comparing with the era5 gpcc monthly precipitation is more reliable fig s5 because it is derived from quality controlled station data therefore the standard deviation of reconstruction based on gpcc is larger than the reconstruction based on era5 especially in the northwest fig s7 which means it more reasonably capture the fluctuations in the twsa however because of the sparse situ observation in northwest fig s5 the uncertainty of precipitation is still great which lead to the underestimation of fluctuation of twsa especially in the northwest fig 3i generally we deem that our results reliably depict the long term change of tws over china in general the tws increases in humid regions such as pearl southeast and yangtze river basins while it decline in arid and semi arid regions likes yellow hai and huai river basins especially after 2000 s fig 3 compared with the tws during 1981 1985 it has significantly declined in northern china during 2016 2020 while the increase has happened in the southern china and northern tibet fig 7 a moreover the variability standard deviation of tws increases over 60 regions of china including area where tws has decreased a larger variability or standard deviation usually means the extreme events risk may increase fig 7 b 3 2 the driver of tws variation to distinguish the impacts of anthropogenic and natural factors on the change of twsa we conduct a series of sensitivity experiments with and without land cover and human activities change by the hybrid model table 2 the natural experiments nat without land cover and human activities change are to fix the human activities and land covers features in a specific year e g 1981 or 2020 in our study while the actual historical experiment with human activities change refers to our actual reconstructed tws in which all features change with time fig 8 represents the first modes of empirical orthogonal function eof of nat in which human interventions and lc features are fixed in 1981 and clm5 simulation which depicts the climate driven twsa change we find the spatial patterns of them are similar r 0 92 p 0 01 which are related with atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo fig 8 c the other eof modes of the nat resemble the land surface model simulation s modes as well therefore we think our nat experiments are able to efficiently reflect the impact of climate change and exclude the influences of human interventions on the twsa over china in our study the nat involves six experiments human lc 1981 human lc 2020 human 1981 human 2020 lc 1981 and lc 2020 fig 9 table 2 through series of experiments we find that the twsa change is mainly dominated by climate change in songhua where there is no obvious difference between the nat and historical experiments fig 9 a while human activities cause the decline in arid and semi arid regions such as liao hai huai yellow northwest and southwest basins where the tws of human 1981 and human lc 1981 are higher than historical run fig 9 b c d e i and j additionally acc between the withdrawal and tws is about 0 62 p 0 01 over arid and semi arid basins fig 9 which also means the human intervention is the important cause of the twsa decline over these regions however we find the tws has increased significantly in yangtze since 2000 s which is related to human activities especially the three gorges project scanlon et al 2018 xiong et al 2022b although there is no dam information in our dynamic machine learning model the impact of reservoirs can be learned from grace observation and other human activity indices such as the increases of population and real gdp fig s8 similar phenomena have happened in southeast and pearl basins fig s8 where water withdrawal has decline in 2010 s and both of climate change and human intervention cause the slight increase of tws fig 9 g h additionally we compare the trends of historical tws with the nat tws human lc 1981 and the mann kendall mann 1945 is applied to calculate the long term trend fig 10 shows the trend of tws over four typical basins i e northwest yellow yangtze and hai river basins standing for different effects of climate condition and human interventions the results show that climate change is the main reason of the tws increase over northwest from the 1990 s fig 10 a while the human activities and the land cover change lead to the increase of evapotranspiration lv et al 2019 caused the decline of its increase trend in past 10 years i e 2010 2020 fig 10 b meanwhile human interventions and climate change have exacerbated the decline of tws in yellow and hai river basins fig 10 c d g h however human activities lead to the increase in twsa over yangtze especially after 2003 fig 10 e f in addition the human activities reduce the standard deviation of inner annual tws over china fig 11 presents the contribution of climate variation to the difference of tws and tws variability between 1981 1985 and 2016 2020 the negative values represents the change of twsa caused by climate change is different from that of actual tws change we find that the climate variation contributes about 20 to the increase of tws over yangtze basin and over 30 in northern tibet while it mainly leads to the change of tws variability over 60 china except middle of yangtze lower yellow basins northeast and west china fig 11 b 3 3 the change of hydrologcial drought in the last we analyze the change of seasonal drought over china and the influence of human activities on it here we choose 1 5 as the severe drought threshold wang et al 2020 fig 12 comparing with 1981 1985 the frequency of drought has increased over northern china during 2016 2020 while it has decreased in southern china not shown which is similar to the change of tws mainly attributing to human intervention and lc change fig 11 a in fig 12 we present the tdi probability density function pdf over four typical river basins i e songhua yellow yangtze and hai river basins which stand for different climate and human activities characteristics compared with the tdi in 1981 1985 the climate variation and human activities lead to the increase of seasonal drought in songhua while the human activities lead to the decline of severe wet events in 2016 2020 in the yangtze basin the extreme drought events increase due to the climate change but the human interventions have significantly wetted the region and reduced the total drought area duration multiply by area by about 52 fig 10 c yang et al 2020 on the contrary frequent human activities have increased the total drought area in the yellow river and the hai river basin fig 12 b d cheng et al 2021 yang et al 2020 notably the drier climate in northern china such as in yellow and hai river basins might lead to the increase of irrigation which consequently exacerbates the reduction of tws fig 9 c and e 4 discussion in this work we establish a dynamic machine learning model to reasonably depict china historical twsa in this model the lsms simulations are based on clm5 cra40 jra55 and era5 respectively the groundwater is a nontrivial part of tws abhishek et al 2021 but the aquifer module is removed from the clm5 by the model developers due to the uncertainty in aquifer dynamic the era5 jra55 and cra40 do not provide the groundwater output either but our reconstruction is able to reflect the influence of groundwater change implicitly because the actual tws based on grace is incorporated in our hybrid model the high accs between our reconstruction and independent datasets imply that our results reasonably depict the historical variation of twsa in china figs 4 6 additionally the reconstruction can be applied to fill the gap between grace and grace fo july 2017 june 2018 during the gap the time series of twsa from different sources humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 are similar in different basins fig s9 but for the long timescale i e 2002 2020 comparing to humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the hybrid model is able to depict the impacts of human interventions on twsa such as the decrease in semi arid areas and the increase in yangtze basin the huge differences between li et al 2021 and our reconstruction are in the pre grace period before 2002 in li et al 2021 the time series are decomposed into three components involving trend seasonal cycle and residual however due to the climate change and human interventions the trends are different in different periods especially in china therefore using the non linear methods e g ai can more objectively represent the historical variation of twsa over china however there is still room for improvement in our result the acc is lower in the northwest than other regions fig 6 although our reconstruction is able to depict the change of tdi fig 5 it always underestimates the amplitude of twsa in northwest fig 3i due to the uncertainty of climate forcings i e precipitation and simulated twsa by dynamic models i e clm5 era5 cra40 and jra55 comparing with the reconstruction based on era5 the standard deviation reconstruction based on gpcc is larger fig s7 which means it is able to depict the fluctuations in the twsa over northwest because gpcc monthly precipitation is more reliable than era5 fig s5 the reconstruction can be further improved if we have more accurate climate forcings and reliable dynamic models which can reasonably represent the natural variation of tws in northwest furthermore reservoir regulation and groundwater depletion influence regional tws variation through hydrological processes although a high resolution comprehensive geospatial reservoirs dataset is available song et al 2022 there is a lack of publically available gridded historical reservoir capacity data over china in our work the human activities datasets e g irrigation population and gdp is able to implicitly reflect the impact of reservoir regulations over china e g yangtze southeast and hai river basins fig s8 nevertheless more reliable datasets such as historical reservoirs capacities and groundwater depletion are helpful for further improvement of historical tws estimation over basins with intensive human interventions such as north china plain besides the machine learning model lightgbm is applied to establish a hybrid model connecting the dynamic model and human intervention datasets in the hybrid model each column is independent which is similar to most lsms that do not depict the upstream and downstream effects such as lateral flows ji et al 2017 by using deep learning methods such as cnn convolutional neural network transformer and gan generative adversarial networks which have been widely applied in weather forecast ravuri et al 2021 and climate prediction ham et al 2019 it is possible to extract spatial information however deep learning models usually require a large sample of data for training the limited twsa observation i e 192 months makes it not appropriate to apply complex deep learning model in this study 5 conclusions this study applies the state of the art machine learning model lightgbm as the bond connecting the physical lsm land properties and human survey datasets to establish a hybrid twsa model and use the dynamic machine learning model to reconstruct china s twsa in the past 40 years which is able to efficiently reflect the impacts of climate variation and human interventions on twsa the acc and rmse of our reconstruction are 0 71 and 24 78 mm which perform better in the test set than previous works humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 li et al 2021 in addition the reconstruction is validated through other independent datasets i e drought index water withdrawal data and twsc based on terrestrial water balance with independent datasets in the pre grace and higher acc mean the reconstruction more reliably depicts the change of twsa over china with the reconstructed historical twsa we find that flooding drought in south north has intensified in china over past 40 years the tws decreases significantly over 43 areas of china which are mainly located in northern china and the tws increases significantly over 28 region which are mainly located in southern china and northern tibet in western china subsequently the hybrid model is applied to conduct series of sensitivity analyses to distinguish the impacts of climate change and human activities on the twsa the results represent that the trend of tws is closely related to the human interventions and land cover change accounting for about 70 while the change of tws variability is closely related to the climate variation frequent human activities have increased the total drought area in semi arid regions but the human interventions such as the filling of water conservancy facilities xiong et al 2022b have significantly wetted yangtze and reduced the total drought area by about 52 besides reconstruction our method can be used in prediction and projection as well recently more researches focus on the predictability of tws and its components on annual inter annual even decadal scale jensen et al 2020 yuan and zhu 2018 zhu et al 2019 but these works were almost based on model simulation which do not accurately depict the impact of human activities therefore the assessment of predictabilities or prediction skills has uncertainty in future our dynamic machine learning model can provide more reasonable long term prediction and projection of tws and its components which not only involves the climate information but also considers the impact of human activities credit authorship contribution statement enda zhu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft yaqiang wang

1894,in this study we estimated a comprehensive set of extreme precipitation indices defined by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi over north america na using 18 selected higher resolution gcms of the sixth coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the gcms are evaluated in their historical simulations 1981 2010 against those estimated from in situ daymet and reanalysis narr dataasets followed by the projected changes in precipitation extremes of na in response to climate warming ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios of cmip6 in terms of temporal variations spatial distributions seasonal patterns and model agreement over the 21st century relative to 1981 2010 results show that the cmip6 ensemble median cmip6 enm can generally capture the observed extreme precipitation patterns of na and it out performs all 18 individual gcms with negative rmse xy higher r statistics r 0 8 and the signal to noise ratio snr 1 in most sub regions of na in general extreme precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently and severely in the future particularly in latitudes above 55 n of na and in coastal areas in contrast dry conditions in southern na e g nca and sca are projected to intensify over the 21st century seasonal changes are projected to be more significant in winter than in summer for northern na e g gic nwn and nen while in central america e g wna can ena precipitation extremes will likely be less severe in both summer and winter however unlike strong model agreements in high 100 and mid latitudes 80 there is often a wide disparity among the signs of projected changes between gcms in southern na unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced immediately na will likely be vulnerable to the impact of worsening extreme precipitation events especially in northern and coastal regions keywords extreme precipitation events cmip6 climate scenarios north america climate change extreme precipitation indices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the intergovernmental panel on climate change sixth assessment report ipcc 2021 reported an unprecedented warming in each of the last four decades than any previous decade since 1850 that the global mean surface temperature in 2011 2020 has risen by 1 09 0 95 to 1 20 c compared to 1850 1900 unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced immediately the world will probably exceed 1 5 c of warming within the next two decades allen et al 2019 the intensification of extreme precipitation is an expected effect of a warming climate douville et al 2021 aghakouchak et al 2020 it is of high confidence that the increase of global precipitation extremes is about 7 k 1 similar to the moisture increase based on the clausius clapeyron relationship ipcc 2021 li et al 2021 wehner 2020 the intensification of daily extreme precipitation has been observed in north america and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere as well as in many other regions kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 ma et al 2020 zhan et al 2020 zhang and colle 2017 zhou et al 2018 which is expected to worsen as the hydrologic cycle accelerates under global warming impact tabari 2020 leading to a higher risk of major flooding which will significantly impact the ecosystems human societies and also the economy to investigate the hydroclimatic effect of global warming a set of indices has been defined by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi to detect particular characteristics of weather and climate extremes including frequency amplitude and persistency zhang et al 2011 these indices describe extreme meteorological events in a given year or month sillmann et al 2013a srivastava et al 2020 which have been widely used in studies on detection and attribution analysis gan et al 2007 dong et al 2021 kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 liu et al 2021a b regional studies in observational records and future projections akinsanola et al 2020a bai et al 2021 duan et al 2019 kim et al 2020 srivastava et al 2022 as well as the performance examination among climate models fan et al 2020a fan et al 2020b gibson et al 2019 srivastava et al 2022 global climate models gcms have been widely used in climate studies and they have been shown to simulate representative historical climate statistics agel and barlow 2020 zhan et al 2020 moreover gcms are critical tools widely used in predicting mean and extreme climate events akinsanola et al 2020a knutti et al 2008 stouffer et al 2017 zhu and yang 2020 based on gcms and etccdi indices researchers projected a general increase in global scale extreme precipitation events chen et al 2020 li et al 2021 wehner 2020 recently there have been growing numbers of regional analyses on changes to future precipitation extremes based on gcms and etccdi indices duan et al 2019 ge et al 2021 rao et al 2020 xu et al 2019 for example extreme precipitation in california has been projected to increase largely by storms due to atmospheric river berg and hall 2015 huang et al 2020 iturbide et al 2020 gcms were used by akinsanola et al 2020a almazroui et al 2021 and ning and bradley 2016 to project an amplification of heavy precipitation over the eastern us a robust increase in winter precipitation was projected in canada due to the increase in horizontal water vapor flux erler and richard peltier 2016 zhou et al 2018 and teleconnections tan et al 2018 although some future projections have been conducted on extreme precipitation indices by using gcms further study is still needed firstly previous studies of future changes in climate extremes have been based on climate scenarios of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 but now can be conducted using the most recent simulations from gcms of cmip6 eyring et al 2016 and the shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios o neill et al 2014 the new generation of gcms of cmip6 is developed with finer resolutions and improved dynamical processes that address three critical scientific gaps in cmip5 gidden et al 2019 priestley et al 2020 stouffer et al 2017 recent studies show an improvement in the cmip6 ensemble in simulating global climatic extremes agel and barlow 2020 chen et al 2020 with a stronger climate variability than cmip5 models globally fan et al 2020b kim et al 2020 zhu and yang 2020 secondly studies related to the projection of extreme precipitation based on gcms generally focus on some extreme etccdi indices that cannot comprehensively analyze future extreme precipitation in terms of their changes in frequency amplitude and persistency akinsanola et al 2020a bai et al 2021 duan et al 2019 thus research involving all categories of extreme precipitation indices is needed thirdly previous studies are mainly focused on future changes in sub regional e g western na eastern na and the united states lacking analysis of extreme precipitation in the whole na almazroui et al 2021 ma et al 2020 mcafee et al 2011 zhang and colle 2017 given the strong relationship among regions in the changes of extreme precipitation due to the accelerating hydrologic cycle under global warming impact tabari 2020 it is necessary to assess future extreme precipitation in overall na to compare the magnitude and sign of changes among subregions therefore in this study we analyzed projected changes in ten extreme precipitation indices over na and its subregions by using simulations of cmip6 gcms results may contribute to the scientific basis that decision makers can use to frame effective mitigation policies and adaptation planning this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the cmip6 multi model ensembles two observation datasets and the study area section 3 defines extreme precipitation indices and the metrics used in this study while section 4 evaluates the results based on projections of 18 gcms of cmip6 the distributions temporal evolutions and spatial variabilities of extreme precipitation indices seasonal patterns and climate model agreements summary of results and conclusions are given in section 5 2 data 2 1 cmip6 simulations daily precipitation data of cmip6 simulated by some selected gcms over 1981 2100 are obtained from the earth system grid data distribution portal esg https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 the gcms of cmip6 are selected for this study if 1 the nominal model resolution is between 100 km and 250 km because gcms of higher resolutions should simulate more representative precipitation extreme events than gcms of coarser resolutions bador et al 2020 chen et al 2020 and 2 model outputs should be available for both historical experiments and three future ssp emissions scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 to compare the extreme precipitation projected by the selected gcms under the possible impact of climate warming in addition only extreme precipitation data projected by the first ensemble member of each gcm i e r1i1p1f1 is assessed to avoid unfair comparison among the gcms kim et al 2020 priestley et al 2020 in this study we have selected a total of 18 gcms of cmip6 table s1 provides the name institutions nominal model resolution and experimental run information of all the gcms selected for this study 2 2 observed precipitation data given uncertainties inevitably exist in most if not all observational products due to different data sources and processing algorithms akinsanola et al 2020a herold et al 2017 an in situ and a reanalysis observed precipitation datasets are used to comprehensively evaluate the ensemble performance of precipitation extremes simulated by the 18 selected gcms of cmip6 over the historical period of 1981 2010 the daymet version 4 data product is an in situ based gridded dataset supported by the national aeronautics and space administration of usa nasa in daymet the latest observed station datasets of daily weather and climatology variables are interpolated to a high 1 km spatial resolution over na starting from 1980 thornton et al 2021 the gauge distribution of daymet is show in supplementary material fig s 1 the north american regional reanalysis narr dataset produced by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep provides daily precipitation data at a 32 km resolution since 1979 mesinger et al 2006 these two datasets have been successfully used in evaluating model simulated extreme precipitation in certain regions of na e g ashfaq et al 2016 dong et al 2019 liu et al 2017 srivastava et al 2022 1981 to 2010 is chosen as the reference period for evaluating selected gcms of cmip6 because this 30 year period is the baseline climate normal period recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo as the most representative of current climatic conditions wmo 2019 furthermore many recent studies dosio et al 2019 iturbide et al 2020 spinoni et al 2018 based on the sixth assessment report ar6 of ipcc also choose this period as the baseline climate normal period the projected impact of climate warming relative to the historical period of 1981 2010 is assessed over two future periods the 2050s 2041 2070 and the 2080s 2071 2100 2 3 study area according to the reference regions in the ipcc ar6 iturbide et al 2020 north america is divided into eight climate homogenous areas such as nwn nw north america nen ne north america and others as shown in fig 1 since these reference regions are widely used in various recent studies on the analysis of cmip6 simulations we have conducted this study using the same reference regions in na so that we can compare our results with other related studies on ar6 of ipcc e g kim et al 2020 3 research methodology the effects of climate warming to the future extreme precipitations of na are evaluated in terms of ten selected precipitation indices of etccdi to assess projected changes in precipitation intensities maximum rainfall depth over 1 to consecutive 5 days durations of consecutive wet and dry days etc as explained below 3 1 extreme climate indices following the etccdi ten precipitation indices are analyzed in this study see supplementary material table s 2 which can be grouped under four basic categories 1 absolute precipitation indices are maximum 1 day rx1day or 5 day precipitation rx5day for both annual or monthly time scales high values of rx1day could result in flash floods expected to cause damages and hazards to municipal infrastructure transportation networks and others while high rx5day could lead to large scale river flooding resulting in extensive and long term damages 2 duration indices are consecutive dry cdd and wet days cwd that respectively represent the maximum number of consecutive days with daily precipitation amount 1 mm cdd or 1 mm cwd in a year therefore cdd and cwd are the indices representing the durations of dry and wet spells 3 threshold indices r10mm or r20mm are the number of days with more than 10 mm or 20 mm precipitation which represent the frequency of heavy precipitation and very heavy precipitation respectively at an annual or monthly time scales 4 percentile indices are the r95p and r99p indices that measure the total precipitation per year from wet day pr 1 mm with precipitation above the 95th and 99th percentile daily precipitation respectively for 1981 2010 r95p represents very wet days while r99p represents extremely wet days 5 total wet day precipitation prcptot at annual and monthly time scales and the simple daily intensity sdii index on wet days pr 1 mm at annual time scale all indices are computed on an annual basis but some are also computed on monthly basis e g rx1day rx5day r10mm r20mm and prcptot the extreme precipitation indices are first estimated for the original grids of gcms using the r package climpact2 at https github com arccss extremes climpact and then bilinearly interpolated into a common 1 1 resolution using the climate data operators cdo at https code mpimet mpg de projects cdo therefore the cmip6 ensemble median cmip6 enm for a specific index is the median at each 1 1 grid interpolated from the simulations of 18 cmip6 models over the na grids 3 2 model performance metrics the performance of cmip6 gcms has been evaluated using the root mean squared error rmse statistics in recent studies at both global and regional scales kim et al 2020 sillmann et al 2013a srivastava et al 2020 xu et al 2019 the annual spatially averaged extreme precipitation index simulated by gcms is evaluated against corresponding observed datasets daymet and narr for 1981 2010 using rmse xy defined as 1 rmse xy x y 2 where x and y represent the extreme precipitation index simulated by a gcm of cmip6 and the observed dataset at a grid point respectively the angular brackets represent the mean for all grids points over na rmse xy is the difference between individual model including cmip6 enm rmse xy and rmse median median error of an index for 18 gcms that provides an indication of the performance of gcms of cmip6 with respect to observations rmse xy is defined as 2 rmse xy rmse xy rmse median rmse median thus for an extreme precipitation index a negative rmse xy indicates that the corresponding model performs better than the majority 50 of cmip6 gcms similarly a positive rmse xy indicates that the corresponding model performs poorer than the majority 50 of cmip6 gcms snr is the signal to noise ratio that indicates the credibility of a gcm s projection at a grid point 3 snr x e 1 n i 1 n x i x e 2 where x i represents the index simulated by an individual gcm while x e is the corresponding index of cmip6 enm and n is the ensemble size n 18 in a statistical sense the numerator and denominator represent the signal and the noise respectively snr 1 implies that the signal is greater than the noise indicating relatively reliable projections and vice versa 3 3 projected changes in future extreme precipitation projected changes of extreme precipitation indices in two periods the 2050s and 2080s relative to the baseline 1981 2010 are calculated as follows when indices units are mm 4 relative c h a n g e index future index baseline index baseline 100 when indices units are days 5 relative c h a n g e d a y s index future index baseline 4 results 4 1 performance of global climate models of cmip6 portrait diagrams in fig 2 provides an assessment of the performance of 18 cmip6 gcms in na in simulating ten extreme precipitation indices such as cdd cwd prcptot r10mm etc with reference to the observed daymet fig 2a and narr dataset fig 2b model performances in 8 subregions are show in supplementary material fig s 2 negative positive values shown in blue red indicate that the gcm performs better poorer than the majority 50 of selected gcms the assessment results in the simulations of gcms are based on the assumption that the observed dataset is correct even though observed data inevitably has some uncertainty due to the limitations of ground observation three gcms ec earth3 taiesm1 and noresm2 mm perform relatively well with the most negative rmse xy in fig 2 part of the reason is that higher resolution climate models generally perform better in simulating observed extreme precipitation than models with coarser resolutions agel and barlow 2020 in contrast ipsl cm6a lr and fgoals g3 show relatively weak performance with many positive rmse xy because they generally overestimate the change of extreme precipitation due to their coarser resolution as also found in previous studies ge et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 however cmip6 enm show negative rmse xy for all indices indicating that the cmip6 enm is more robust than precipitation events simulated by individual gcms in both na and 8 subregions fig s 2 because as the median at each grid interpolated from the simulations of 18 cmip6 models over the na grids cmip6 enm could cancel some of the simulation errors either over or under simulations in individual climate models fig 3 compares spatial distributions of seven extreme precipitation indices of the cmip6 ensemble median and observations over na for 1981 2010 results of r20mm rx1day and r99p are shown in supplementary material fig s 3 the spatial distributions for seven extreme precipitation indices of na for the historical period are statistically significant snr 1 over almost the entire na except for some uncertainty in gic for r10mm fig 3b3 and uncertainty in northern and western na for r20mm fig s 3 a3 and r99p fig s 3 c3 there is an obvious discontinuity between the narr dataset at the canada u s border because relatively less number and lower resolution of climate station data is assimilated for canada than those for the united states zhou et al 2018 results show that cmip6 enm could well reproduce the historical spatial patterns of observed precipitation events precipitation extremes represented by three datasets features a tend to concentrate mainly in the pacific northwest eastern the united states and the gulf of mexico which are relatively wet in contrast to the arctic gic and central na east of the rocky mountains which are relatively dry on the other hand central america such as nca and sca can experience both dry and wet spells represented by both high cdd and high cwd prcptot r10mm and rx5day in these regions as expected high latitude regions e g gic show dry climatology with high value in cdd and low values in other indices the spatial correlations between the 3 datasets cmip6 enm daymet cmip6 enm narr daymet narr on precipitation extremes fig 4 show a strong and consistent agreement between the cmip6 enm and two observed data since the statistics r are bigger than 0 8 for most precipitation indices however the spatial correlation of the consecutive wet days cwd index between cmip6 enm narr and daymet is relatively low low may because cmip6 enm and narr are both climate model based data which tends to simulate more frequent but less intensive precipitation e g drizzle due to model limitations i e model physics spatial averaging compared to the station dataset argüeso et al 2013 this over simulated light rain in climate models is inevitable and tends to overestimate cwd which is the largest number of consecutive days when daily precipitation is bigger than 1 mm which has been widely reported in previous studies e g duan et al 2019 stephens et al 2010 4 2 temporal evolution of precipitation extremes fig 5 shows the projected changes of ten spatially averaged extreme precipitation indices from 1981 to 2100 except for cdd extreme precipitation indices are projected to consistently increase over the twenty first century rx1day rx5day and prcptot are projected to increase by about 10 14 and 24 in 2100 under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively indicating a projected increase in the depth of short duration extreme precipitation under ssp5 8 5 scenarios the largest projected change is found in r99p 170 followed by r95p 77 that are far greater than prcptot implying the growing contributions of extreme precipitation to the total precipitation in the future additionally the projected increase of sdii is relatively smaller than that of prcptot because the frequency of rainy days is also projected to increase however projected median changes in the above indices are not distinguishable under three ssp emission scenarios before 2040 but the projections diverge over time after that with the most significant changes under ssp5 8 5 furthermore ensemble model simulations over the 25th 75th quantiles are projected to expand with time and remain overlapped between all ssps indicating the growing uncertainty of model simulations as cmip6 gcms project the climate to the distant future fig 6 is the distributions of grids showing the projected changes in percentage for ten extreme precipitation indices of cmip6 enm over na for the 2050s dash line and 2080s solid line although there are some projected negative changes 0 projected positive change dominate most grids for r10mm r20mm rx1day rx5day r95p r99p prcptot and sdii for both the 2050s and 2080s with a right shift in the distributions of grids under higher ssp emission scenarios the grids have similar distributions between the 2050s and the 2080s under the ssp1 2 6 scenarios but the distribution of grids become flatter and spread over wider ranges under ssp5 8 5 likely implying a larger interannual variability under higher projected radiative forcings of higher ssp emission scenarios in particular moving from ssp1 2 6 to ssp5 8 5 scenarios r95p and r99p tends to become more and more skewed towards the right with more elongated upper tails suggesting a growing projection of extreme events as climate warming worsens although the projected changes in fig 5 in cdd and cwd are not as sensitive to the effects of climate warming as the other precipitation indices the density distributions centered at the zero in fig 6 means are projected to spread over a wider range of cdd and cwd under higher emission scenarios partly due to their larger spatial variability the projected responses of these two indices differ from region to region across na but on a whole they are less sensitive to the effect of climate warming as reported in previous studies akinsanola et al 2020b sillmann et al 2013a 4 3 projected spatial changes in precipitation extremes relative changes of the spatially distributed extreme precipitation indices and their zonal means of cmip6 enm under three ssps emission scenarios in the 2080s are shown in fig 7 precipitation extremes are projected to become more severe over most na in the 2080s relative to the baseline period all indices are projected to progressively increase in magnitude under the larger radiative forcing of higher emission scenarios especially the ssp5 8 5 scenarios the projected percentage increase of cwd rx1day supplementary material fig s 4 b rx5day and r95p prcptot sdii are statistically significant snr 1 over the entire na and their zonal mean increases are higher in latitudes above 55 n of na than in lower latitudes for example under ssp5 8 5 rx5day is projected to increase by about 15 between 15 n and 55 n but by about 35 between 55 n and 80 n the change of heavy precipitation r10mm and r20mm supplementary material fig s 5 are projected to occur more frequently in coastal areas between 40 n and 70 n as many as 7 days and 3 days zonal mean average under ssp5 8 5 at around 60 n of na however among all the extreme precipitation indices selected for this study the consecutive dry days cdd is the only etccdi index that is projected to decrease by ssp forcings for zonal mean values in latitudes above 55 n in addition significant decreases in cdd are also detected in california and nevada likely attributed to the thermodynamic moistening of air as alpine snowmelt accelerates under climate warming huang et al 2020 iturbide et al 2020 sun et al 2019 southern regions especially mexico and texas are projected to experience a significant increase in cdd which corresponds to generally projected decrease in other precipitation indices implying meteorological droughts in these regions will likely intensify in between wna and southern nwn of na e g oregon washington and southern british columbia cdd r10mm and r95p are all projected to increase which means that both extreme precipitation events and droughts will become more severe or hydrologic extremes will worsen under the impact of climate warming gaur et al 2021 4 4 seasonal patterns using boxplots fig 8 presents the range of projected changes of 18 gcms for prcptot r10mm and rx5day between summer jja and winter djf over eight subregions of na in the 2080s results for r20mm and rx1day are shown in supplementary material fig s 5 in upper northern latitude regions such as gic nwn and nen relative changes of prcptot and rx5day are projected to be more pronounced in winter than in summer for example in gic the largest increase of prcptot rx5day in winter is 250 115 compared to 55 50 in summer on the other hand seasonal differences between winter and summer in the relative changes of prcptot and rx5day in central america e g nca and sca are minimal because the ensemble median of both indices cmip6 enm are only projected to decrease marginally in both seasons however relative projected changes of r10mm are more homogeneous and positive in winter than in summer given regional changes in r10mm of cmip6 enm ranges from 1 to 1 5 days in djf compared with 7 to1 5 days in jja in particular the median r10mm and r20mm fig s 5c for winter is virtually unchanged in gic since in winter the 10 mm and r20mm threshold is rarely exceeded in this region the most significant change of r10mm 17 days is projected in the lowest northern latitude regions e g sca in summer under ssp5 8 5 for the middle northern latitude regions of na such as wna cna and ena prcptot rx5 day and r10mm are all projected to increase in winter but only minor positive change is projected in the summer 5 or even less than zero depending on the ssps 4 5 model agreement to compare regional responses to different ssp scenarios annual extreme precipitation indices for the 8 sub regions of na over the 2080s based on the simulations of 18 individual gcms and their ensemble median are presented in fig 9 in terms of data points and bar plots respectively results over the 2050s are shown in supplementary material fig s 6 we assess the agreements between the 18 gcms of cmip6 by comparing how many gcms in agree on the sign of ensemble mean changes cmip6 enm projected for ten indices over the 8 sub regions of na in general precipitation extremes in cmip6 enm are projected to progressively becoming more severe towards the end of the twenty first century the 2080s the gcms of cmip6 unanimously agree 100 agreement on the increase in precipitation extremes over high latitude regions such as gic nwn and nen while in wna cna and nca model agreements vary between the indices for example rx1day rx5day r95p r99p that represent thresholds and block maximum extremes respectively are all projected to increase with 100 model agreements in central na given the consistent projections between all 18 gcms there is a strong confidence that extreme precipitation events will very likely become more severe under the impact of climate warming in central na in comparison model agreements are about 80 in terms of r10mm r20mm and prcptot in middle northern latitude of na for lower latitude of na e g nca and sca gcms disagree on the sign and magnitude of projected changes in extreme precipitation for at least one of the three ssp scenarios especially for r10mm r20mm and sdii except for some major differences ranging from 2 to 37 days between gcms in sca southern mexico it seems that cwd in other parts of na will only experience minimal changes until the 2080s however the projected increase decrease in cdd generally coincides with the projected decrease increase in r10mm r20mm and prcptot such that cdd is projected to decrease in high latitude regions with 100 model agreement while increasing in central america with only some limited disagreements in nca northern mexico under ssp1 2 6 on a whole there is a low confidence that southern na will become progressively drier over the 21st century but as we move north across na there is high confidence that na will become wetter and wetter over the 21st century ipcc 2021 among the 18 gcms of cmip6 selected in this study some projections deviate significantly from the ensemble medians which indicate that climate model uncertainties could affect the results on future extreme precipitation for na obtained from the three ssp scenarios of cmip6 for example the gcm ipsl cm6a lr of institut pierre simon laplace france projected the largest decrease for cwd r10mm prcptot sdii rx5day and r95p over sca this could be attributed to the bias in dryness of ipsl cm6a lr associated with its negative sea surface temperature bias in the equatorial pacific boucher et al 2020 in contrast in gic the ec earth3 gcm projected the most severe extreme precipitation indices for the 2080s including prcptot 190 sdii 39 rx5day 115 and r95p 670 partly because this gcm over simulated the amplitude of global mean precipitation patterns and the volume of arctic sea ice resulting in a fast reinforcement in the amplitude of precipitation as warming increases döscher et al 2022 5 discussion and conclusion in this study we assess the projected spatial and temporal changes in extreme precipitation of na over the 21st century based on the projections of 18 gcms of cmip6 and the performance of these gcms over the historical period of 1981 2010 over na with respect to in situ measurements daymet and reanalysis data narr the analysis of these changes in precipitation extremes is based on the ensemble median of these selected gcms of cmip6 the following summarizes the main conclusions 1 compared with previous studies conducted in different regions ge et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 cmip6 enm could reasonably reproduce the spatial patterns of observed precipitation events and should be representative and reliable over the future periods because 10 etccdi extreme precipitation indices simulated by the cmip6 enm out performs all 18 individual gcms with negative rmse xy over na fig 2 and 8 subregions fig s 2 the signal to noise ratio snr 1 fig 3 and higher r statistics r 0 8 fig 4 in most sub regions of na in contrast to results simulated by cmip5 gcms sillmann et al 2013a gcms of cmip6 agree better with observations represented by narr and daymet this indicates an improvement in the cmip6 models in simulating observed precipitation characteristics partly because cmip6 gcms generally are of higher spatial resolutions than cmip5 models however gcms inevitably over simulate light rain e g drizzle compared to observations resulting in an overestimated cwd this is a common problem that has not been significantly improved in cmip6 models duan et al 2019 stephens et al 2010 srivastava et al 2020 the parameterization of physical processes may play a role in improving the model performance which needs to be further investigated sillmann et al 2013a 2 projected changes to extreme precipitation indices in response to a different level of climate warming ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios are similar to each other before 2040 unanimous agreements between gcms especially in high latitude regions but the difference in projected changes based on the three ssp scenarios progressively become larger and larger towards the end of the twenty first century 2080s as expected fig 5 the temporal changes in extreme precipitation are similar to the changes in global surface air temperature due to increasing radiative forcing patterns as reported in chapter 4 of ar6 lee et al 2021 which can be assumed that the intensification of extreme precipitation in na is directly influenced by global warming the magnitude of changes in extreme precipitation indices depends on the index type sillmann et al 2013b for example higher increase is projected in the percentile indices r95p and r99p compared with prcptot indicating a projected increase in the future contribution of extreme precipitation to the total precipitation moreover it is of high confidence that the response of extreme precipitation in na to the impact of global warming will continue to be amplified throughout the 21st century fig 6 and the magnitude is bigger in cmip6 ensembles than in cmip5 models ipcc 2021 3 extreme precipitation of na will likely occur more severely over the 21st century especially in latitudes above 55 n of na and coastal areas under the ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios represented by larger projected decrease in cdd and larger increase in other indices this is not a surprise because according to the clausius clapeyron scaling atmospheric humidity is expected to increase at about 7 c of warming particularly in higher latitude regions where warming is projected to become higher a phenomenon commonly known as the arctic amplification liu et al 2021a b stjern et al 2019 the spatial patterns shown in fig 7 reveal that at middle latitudes in between wna and southern nwn of na e g oregon washington and southern british columbia where both extreme precipitation events and droughts are projected to become more severe at lower latitudes especially in mexico and texas projections of indices imply meteorological droughts in these regions will likely intensify e g projected increase in cdd and decrease in other indices in addition coastal regions are also prone to the occurrences of more extreme precipitation the high elevations of the rocky mountains and the pacific northwest are mainly fueled by landfalling atmospheric rivers ars that transport more water vapor from the pacific ocean liu et al 2021a b lora et al 2017 ma et al 2020 while precipitation extremes in the eastern coastland are primarily attributed to the higher intensity cyclone relative frontal precipitation bishop et al 2019 zhang and colle 2017 4 seasonal changes in northern latitude such as gic nwn and nen and middle latitude regions e g wna cna and ena are projected to experience more pronounced changes in precipitation extremes in winter than in summer this may result from the northward migration storm and expanded subtropical high that contributes to decreasing subtropical precipitation and increasing high latitude precipitation in summer maloney et al 2014 mcafee et al 2011 zhou et al 2022 meanwhile atmospheric rivers as well as some large climate patterns e g the madden julian oscillation and the north atlantic oscillation are related to more intensive storms and more precipitation in winter dong et al 2018 liu et al 202a b lora et al 2017 ma et al 2020 ning and bradley 2016 on the other hand changes between winter and summer in lower latitudes of na e g nca and sca agree with the cmip5 results that precipitation seasonality will decrease with decreasing trends in both winter and summer suggesting a more severe arid future sillmann et al 2013b 5 with regard to model agreement cmip6 climate models consistently project that precipitation extremes of na will progressively become more severe towards the end of the twenty first century the 2080s with 100 agreement for all indices over high latitude regions such as gic nwn and nen there is more than 80 agreement between climate models projections for all indices over middle latitude regions such as wna cna and ena however there is low confidence less than 60 that some indices in lower latitudes of na such as nca and sca indicate progressively wetter conditions over the 21st century ipcc 2021 climate models that e g ipsl cm6a lr perform poorly in simulating observed extreme precipitation generally deviate from the ensemble medians in projecting future extreme precipitation indices due to their coarser resolutions however models with finer resolutions e g ec earth3 generally project very severe extreme precipitation indices which may be partly because high values are not easy to smoothen by data resampling oubeidillah et al 2014 future research is still needed to explore the influence of the gcms resolutions in simulating observed climate extremes in conclusion based on results obtained from the projections of 18 gcms of cmip6 for na there is high confidence that extreme precipitation will likely occur more frequently with greater severity especially in high latitudes and coastal regions of na these variations will contribute to more severe natural hazards such as floods droughts and wildfires which may not only threaten water storage conveyance and flood control infrastructure but also challenge the regional food supply which will affect the social stability cmip6 results will help us to develop adaptive measures to mitigate the potential impact of these changes in precipitation extremes to reduce the vulnerability of some parts of north america such as the canadian prairies against the impact of droughts and floods and possible structural and non structural measures against future hazards in floods and droughts besides the impact of climate warming the extreme precipitation in some parts of na has been shown to be related to the effect of climate anomalies such as el niňo southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation north atlantic oscillation arctic oscillation and others e g gan et al 2007 islam and gan 2015 ning and bradley 2016 tan et al 2017a tan et al 2017b future research should investigate the combined impact of climate warming and climate anomalies to the future

1894,in this study we estimated a comprehensive set of extreme precipitation indices defined by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi over north america na using 18 selected higher resolution gcms of the sixth coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the gcms are evaluated in their historical simulations 1981 2010 against those estimated from in situ daymet and reanalysis narr dataasets followed by the projected changes in precipitation extremes of na in response to climate warming ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios of cmip6 in terms of temporal variations spatial distributions seasonal patterns and model agreement over the 21st century relative to 1981 2010 results show that the cmip6 ensemble median cmip6 enm can generally capture the observed extreme precipitation patterns of na and it out performs all 18 individual gcms with negative rmse xy higher r statistics r 0 8 and the signal to noise ratio snr 1 in most sub regions of na in general extreme precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently and severely in the future particularly in latitudes above 55 n of na and in coastal areas in contrast dry conditions in southern na e g nca and sca are projected to intensify over the 21st century seasonal changes are projected to be more significant in winter than in summer for northern na e g gic nwn and nen while in central america e g wna can ena precipitation extremes will likely be less severe in both summer and winter however unlike strong model agreements in high 100 and mid latitudes 80 there is often a wide disparity among the signs of projected changes between gcms in southern na unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced immediately na will likely be vulnerable to the impact of worsening extreme precipitation events especially in northern and coastal regions keywords extreme precipitation events cmip6 climate scenarios north america climate change extreme precipitation indices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the intergovernmental panel on climate change sixth assessment report ipcc 2021 reported an unprecedented warming in each of the last four decades than any previous decade since 1850 that the global mean surface temperature in 2011 2020 has risen by 1 09 0 95 to 1 20 c compared to 1850 1900 unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced immediately the world will probably exceed 1 5 c of warming within the next two decades allen et al 2019 the intensification of extreme precipitation is an expected effect of a warming climate douville et al 2021 aghakouchak et al 2020 it is of high confidence that the increase of global precipitation extremes is about 7 k 1 similar to the moisture increase based on the clausius clapeyron relationship ipcc 2021 li et al 2021 wehner 2020 the intensification of daily extreme precipitation has been observed in north america and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere as well as in many other regions kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 ma et al 2020 zhan et al 2020 zhang and colle 2017 zhou et al 2018 which is expected to worsen as the hydrologic cycle accelerates under global warming impact tabari 2020 leading to a higher risk of major flooding which will significantly impact the ecosystems human societies and also the economy to investigate the hydroclimatic effect of global warming a set of indices has been defined by the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi to detect particular characteristics of weather and climate extremes including frequency amplitude and persistency zhang et al 2011 these indices describe extreme meteorological events in a given year or month sillmann et al 2013a srivastava et al 2020 which have been widely used in studies on detection and attribution analysis gan et al 2007 dong et al 2021 kirchmeier young and zhang 2020 liu et al 2021a b regional studies in observational records and future projections akinsanola et al 2020a bai et al 2021 duan et al 2019 kim et al 2020 srivastava et al 2022 as well as the performance examination among climate models fan et al 2020a fan et al 2020b gibson et al 2019 srivastava et al 2022 global climate models gcms have been widely used in climate studies and they have been shown to simulate representative historical climate statistics agel and barlow 2020 zhan et al 2020 moreover gcms are critical tools widely used in predicting mean and extreme climate events akinsanola et al 2020a knutti et al 2008 stouffer et al 2017 zhu and yang 2020 based on gcms and etccdi indices researchers projected a general increase in global scale extreme precipitation events chen et al 2020 li et al 2021 wehner 2020 recently there have been growing numbers of regional analyses on changes to future precipitation extremes based on gcms and etccdi indices duan et al 2019 ge et al 2021 rao et al 2020 xu et al 2019 for example extreme precipitation in california has been projected to increase largely by storms due to atmospheric river berg and hall 2015 huang et al 2020 iturbide et al 2020 gcms were used by akinsanola et al 2020a almazroui et al 2021 and ning and bradley 2016 to project an amplification of heavy precipitation over the eastern us a robust increase in winter precipitation was projected in canada due to the increase in horizontal water vapor flux erler and richard peltier 2016 zhou et al 2018 and teleconnections tan et al 2018 although some future projections have been conducted on extreme precipitation indices by using gcms further study is still needed firstly previous studies of future changes in climate extremes have been based on climate scenarios of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 but now can be conducted using the most recent simulations from gcms of cmip6 eyring et al 2016 and the shared socioeconomic pathway ssp scenarios o neill et al 2014 the new generation of gcms of cmip6 is developed with finer resolutions and improved dynamical processes that address three critical scientific gaps in cmip5 gidden et al 2019 priestley et al 2020 stouffer et al 2017 recent studies show an improvement in the cmip6 ensemble in simulating global climatic extremes agel and barlow 2020 chen et al 2020 with a stronger climate variability than cmip5 models globally fan et al 2020b kim et al 2020 zhu and yang 2020 secondly studies related to the projection of extreme precipitation based on gcms generally focus on some extreme etccdi indices that cannot comprehensively analyze future extreme precipitation in terms of their changes in frequency amplitude and persistency akinsanola et al 2020a bai et al 2021 duan et al 2019 thus research involving all categories of extreme precipitation indices is needed thirdly previous studies are mainly focused on future changes in sub regional e g western na eastern na and the united states lacking analysis of extreme precipitation in the whole na almazroui et al 2021 ma et al 2020 mcafee et al 2011 zhang and colle 2017 given the strong relationship among regions in the changes of extreme precipitation due to the accelerating hydrologic cycle under global warming impact tabari 2020 it is necessary to assess future extreme precipitation in overall na to compare the magnitude and sign of changes among subregions therefore in this study we analyzed projected changes in ten extreme precipitation indices over na and its subregions by using simulations of cmip6 gcms results may contribute to the scientific basis that decision makers can use to frame effective mitigation policies and adaptation planning this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the cmip6 multi model ensembles two observation datasets and the study area section 3 defines extreme precipitation indices and the metrics used in this study while section 4 evaluates the results based on projections of 18 gcms of cmip6 the distributions temporal evolutions and spatial variabilities of extreme precipitation indices seasonal patterns and climate model agreements summary of results and conclusions are given in section 5 2 data 2 1 cmip6 simulations daily precipitation data of cmip6 simulated by some selected gcms over 1981 2100 are obtained from the earth system grid data distribution portal esg https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 the gcms of cmip6 are selected for this study if 1 the nominal model resolution is between 100 km and 250 km because gcms of higher resolutions should simulate more representative precipitation extreme events than gcms of coarser resolutions bador et al 2020 chen et al 2020 and 2 model outputs should be available for both historical experiments and three future ssp emissions scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 to compare the extreme precipitation projected by the selected gcms under the possible impact of climate warming in addition only extreme precipitation data projected by the first ensemble member of each gcm i e r1i1p1f1 is assessed to avoid unfair comparison among the gcms kim et al 2020 priestley et al 2020 in this study we have selected a total of 18 gcms of cmip6 table s1 provides the name institutions nominal model resolution and experimental run information of all the gcms selected for this study 2 2 observed precipitation data given uncertainties inevitably exist in most if not all observational products due to different data sources and processing algorithms akinsanola et al 2020a herold et al 2017 an in situ and a reanalysis observed precipitation datasets are used to comprehensively evaluate the ensemble performance of precipitation extremes simulated by the 18 selected gcms of cmip6 over the historical period of 1981 2010 the daymet version 4 data product is an in situ based gridded dataset supported by the national aeronautics and space administration of usa nasa in daymet the latest observed station datasets of daily weather and climatology variables are interpolated to a high 1 km spatial resolution over na starting from 1980 thornton et al 2021 the gauge distribution of daymet is show in supplementary material fig s 1 the north american regional reanalysis narr dataset produced by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep provides daily precipitation data at a 32 km resolution since 1979 mesinger et al 2006 these two datasets have been successfully used in evaluating model simulated extreme precipitation in certain regions of na e g ashfaq et al 2016 dong et al 2019 liu et al 2017 srivastava et al 2022 1981 to 2010 is chosen as the reference period for evaluating selected gcms of cmip6 because this 30 year period is the baseline climate normal period recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo as the most representative of current climatic conditions wmo 2019 furthermore many recent studies dosio et al 2019 iturbide et al 2020 spinoni et al 2018 based on the sixth assessment report ar6 of ipcc also choose this period as the baseline climate normal period the projected impact of climate warming relative to the historical period of 1981 2010 is assessed over two future periods the 2050s 2041 2070 and the 2080s 2071 2100 2 3 study area according to the reference regions in the ipcc ar6 iturbide et al 2020 north america is divided into eight climate homogenous areas such as nwn nw north america nen ne north america and others as shown in fig 1 since these reference regions are widely used in various recent studies on the analysis of cmip6 simulations we have conducted this study using the same reference regions in na so that we can compare our results with other related studies on ar6 of ipcc e g kim et al 2020 3 research methodology the effects of climate warming to the future extreme precipitations of na are evaluated in terms of ten selected precipitation indices of etccdi to assess projected changes in precipitation intensities maximum rainfall depth over 1 to consecutive 5 days durations of consecutive wet and dry days etc as explained below 3 1 extreme climate indices following the etccdi ten precipitation indices are analyzed in this study see supplementary material table s 2 which can be grouped under four basic categories 1 absolute precipitation indices are maximum 1 day rx1day or 5 day precipitation rx5day for both annual or monthly time scales high values of rx1day could result in flash floods expected to cause damages and hazards to municipal infrastructure transportation networks and others while high rx5day could lead to large scale river flooding resulting in extensive and long term damages 2 duration indices are consecutive dry cdd and wet days cwd that respectively represent the maximum number of consecutive days with daily precipitation amount 1 mm cdd or 1 mm cwd in a year therefore cdd and cwd are the indices representing the durations of dry and wet spells 3 threshold indices r10mm or r20mm are the number of days with more than 10 mm or 20 mm precipitation which represent the frequency of heavy precipitation and very heavy precipitation respectively at an annual or monthly time scales 4 percentile indices are the r95p and r99p indices that measure the total precipitation per year from wet day pr 1 mm with precipitation above the 95th and 99th percentile daily precipitation respectively for 1981 2010 r95p represents very wet days while r99p represents extremely wet days 5 total wet day precipitation prcptot at annual and monthly time scales and the simple daily intensity sdii index on wet days pr 1 mm at annual time scale all indices are computed on an annual basis but some are also computed on monthly basis e g rx1day rx5day r10mm r20mm and prcptot the extreme precipitation indices are first estimated for the original grids of gcms using the r package climpact2 at https github com arccss extremes climpact and then bilinearly interpolated into a common 1 1 resolution using the climate data operators cdo at https code mpimet mpg de projects cdo therefore the cmip6 ensemble median cmip6 enm for a specific index is the median at each 1 1 grid interpolated from the simulations of 18 cmip6 models over the na grids 3 2 model performance metrics the performance of cmip6 gcms has been evaluated using the root mean squared error rmse statistics in recent studies at both global and regional scales kim et al 2020 sillmann et al 2013a srivastava et al 2020 xu et al 2019 the annual spatially averaged extreme precipitation index simulated by gcms is evaluated against corresponding observed datasets daymet and narr for 1981 2010 using rmse xy defined as 1 rmse xy x y 2 where x and y represent the extreme precipitation index simulated by a gcm of cmip6 and the observed dataset at a grid point respectively the angular brackets represent the mean for all grids points over na rmse xy is the difference between individual model including cmip6 enm rmse xy and rmse median median error of an index for 18 gcms that provides an indication of the performance of gcms of cmip6 with respect to observations rmse xy is defined as 2 rmse xy rmse xy rmse median rmse median thus for an extreme precipitation index a negative rmse xy indicates that the corresponding model performs better than the majority 50 of cmip6 gcms similarly a positive rmse xy indicates that the corresponding model performs poorer than the majority 50 of cmip6 gcms snr is the signal to noise ratio that indicates the credibility of a gcm s projection at a grid point 3 snr x e 1 n i 1 n x i x e 2 where x i represents the index simulated by an individual gcm while x e is the corresponding index of cmip6 enm and n is the ensemble size n 18 in a statistical sense the numerator and denominator represent the signal and the noise respectively snr 1 implies that the signal is greater than the noise indicating relatively reliable projections and vice versa 3 3

performance of global climate models of cmip6 portrait diagrams in fig 2 provides an assessment of the performance of 18 cmip6 gcms in na in simulating ten extreme precipitation indices such as cdd cwd prcptot r10mm etc with reference to the observed daymet fig 2a and narr dataset fig 2b model performances in 8 subregions are show in supplementary material fig s 2 negative positive values shown in blue red indicate that the gcm performs better poorer than the majority 50 of selected gcms the assessment results in the simulations of gcms are based on the assumption that the observed dataset is correct even though observed data inevitably has some uncertainty due to the limitations of ground observation three gcms ec earth3 taiesm1 and noresm2 mm perform relatively well with the most negative rmse xy in fig 2 part of the reason is that higher resolution climate models generally perform better in simulating observed extreme precipitation than models with coarser resolutions agel and barlow 2020 in contrast ipsl cm6a lr and fgoals g3 show relatively weak performance with many positive rmse xy because they generally overestimate the change of extreme precipitation due to their coarser resolution as also found in previous studies ge et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 however cmip6 enm show negative rmse xy for all indices indicating that the cmip6 enm is more robust than precipitation events simulated by individual gcms in both na and 8 subregions fig s 2 because as the median at each grid interpolated from the simulations of 18 cmip6 models over the na grids cmip6 enm could cancel some of the simulation errors either over or under simulations in individual climate models fig 3 compares spatial distributions of seven extreme precipitation indices of the cmip6 ensemble median and observations over na for 1981 2010 results of r20mm rx1day and r99p are shown in supplementary material fig s 3 the spatial distributions for seven extreme precipitation indices of na for the historical period are statistically significant snr 1 over almost the entire na except for some uncertainty in gic for r10mm fig 3b3 and uncertainty in northern and western na for r20mm fig s 3 a3 and r99p fig s 3 c3 there is an obvious discontinuity between the narr dataset at the canada u s border because relatively less number and lower resolution of climate station data is assimilated for canada than those for the united states zhou et al 2018 results show that cmip6 enm could well reproduce the historical spatial patterns of observed precipitation events precipitation extremes represented by three datasets features a tend to concentrate mainly in the pacific northwest eastern the united states and the gulf of mexico which are relatively wet in contrast to the arctic gic and central na east of the rocky mountains which are relatively dry on the other hand central america such as nca and sca can experience both dry and wet spells represented by both high cdd and high cwd prcptot r10mm and rx5day in these regions as expected high latitude regions e g gic show dry climatology with high value in cdd and low values in other indices the spatial correlations between the 3 datasets cmip6 enm daymet cmip6 enm narr daymet narr on precipitation extremes fig 4 show a strong and consistent agreement between the cmip6 enm and two observed data since the statistics r are bigger than 0 8 for most precipitation indices however the spatial correlation of the consecutive wet days cwd index between cmip6 enm narr and daymet is relatively low low may because cmip6 enm and narr are both climate model based data which tends to simulate more frequent but less intensive precipitation e g drizzle due to model limitations i e model physics spatial averaging compared to the station dataset argüeso et al 2013 this over simulated light rain in climate models is inevitable and tends to overestimate cwd which is the largest number of consecutive days when daily precipitation is bigger than 1 mm which has been widely reported in previous studies e g duan et al 2019 stephens et al 2010 4 2 temporal evolution of precipitation extremes fig 5 shows the projected changes of ten spatially averaged extreme precipitation indices from 1981 to 2100 except for cdd extreme precipitation indices are projected to consistently increase over the twenty first century rx1day rx5day and prcptot are projected to increase by about 10 14 and 24 in 2100 under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively indicating a projected increase in the depth of short duration extreme precipitation under ssp5 8 5 scenarios the largest projected change is found in r99p 170 followed by r95p 77 that are far greater than prcptot implying the growing contributions of extreme precipitation to the total precipitation in the future additionally the projected increase of sdii is relatively smaller than that of prcptot because the frequency of rainy days is also projected to increase however projected median changes in the above indices are not distinguishable under three ssp emission scenarios before 2040 but the projections diverge over time after that with the most significant changes under ssp5 8 5 furthermore ensemble model simulations over the 25th 75th quantiles are projected to expand with time and remain overlapped between all ssps indicating the growing uncertainty of model simulations as cmip6 gcms project the climate to the distant future fig 6 is the distributions of grids showing the projected changes in percentage for ten extreme precipitation indices of cmip6 enm over na for the 2050s dash line and 2080s solid line although there are some projected negative changes 0 projected positive change dominate most grids for r10mm r20mm rx1day rx5day r95p r99p prcptot and sdii for both the 2050s and 2080s with a right shift in the distributions of grids under higher ssp emission scenarios the grids have similar distributions between the 2050s and the 2080s under the ssp1 2 6 scenarios but the distribution of grids become flatter and spread over wider ranges under ssp5 8 5 likely implying a larger interannual variability under higher projected radiative forcings of higher ssp emission scenarios in particular moving from ssp1 2 6 to ssp5 8 5 scenarios r95p and r99p tends to become more and more skewed towards the right with more elongated upper tails suggesting a growing projection of extreme events as climate warming worsens although the projected changes in fig 5 in cdd and cwd are not as sensitive to the effects of climate warming as the other precipitation indices the density distributions centered at the zero in fig 6 means are projected to spread over a wider range of cdd and cwd under higher emission scenarios partly due to their larger spatial variability the projected responses of these two indices differ from region to region across na but on a whole they are less sensitive to the effect of climate warming as reported in previous studies akinsanola et al 2020b sillmann et al 2013a 4 3 projected spatial changes in precipitation extremes relative changes of the spatially distributed extreme precipitation indices and their zonal means of cmip6 enm under three ssps emission scenarios in the 2080s are shown in fig 7 precipitation extremes are projected to become more severe over most na in the 2080s relative to the baseline period all indices are projected to progressively increase in magnitude under the larger radiative forcing of higher emission scenarios especially the ssp5 8 5 scenarios the projected percentage increase of cwd rx1day supplementary material fig s 4 b rx5day and r95p prcptot sdii are statistically significant snr 1 over the entire na and their zonal mean increases are higher in latitudes above 55 n of na than in lower latitudes for example under ssp5 8 5 rx5day is projected to increase by about 15 between 15 n and 55 n but by about 35 between 55 n and 80 n the change of heavy precipitation r10mm and r20mm supplementary material fig s 5 are projected to occur more frequently in coastal areas between 40 n and 70 n as many as 7 days and 3 days zonal mean average under ssp5 8 5 at around 60 n of na however among all the extreme precipitation indices selected for this study the consecutive dry days cdd is the only etccdi index that is projected to decrease by ssp forcings for zonal mean values in latitudes above 55 n in addition significant decreases in cdd are also detected in california and nevada likely attributed to the thermodynamic moistening of air as alpine snowmelt accelerates under climate warming huang et al 2020 iturbide et al 2020 sun et al 2019 southern regions especially mexico and texas are projected to experience a significant increase in cdd which corresponds to generally projected decrease in other precipitation indices implying meteorological droughts in these regions will likely intensify in between wna and southern nwn of na e g oregon washington and southern british columbia cdd r10mm and r95p are all projected to increase which means that both extreme precipitation events and droughts will become more severe or hydrologic extremes will worsen under the impact of climate warming gaur et al 2021 4 4 seasonal patterns using boxplots fig 8 presents the range of projected changes of 18 gcms for prcptot r10mm and rx5day between summer jja and winter djf over eight subregions of na in the 2080s results for r20mm and rx1day are shown in supplementary material fig s 5 in upper northern latitude regions such as gic nwn and nen relative changes of prcptot and rx5day are projected to be more pronounced in winter than in summer for example in gic the largest increase of prcptot rx5day in winter is 250 115 compared to 55 50 in summer on the other hand seasonal differences between winter and summer in the relative changes of prcptot and rx5day in central america e g nca and sca are minimal because the ensemble median of both indices cmip6 enm are only projected to decrease marginally in both seasons however relative projected changes of r10mm are more homogeneous and positive in winter than in summer given regional changes in r10mm of cmip6 enm ranges from 1 to 1 5 days in djf compared with 7 to1 5 days in jja in particular the median r10mm and r20mm fig s 5c for winter is virtually unchanged in gic since in winter the 10 mm and r20mm threshold is rarely exceeded in this region the most significant change of r10mm 17 days is projected in the lowest northern latitude regions e g sca in summer under ssp5 8 5 for the middle northern latitude regions of na such as wna cna and ena prcptot rx5 day and r10mm are all projected to increase in winter but only minor positive change is projected in the summer 5 or even less than zero depending on the ssps 4 5 model agreement to compare regional responses to different ssp scenarios annual extreme precipitation indices for the 8 sub regions of na over the 2080s based on the simulations of 18 individual gcms and their ensemble median are presented in fig 9 in terms of data points and bar plots respectively results over the 2050s are shown in supplementary material fig s 6 we assess the agreements between the 18 gcms of cmip6 by comparing how many gcms in agree on the sign of ensemble mean changes cmip6 enm projected for ten indices over the 8 sub regions of na in general precipitation extremes in cmip6 enm are projected to progressively becoming more severe towards the end of the twenty first century the 2080s the gcms of cmip6 unanimously agree 100 agreement on the increase in precipitation extremes over high latitude regions such as gic nwn and nen while in wna cna and nca model agreements vary between the indices for example rx1day rx5day r95p r99p that represent thresholds and block maximum extremes respectively are all projected to increase with 100 model agreements in central na given the consistent projections between all 18 gcms there is a strong confidence that extreme precipitation events will very likely become more severe under the impact of climate warming in central na in comparison model agreements are about 80 in terms of r10mm r20mm and prcptot in middle northern latitude of na for lower latitude of na e g nca and sca gcms disagree on the sign and magnitude of projected changes in extreme precipitation for at least one of the three ssp scenarios especially for r10mm r20mm and sdii except for some major differences ranging from 2 to 37 days between gcms in sca southern mexico it seems that cwd in other parts of na will only experience minimal changes until the 2080s however the projected increase decrease in cdd generally coincides with the projected decrease increase in r10mm r20mm and prcptot such that cdd is projected to decrease in high latitude regions with 100 model agreement while increasing in central america with only some limited disagreements in nca northern mexico under ssp1 2 6 on a whole there is a low confidence that southern na will become progressively drier over the 21st century but as we move north across na there is high confidence that na will become wetter and wetter over the 21st century ipcc 2021 among the 18 gcms of cmip6 selected in this study some projections deviate significantly from the ensemble medians which indicate that climate model uncertainties could affect the results on future extreme precipitation for na obtained from the three ssp scenarios of cmip6 for example the gcm ipsl cm6a lr of institut pierre simon laplace france projected the largest decrease for cwd r10mm prcptot sdii rx5day and r95p over sca this could be attributed to the bias in dryness of ipsl cm6a lr associated with its negative sea surface temperature bias in the equatorial pacific boucher et al 2020 in contrast in gic the ec earth3 gcm projected the most severe extreme precipitation indices for the 2080s including prcptot 190 sdii 39 rx5day 115 and r95p 670 partly because this gcm over simulated the amplitude of global mean precipitation patterns and the volume of arctic sea ice resulting in a fast reinforcement in the amplitude of precipitation as warming increases döscher et al 2022 5 discussion and conclusion in this study we assess the projected spatial and temporal changes in extreme precipitation of na over the 21st century based on the projections of 18 gcms of cmip6 and the performance of these gcms over the historical period of 1981 2010 over na with respect to in situ measurements daymet and reanalysis data narr the analysis of these changes in precipitation extremes is based on the ensemble median of these selected gcms of cmip6 the following summarizes the main conclusions 1 compared with previous studies conducted in different regions ge et al 2021 srivastava et al 2020 cmip6 enm could reasonably reproduce the spatial patterns of observed precipitation events and should be representative and reliable over the future periods because 10 etccdi extreme precipitation indices simulated by the cmip6 enm out performs all 18 individual gcms with negative rmse xy over na fig 2 and 8 subregions fig s 2 the signal to noise ratio snr 1 fig 3 and higher r statistics r 0 8 fig 4 in most sub regions of na in contrast to results simulated by cmip5 gcms sillmann et al 2013a gcms of cmip6 agree better with observations represented by narr and daymet this indicates an improvement in the cmip6 models in simulating observed precipitation characteristics partly because cmip6 gcms generally are of higher spatial resolutions than cmip5 models however gcms inevitably over simulate light rain e g drizzle compared to observations resulting in an overestimated cwd this is a common problem that has not been significantly improved in cmip6 models duan et al 2019 stephens et al 2010 srivastava et al 2020 the parameterization of physical processes may play a role in improving the model performance which needs to be further investigated sillmann et al 2013a 2 projected changes to extreme precipitation indices in response to a different level of climate warming ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios are similar to each other before 2040 unanimous agreements between gcms especially in high latitude regions but the difference in projected changes based on the three ssp scenarios progressively become larger and larger towards the end of the twenty first century 2080s as expected fig 5 the temporal changes in extreme precipitation are similar to the changes in global surface air temperature due to increasing radiative forcing patterns as reported in chapter 4 of ar6 lee et al 2021 which can be assumed that the intensification of extreme precipitation in na is directly influenced by global warming the magnitude of changes in extreme precipitation indices depends on the index type sillmann et al 2013b for example higher increase is projected in the percentile indices r95p and r99p compared with prcptot indicating a projected increase in the future contribution of extreme precipitation to the total precipitation moreover it is of high confidence that the response of extreme precipitation in na to the impact of global warming will continue to be amplified throughout the 21st century fig 6 and the magnitude is bigger in cmip6 ensembles than in cmip5 models ipcc 2021 3 extreme precipitation of na will likely occur more severely over the 21st century especially in latitudes above 55 n of na and coastal areas under the ssp5 8 5 climate scenarios represented by larger projected decrease in cdd and larger increase in other indices this is not a surprise because according to the clausius clapeyron scaling atmospheric humidity is expected to increase at about 7 c of warming particularly in higher latitude regions where warming is projected to become higher a phenomenon commonly known as the arctic amplification liu et al 2021a b stjern et al 2019 the spatial patterns shown in fig 7 reveal that at middle latitudes in between wna and southern nwn of na e g oregon washington and southern british columbia where both extreme precipitation events and droughts are projected to become more severe at lower latitudes especially in mexico and texas projections of indices imply meteorological droughts in these regions will likely intensify e g projected increase in cdd and decrease in other indices in addition coastal regions are also prone to the occurrences of more extreme precipitation the high elevations of the rocky mountains and the pacific northwest are mainly fueled by landfalling atmospheric rivers ars that transport more water vapor from the pacific ocean liu et al 2021a b lora et al 2017 ma et al 2020 while precipitation extremes in the eastern coastland are primarily attributed to the higher intensity cyclone relative frontal precipitation bishop et al 2019 zhang and colle 2017 4 seasonal changes in northern latitude such as gic nwn and nen and middle latitude regions e g wna cna and ena are projected to experience more pronounced changes in precipitation extremes in winter than in summer this may result from the northward migration storm and expanded subtropical high that contributes to decreasing subtropical precipitation and increasing high latitude precipitation in summer maloney et al 2014 mcafee et al 2011 zhou et al 2022 meanwhile atmospheric rivers as well as some large climate patterns e g the madden julian oscillation and the north atlantic oscillation are related to more intensive storms and more precipitation in winter dong et al 2018 liu et al 202a b lora et al 2017 ma et al 2020 ning and bradley 2016 on the other hand changes between winter and summer in lower latitudes of na e g nca and sca agree with the cmip5 results that precipitation seasonality will decrease with decreasing trends in both winter and summer suggesting a more severe arid future sillmann et al 2013b 5 with regard to model agreement cmip6 climate models consistently project that precipitation extremes of na will progressively become more severe towards the end of the twenty first century the 2080s with 100 agreement for all indices over high latitude regions such as gic nwn and nen there is more than 80 agreement between climate models projections for all indices over middle latitude regions such as wna cna and ena however there is low confidence less than 60 that some indices in lower latitudes of na such as nca and sca indicate progressively wetter conditions over the 21st century ipcc 2021 climate models that e g ipsl cm6a lr perform poorly in simulating observed extreme precipitation generally deviate from the ensemble medians in projecting future extreme precipitation indices due to their coarser resolutions however models with finer resolutions e g ec earth3 generally project very severe extreme precipitation indices which may be partly because high values are not easy to smoothen by data resampling oubeidillah et al 2014 future research is still needed to explore the influence of the gcms resolutions in simulating observed climate extremes in conclusion based on results obtained from the projections of 18 gcms of cmip6 for na there is high confidence that extreme precipitation will likely occur more frequently with greater severity especially in high latitudes and coastal regions of na these variations will contribute to more severe natural hazards such as floods droughts and wildfires which may not only threaten water storage conveyance and flood control infrastructure but also challenge the regional food supply which will affect the social stability cmip6 results will help us to develop adaptive measures to mitigate the potential impact of these changes in precipitation extremes to reduce the vulnerability of some parts of north america such as the canadian prairies against the impact of droughts and floods and possible structural and non structural measures against future hazards in floods and droughts besides the impact of climate warming the extreme precipitation in some parts of na has been shown to be related to the effect of climate anomalies such as el niňo southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation north atlantic oscillation arctic oscillation and others e g gan et al 2007 islam and gan 2015 ning and bradley 2016 tan et al 2017a tan et al 2017b future research should investigate the combined impact of climate warming and climate anomalies to the future
