22320,the wave profile of solitary wave has been widely used as a tsunami paradigm for decades to capture the main features of actual tsunamis since most of the fatalities were attributed to overland flow of tsunamis the runup and rundown processes of solitary waves have been extensively studied experimentally and numerically comparing to previous research this paper systematically investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of breaking solitary wave runup on a permeable sloped beach using a nonhydrostatic model firstly the computational capabilities of present numerical model in predicting solitary wave runup process and flow field in permeable media are well validated with experimental data then a series of computational runs have been performed to study the breaking solitary wave on permeable sloped beach effects of three prominent factors on the maximum runup height of breaking solitary wave are considered in detail the thickness b median diameter d 50 and porosity n of the permeable layers the porosity of the beach has a substantial impact on the flow field for breaking waves running up a sloped beach the maximum wave runup height can be substantially reduced if the permeability of the beach is considered it is also found that the maximum wave runup height decreases with permeable layer thickness however the reduction rate gradually decreases the influences of median diameter are very limited and can be ignored in addition based on our results we also proposed a new empirical formula to calculate the maximum wave runup height of breaking solitary wave on permeable sloped beach the findings of this paper are expected to be useful for developing an improved understanding on the runup processes of breaking solitary wave on sloped beach

landslides submarine volcanic explosions or sea bottom deformations associated with large submarine earthquakes cho et al 2004 synolakis and bernard 2006 during the early years of the 20th century devastating tsunamis resulted in tremendous human and socioeconomic losses near the coast within the reach of tsunami surge wave runup and subsequent flooding for example the december 26th 2004 tsunami in the indian ocean resulted in an estimated final death toll of more than 230 000 synolakis et al 2005 the 2011 tōhoku tsunami started as surface waves with negligible amplitude in the deep ocean and finally evolved into up to 39 m tall walls of water near the seashore which then splashed against structures i e houses and bridges leading to 14 508 casualties 11 452 missing people and property damage ranging between 16 and 25 trillion yen mimura et al 2011 and the tsunami induced surge bore ultimately caused the meltdown of three reactors within the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant complex in japan yalciner et al 2011 most of the fatalities were caused by the tsunami induced inundation when tsunami surge waves propagated inland liu et al 2005 fritz et al 2005 and for tsunamis that originate near coastlines there is usually not enough time to seek refuge cho et al 2004 hence it is very important to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tsunami surge wave runup process the wave profile of solitary waves has been routinely used to capture the main features of leading tsunamis since 1970s and its runup and rundown processes and interactions with coastal infrastructure have been extensively studied through experiments synolakis 1987 goseberg et al 2013 and numerical simulation cho et al 2004 hsiao and lin 2010 limura and norio 2012 liang et al 2013 maza et al 2015 based on experimental data and computational results serval empirical formulas were proposed for calculating the maximum runup height of non breaking and breaking solitary wave on slope beach synolakis 1986 1987 madsen and schäffer 2010 although in recent years some of the experimental and numerical studies on tsunamis are carried out using special wave profiles such as elongated solitary waves synolakis 1990 charvet et al 2013 sine waves bremm et al 2015 and n waves qu et al 2017a 2017b zhao et al 2019 solitary wave is still the most popular tsunami paradigm for research communities for instances solitary waves were used to study the runup process of tsunami waves on mild steep and composite slopes this was done through experimental work xuan and wu 2013 sælevik et al 2013 huang and hwang 2015 smith et al 2019 and also through various simulations such as those based on a depth averaged model liang et al 2013 boussinesq wave model shao et al 2019 ning et al 2019 two phase flow model ha et al 2014 and sph model li et al 2012 the tsunami induced hydrodynamic loads and local scouring around coastal infrastructure and vegetations had also been studied xiao and huang 2008 maza et al 2015 solitary waves are also used to study the evolution of tsunami induced morphology on the sloped beach experimentally and numerically young et al 2010 xiao et al 2010 with respect to the study of tsunami runup processes on sloped beaches most previous research was carried out for impermeable slopes synolakis 1987 gedik et al 2005 hsiao and lin 2010 goseberg et al 2013 etc the outcomes and findings of these studies are applicable to sandy beaches since the velocity magnitude within the sand is at least an order of magnitude smaller than flow field above it higuera et al 2013 however for a gravel beach the permeability and the grain size of the beach may substantially affect the wave motion since some water may also flow into a permeable beach wave energy might be dissipated at a higher rate this process would influence the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tsunami wave and its maximum runup height furthermore effects of bottom permeability on wave breaking have not yet been thoroughly explored for regular waves lara et al 2006 let alone solitary waves this work contributes to filling these knowledge gaps in particular with respect to elucidating the hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary wave runup on a permeable sloped beach we investigate this process using a non hydrostatic model nhwave ma et al 2012 which is based on the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations varans in a σ coordinate grid system in the nhwave the computational domain is discretized using a structured rectangular grid in the horizontal direction in the vertical direction a σ coordinate system is implemented which can enable an accurate representation of the bottom and free surface geometry young et al 2007 zapata et al 2019 the main advantage of numerical models based on the σ coordinate system is their simplicity accuracy and relative efficiency for computing free surface flows over irregular bathymetry comparing to hydrostatic models that neglecting the vertical acceleration non hydrostatic models can effectively simulate both shallow and deep water surface wave propagation and breaking processes lin and liu 1998 walters 2005 generally non hydrostatic model can predict same results as that of two phase cfd models but at a very low computational load by applying nhwave effects of prominent factors such as thickness medium diameter and porosity of the permeable layer on the flow field of solitary wave runup sloped beach and its final maximum runup height are discussed the rest of the paper is organized

regarding the numerical model in this paper readers are referred to ma et al 2014 3 model validation 3 1 breaking solitary wave during runup on sloped beach as the first calibration case the run up of a breaking solitary wave on a sloped beach is numerically simulated the predicted water surface elevations are compared to the corresponding measurements in the experimental work of synolakis 1987 the schematic of the experimental layout is depicted in fig 1 where h is the incident solitary wave height h is the still water depth l is the wave length of the solitary wave and β is the slope angle of the beach and tanβ 1 20 for the details regarding the experiment readers are referred to synolakis 1987 and zelt 1991 we use a still water depth h of 0 21 m and wave height h of 0 058 m which produces a wave height ratio h h 0 28 the solitary wave was generated at a distance of l 2 from the toe of the beach the total length of the computational domain is 20 m the mesh spacing in horizontal direction is 0 01 m and 40 sigma layers are used in the vertical direction the minimum dry water depth is set as 0 005 m snapshots of the predicted and measured run up and run down processes of the water surface on the sloped beach are plotted in fig 2 the time scale of the computational results is shifted to be in accordance with measurements predicted water surfaces are in good agreement with experimental data not only in the wave runup process but also in the rundown process of solitary wave on the beach when the solitary wave propagates in the water with constant depth its wave amplitude remains unchanged fig 2a once the solitary wave approaches and climbs the slope the wave front becomes increasingly sharpened fig 2b and c and the wave profile becomes more peaked fig 2h shows that the wave front almost reaches its highest runup location about 0 6 m which is nearly ten times the incident wave height after this moment the water body has started its rundown process fig 2i j k and l therefore the modelled results are in good agreement with observations for both of the runup and rundown processes besides the computational case for h 0 058 m another nine case with different wave height ratio h h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 and 0 5 are simulated in fig 3 the predicted maximum solitary wave runup heights are compared with both experimental data and analytical solution in synolakis 1987 eq 13 the figure shows that the predicted maximum runup height r is in good agreement with both analytical solution and corresponding measurement proving that present numerical model is well suited for modelling of breaking solitary wave runup the sloped beach 3 2 solitary wave propagation over permeable breakwater since this paper mainly discusses the breaking solitary wave runup on a permeable sloped beach it is necessary to verify the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting the flow in permeable medium the predicted distributions of velocities and water elevations are compared with corresponding measured data the laboratory measurements were carried out by wu and hsiao 2013 in a 2d glass walled and glass bottomed wave flume of 25 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 6 m deep and the experimental layout is shown in fig 4 the breakwater consisted of uniform glass spheres with constant diameter of 1 5 cm yielding a porosity value of 0 52 and was mounted on the bottom of the flume as shown in fig 4 the origin of the coordinate system is defined at the intersection of the bottom and the left side of the breakwater two wave gauges are installed to measure the time series of water elevation at the front side wg1 x 1 8 m and back side wg2 x 1 8 m of breakwater the computational domain is 8 m in length the mesh resolution in horizontal direction is dx 0 004 m and 40 σ layers are applied in the vertical direction the distance between the inlet of the computational domain and the breakwater is 4 m the still water depth h is 0 106 m and the incident solitary wave height is 0 0477 m the predicted time series of water elevations recorded at wave gages wg1 and wg2 are compared with experimental data in fig 5 the figure shows that the predicted elevations are in good agreement with experiment data for both of peak value and temporal variation which can be also observed in the snapshots of water elevation distribution near the breakwater as shown in figs 6 8 10 12 and 14 the comparisons between the measured and predicted vertical and horizontal velocity distributions along the water depth at different positions from t 1 45s 2 25s with the time interval of 0 2s are plotted in figs 7 9 11 13 and 15 respectively the figures shows that the measured and predicted flow velocities are in very good agreement although there are some slight discrepancies at some locations for instance at t 1 65s and x 0 16 m the numerical model underestimates the magnitude of vertical velocity at the rear side of the breakwater some of the discrepancy can be attributed to limitations regarding how the porous media was approximated in the numerical model our numerical model is formulated using a homogeneous porous medium assumption without detailing each individual glass sphere overall results clearly support the computational capability our numerical model for describing a solitary wave propagating over the permeable breakwater 4 results and discussion in the following sections the flow phenomena of a breaking solitary wave as it runs up a permeable sloped beach are numerically investigated the impact of the permeable layer properties on the maximum runup height r is investigated with respect to the thickness b porosity n the medium diameter d50 of the permeable layer the computational layout is shown in fig 16 here b represents the thickness of the permeable layer for all following computations the still water depth h is kept at 0 21 m and the slope of the beach is the same as in section 3 1 tanβ 1 20 the computational domain is 20 m in length the mesh resolution in horizontal direction is dx 0 01 m and 40 layers are applied in vertical σ layers energy loss and transfer during wave breaking play an important role in coastal hydrodynamics especially when the permeability of beach is considered therefore we investigate the energy dissipation for the breaking solitary wave on a permeable sloped beach by calculating the kinetic energy ke potential energy pe and total energy te using the following formulas 10 ke ρ u 2 w 2 2 dzdx t 11 pe ρ gzdzdx t ρ gzdzdx t 0 12 te ke pe 4 1 hydrodynamic phenomena the still water depth h is 0 21 m and incident wave height ratio h h is 0 3 the thickness of permeable layer ratio b h is 0 3 and the porosity of permeable layer n is 0 5 the results for the impermeable beach are also provided for comparison snapshots of water surface elevation are plotted in fig 17 it is found that the distribution of water surface elevation for impermeable and permeable beaches are the same when the solitary wave propagates in water of constant depth and also at the beginning of wave steepening fig 17a as the wave continues to propagate the front of the wave gradually sharpens due to shallowing fig 17b and c and the front of the wave becomes even sharper for the permeable beach with a higher wave peak than impermeable beach but the wave front propagates a little bit slower fig 17c this is due to the backward flow formed in the preamble layer after wave breaking the breaking surge propagates on the sloped beach for impermeable beach this duration is a little longer fig 17d to h than for the permeable beach fig 17d to g the maximum wave runup height for the permeable beach is much lower than that of impermeable beach compared to the impermeable beach the water surface doesn t fluctuate as much for a permeable beach after the surge receded fig 17i and g at beginning of wave climbing the velocity contours for permeable and impermeable beaches look very similar except very limited flow current existing in permeable layer fig 18 a as the wave climbs further flow speed increases gradually in the permeable layer and water in the permeable layer can flow backwards towards the origin of the wave making the wave front shaper but slower fig 18b after wave breaking a high speed surge flow is formed within a thin layer for impermeable beach fig 18c left side but the amount of surge flow for the permeable beach is very small with a relative smooth surge front fig 18c right side later the velocity of the wave surge flow for the permeable beach decreases at a high rate compared to the impermeable beach fig 18d meanwhile the water elevation in the permeable layer also increases gradually fig 18 c to e right side fig 19 shows the temporal evolution of energy for the water inside the computational domain both kinematic and potential energy of the water body gradually increase as the solitary wave enters the computational domain t 1 4s for the impermeable beach kinematic energy remains nearly constant between when the solitary wave entered the computational domain and before breaking initiated fig 19a red dash line once wave breaking initiates kinematic energy is substantially reduced and the potential energy greatly increases as the wave surge climbs fig 19b red dash line however for the permeable beach the kinematic energy of the water body continuously dissipates and dissipation accelerates with time for the impervious beach during wave breaking ke decreases while pe increases however for the permeable beach ke and pe both decrease during wave breaking fig 19a and b blue solid line this is because energy can be greatly dissipated by the permeable layer once the breaking surge recedes from sloped beach ke gradually increases for impermeable beach fig 19a red dash line t 8s however for permeable beach ke increases a little and is quickly damped out by the permeable layer fig 19a blue solid line t 8s the phenomena are also reflected in the variation of their pe during receding process fig 19b for both permeable and impermeable beaches the total energy of the water body gradually decreases and the decreasing rate for permeable beach is much higher than impermeable beach fig 19c overall the numerical simulations clearly show that the hydrodynamic characteristics of wave breaking on a permeable beach are vastly different from an impermeable beach 4 2 effects of permeable layer thickness this section focusses on the impact of permeable layer thickness on the runup process of the solitary wave five permeable layer thickness ratios b h and incident wave height ratios h h are selected and are 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 for both b h and h h porosity of the permeable layer is set as n 0 5 fig 20 shows snapshots of velocity contours at two different times for different permeable layer thicknesses when the wave height ratio h h 0 3 it is found that the wave front gradually become sharper as the thickness increases before wave breaking after wave breaking the wave surge is formed and runs up on the beach model results indicate that the magnitude of current velocity of the surge head decreases gradually with permeable layer thickness b this suggests that increasing the permeable layer thickness will reduce the maximum runup height the temporal evolution of the total energy for different permeable layer thicknesses are plotted in fig 21 the figure shows that the total energy is substantially reduced after wave breaking and that the reduction in total energy increases with permeable layer thickness the curve of the maximum runup r as function of permeable layer thickness is plotted in fig 22 for different wave heights computational results for impermeable beach are also included for comparison the figure shows that even when permeable layer thickness is relatively small b h 0 1 the maximum wave height can be greatly reduced for a permeable layer thickness b h of 0 1 the maximum runup height is reduced by 70 60 for the impermeable case for a wave height ratio h h 0 1 h h 0 5 although the maximum wave runup height monotonically decreases with permeable layer thickness the rate of decrease is greatly reduced after b h 0 2 4 3 effects of medium diameter and porosity this section examines the effects of medium diameter and the porosity of the permeable layer to examine the effect of the medium diameter five different values are selected d 50 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 m the same five different incident wave height ratios are selected as in section 4 2 h h 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 for examining the impacts related to porosity four different values are selected n 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the thickness of the permeable layer is set as b h 0 3 as seen in fig 23 the temporal evolution of the total energy for different d50 values are nearly identical fig 23a a zoomed view shows that the reduction percentage in total energy increases with medium diameter but the differences among different medium diameters are very limited and can be ignored fig 23b the medium diameter also has limited impact on the maximum wave runup height of breaking solitary wave on permeable beach fig 24 porosity has some impact on the hydrodynamic characteristics of wave breaking fig 25 both reduction percentage and reduction rate of total energy increases with the porosity of the permeable layer the maximum wave run height under different porosities are plotted as function of wave height ratio fig 26 the figure shows that the maximum wave runup height decreases with increasing porosity it shows that increasing porosity results in lower maximum wave runup height due to the energy dissipation increasing with porosity 4 4 further discussion on the maximum runup based on a series of experimental work carried out for solitary wave runup on an impermeable beach synolakis 1986 derived an empirical formula for calculating the maximum wave runup height r as 13 r h 1 109 h h 0 582 although eq 13 is very successfully for predicting the breaking solitary wave runup height on an impermeable beach the effects of permeable materials aren t accounted for in this section based on all of simulation results demonstrated in previous sections eq 14 is adapted to account for the effects permeability of the beach as 14 r h 1 109 h h 0 582 1 0 884 b h 0 186 1 0 752 n 1 705 eq 14 will be reduced to eq 13 if the permeability and the thickness of the permeable layer is zero fig 27 plots the comparison between simulation results and calculation by eq 14 since the adjusted r 2 of curve fitting is 0 947 the computational capability of eq 14 is reliable 5 conclusions this paper numerically investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of a solitary wave breaking during runup for an impermeable and permeable sloped beach using a nonhydrostatic numerical model the computational capability of the numerical model was verified by numerically reproducing experimental observations made for the case of an impermeable sloped beach predicted maximum wave runup heights are in good agreement with both measured data and the empirical formula proposed by synolakis 1987 furthermore by simulating solitary wave over permeable breakwater we also verified the computational capability of the numerical model with regards to calculating the flow field in a porous medium the numerical model was then applied to study the maximum wave runup height of a breaking solitary wave on permeable beach considering three prominent factors the permeable layer thickness b the medium diameter d 50 and the porosity major findings of this work are 1 the permeability of the beach has a substantial impact on the flow field for breaking waves running up a sloped beach the maximum wave runup height can be substantially reduced if the permeability of the beach is considered even for a relatively thin permeable layer thickness b h 0 1 the maximum runup height was reduced by nearly 70 for wave height ratio h h 0 1 and to by 60 for wave height ratio h h 0 5 2 the thickness of the permeable layer has great impact on the maximum wave runup height the maximum wave runup height decreases with permeable layer thickness b however the reduction rate gradually decreases for b h 0 2 3 the influence of medium diameter d 50 on the maximum wave runup height was limited and can be ignored 4 the porosity of the permeable layer has some influence on the maximum wave runup height r decreases with n 5 by analyzing the computational results empirical formula for predicting the maximum wave runup height for impermeable beach has been adapted to account for the effects of permeability it shows the newly updated formula can predict the maximum wave runup height of solitary wave on permeable beach with an

a breaking solitary wave on a sloped beach is numerically simulated the predicted water surface elevations are compared to the corresponding measurements in the experimental work of synolakis 1987 the schematic of the experimental layout is depicted in fig 1 where h is the incident solitary wave height h is the still water depth l is the wave length of the solitary wave and β is the slope angle of the beach and tanβ 1 20 for the details regarding the experiment readers are referred to synolakis 1987 and zelt 1991 we use a still water depth h of 0 21 m and wave height h of 0 058 m which produces a wave height ratio h h 0 28 the solitary wave was generated at a distance of l 2 from the toe of the beach the total length of the computational domain is 20 m the mesh spacing in horizontal direction is 0 01 m and 40 sigma layers are used in the vertical direction the minimum dry water depth is set as 0 005 m snapshots of the predicted and measured run up and run down processes of the water surface on the sloped beach are plotted in fig 2 the time scale of the computational results is shifted to be in accordance with measurements predicted water surfaces are in good agreement with experimental data not only in the wave runup process but also in the rundown process of solitary wave on the beach when the solitary wave propagates in the water with constant depth its wave amplitude remains unchanged fig 2a once the solitary wave approaches and climbs the slope the wave front becomes increasingly sharpened fig 2b and c and the wave profile becomes more peaked fig 2h shows that the wave front almost reaches its highest runup location about 0 6 m which is nearly ten times the incident wave height after this moment the water body has started its rundown process fig 2i j k and l therefore the modelled results are in good agreement with observations for both of the runup and rundown processes besides the computational case for h 0 058 m another nine case with different wave height ratio h h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 and 0 5 are simulated in fig 3 the predicted maximum solitary wave runup heights are compared with both experimental data and analytical solution in synolakis 1987 eq 13 the figure shows that the predicted maximum runup height r is in good agreement with both analytical solution and corresponding measurement proving that present numerical model is well suited for modelling of breaking solitary wave runup the sloped beach 3 2 solitary wave propagation over permeable breakwater since this paper mainly discusses the breaking solitary wave runup on a permeable sloped beach it is necessary to verify the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting the flow in permeable medium the predicted distributions of velocities and water elevations are compared with corresponding measured data the laboratory measurements were carried out by wu and hsiao 2013 in a 2d glass walled and glass bottomed wave flume of 25 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 6 m deep and the experimental layout is shown in fig 4 the breakwater consisted of uniform glass spheres with constant diameter of 1 5 cm yielding a porosity value of 0 52 and was mounted on the bottom of the flume as shown in fig 4 the origin of the coordinate system is defined at the intersection of the bottom and the left side of the breakwater two wave gauges are installed to measure the time series of water elevation at the front side wg1 x 1 8 m and back side wg2 x 1 8 m of breakwater the computational domain is 8 m in length the mesh resolution in horizontal direction is dx 0 004 m and 40 σ layers are applied in the vertical direction the distance between the inlet of the computational domain and the breakwater is 4 m the still water depth h is 0 106 m and the incident solitary wave height is 0 0477 m the predicted time series of water elevations recorded at wave gages wg1 and wg2 are compared with experimental data in fig 5 the figure shows that the predicted elevations are in good agreement with experiment data for both of peak value and temporal variation which can be also observed in the snapshots of water elevation distribution near the breakwater as shown in figs 6 8 10 12 and 14 the comparisons between the measured and predicted vertical and horizontal velocity distributions along the water depth at different positions from t 1 45s 2 25s with the time interval of 0 2s are plotted in figs 7 9 11 13 and 15 respectively the figures shows that the measured and predicted flow velocities are in very good agreement although there are some slight discrepancies at some locations for instance at t 1 65s and x 0 16 m the numerical model underestimates the magnitude of vertical velocity at the rear side of the breakwater some of the discrepancy can be attributed to limitations regarding how the porous media was approximated in the numerical model our numerical model is formulated using a homogeneous porous medium assumption without detailing each individual glass sphere overall results clearly support the computational capability our numerical model for describing a solitary wave propagating over the permeable breakwater 4 results and discussion in the following sections the flow phenomena of a breaking solitary wave as it runs up a permeable sloped beach are numerically investigated the impact of the permeable layer properties on the maximum runup height r is investigated with respect to the thickness b porosity n the medium diameter d50 of the permeable layer the computational layout is shown in fig 16 here b represents the thickness of the permeable layer for all following computations the still water depth h is kept at 0 21 m and the slope of the beach is the same as in section 3 1 tanβ 1 20 the computational domain is 20 m in length the mesh resolution in horizontal direction is dx 0 01 m and 40 layers are applied in vertical σ layers energy loss and transfer during wave breaking play an important role in coastal hydrodynamics especially when the permeability of beach is considered therefore we investigate the energy dissipation for the breaking solitary wave on a permeable sloped beach by calculating the kinetic energy ke potential energy pe and total energy te using the following formulas 10 ke ρ u 2 w 2 2 dzdx t 11 pe ρ gzdzdx t ρ gzdzdx t 0 12 te ke pe 4 1 hydrodynamic phenomena the still water depth h is 0 21 m and incident wave height ratio h h is 0 3 the thickness of permeable layer ratio b h is 0 3 and the porosity of permeable layer n is 0 5 the results for the impermeable beach are also provided for comparison snapshots of water surface elevation are plotted in fig 17 it is found that the distribution of water surface elevation for impermeable and permeable beaches are the same when the solitary wave propagates in water of constant depth and also at the beginning of wave steepening fig 17a as the wave continues to propagate the front of the wave gradually sharpens due to shallowing fig 17b and c and the front of the wave becomes even sharper for the permeable beach with a higher wave peak than impermeable beach but the wave front propagates a little bit slower fig 17c this is due to the backward flow formed in the preamble layer after wave breaking the breaking surge propagates on the sloped beach for impermeable beach this duration is a little longer fig 17d to h than for the permeable beach fig 17d to g the maximum wave runup height for the permeable beach is much lower than that of impermeable beach compared to the impermeable beach the water surface doesn t fluctuate as much for a permeable beach after the surge receded fig 17i and g at beginning of wave climbing the velocity contours for permeable and impermeable beaches look very similar except very limited flow current existing in permeable layer fig 18 a as the wave climbs further flow speed increases gradually in the permeable layer and water in the permeable layer can flow backwards towards the origin of the wave making the wave front shaper but slower fig 18b after wave breaking a high speed surge flow is formed within a thin layer for impermeable beach fig 18c left side but the amount of surge flow for the permeable beach is very small with a relative smooth surge front fig 18c right side later the velocity of the wave surge flow for the permeable beach decreases at a high rate compared to the impermeable beach fig 18d meanwhile the water elevation in the permeable layer also increases gradually fig 18 c to e right side fig 19 shows the temporal evolution of energy for the water inside the computational domain both kinematic and potential energy of the water body gradually increase as the solitary wave enters the computational domain t 1 4s for the impermeable beach kinematic energy remains nearly constant between when the solitary wave entered the computational domain and before breaking initiated fig 19a red dash line once wave breaking initiates kinematic energy is substantially reduced and the potential energy greatly increases as the wave surge climbs fig 19b red dash line however for the permeable beach the kinematic energy of the water body continuously dissipates and dissipation accelerates with time for the impervious beach during wave breaking ke decreases while pe increases however for the permeable beach ke and pe both decrease during wave breaking fig 19a and b blue solid line this is because energy can be greatly dissipated by the permeable layer once the breaking surge recedes from sloped beach ke gradually increases for impermeable beach fig 19a red dash line t 8s however for permeable beach ke increases a little and is quickly damped out by the permeable layer fig 19a blue solid line t 8s the phenomena are also reflected in the variation of their pe during receding process fig 19b for both permeable and impermeable beaches the total energy of the water body gradually decreases and the decreasing rate for permeable beach is much higher than impermeable beach fig 19c overall the numerical simulations clearly show that the hydrodynamic characteristics of wave breaking on a permeable beach are vastly different from an impermeable beach 4 2 effects of permeable layer thickness this section focusses on the impact of permeable layer thickness on the runup process of the solitary wave five permeable layer thickness ratios b h and incident wave height ratios h h are selected and are 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 for both b h and h h porosity of the permeable layer is set as n 0 5 fig 20 shows snapshots of velocity contours at two different times for different permeable layer thicknesses when the wave height ratio h h 0 3 it is found that the wave front gradually become sharper as the thickness increases before wave breaking after wave breaking the wave surge is formed and runs up on the beach model results indicate that the magnitude of current velocity of the surge head decreases gradually with permeable layer thickness b this suggests that increasing the permeable layer thickness will reduce the maximum runup height the temporal evolution of the total energy for different permeable layer thicknesses are plotted in fig 21 the figure shows that the total energy is substantially reduced after wave breaking and that the reduction in total energy increases with permeable layer thickness the curve of the maximum runup r as function of permeable layer thickness is plotted in fig 22 for different wave heights computational results for impermeable beach are also included for comparison the figure shows that even when permeable layer thickness is relatively small b h 0 1 the maximum wave height can be greatly reduced for a permeable layer thickness b h of 0 1 the maximum runup height is reduced by 70 60 for the impermeable case for a wave height ratio h h 0 1 h h 0 5 although the maximum wave runup height monotonically decreases with permeable layer thickness the rate of decrease is greatly reduced after b h 0 2 4 3 effects of medium diameter and porosity this section examines the effects of medium diameter and the porosity of the permeable layer to examine the effect of the medium diameter five different values are selected d 50 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 m the same five different incident wave height ratios are selected as in section 4 2 h h 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 for examining the impacts related to porosity four different values are selected n 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the thickness of the permeable layer is set as b h 0 3 as seen in fig 23 the temporal evolution of the total energy for different d50 values are nearly identical fig 23a a zoomed view shows that the reduction percentage in total energy increases with medium diameter but the differences among different medium diameters are very limited and can be ignored fig 23b the medium diameter also has limited impact on the maximum wave runup height of breaking solitary wave on permeable beach fig 24 porosity has some impact on the hydrodynamic characteristics of wave breaking fig 25 both reduction percentage and reduction rate of total energy increases with the porosity of the permeable layer the maximum wave run height under different porosities are plotted as function of wave height ratio fig 26 the figure shows that the maximum wave runup height decreases with increasing porosity it shows that increasing porosity results in lower maximum wave runup height due to the energy dissipation increasing with porosity 4 4 further discussion on the maximum runup based on a series of experimental work carried out for solitary wave runup on an impermeable beach synolakis 1986 derived an empirical formula for calculating the maximum wave runup height r as 13 r h 1 109 h h 0 582 although eq 13 is very successfully for predicting the breaking solitary wave runup height on an impermeable beach the effects of permeable materials aren t accounted for in this section based on all of simulation results demonstrated in previous sections eq 14 is adapted to account for the effects permeability of the beach as 14 r h 1 109 h h 0 582 1 0 884 b h 0 186 1 0 752 n 1 705 eq 14 will be reduced to eq 13 if the permeability and the thickness of the permeable layer is zero fig 27 plots the comparison between simulation results and calculation by eq 14 since the adjusted r 2 of curve fitting is 0 947 the computational capability of eq 14 is reliable 5 conclusions this paper numerically investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of a solitary wave breaking during runup for an impermeable and permeable sloped beach using a nonhydrostatic numerical model the computational capability of the numerical model was verified by numerically reproducing experimental observations made for the case of an impermeable sloped beach predicted maximum wave runup heights are in good agreement with both measured data and the empirical formula proposed by synolakis 1987 furthermore by simulating solitary wave over permeable breakwater we also verified the computational capability of the numerical model with regards to calculating the flow field in a porous medium the numerical model was then applied to study the maximum wave runup height of a breaking solitary wave on permeable beach considering three prominent factors the permeable layer thickness b the medium diameter d 50 and the porosity major findings of this work are 1 the permeability of the beach has a substantial impact on the flow field for breaking waves running up a sloped beach the maximum wave runup height can be substantially reduced if the permeability of the beach is considered even for a relatively thin permeable layer thickness b h 0 1 the maximum runup height was reduced by nearly 70 for wave height ratio h h 0 1 and to by 60 for wave height ratio h h 0 5 2 the thickness of the permeable layer has great impact on the maximum wave runup height the maximum wave runup height decreases with permeable layer thickness b however the reduction rate gradually decreases for b h 0 2 3 the influence of medium diameter d 50 on the maximum wave runup height was limited and can be ignored 4 the porosity of the permeable layer has some influence on the maximum wave runup height r decreases with n 5 by analyzing the computational results empirical formula for predicting the maximum wave runup height for impermeable beach has been adapted to account for the effects of permeability it shows the newly updated formula can predict the maximum wave runup height of solitary wave on permeable beach with an

22321,the detection sensitivity of pipe pile defects during low strain integrity testing is investigated with the consideration of soil plug the soil sandwiched in neck defect and high frequency interference at pile head the additional mass model and fictitious ring soil pile model frspm are introduced to simulate the soil plug effect and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect respectively the high frequency interference is realized by considering the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions an analytical solution for the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile is derived in the frequency domain through the transfer function method and the corresponding semi analytical solution in the time domain is then obtained by using the inverse fourier transform the reasonability and accuracy of the developed solution are verified by a series of field experiments the dynamic interaction between the neck defect and the frspm is clarified via the parameter sensitivity analysis the non detection zone of pipe pile during low strain integrity testing is analyzed it is shown that the main factors to affect detection accuracy are the reduction degree and the location of defects and there exists a location non detection zone near the pipe pile toe keywords pipe pile defect soil plug effect additional mass model fictitious ring soil pile model low strain integrity testing 1 introduction integrity testing is an integral part of quality assurance programs for pile foundations to ensure their satisfactory performance low strain integrity test based on the wave propagation theory provides cost efficient and practical method for evaluating pile integrity current research on the detection of pile defects during low strain integrity test can be divided into two broad classes the dynamic pile soil interaction and the three dimensional 3d wave propagation effects in the pile extensive researches have been conducted to characterize the mechanism of pile soil interaction wang et al 2010 used a general voigt model to simulate the dynamic interaction between a prefabricated square pile and surrounding soil gao et al 2016 derived an analytical solution with the winkler model for the detection of the variable modulus defects lü et al 2014 employed a 3d continuum model which can allow for both vertical and radial continuity conditions at the soil pile interface to explore the effect of the transverse inertia on the dynamic response of a defective pile wu et al 2012 2014 2016 adopted the fictitious soil pile model which regards the soil underlying the pile toe as an extension of the pile shaft to detect the settlement under the pile toe gao et al 2017 pursued the fictitious soil pile model and proposed the fictitious ring soil pile model to simulate the dynamic interaction between the neck defects and the surrounding soil large solid piles or pipe piles exhibit obvious 3d effect during low strain integrity testing the 3d effect at pile head will cause serious high frequency interference which is often misinterpreted as the reflected signal from pile anomalies or may obscure the reflected signal from pile anomalies and pile toe therefore many researchers have investigated the influence of 3d effect on the detection of pile defects during low strain integrity testing liao and roesset 1997 utilized a 3d axisymmetric finite element model to evaluate the capabilities of low strain testing in detecting the location and length of pile defects chow et al 2003 reported that the anomaly near the pile head may be distinguished by observing the peak amplitude of the negative dip which is immediately followed the incident wave and can be eliminated by moving the receiving accelerometer sufficiently far from the impact point for a intact pile however for a defective pile the negative dip can be hardly weakened no matter where the receiving accelerometer is located phoon and chai 2013 recommended that the second incident wave signal reflected from the pile toe can be utilized to distinguish the defect reflected signal from the strong high frequency interference the finite element method has obvious advantages in dealing with variable particular pile defects such as local defects or longitudinal crack zheng et al 2016a derived a 3d axisymmetric analytical solution to investigate the detection of a solid pile with variable cross section or modulus defects various defects can be found during pipe pile construction especially for cast in place concrete large diameter pipe piles pcc where bulging necking slurry scrappy and weak concrete often occur during casting concrete and retrieving the double walled steel casing karreman 2006 liu et al 2009 compared with solid piles the low strain testing for pipe piles is more complex owing to their lower flexural stiffness pipe piles are likely to produce more profound 3d disturbance under eccentric force ding et al 2011 zheng et al 2015 li et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in addition the soil plug also adds more ambiguities to assessing the pile soil interaction mechanism wu et al 2017a observed that the apparent wave velocity of pipe pile decreases with the increase of soil plug height and proposed the additional mass model to reflect this phenomenon wu et al 2017b further employed the additional mass model to evaluate the weld quality of prestressed pipe pile and achieved satisfied application effect liu et al 2018 found that the applicability of the plane section assumption becomes weaker owing to the soil plug effect although many works have been done on the detection of pipe piles the influence of soil plug and soil sandwiched in the neck defect on the detection of pipe pile defects are still not clarified another clear deficiency in current methods is that parameters of the pile defects are always assumed as certain values so that the reflected signals from the defects and high frequency disturbance could be well distinguished however the detection accuracy of defects in pipe piles has not yet been validated therefore in this paper the detection sensitivity range of pipe pile defects is analyzed through a semi analytical solution in the time domain based on the additional mass model and the fictitious soil pile model the influence of high frequency interference is also taken into consideration 2 mathematical model and assumptions the soil pile interaction model is established in the cylindrical coordinate system as depicted in fig 1 to better reflect the variation of the modulus or the pipe pile cross section and soil properties the soil pile system is divided into a total number of k segments or layers along the vertical direction which are marked by 1 2 j k from pile toe to pile head the pile cross section and the elastic modulus of pile and soil are assumed to be homogeneous within each segment or layer but may vary from segment to segment or layer to layer the pile length is represented as h the wall thickness outer radius inner radius and average radius of the jth pipe pile segment are denoted as b j r j 1 r j 2 and r j r j 1 r j 2 2 respectively while h j represents the bottom surface depth of the jth soil pile segment the additional mass model is introduced to simulate the dynamic interaction between the pipe pile and soil plug the unit mass of the jth soil plug layer is expressed as m j s which is connected to the jth pile segment through the distributed voigt model where the spring constant and damping coefficient are denoted by k j and c j respectively for the pile segment without soil plug the value of m j s is set to zero two types of defective piles are considered herein the first one is a pile with a weak concrete zone defect which may be simulated by the locally varying young s modulus the second is a pile with a neck defect which can be represented by locally reducing the outer radius of the pile shaft the previous researches usually assume that there is no soil filling inside the empty volume due to the loss of the concrete in the neck defect for computational simplicity which cannot fully reflect the reality and may underestimate the defect condition in order to overcome this deficiency the fictitious ring soil pile model is employed to consider the dynamic interaction between the soil and the neck defect as shown in fig 1 r 0 is the outer radius of an intact pipe pile segment b j s r j 3 and r j s are the wall thickness outer and average radii of the fictitious ring soil pile respectively and can be expressed as b j s r j 3 r j 1 r j 3 r 0 and r j s r j 3 r j 1 2 the following assumptions are adopted during the analysis 1 only the vertical displacements in the soil pile system are taken into consideration and the vertical displacement of the pipe pile is assumed to be invariant in the radial direction zheng et al 2015 2016a 2016b 2 the soil is assumed to be viscoelastic stratified and extend infinitely in the radial direction a free boundary is set to the soil top surface the stress and displacement of the pile surrounding soil approach zero at an infinite radial distance 3 the soil pile system is subjected to small deformations and strains during vibration 4 for the pile segment with a neck defect the displacement of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched between the two adjacent normal pile segments is equal to that of the necking pile segment 5 at the beginning of vibration the displacement and velocity of the soil pipe pile system are set zero 3 general equations and their solutions 3 1 dynamic equation of soil adjacent to pile and its solution assuming plane strain conditions novak 1974 el naggar and novak 1994 the dynamic equation of the jth pile surrounding soil layer can be given by 1 r 2 d 2 w j r d r 2 r d w j r d r β j 2 r 2 w j r 0 j 1 2 k where w j r denotes the vertical displacement of the jth soil

segment and the jth soil plug segment respectively λ j g j and η j are the lame s constant shear modulus and material damping coefficient of the jth pipe pile segment respectively if the jth pipe pile segment has an intact cross section f j s represents the vertical complex stiffness of the jth soil layer acting on the per unit area of the outer wall of the jth pipe pile segment and thus f j s k j s 1 if the jth pipe pile segment exhibits a neck defect f j s indicates the dynamic frictional force developed at the interface of the fictitious ring soil pile and the jth pipe pile segment if there is a neck defect in the jth pipe pile segment the fictitious ring soil pile model can be introduced to simulate the dynamic interaction between the necking pipe pile segment and the additional soil embedded in the neck defect the dynamic equilibrium equation of the fictitious ring soil pile can then be formulated as 6 λ j s 2 g j s 2 u j s p z θ t z 2 η j s 3 u j s p z θ t z 2 t g j s r j s 2 2

vertical displacement of the fictitious ring soil pile ρ j s p λ j s g j s and η j s are the density lame s constant shear modulus and material damping coefficient of the fictitious ring soil pile respectively and their values are the same as those for the jth surrounding soil layer the dynamic equilibrium equation of the jth soil plug segment can be derived as 7 k j u j p z θ t u j s z θ t c j

developed in this paper has significant advantages over the existing models as it can account for the influence of the soil plug high frequency interference and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect on the dynamic response of the pile the soil plug and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect are simulated by the additional mass model and the fictitious ring soil pile model respectively the high frequency interference may be interpreted as the three dimensional effect of the pile since the authors previous work wu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 2019 has already proven that the additional mass model can accurately simulate the dynamic interaction between the soil plug and pile therefore the next thing we need to do is to separately utilize the present model to analyze the influence of the high frequency interference and the fictitious ring soil pile model on the defect detection during low strain testing if the present model can achieve a satisfied application effect then the reasonability and accuracy of the developed model can be verified 4 1 influence of high frequency interference on the defect detection the influence of high frequency interference on the defect detection was investigated through a series of field experiments conducted in one of the pile plants in ningbo china the geometry conditions of piles and defects are shown in fig 2 the parameters of piles and defects are presented in table 1 where the dimensionless l is introduced to represent the ratio of defect length to the total pile length for the defects with a length lower than a certain value say l d 75 mm the neck defects were prepared strictly following the theoretical model where the inner radius remains unchanged and the outer radius reduces homogenously leaving a ring shaped empty volume sandwiched between the two adjacent normal pile segments however for the pile with relatively large defects due to technical difficulties and limitation of the experimental conditions it is difficult to cut a long deep ring shaped empty volume in the pipe pile shaft therefore in order to keep the same defective degree we cut off the entire pile wall in the extent of the half pile perimeter to approximately simulate the theoretical model fig 3 depicts the comparison of measured and calculated dynamic velocity response of piles with different defect lengths it can be observed from fig 3 that the although there exists some discrepancy in the amplitude values of the reflected wave signals from defects and pile toe the waveforms of the calculated and measured curves are generally in a good agreement this discrepancy may be due to measurement error related to the sensitivity of the accelerometer given the high frequency and low peak amplitudes of the measured dynamic velocity response the arrival time of the peak value of the reflected signals from defects and pile toe are basically coincided indicating the theoretical model has high accuracy the tendency of the high frequency interference in the calculated curves confirms well with the measured ones as shown in fig 3 the peak value of the reflected signals from the defects decreases with the defect length when the defect length is lower than a certain value the reflected signal from the defect will be obstructed by the high frequency interference at the pile head the above analysis suggests that the developed model can accurately reflect the high frequency interference on the defect detection 4 2 influence of the fictitious ring soil pile model on the defect detection parameters used in this section are as follows the length outer radius inner radius poisson s ratio density and young s modulus of the pipe pile are 12 m 0 5 m 0 38 m 0 3 2500 kg m3 and 30 gpa respectively the height and density of the soil plug are equal to 12 m and 1800 kg m3 respectively the density and shear wave velocity of the adjacent soil and the soil plug are set to 1800 kg m3 and 50 m s respectively the values of spring constant and damping coefficient of the distributed voigt model are set to k 600 kn m 3 and c 300 kn s m 3 respectively liu et al 2018 owing to the asymmetric property of the impact force the pipe pile displays obvious flexural vibrations which gives rise to serious high frequency interference during low strain testing in order to minimize the interference caused by the flexural movement the receiver is often placed on the neutral plane of flexural vibration where the radius angle between the receiving acceleration transducer and impact point is set as θ 90 ding et al 2011 zheng et al 2016b the impulse width of impact force is set to t 1 4 ms the length and thickness of the top surface of the neck defect are set to 1 0 m and 6 0 m respectively the neck defect is simulated by locally reducing the outer radius of the pile to 0 44 m therefore the thickness of the necking pile segment comes to 0 06 m the present solution with the frspm can be degenerated into the solutions for an intact pile and for a pile with the conventional neck defect model no soil filling inside the empty volume due to the loss of concrete in neck defects by varying the parametric values of ring shaped soil structure sandwiched between the two adjacent normal pile segments the rationality and validity of the frspm are confirmed through the comparison between the degenerated solution presented in this study with the solutions for an intact pile and for a pile with the conventional neck defect model three cases of frspm are adopted in this section case 1 the longitudinal wave velocity and density of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched in the neck defect are set to 1 m s and 1 kg m3 respectively so that the developed solution can be approximately degenerated to the solution of a pile with conventional neck defect model no soil filling inside the empty volume case 2 the longitudinal wave velocity and density of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched in the neck defect are set to 300 m s and 1800 kg m3 respectively case 3 the longitudinal wave velocity and density of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched in the neck defect are set to 3500 m s and 2500 kg m3 respectively i e then the developed solution can represent an intact pipe pile fig 4 compares results from present solution with that of an intact pile and that of a pile with conventional neck defect model it can be seen from fig 4 that the curves of case 1 and case 3 agree well with that calculated using the conventional neck defect model and that of an intact pipe pile respectively this agreement confirms the validity of the frspm it can also be observed that the peak amplitude of the reflected signal from the necking pile segment in case 2 is smaller than that in the conventional defect curve if the low strain testing signal is interpreted without the consideration of the dynamic interaction between the neck defect and its sandwiched soil the actual defective degree of the neck defect will be underestimated moreover the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the necking pile segment is delayed as compared with that in the conventional defect curve and this phenomenon is in accordance with gao s conclusion for a solid necking pile gao et al 2017 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 parameter sensitivity analysis of the fictitious ring soil pile model in this section a parameter sensitivity analysis of the fictitious ring soil pile model is conducted considering different values of density and longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect and the thickness of the neck defect first the influence of the longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile is investigated the longitudinal wave velocity of the soil is set to 1 m s 300 m s 1000 m s and 3000 m s respectively the other parameters used herein are the same as those of case 3 used in section 4 fig 5 illustrates the influence of the longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile it can be observed from fig 5 that the variation of the longitudinal wave velocity of the frspm has a remarkable effect on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile the peak value of the reflected signal from the neck defect decreases gradually with the increase of the longitudinal wave velocity of the frspm if the measured reflected signal is interpreted without the consideration of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect the degree of the neck defect will be underestimated the arrival time of the reflected signal from the neck defect and the pile tip increases with the decrease of the longitudinal wave velocity of the frspm indicating that the neck defect can also lead to the decrease of apparent wave velocity of the pile fig 6 depicts the influence of the density of the frspm on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile the density of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect are varied as 1 kg m3 1500 kg m3 and 2000 kg m3 while other parameters are kept the same as those of case 3 compared with fig 5 the dynamic velocity response of the pile is not very sensitive to the frspm density and the variation of the frspm density gives rise to relatively small effect on the dynamic velocity response of the pile the longitudinal wave velocity v and density ρ can be generalized as the young s modulus e e ρ v 2 the loss of concrete of neck defects can be understood as the loss of the composite young s modulus the longitudinal wave velocity is the quadratic function of young s modulus and the density is the linear function of young s modulus that is the reason for the longitudinal wave velocity having a more remarkable influence on the dynamic velocity response of the pile than that of the density fig 7 demonstrates the influence of wall thickness of neck defect on the performance of the frspm the wall thickness of neck defect is set to b d 0 06 m or 0 08 m while other parameters are the same as those of case 3 it can be seen from fig 7 that as the wall thickness of the neck defect decreases the value and arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the defect increases gradually comparing with the results of the conventional defect model the reduction degree of the reflected signal peak from the defect due to the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect becomes more noticeable with the increase of the necking degree therefore as the wall thickness of the neck defect decreases the influence of frspm becomes more significant on the dynamic velocity response of the pile 5 2 influence of impulse width on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile fig 8 demonstrates the influence of impulse width on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile the impulse width of impact force is set to t 1 0 ms 1 4 ms 1 8 ms and 2 2 ms first the influence of impulse width on the high frequency interference at pipe pile head is investigated as shown in fig 8 with the increase of the impulse width the arrival times of the incident signal peak and the reflected signal peak from the pipe pile toe are both gradually decayed meanwhile the peak width of these signals increase gradually fig 8 also shows that when the impulse width is relatively small the peak value of the high frequency interference decreases significantly with the increasing impulse width however if the impulse width exceeds a certain value say 1 4 ms in this case the influence of the variation of the impulse width on the high frequency interference of pipe pile is neglectable fig 9 depicts the influence of impulse width on the detection accuracy of neck defects of pipe piles the pipe pile exhibits a neck defect extending between depth 6 0 m and 6 25 m where the thickness of the pile wall is locally decreased to 0 06 m as shown in fig 9 with the increase of impulse width the reflected signal peak from neck defect decreases gradually making it more difficult to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of the neck defect from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head this is because the characteristic wavelength increases with the impulse width chai et al 2010 which leads to a decrease in detection accuracy therefore in the remainder of this study the impulse width is set as 1 4 ms to guarantee the detection accuracy 5 3 influence of the defective degree on the integrity testing of pipe pile 5 3 1 non detection zone analysis for a pipe pile with neck defect the influence of length of the neck defect on the non detection zone of pipe pile is investigated first the inner and outer radii of the neck defect are taken equal to 0 38 m and 0 44 m respectively the depth of the top surface of neck defect is set to 6 0 m the length of the neck defect is set to l d 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 5 m and 1 0 m fig 10 demonstrates the influence of the neck defect length on the non detection zone of pipe pile as shown in fig 10 for an intact pipe pile the dynamic velocity response curve declines smoothly with time and the peak value of the high frequency interference also decreases gradually for a pile with neck defect the ortho kinetic reflected signal from the top surface of the defect can be received followed by the reverse reflected signal from the bottom surface of the defect consequently it can also be found that as the length of the neck defect decreases the reflected signal peak from the neck defect also decreases when the neck defect length is less than 0 5 m it becomes very difficult to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of the neck defect from the high frequency interference at pile head fig 11 depicts the influence of reduction degree of wall thickness on the non detection zone of pipe pile the depth of the neck defect extends from 6 m to 6 5 m where the inner radius remains 0 38 m and the wall thickness decreases to 0 10 m 0 08 m 0 06 m and 0 04 m respectively as shown in fig 11 when the wall thickness reduces less than 0 04 m which is about 1 3 of the normal wall thickness it is hard to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of neck defect from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head figs 10 and 11 show that both the neck defect and weak concrete defect will lead to the decrease of apparent wave velocity of the pile the previous studies have recognized that the weak concrete defect will lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity of the pile it is a new finding that the neck defect can also lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity of the pile due to the soil plug effect wu et al 2019 therefore the variation of the apparent wave velocity of the pile can be used to evaluate the pile quality fig 12 displays the influence of neck defect depths on the non detection zone of pipe pile the inner radius outer radius and length of the neck defect are set to 0 38 m 0 44 m and 0 5 m respectively the depth of the top surface of neck defect is set to 3 m 6 m and 9 m respectively it can be seen from fig 12 that when the neck defect is located at a shallow depth the reflected signal from the top and bottom surfaces of the neck defect can be clearly distinguished as the depth of the neck defect increases the reflected signal peak from the neck defect decreases gradually which makes it more difficult to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of the neck defect from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head the non detection zone range is enlarged with the increasing neck defect depth 5 3 2 non detection zone analysis for a pipe pile with weak concrete defect in this section the non detection zone analysis of a pipe pile with weak concrete defect is conducted first the influence of the length of the weak concrete defect on the non detection zone of pipe pile is investigated young s modulus of the concrete is reduced from the normal value of 30 gpa to20 gpa to simulate the weak concrete defect the depth of the weak concrete defect is set to 6 0 m the length of weak concrete defect is given as l d 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 5 m and 1 0 m respectively fig 13 shows that the influence of length of weak concrete defect on the non detection zone of pipe pile is similar with that of neck defect when the length of weak concrete defect is less than 0 5 m it becomes very difficult to accurately ascertain the quality of the weak concrete defect along the pile shaft fig 14 depicts the influence of reduction degree of concrete young s modulus on the non detection zone of pipe pile the weak concrete defect extends between depths 6 0 m and 6 5 m where the young s modulus of the weak concrete reduces from the normal 30 gpa to25 gpa 20 gpa 15 gpa and 10 gpa respectively it can be seen from fig 14 that similar to the influence of reduction in wall thickness on the non detection zone of pipe pile if concrete young s modulus is less than 1 3 of young s modulus of the normal pipe pile segment it can hardly distinguish the reflected signal of weak concrete defect from the high frequency interference at pile head fig 15 indicates the effect of weak concrete defect depth on the non detection zone of pipe pile as shown in fig 15 the influence of weak concrete defect depth on the non detection zone of pipe pile is similar to that of the neck defect i e the non detection zone range is enlarged as the depth of weak concrete defect increases based on the above analyses it can be concluded that there exists a defective non detection zone of pipe pile during low strain testing the defective non detection zone is mainly affected by the length depth and degree of defect but not the defective type i e neck or weak concrete as the defect depth increases the range of the non detection zone increases if the defect degree is within the non detection zone range the reflected signal from the defect may be obstructed by the high frequency interference at pile head making defect estimating more difficult 5 4 influence of location of defects on the integrity testing of pipe pile when the defect is near the pile head the reflected signal from defects may be obstructed by the incident wave signal or the high frequency interference the influence of shallow neck defect on the low strain testing of pile is demonstrated first the length and wall thickness of the neck defect are set to 0 5 m and 0 06 m respectively the depth of neck defect is set to 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m respectively as indicated in fig 16 the reflected signal from pile toe is typically much weaker than that for a solid pile due to the damping effect of soil plug and the relatively smaller wall thickness therefore the method of utilizing the second incident wave phoon and chai 2013 which is generated at the pile head by the reflection of the upward tip reflection to detect the shallow defect of a solid pile may not be suitable for pipe piles fig 16 shows that when the neck defect depth is less than 1 0 m the reflected signal from the neck defect cannot be distinguished from the waveform however the peak value of the negative dip following the incident signal increases noticeably this phenomenon is similar to a solid pile with a shallow defect chow et al 2003 and it can be further used to make a quick and preliminary evaluation of shallow defect near the pile head if the neck defect depth is close to 2 0 m the negative dip following the incident signal decreases with time and the negative dip width is larger than that of a normal pipe pile or that of a pile with neck defect buried more than 3 0 m for the case of neck defect buried more than 3 0 m the ortho kinetic and reverse reflected signals from the top and bottom surface of the neck defect can be clearly received and easily distinguished fig 17 depicts the influence of defects near the pile toe on the low strain testing of pile the neck defect and weak concrete defect near the pipe pile toe are considered respectively for the pile with neck defect near pile toe the length and wall thickness of neck defect are taken equal to 1 0 m and 0 06 m respectively the neck defect depth is set to 9 0 m 10 0 m and 11 0 m respectively for the pile with weak concrete defect near the pile toe the length and young s modulus of the weak concrete defect are given as 1 0 m and 15 gpa respectively the depth of weak concrete defect is set to 9 0 m 10 0 m and 11 0 m respectively fig 17a compares the dynamic velocity response of an intact pipe pile with that of a necking pile it can be observed from fig 17a that if the defects locate at a certain distance away from the pile toe the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the pile toe is delayed when compared with that of an intact pile which means the apparent wave velocity the pile gets smaller owing to the neck defect moreover as the neck defect depth increases the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the pile toe decreases gradually this phenomenon indicates that the attenuation effect of apparent wave velocity of the pile due to the neck defect becomes weaker as the neck defect is closer to the pile toe fig 17b compares the dynamic velocity response of an intact pile with that of a pile with weak concrete defect it can be seen from fig 17b that the influence of the location of weak concrete defect on the pile dynamic velocity response is similar to that of a pile with a neck defect nevertheless when the defect is close to the pile toe e g within 1 0 m the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the necking pipe pile toe is coincided with that of an intact pile it can be seen from fig 17 that when the defect locates at a certain distance away from the pile toe the defect can be recognized from the dynamic velocity response curve and the variation of the apparent wave velocity of the pile can also serve as an auxiliary method to preliminarily evaluate the pile quality when the defect is close to the pile toe it s very likely that the reflected signal from the defect would be obstructed by the reflected signal from pile toe therefore there exists a non detection zone near the pile toe during low strain integrity if the defect locates within this non detection zone it becomes very difficult to evaluate the pile quality no matter by recognizing the variation of the dynamic velocity response curve or comparing the variation of the apparent wave velocity 5 5 influence of soil plug on the detection of defective pipe pile the reflected wave signal from the top of soil plug may complicate the interpretation of the dynamic velocity response curve of pipe pile during low strain integrity testing in this section the influence of soil plug on the detection of pipe pile defect is presented a pipe pile with a neck defect extending between depth 6 0 m and 6 5 m is considered the wall thickness of the neck defect decreases to 0 08 m the schematic of the relative location between the neck defect and the top surface of soil plug is depicted in fig 18 as shown in fig 18 the height of soil plug is set to 12 m 9 m 6 25 m 6 m 5 75 m 3 m and 0 m respectively fig 19 demonstrates the influence of relative location between neck defect and top surface of soil plug on the detection of pipe pile defects as indicated in fig 19 with the decrease of soil plug height the peak of reflected signal from the neck defect increases gradually and the defective non detection zone range decreases gradually when the soil plug height is lower than a certain value the second ortho kinetic reflected signal from the neck defect can be received owing to the weakness of the damping effect of the soil plug in this case the method of using the second incident wave which is generated at the pile head by the reflection of the upward toe reflection to detect the shallow defect of a solid pile may be adopted to the detection of the shallow defect of pipe pile the apparent wave velocity of the pile increases with the decrease of the soil plug height if the measured result is interpreted simply based on the material longitudinal wave velocity of the pile the calculated length and depth of neck defect will be larger than the actual condition therefore when calculating the length and depth of the neck defect it is necessary to take the attenuation effect of the apparent wave velocity into consideration it can be observed from fig 19b that when the top of soil plug is close to the depth of neck defect the inverse reflected signal from soil plug top cannot be distinguished from the reflected signal of neck defect the reflected signal peak of neck defect is affected by the reflected signal of soil plug 6 conclusions the theoretical model developed in this paper has significant advantages over the existing models as it can account for the influence of the soil plug high frequency interference and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect on the dynamic response of the pile the additional mass model and fictitious ring soil pile model frspm are introduced to simulate the soil plug effect and the soil neck defect dynamic interaction respectively the high frequency interference is realized by considering the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions the specific conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the previous studies have recognized that the weak concrete defect will lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity of the pile it is a new finding that the neck defect can also lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity due to the soil plug effect therefore the variation of the apparent wave velocity can be used to evaluate the pile quality 2 the longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect is the major factor to affect the dynamic response of the pile if ignoring the dynamic interaction between the neck defect and its sandwiched soil the actual defective degree of the pile segment will be underestimated 3 the non detection zone of the defect is mainly associated with its reduction degree and location and it does not distinguish the difference between the neck and weak concrete defects 4 if the defect is near the pile head the peak value of the negative dip following the incident wave will increase significantly which can be used to make a quick and preliminary evaluation of the shallow defect however when the defects locate near the pile toe it becomes difficult to be detected neither by recognizing the waveform of the dynamic velocity response curve or comparing the variation of the composite velocity of the longitudinal stress wave 5 the influence of impulse width on the high frequency interference at pipe pile head has a threshold value above this value the increase of impulse width can hardly weaken the high frequency interference but leads to a decrease in detection accuracy acknowledgements this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51578164

22321,the detection sensitivity of pipe pile defects during low strain integrity testing is investigated with the consideration of soil plug the soil sandwiched in neck defect and high frequency interference at pile head the additional mass model and fictitious ring soil pile model frspm are introduced to simulate the soil plug effect and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect respectively the high frequency interference is realized by considering the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions an analytical solution for the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile is derived in the frequency domain through the transfer function method and the corresponding semi analytical solution in the time domain is then obtained by using the inverse fourier transform the reasonability and accuracy of the developed solution are verified by a series of field experiments the dynamic interaction between the neck defect and the frspm is clarified via the parameter sensitivity analysis the non detection zone of pipe pile during low strain integrity testing is analyzed it is shown that the main factors to affect detection accuracy are the reduction degree and the location of defects and there exists a location non detection zone near the pipe pile toe keywords pipe pile defect soil plug effect additional mass model fictitious ring soil pile model low strain integrity testing 1 introduction integrity testing is an integral part of quality assurance programs for pile foundations to ensure their satisfactory performance low strain integrity test based on the wave propagation theory provides cost efficient and practical method for evaluating pile integrity current research on the detection of pile defects during low strain integrity test can be divided into two broad classes the dynamic pile soil interaction and the three dimensional 3d wave propagation effects in the pile extensive researches have been conducted to characterize the mechanism of pile soil interaction wang et al 2010 used a general voigt model to simulate the dynamic interaction between a prefabricated square pile and surrounding soil gao et al 2016 derived an analytical solution with the winkler model for the detection of the variable modulus defects lü et al 2014 employed a 3d continuum model which can allow for both vertical and radial continuity conditions at the soil pile interface to explore the effect of the transverse inertia on the dynamic response of a defective pile wu et al 2012 2014 2016 adopted the fictitious soil pile model which regards the soil underlying the pile toe as an extension of the pile shaft to detect the settlement under the pile toe gao et al 2017 pursued the fictitious soil pile model and proposed the fictitious ring soil pile model to simulate the dynamic interaction between the neck defects and the surrounding soil large solid piles or pipe piles exhibit obvious 3d effect during low strain integrity testing the 3d effect at pile head will cause serious high frequency interference which is often misinterpreted as the reflected signal from pile anomalies or may obscure the reflected signal from pile anomalies and pile toe therefore many researchers have investigated the influence of 3d effect on the detection of pile defects during low strain integrity testing liao and roesset 1997 utilized a 3d axisymmetric finite element model to evaluate the capabilities of low strain testing in detecting the location and length of pile defects chow et al 2003 reported that the anomaly near the pile head may be distinguished by observing the peak amplitude of the negative dip which is immediately followed the incident wave and can be eliminated by moving the receiving accelerometer sufficiently far from the impact point for a intact pile however for a defective pile the negative dip can be hardly weakened no matter where the receiving accelerometer is located phoon and chai 2013 recommended that the second incident wave signal reflected from the pile toe can be utilized to distinguish the defect reflected signal from the strong high frequency interference the finite element method has obvious advantages in dealing with variable particular pile defects such as local defects or longitudinal crack zheng et al 2016a derived a 3d axisymmetric analytical solution to investigate the detection of a solid pile with variable cross section or modulus defects various defects can be found during pipe pile construction especially for cast in place concrete large diameter pipe piles pcc where bulging necking slurry scrappy and weak concrete often occur during casting concrete and retrieving the double walled steel casing karreman 2006 liu et al 2009 compared with solid piles the low strain testing for pipe piles is more complex owing to their lower flexural stiffness pipe piles are likely to produce more profound 3d disturbance under eccentric force ding et al 2011 zheng et al 2015 li et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in addition the soil plug also adds more ambiguities to assessing the pile soil interaction mechanism wu et al 2017a observed that the apparent wave velocity of pipe pile decreases with the increase of soil plug height and proposed the additional mass model to reflect this phenomenon wu et al 2017b further employed the additional mass model to evaluate the weld quality of prestressed pipe pile and achieved satisfied application effect liu et al 2018 found that the applicability of the plane section assumption becomes weaker owing to the soil plug effect although many works have been done on the detection of pipe piles the influence of soil plug and soil sandwiched in the neck defect on the detection of pipe pile defects are still not clarified another clear deficiency in current methods is that parameters of the pile defects are always assumed as certain values so that the reflected signals from the defects and high frequency disturbance could be well distinguished however the detection accuracy of defects in pipe piles has not yet been validated therefore in this paper the detection sensitivity range of pipe pile defects is analyzed through a semi analytical solution in the time domain based on the additional mass model and the fictitious soil pile model the influence of high frequency interference is also taken into consideration 2 mathematical model and assumptions the soil pile interaction model is established in the cylindrical coordinate system as depicted in fig 1 to better reflect the variation of the modulus or the pipe pile cross section and soil properties the soil pile system is divided into a total number of k segments or layers along the vertical direction which are marked by 1 2 j k from pile toe to pile head the pile cross section and the elastic modulus of pile and soil are assumed to be homogeneous within each segment or layer but may vary from segment to segment or layer to layer the pile length is represented as h the wall thickness outer radius inner radius and average radius of the jth pipe pile segment are denoted as b j r j 1 r j 2 and r j r j 1 r j 2 2 respectively while h j represents the bottom surface depth of the jth soil pile segment the additional mass model is introduced to simulate the dynamic interaction between the pipe pile and soil plug the unit mass of the jth soil plug layer is expressed as m j s which is connected to the jth pile segment through the distributed voigt model where the spring constant and damping coefficient are denoted by k j and c j respectively for the pile segment without soil plug the value of m j s is set to zero two types of defective piles are considered herein the first one is a pile with a weak concrete zone defect which may be simulated by the locally varying young s modulus the second is a pile with a neck defect which can be represented by locally reducing the outer radius of the pile shaft the previous researches usually assume that there is no soil filling inside the empty volume due to the loss of the concrete in the neck defect for computational simplicity which cannot fully reflect the reality and may underestimate the defect condition in order to overcome this deficiency the fictitious ring soil pile model is employed to consider the dynamic interaction between the soil and the neck defect as shown in fig 1 r 0 is the outer radius of an intact pipe pile segment b j s r j 3 and r j s are the wall thickness outer and average radii of the fictitious ring soil pile respectively and can be expressed as b j s r j 3 r j 1 r j 3 r 0 and r j s r j 3 r j 1 2 the following assumptions are adopted during the analysis 1 only the vertical displacements in the soil pile system are taken into consideration and the vertical displacement of the pipe pile is assumed to be invariant in the radial direction zheng et al 2015 2016a 2016b 2 the soil is assumed to be viscoelastic stratified and extend infinitely in the radial direction a free boundary is set to the soil top surface the stress and displacement of the pile surrounding soil approach zero at an infinite radial distance 3 the soil pile system is subjected to small deformations and strains during vibration 4 for the pile segment with a neck defect the displacement of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched between the two adjacent normal pile segments is equal to that of the necking pile segment 5 at the beginning of vibration the displacement and velocity of the soil pipe pile system are set zero 3 general equations and their solutions 3 1 dynamic equation of soil adjacent to pile and its solution assuming plane strain conditions novak 1974 el naggar and novak 1994 the dynamic equation of the jth pile surrounding soil layer can be given by 1 r 2 d 2 w j r d r 2 r d w j r d r β j 2 r 2 w j r 0 j 1 2 k where w j r denotes the vertical displacement of the jth soil

and finally β j i ω v j s 1 1 i d j s 1 the general solution of eq 1 can be given in terms of bessel function as 2 w j r m j k 0 β j r n j i 0 β j r where i 0 and k 0 represent the modified bessel functions of order zero of the first and second kinds respectively m j and n j denote undetermined coefficients by virtue of the boundary conditions that the displacement and stress of the jth soil layer approach zero as r approaches infinity eq 2 yields n j 0 the vertical shear stress amplitude at any point within the jth soil layer can be written as 3 τ j r g j s 1 1 i d j s 1 d w j r d r g j

segment and the jth soil plug segment respectively λ j g j and η j are the lame s constant shear modulus and material damping coefficient of the jth pipe pile segment respectively if the jth pipe pile segment has an intact cross section f j s represents the vertical complex stiffness of the jth soil layer acting on the per unit area of the outer wall of the jth pipe pile segment and thus f j s k j s 1 if the jth pipe pile segment exhibits a neck defect f j s indicates the dynamic frictional force developed at the interface of the fictitious ring soil pile and the jth pipe pile segment if there is a neck defect in the jth pipe pile segment the fictitious ring soil pile model can be introduced to simulate the dynamic interaction between the necking pipe pile segment and the additional soil embedded in the neck defect the dynamic equilibrium equation of the fictitious ring soil pile can then be formulated as 6 λ j s 2 g j s 2 u j s p z θ t z 2 η j s 3 u j s p z θ t z 2 t g j s r j s 2 2

shown in eq 11 and eq 12 although the conditions for the embedded pipe pile have some differences with those of the rigid disc the solutions presented by lysmer and richart 1966 display high

developed in this paper has significant advantages over the existing models as it can account for the influence of the soil plug high frequency interference and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect on the dynamic response of the pile the soil plug and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect are simulated by the additional mass model and the fictitious ring soil pile model respectively the high frequency interference may be interpreted as the three dimensional effect of the pile since the authors previous work wu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 2019 has already proven that the additional mass model can accurately simulate the dynamic interaction between the soil plug and pile therefore the next thing we need to do is to separately utilize the present model to analyze the influence of the high frequency interference and the fictitious ring soil pile model on the defect detection during low strain testing if the present model can achieve a satisfied application effect then the reasonability and accuracy of the developed model can be verified 4 1 influence of high frequency interference on the defect detection the influence of high frequency interference on the defect detection was investigated through a series of field experiments conducted in one of the pile plants in ningbo china the geometry conditions of piles and defects are shown in fig 2 the parameters of piles and defects are presented in table 1 where the dimensionless l is introduced to represent the ratio of defect length to the total pile length for the defects with a length lower than a certain value say l d 75 mm the neck defects were prepared strictly following the theoretical model where the inner radius remains unchanged and the outer radius reduces homogenously leaving a ring shaped empty volume sandwiched between the two adjacent normal pile segments however for the pile with relatively large defects due to technical difficulties and limitation of the experimental conditions it is difficult to cut a long deep ring shaped empty volume in the pipe pile shaft therefore in order to keep the same defective degree we cut off the entire pile wall in the extent of the half pile perimeter to approximately simulate the theoretical model fig 3 depicts the comparison of measured and calculated dynamic velocity response of piles with different defect lengths it can be observed from fig 3 that the although there exists some discrepancy in the amplitude values of the reflected wave signals from defects and pile toe the waveforms of the calculated and measured curves are generally in a good agreement this discrepancy may be due to measurement error related to the sensitivity of the accelerometer given the high frequency and low peak amplitudes of the measured dynamic velocity response the arrival time of the peak value of the reflected signals from defects and pile toe are basically coincided indicating the theoretical model has high accuracy the tendency of the high frequency interference in the calculated curves confirms well with the measured ones as shown in fig 3 the peak value of the reflected signals from the defects decreases with the defect length when the defect length is lower than a certain value the reflected signal from the defect will be obstructed by the high frequency interference at the pile head the above analysis suggests that the developed model can accurately reflect the high frequency interference on the defect detection 4 2 influence of the fictitious ring soil pile model on the defect detection parameters used in this section are as follows the length outer radius inner radius poisson s ratio density and young s modulus of the pipe pile are 12 m 0 5 m 0 38 m 0 3 2500 kg m3 and 30 gpa respectively the height and density of the soil plug are equal to 12 m and 1800 kg m3 respectively the density and shear wave velocity of the adjacent soil and the soil plug are set to 1800 kg m3 and 50 m s respectively the values of spring constant and damping coefficient of the distributed voigt model are set to k 600 kn m 3 and c 300 kn s m 3 respectively liu et al 2018 owing to the asymmetric property of the impact force the pipe pile displays obvious flexural vibrations which gives rise to serious high frequency interference during low strain testing in order to minimize the interference caused by the flexural movement the receiver is often placed on the neutral plane of flexural vibration where the radius angle between the receiving acceleration transducer and impact point is set as θ 90 ding et al 2011 zheng et al 2016b the impulse width of impact force is set to t 1 4 ms the length and thickness of the top surface of the neck defect are set to 1 0 m and 6 0 m respectively the neck defect is simulated by locally reducing the outer radius of the pile to 0 44 m therefore the thickness of the necking pile segment comes to 0 06 m the present solution with the frspm can be degenerated into the solutions for an intact pile and for a pile with the conventional neck defect model no soil filling inside the empty volume due to the loss of concrete in neck defects by varying the parametric values of ring shaped soil structure sandwiched between the two adjacent normal pile segments the rationality and validity of the frspm are confirmed through the comparison between the degenerated solution presented in this study with the solutions for an intact pile and for a pile with the conventional neck defect model three cases of frspm are adopted in this section case 1 the longitudinal wave velocity and density of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched in the neck defect are set to 1 m s and 1 kg m3 respectively so that the developed solution can be approximately degenerated to the solution of a pile with conventional neck defect model no soil filling inside the empty volume case 2 the longitudinal wave velocity and density of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched in the neck defect are set to 300 m s and 1800 kg m3 respectively case 3 the longitudinal wave velocity and density of the ring shaped soil structure sandwiched in the neck defect are set to 3500 m s and 2500 kg m3 respectively i e then the developed solution can represent an intact pipe pile fig 4 compares results from present solution with that of an intact pile and that of a pile with conventional neck defect model it can be seen from fig 4 that the curves of case 1 and case 3 agree well with that calculated using the conventional neck defect model and that of an intact pipe pile respectively this agreement confirms the validity of the frspm it can also be observed that the peak amplitude of the reflected signal from the necking pile segment in case 2 is smaller than that in the conventional defect curve if the low strain testing signal is interpreted without the consideration of the dynamic interaction between the neck defect and its sandwiched soil the actual defective degree of the neck defect will be underestimated moreover the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the necking pile segment is delayed as compared with that in the conventional defect curve and this phenomenon is in accordance with gao s conclusion for a solid necking pile gao et al 2017 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 parameter sensitivity analysis of the fictitious ring soil pile model in this section a parameter sensitivity analysis of the fictitious ring soil pile model is conducted considering different values of density and longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect and the thickness of the neck defect first the influence of the longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile is investigated the longitudinal wave velocity of the soil is set to 1 m s 300 m s 1000 m s and 3000 m s respectively the other parameters used herein are the same as those of case 3 used in section 4 fig 5 illustrates the influence of the longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile it can be observed from fig 5 that the variation of the longitudinal wave velocity of the frspm has a remarkable effect on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile the peak value of the reflected signal from the neck defect decreases gradually with the increase of the longitudinal wave velocity of the frspm if the measured reflected signal is interpreted without the consideration of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect the degree of the neck defect will be underestimated the arrival time of the reflected signal from the neck defect and the pile tip increases with the decrease of the longitudinal wave velocity of the frspm indicating that the neck defect can also lead to the decrease of apparent wave velocity of the pile fig 6 depicts the influence of the density of the frspm on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile the density of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect are varied as 1 kg m3 1500 kg m3 and 2000 kg m3 while other parameters are kept the same as those of case 3 compared with fig 5 the dynamic velocity response of the pile is not very sensitive to the frspm density and the variation of the frspm density gives rise to relatively small effect on the dynamic velocity response of the pile the longitudinal wave velocity v and density ρ can be generalized as the young s modulus e e ρ v 2 the loss of concrete of neck defects can be understood as the loss of the composite young s modulus the longitudinal wave velocity is the quadratic function of young s modulus and the density is the linear function of young s modulus that is the reason for the longitudinal wave velocity having a more remarkable influence on the dynamic velocity response of the pile than that of the density fig 7 demonstrates the influence of wall thickness of neck defect on the performance of the frspm the wall thickness of neck defect is set to b d 0 06 m or 0 08 m while other parameters are the same as those of case 3 it can be seen from fig 7 that as the wall thickness of the neck defect decreases the value and arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the defect increases gradually comparing with the results of the conventional defect model the reduction degree of the reflected signal peak from the defect due to the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect becomes more noticeable with the increase of the necking degree therefore as the wall thickness of the neck defect decreases the influence of frspm becomes more significant on the dynamic velocity response of the pile 5 2 influence of impulse width on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile fig 8 demonstrates the influence of impulse width on the dynamic velocity response of pipe pile the impulse width of impact force is set to t 1 0 ms 1 4 ms 1 8 ms and 2 2 ms first the influence of impulse width on the high frequency interference at pipe pile head is investigated as shown in fig 8 with the increase of the impulse width the arrival times of the incident signal peak and the reflected signal peak from the pipe pile toe are both gradually decayed meanwhile the peak width of these signals increase gradually fig 8 also shows that when the impulse width is relatively small the peak value of the high frequency interference decreases significantly with the increasing impulse width however if the impulse width exceeds a certain value say 1 4 ms in this case the influence of the variation of the impulse width on the high frequency interference of pipe pile is neglectable fig 9 depicts the influence of impulse width on the detection accuracy of neck defects of pipe piles the pipe pile exhibits a neck defect extending between depth 6 0 m and 6 25 m where the thickness of the pile wall is locally decreased to 0 06 m as shown in fig 9 with the increase of impulse width the reflected signal peak from neck defect decreases gradually making it more difficult to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of the neck defect from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head this is because the characteristic wavelength increases with the impulse width chai et al 2010 which leads to a decrease in detection accuracy therefore in the remainder of this study the impulse width is set as 1 4 ms to guarantee the detection accuracy 5 3 influence of the defective degree on the integrity testing of pipe pile 5 3 1 non detection zone analysis for a pipe pile with neck defect the influence of length of the neck defect on the non detection zone of pipe pile is investigated first the inner and outer radii of the neck defect are taken equal to 0 38 m and 0 44 m respectively the depth of the top surface of neck defect is set to 6 0 m the length of the neck defect is set to l d 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 5 m and 1 0 m fig 10 demonstrates the influence of the neck defect length on the non detection zone of pipe pile as shown in fig 10 for an intact pipe pile the dynamic velocity response curve declines smoothly with time and the peak value of the high frequency interference also decreases gradually for a pile with neck defect the ortho kinetic reflected signal from the top surface of the defect can be received followed by the reverse reflected signal from the bottom surface of the defect consequently it can also be found that as the length of the neck defect decreases the reflected signal peak from the neck defect also decreases when the neck defect length is less than 0 5 m it becomes very difficult to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of the neck defect from the high frequency interference at pile head fig 11 depicts the influence of reduction degree of wall thickness on the non detection zone of pipe pile the depth of the neck defect extends from 6 m to 6 5 m where the inner radius remains 0 38 m and the wall thickness decreases to 0 10 m 0 08 m 0 06 m and 0 04 m respectively as shown in fig 11 when the wall thickness reduces less than 0 04 m which is about 1 3 of the normal wall thickness it is hard to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of neck defect from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head figs 10 and 11 show that both the neck defect and weak concrete defect will lead to the decrease of apparent wave velocity of the pile the previous studies have recognized that the weak concrete defect will lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity of the pile it is a new finding that the neck defect can also lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity of the pile due to the soil plug effect wu et al 2019 therefore the variation of the apparent wave velocity of the pile can be used to evaluate the pile quality fig 12 displays the influence of neck defect depths on the non detection zone of pipe pile the inner radius outer radius and length of the neck defect are set to 0 38 m 0 44 m and 0 5 m respectively the depth of the top surface of neck defect is set to 3 m 6 m and 9 m respectively it can be seen from fig 12 that when the neck defect is located at a shallow depth the reflected signal from the top and bottom surfaces of the neck defect can be clearly distinguished as the depth of the neck defect increases the reflected signal peak from the neck defect decreases gradually which makes it more difficult to accurately distinguish the reflected signal of the neck defect from the high frequency interference at pipe pile head the non detection zone range is enlarged with the increasing neck defect depth 5 3 2 non detection zone analysis for a pipe pile with weak concrete defect in this section the non detection zone analysis of a pipe pile with weak concrete defect is conducted first the influence of the length of the weak concrete defect on the non detection zone of pipe pile is investigated young s modulus of the concrete is reduced from the normal value of 30 gpa to20 gpa to simulate the weak concrete defect the depth of the weak concrete defect is set to 6 0 m the length of weak concrete defect is given as l d 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 5 m and 1 0 m respectively fig 13 shows that the influence of length of weak concrete defect on the non detection zone of pipe pile is similar with that of neck defect when the length of weak concrete defect is less than 0 5 m it becomes very difficult to accurately ascertain the quality of the weak concrete defect along the pile shaft fig 14 depicts the influence of reduction degree of concrete young s modulus on the non detection zone of pipe pile the weak concrete defect extends between depths 6 0 m and 6 5 m where the young s modulus of the weak concrete reduces from the normal 30 gpa to25 gpa 20 gpa 15 gpa and 10 gpa respectively it can be seen from fig 14 that similar to the influence of reduction in wall thickness on the non detection zone of pipe pile if concrete young s modulus is less than 1 3 of young s modulus of the normal pipe pile segment it can hardly distinguish the reflected signal of weak concrete defect from the high frequency interference at pile head fig 15 indicates the effect of weak concrete defect depth on the non detection zone of pipe pile as shown in fig 15 the influence of weak concrete defect depth on the non detection zone of pipe pile is similar to that of the neck defect i e the non detection zone range is enlarged as the depth of weak concrete defect increases based on the above analyses it can be concluded that there exists a defective non detection zone of pipe pile during low strain testing the defective non detection zone is mainly affected by the length depth and degree of defect but not the defective type i e neck or weak concrete as the defect depth increases the range of the non detection zone increases if the defect degree is within the non detection zone range the reflected signal from the defect may be obstructed by the high frequency interference at pile head making defect estimating more difficult 5 4 influence of location of defects on the integrity testing of pipe pile when the defect is near the pile head the reflected signal from defects may be obstructed by the incident wave signal or the high frequency interference the influence of shallow neck defect on the low strain testing of pile is demonstrated first the length and wall thickness of the neck defect are set to 0 5 m and 0 06 m respectively the depth of neck defect is set to 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m respectively as indicated in fig 16 the reflected signal from pile toe is typically much weaker than that for a solid pile due to the damping effect of soil plug and the relatively smaller wall thickness therefore the method of utilizing the second incident wave phoon and chai 2013 which is generated at the pile head by the reflection of the upward tip reflection to detect the shallow defect of a solid pile may not be suitable for pipe piles fig 16 shows that when the neck defect depth is less than 1 0 m the reflected signal from the neck defect cannot be distinguished from the waveform however the peak value of the negative dip following the incident signal increases noticeably this phenomenon is similar to a solid pile with a shallow defect chow et al 2003 and it can be further used to make a quick and preliminary evaluation of shallow defect near the pile head if the neck defect depth is close to 2 0 m the negative dip following the incident signal decreases with time and the negative dip width is larger than that of a normal pipe pile or that of a pile with neck defect buried more than 3 0 m for the case of neck defect buried more than 3 0 m the ortho kinetic and reverse reflected signals from the top and bottom surface of the neck defect can be clearly received and easily distinguished fig 17 depicts the influence of defects near the pile toe on the low strain testing of pile the neck defect and weak concrete defect near the pipe pile toe are considered respectively for the pile with neck defect near pile toe the length and wall thickness of neck defect are taken equal to 1 0 m and 0 06 m respectively the neck defect depth is set to 9 0 m 10 0 m and 11 0 m respectively for the pile with weak concrete defect near the pile toe the length and young s modulus of the weak concrete defect are given as 1 0 m and 15 gpa respectively the depth of weak concrete defect is set to 9 0 m 10 0 m and 11 0 m respectively fig 17a compares the dynamic velocity response of an intact pipe pile with that of a necking pile it can be observed from fig 17a that if the defects locate at a certain distance away from the pile toe the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the pile toe is delayed when compared with that of an intact pile which means the apparent wave velocity the pile gets smaller owing to the neck defect moreover as the neck defect depth increases the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the pile toe decreases gradually this phenomenon indicates that the attenuation effect of apparent wave velocity of the pile due to the neck defect becomes weaker as the neck defect is closer to the pile toe fig 17b compares the dynamic velocity response of an intact pile with that of a pile with weak concrete defect it can be seen from fig 17b that the influence of the location of weak concrete defect on the pile dynamic velocity response is similar to that of a pile with a neck defect nevertheless when the defect is close to the pile toe e g within 1 0 m the arrival time of the reflected signal peak from the necking pipe pile toe is coincided with that of an intact pile it can be seen from fig 17 that when the defect locates at a certain distance away from the pile toe the defect can be recognized from the dynamic velocity response curve and the variation of the apparent wave velocity of the pile can also serve as an auxiliary method to preliminarily evaluate the pile quality when the defect is close to the pile toe it s very likely that the reflected signal from the defect would be obstructed by the reflected signal from pile toe therefore there exists a non detection zone near the pile toe during low strain integrity if the defect locates within this non detection zone it becomes very difficult to evaluate the pile quality no matter by recognizing the variation of the dynamic velocity response curve or comparing the variation of the apparent wave velocity 5 5 influence of soil plug on the detection of defective pipe pile the reflected wave signal from the top of soil plug may complicate the interpretation of the dynamic velocity response curve of pipe pile during low strain integrity testing in this section the influence of soil plug on the detection of pipe pile defect is presented a pipe pile with a neck defect extending between depth 6 0 m and 6 5 m is considered the wall thickness of the neck defect decreases to 0 08 m the schematic of the relative location between the neck defect and the top surface of soil plug is depicted in fig 18 as shown in fig 18 the height of soil plug is set to 12 m 9 m 6 25 m 6 m 5 75 m 3 m and 0 m respectively fig 19 demonstrates the influence of relative location between neck defect and top surface of soil plug on the detection of pipe pile defects as indicated in fig 19 with the decrease of soil plug height the peak of reflected signal from the neck defect increases gradually and the defective non detection zone range decreases gradually when the soil plug height is lower than a certain value the second ortho kinetic reflected signal from the neck defect can be received owing to the weakness of the damping effect of the soil plug in this case the method of using the second incident wave which is generated at the pile head by the reflection of the upward toe reflection to detect the shallow defect of a solid pile may be adopted to the detection of the shallow defect of pipe pile the apparent wave velocity of the pile increases with the decrease of the soil plug height if the measured result is interpreted simply based on the material longitudinal wave velocity of the pile the calculated length and depth of neck defect will be larger than the actual condition therefore when calculating the length and depth of the neck defect it is necessary to take the attenuation effect of the apparent wave velocity into consideration it can be observed from fig 19b that when the top of soil plug is close to the depth of neck defect the inverse reflected signal from soil plug top cannot be distinguished from the reflected signal of neck defect the reflected signal peak of neck defect is affected by the reflected signal of soil plug 6 conclusions the theoretical model developed in this paper has significant advantages over the existing models as it can account for the influence of the soil plug high frequency interference and the dynamic interaction between the sandwiched soil and neck defect on the dynamic response of the pile the additional mass model and fictitious ring soil pile model frspm are introduced to simulate the soil plug effect and the soil neck defect dynamic interaction respectively the high frequency interference is realized by considering the stress wave propagating both in the vertical and circumferential directions the specific conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the previous studies have recognized that the weak concrete defect will lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity of the pile it is a new finding that the neck defect can also lead to the decrease of the apparent wave velocity due to the soil plug effect therefore the variation of the apparent wave velocity can be used to evaluate the pile quality 2 the longitudinal wave velocity of the ring shaped soil sandwiched in the neck defect is the major factor to affect the dynamic response of the pile if ignoring the dynamic interaction between the neck defect and its sandwiched soil the actual defective degree of the pile segment will be underestimated 3 the non detection zone of the defect is mainly associated with its reduction degree and location and it does not distinguish the difference between the neck and weak concrete defects 4 if the defect is near the pile head the peak value of the negative dip following the incident wave will increase significantly which can be used to make a quick and preliminary evaluation of the shallow defect however when the defects locate near the pile toe it becomes difficult to be detected neither by recognizing the waveform of the dynamic velocity response curve or comparing the variation of the composite velocity of the longitudinal stress wave 5 the influence of impulse width on the high frequency interference at pipe pile head has a threshold value above this value the increase of impulse width can hardly weaken the high frequency interference but leads to a decrease in detection accuracy acknowledgements this research is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51578164

22322,small high speed craft are the most vulnerable to the severity of the sea achieving a design which pairs good performance and acceptable levels of safety is not a trivial task the seakeeping and manoeuvrability of these vessels play a crucial role in following sea conditions dynamic instabilities namely broaching to and surf riding are more than a rare eventuality and threaten the survivability of the vessel and the life of the mariners this study investigates the effects of the steering qualities on the broaching to behaviour of a high speed craft when it is sailing in following and stern quartering waves the motions and loads of the vessel are simulated by means of a 3d time domain blended potential flow boundary element method bem validated using captive model tests in regular waves carried out at the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb of marin the hull directional stability and turning ability of the high speed craft were artificially modified showing that an increase in the directional stability as well as in the effectiveness of the steering can be beneficial to avoid the inception of broaching to but they have different consequences on the dynamics of the vessel s loss of control keywords manoeuvrability in waves high speed craft broaching to following sea captive model tests panel method 1 introduction the first research studies on the controllability of ships focused on displacement merchant vessels manoeuvring in calm water the most important aspects of the manoeuvrability of such ships were related to their ability to maintain a straight course with the minimum steering effort and to stop quickly before an obstacle or to avoid it by a safe turn for example these principles are still valid nowadays resolution 2002 and ships are designed according to these safety requirements the studies on the manoeuvrability of displacement vessels are numerous the same cannot be said for high speed craft usually high speed vessels must possess very good steering capabilities in order to be very manoeuvrable but they must also be able to easily maintain their course in a seaway from a technical point of view the controllability of small hard chine fast craft is more complicated because it depends on several factors which are not usually considered for conventional displacement ships forward speed vertical running attitude wave making effects and flow separation on knuckles are decisive factors in the manoeuvring behaviour of small fast vessels the manoeuvring characteristics of high speed craft can be very important in rough seas small vessels are more subjected than big displacement ships to dangerous motions and large fluctuations of forward speed the hazard related to small vessels sailing in the following sea is well known dynamic instability phenomena such as broaching to are events strongly dreaded by mariners a broach or broaching to is the involuntary yawing movement of the vessel caused by the incoming following wave the vessel suddenly turns broadside to the seaway because of the large destabilizing wave yawing moment in this situation the steering is difficult and the vessel continues a turning motion despite the maximum control counter action from the rudder the loss of control of the ship puts the safety of the crew on board in great danger in extreme cases broaching to can lead to the capsize of the vessel the characteristics of the phenomenon of broaching to are well known du cane and goodrich 1962 spyrou 1996 umeda 1999 umeda and matsuda 2000 renilson 1981 2014 renilson and driscoll 1982 according to the definition by cohen and blount 1986 broaching to is a non oscillatory combined yaw roll dynamic instability which occurs at medium high speed typically at a length froude number higher than 0 3 the ships which are more subjected to such dynamic instability are therefore relatively small vessels up to 70 m in length which operate in the pre planing regime high speed craft fishing vessels patrol boats small frigates and destroyers broaching to can be considered as a single wave event it usually occurs when the wave length is between 1 to 3 ship lengths and when the wave height is large enough de jong et al de jong et al 2015 showed that the likelihood of broaching increases with the wave steepness usually a broaching to event is preceded by another known and widely analysed phenomenon surf riding spyrou 2006 maki et al 2010 the vessel is captured by the incoming wave and accelerated to the wave celerity the vessel then spends a lot of time at one longitudinal position in the wave typically the front see the work of renilson 2014 at this longitudinal position the destabilizing wave yawing moment grows larger such that the turning moment on the ship from the wave cannot be compensated for by the steering counter action the dynamics of this phenomenon is usually very quick and violent a broach occurs in few seconds and the vessel s yaw rate can be extremely high the destabilizing yawing moment is greater at a greater heading angle but as shown in de jong et al 2015 this does not necessarily increase the likelihood of a broach the reason for this is that at higher wave incidence angles a surf ride is less likely since there is a larger difference in the relative speed between the ship and the wave surf riding and broaching to are thus strictly connected phenomena a broach occurs shortly after the onset of a surf riding without this precondition in most cases the ship experiences just a periodic motion the research presented in this paper aims to investigate the inception of this dangerous dynamic instability phenomena in following seas designers and researchers are aware of the circumstances in which a broach could occur as well as of the kinematics which characterises it what is still not clear it is the reason why certain ships suffer more than others from broaching to and which aspects determine the likelihood of a vessel to lose control in the following sea this debate is still open and a solution must be sought in order to assess the capabilities of a vessel to manoeuvre at sea which is a problematic task because of its complexity the issue of manoeuvring in waves of fast vessels is rarely investigated during the design process as a result of this lack of knowledge the controllability of small high speed craft is often entrusted to the masters and the helmsmen who operate the vessel this is also motivated by the fact that the skills of the mariners are considered more important than the inherent characteristics of the small vessels for their safety as conolly explained in conolly 1972 referring to the following sea scenarios mariners tend to be philosophical on this subject and to accept the problems of following seas as a natural environmental hazard they rely heavily on individual experiences and would not necessarily all follow the same course of action when confronted by a given set of circumstances however this was written in 1972 and both technology and the expectations of mariners regarding the design of their vessels have changed since then therefore designers must have sufficient certainties regarding the solutions to adopt in order to prevent or at least mitigate the vessel vulnerability to dynamic instabilities this is of vital importance for a reliable safety assessment of a fast craft sailing in rough sea the dutch rescue boat sar nh 1816 operated by the royal netherlands sea rescue institution knrm was chosen in this work as test case for the investigation of the steering qualities of high speed craft in the following sea the nh 1816 is the result of an innovative and versatile design project keuning et al 2011 originating from the upgrade of the rescue vessel arie visser converted to the axe bow concept keuning 2006 the axe bow is designed to improve the response of the ship in head waves the craft is equipped with two water jets which facilitate rescue operations and ensure good manoeuvrability and with two retractable skegs which improve the course stability in the seaway the main parameters of the vessel and its hull lines are shown respectively in table 1 and fig 1 one of the most reliable ways to investigate the manoeuvring characteristics of a vessel is by means of model experiments however for manoeuvring in wave problems experimental techniques are often complicated and expensive since the number of model experiments required to cover an adequate range of conditions would be too extensive experimental studies on the manoeuvrability of high speed craft are rare and often restricted to the calm water case yasukawa et al 2016 de jong et al 2013 bonci et al 2017 2018 in following sea research free sailing model tests are generally preferred nicholson 1974 umeda and hamamoto 2000 renilson and tuite 1998 umeda et al 2008 2016 since it is possible to directly assess the vulnerability of a vessel to the onset of broaching to captive model tests in waves are often limited to very few wave and model speed conditions since they are time consuming and difficult to set up however measuring forces and moments acting on the model in a captive model test generates a deeper understanding into the dynamics of the vessel sailing in the seaway manoeuvring in waves numerical simulations are usually carried out in the time domain since it is possible to describe the high frequency loads in the vertical plane and the low frequency ones in the horizontal plane well in common state of art mathematical tools used for manoeuvring in waves applications the manoeuvrability loads are formulated with calm water models whereas froude krylov and restoring terms are calculated on the actual wavy submerged geometry this is a feasible approach for medium large vessels the waves are smaller than the vessel size and do not influence the characteristics of the submerged geometry nor the manoeuvrability loads this is not applicable for small fast craft the waves in which they operate are comparable with the vessel size therefore the submerged geometry and the hydrodynamic loads change with respect to the position in the waves because of this unified seakeeping and manoeuvrability simulation tools which directly compute the overall loads acting on the hull at each time step are recommended in the study of high speed craft sailing in waves brute force ranse solvers are capable of providing an accurate description of the dynamics of the vessel however due to the great computational effort required their utilization in manoeuvring in waves problems is not practical less accurate potential flow models such as panel methods bem have been demonstrated to be an optimal option between a reliable description of the ship dynamics and a reasonable demand of computational effort in this study captive model tests on the model of the sar nh 1816 were carried out at the smb of marin in following and stern quartering waves the objective was twofold first the analysis of the hull and steering loads acting on the vessel when sailing in waves second the validation of a 3d bem in the prediction of such loads the 3d bem was then used to investigate the inception of dynamic instabilities in the following sea the validation of this model allowed both a qualitative and quantitative prediction of the broaching behaviour of the nh 1816 2 mathematical model unified seakeeping and manoeuvring mathematical models are the state of art tools used for manoeuvring in waves problems bailey et al 1997 fossen 2003 skejic and faltinsen 2008 both the manoeuvrability and the seakeeping of a vessel must be predicted accurately by the numerical simulations the vessel dynamics in the vertical and horizontal planes as well as its propulsive characteristics can interact with each other in a review of the mathematical methods used to study manoeuvrability in waves reed and beck 2018 considered potential flow methods as an optimal compromise between the accuracy of the results and the range of applicability when compared to more sophisticated tools ranse solvers or simpler parametric models in the current study a 3d bem was chosen to simulate the motions of a free sailing high speed craft in stern quartering seas in the time domain in six degrees of freedom dof the tool was developed mainly by van walree van walree 1999 and de jong de jong 2011 for both head de jong and van walree 2009 de jong and van walree 2008 and following waves applications de jong et al 2015 de jong et al 2013 van walree and de jong 2011 solving a potential flow problem the 3d bem evaluates the hydrostatic froude krylov and hydrodynamic radiation and diffraction pressures acting on the ship hull the viscous effects and the propulsive and steering device loads are calculated using semi empirical formulations the hydrodynamic components of the loads are evaluated only on the calm water submerged geometry corresponding to the running equilibrium position of the vessel at the relevant speed this allows for the linearization of the free surface boundary conditions and the definition of a unique influence function reducing the computational time albeit with a slightly lower accuracy the vessel is initially in its running vertical equilibrium condition while the waves are ramped up the propulsion rate is kept constant during the entire simulation the initial heave and pitch the wave ramp up factor the propulsion rate and the other important simulation parameters are chosen in such a way to give the smoothest start and not to alter the final outcomes of the simulations the angle of the steering devices is automatically set by the auto pilot equation given in equation 1 1 δ b δψ r c δψ ψ the auto pilot is meant to keep the initial course direction of the vessel correcting the deviation in heading ψ and its rate of change r the main characteristics of the vessel steering are shown in table 2 all the motions and loads refer to the ship fixed coordinate system in fig 2 with origin at the ship centre of gravity g the motion equations in surge sway roll and yaw are given in equations 2 5 in dimensional form 2 m m x u mvr x h x w x r 3 m m y v mur m y α x ṙ y h y w y r 4 i x j x ṗ k h k w k r 5 i z j z ṙ m y α x v n h n w n r the equations in heave and pitch are not considered however the vertical and components of the loads and thus the actual trim and sink rise of the craft in the waves are maintained by the 3d bem in a quasi static manner because the variations in submerged geometry due to the motions in heave and pitch influence the manoeuvring of the vessel the loads acting on the vessel are divided into hull loads both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic subscript h wave loads subscript w and the propulsive and steering forces provided by the waterjets subscript r each of these terms depends on the vessel speed the wave characteristics the longitudinal location of the ship in the waves and its running attitude which defines its submerged geometry in the waves the hull component of the loads acting on the ship can be described using the derivatives of the loads with respect to the motions hydrodynamic coefficients as in equations 6 9 6 x h r t u x vv v 2 7 y h y v v y r m r y φ φ 8 k h k φ m gm t φ k v v k r r 9 n h n v v n r r n φ φ these equations are given in non dimensional form all the non dimensional quantities are obtained dividing them with the correct combination of water density ρ ship reference length l and forward speed u according to the convention used for manoeuvring see principles of naval archi 1988 and hereby denoted with the superscript in a similar way it is possible to linearize the wave sway force roll and yaw moments with respect to the wave incidence angle μ as done in equations 10 to 12 10 y w y μ μ 11 k w k μ μ 12 n w n μ μ the nh 1816 rescue vessel taken as object of the investigation is equipped with waterjets the forces and moments generated by the waterjets are calculated in the simulations according to the equations 13 16 13 x r ρq u noz c m ucosβ r cosδ 14 y r ρq u noz c m ucosβ

flow incidence angle at the waterjet inlet u noz is the flow speed at the waterjet nozzle located at the longitudinal and vertical coordinate x noz and z noz c m is an empirical coefficient representing the flow momentum due to the impeller suction 3 the prediction of the hull loads in following and stern quartering waves in this section the capability of the 3d bem for prediction of the manoeuvring loads is assessed the calculated loads are compared with the results from captive model tests carried out at the smb of marin both in calm water and in regular following and stern quartering waves a photograph of the ship model used in the tests is shown in fig 3 the bem used for the simulation of the ship motions is a blended method the inflow potential on each of the hull panels is composed of the radiation potential and the froude krylov diffraction potential it is impossible in a free sailing vessel simulation to clearly separate the effects of the loads in waves as written in equations 2 5 in order to investigate the numerical prediction of the manoeuvring forces and moments the same experimental captive model tests were reproduced numerically therefore the single contributions to the total loads can be computed and compared with the experimental data the experiments in regular waves were carried out at constant steepness h λ 0 06 taken as the upper limit to ensure good quality waves and to avoid wave breaking a number of wave lengths and model speeds were chosen in order to realize conditions of following waves at low encounter frequency where the waves slowly overtake the model the experimental set up allowed the model to move in heave and pitch thus assuming its natural vertical position in the wave this is an important requirement of the experimental set up since the loads in the waves also depend on the vertical position of the model in waves the loads measured in this model test campaign refer to the bare hull without skegs the uncertainty of the measured data is expressed by the random errors precision limits evaluated from 12 repetitions of a single run for each case the particulars of the tests are summarised in table 3 fig 4 shows two pictures of a measurement run carried out at the smb three different types of experiments were carried out a tests at wave incidence angle with zero sway velocity the wave induced loads were measured at different wave incidence angles up to 25 degrees at this stage the model had zero sway velocity see fig 4 and hence there was no contribution to the sway force or yaw moment from the sway velocity thus the only loads which were measured were due to the wave b tests at pure sway motion in following waves the sway velocity induced loads were measured while the model was running with constant drift in waves the incidence angle between the direction of the waves and the ship longitudinal axis was zero see fig 4 and hence there was no contribution from the wave to the sway force or yaw moment thus the only loads which were measured were due to the sway velocity c tests with waterjets steering angles the steering loads of the waterjets were measured in waves at different steering angles in this condition the sway motion and the wave incidence angle were zero and hence there was no contribution to the loads from either the sway motion or the wave see fig 4 thus the only loads which were measured were due to the waterjet steering angle fig 5 shows a picture taken during a run in following waves the loads due to the sway velocity and the waterjet steering angle were also evaluated in calm water at the same model speeds as used for the tests in waves in order to make a comparison between the condition in calm water and the one in waves the results obtained from the tests are presented in terms of hydrodynamic coefficients or loads as functions of the position of the longitudinal centre of gravity g of the vessel in the waves denoted using the non dimensional parameter ξ g λ defined in fig 2 the results are presented in non dimensional form as shown in equations 17 20 for the force f moment m sway speed v and yaw velocity r 17 f f 0 5ρu 2 l

dimensional velocity components or the angles expressed in radians fig 6 shows an example of the fitting of the yaw moment due to sway in calm water and in two locations in waves for one condition tested the quality of the fitting is estimated by calculating the uncertainty of each measurement run ittc recommended procedure no 7 5 02 06 04 ittc 2014 and the standard estimation error see of the fitting line coleman and steele 1999 the total coefficient uncertainty is visualized by means of error bars on each coefficients value the same methodology can be found in bonci et al 2019 3 1 empirical description of the manoeuvring forces and moments the experimental results can be used to formulate an empirical description of the forces and moments due to manoeuvring at different combinations of vessel froude number and wave lengths it is important that the 3d bem can also predict the forces and moments acting on the hull in several other conditions different than the cases considered in the model tests the same approach can be found in bonci et al 2019 for this purpose it is useful to express concisely the coefficients in waves using very few parameters i e the amplitude the mean value and the phase of the sinusoidal signal of the relevant quantities as shown in fig 7 this approximation is valid under the hypothesis of linearity between the exciting wave and the output load which fits the forces and moments due to manoeuvring well this method assumes linearity between the wave and the loads acting on the hull this hypothesis approximates reasonably the measured data fig 8 compares the measured data for one condition in waves tested and the respective sinusoidal fitting those terms can be obtained by least square fitting of the sinusoidal signals as functions of the location of the ship in the wave ξ g λ each coefficient can be then expressed as in equation 21 with the term y v taken as example 21 y v a yv cos 2π ξ g λ φ yv η yv the amplitude phase and mean value can be plotted as functions of froude number and wave length for every condition tested the values of amplitude phase and mean of the experimental cases can be fitted using a plane as shown in fig 9 thanks to this plane the coefficients can be expressed using the plane polynomial terms as in equation 22 for the mean value of the coefficient y v 22 η yv p 0 p 1 fr p 2 λ l the terms p 0 p1 and p2 are the coefficients of the plane equation a planar fit was chosen as a first approximation of the coefficients in waves the empirical description was used to correct the numerical prediction of the loads predicted using the 3d bem the captive model tests were reproduced numerically with the 3d bem for the same conditions tested in the experiments as with the model test results the coefficients obtained numerically using the 3d bem can be used to define a numerical description by fitting the data with a plane as shown in fig 9 for the experimental cases the differences between the experimental and numerical plane fits can be calculated for every fr λ l combination and therefore used to correct the 3d bem prediction this correction allows an imperfect but reasonable agreement with the experimental results for a wide range of forward speeds and wave lengths the correction depends on how well the terms are distributed over the plane and on how different the initial numerical coefficients are from the experimental measurements the complete numerical experimental comparisons of amplitude a phase φ and mean value η are shown in the appendix for the coefficients induced by the waves and the sway velocity of the vessel 3 2 test a loads due to the wave the wave loads were computed using the 3d bem considering the froude krylov pressures on the actual wavy submerged geometry since the wave exciting forces are mainly potential the boundary element mathematical methods are expected to predict these loads rather well fig 10 shows the uncorrected numerical and the measured wave loads confirming the initial expectations some discrepancies can still be observed especially in the roll moment however the 3d bem provides a reasonable prediction of the wave excitation therefore the predictions from the 3d bem do not need to be corrected in this case a comparison between the measured and predicted wave loads for a single run is shown in fig 10 a more detailed comparison of the measured and predicted wave surge force x w and wave coefficients y μ k μ and n μ is given in the appendix 3 3 test b loads due to sway velocity it is much more difficult to accurately predict the manoeuvring forces and moments such as the forces caused by the sway velocity using potential methods the forces and moments acting on a hard chine craft due to sway velocity are governed by complex phenomena such as spray generation and flow separation at the chine and at the transom moreover the presence of the wave increases the complexity of the phenomena acting on the hull the results of the predictions obtained using the 3d bem were then corrected as explained in section 3 1 the comparison between the corrected bem and measured sway hydrodynamic coefficients is shown in fig 11 for one case a wider and more detailed comparison is given in appendix when a free running ship is sailing in following waves it is subjected to large fluctuations in its surge velocity in extreme cases the ship is forced to travel at wave speed known as surf riding as discussed above surf riding is a prerequisite of broaching to a good match between the measured and predicted loads from the captive model tests is not enough to judge the behaviour of the vessel when it is freely running in a seaway because in the model tests the vessel forward speed is kept constant whereas it is variable in the free running case the 3d bem accounts for the variation of the loads due to the change in forward speed which gives the correction applied at the initial speed therefore it is of paramount importance that the 3d bem is capable of predicting the change in the hydrodynamic loads due to forward speed fig 12 depicts the comparison between the measured and predicted coefficients y v k v and n v in calm water as a function of froude number over the speed range investigated the comparison shows that the 3d bem can be used to qualitatively predict the trend of the hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to the forward velocity 3 4 test c waterjet steering loads the steering loads generated by the waterjets at different deflection angles δ were measured during the model tests both in calm water and in waves fig 13 shows the waterjet arrangements during the experimental campaign the rpm of the waterjet impellers were set to match the resistance in calm water at speed the results in waves are shown in fig 14 in terms of the derivatives of side force y δ roll and yaw moments k δ and n δ for one experimental case the steering coefficients in the following waves are very similar to the calm water values except for the roll moment however the difference is rather small when compared to the other loads this suggests that the waterjets performance in a seaway are very similar to its performances in calm water this is different to what could happen to a propeller rudder configuration where the orbital velocities can reduce the effectiveness of the rudder and in extreme cases rudder emersion can occur waterjets are less subjected to wave induced inflow velocities components or submergence the coefficients measured in the experiments were compared in fig 15 with the mathematical model of the waterjet loads used during the simulations at different forward speeds as done for the coefficients in sway the waterjets mathematical model summarised by equations 13 16 is adequate in capturing the steering forces the waterjets are however subjected to the variation of surge speed of the vessel when surf riding since the flow speed at the waterjets inlet change while the rpm is kept constant this effect is not highlighted in the captive tests since the forward speed is constant however the surge effect is taken into account by the waterjet model 3 5 loads due to yaw velocity different consideration must be made for the yaw velocity induced coefficients y r k r and n r it is very hard to obtain these coefficients in regular following waves in the past renilson renilson 1981 renilson and driscoll 1982 matsuda and umeda 2000 proposed experimental methodologies to obtain these coefficients in waves the problem is that when a vessel is turning with a yaw velocity r t its heading ψ t is also changing thus modifying the actual wave incidence angle μ t it is therefore hard to separate the wave and yaw velocity effects this is in principle possible as explained by equation 23 which refers to the total yaw moment when the vessel turns in waves in the absence of sway velocity 23 n nμμ t nrr t nμ μ ψ t nrr t n μ μ r t dt n r r t however the most difficult task is to correctly set the longitudinal location of the model in the wave this can be done by moving the carriage at the same speed as the wave crest celerity thus performing pure yaw oscillation tests at the same longitudinal wave location this would require a significant number of model runs and it was not feasible for the present model test campaign as an approximation the values of the yaw velocity coefficients used were those obtained in calm water the prediction of these terms using the current 3d bem technique was validated in the work of de jong et al de jong et al 2013 fig 16 shows the values of the coefficients y r k r and n r as functions of froude number in calm water over the speed range investigated 3 6 wave steepness effect the experimental campaign was carried out at a single wave steepness h λ 0 06 it is known that the occurrences of dynamic instabilities in the following sea are more frequent at steeper waves therefore it is necessary to perform simulations at a steepness higher than 0 06 the 3d bem takes into account the effect of steepness for the computation of the wave and hydrodynamic loads every load in the wave can be seen as a sinusoidal curve function of the term ξ g λ then every sinusoidal curve has its own amplitude mean value and phase with respect to the exciting wave a modification of wave steepness has the effect of changing these parameters this is taken into account also into the correction of the predicted loads due to sway velocity the effect of the wave steepness on the manoeuvring loads can be significant since the change in the submerged geometry is large hence greatly affecting the distribution of the pressure over the hull fig 17 shows the predicted effect of the steepness on the amplitude and mean value of the hydrodynamic coefficient n v a change of wave steepness affects only the amplitude and the mean value of the loads not the phase 4 the inception of broaching to the most important steering qualities of the high speed craft can be summarised by two characteristics 1 the ability to maintain the desired course with the minimum steering effort after a disturbance course keeping ability 2 the ability to change heading quickly and in a limited amount of longitudinal displacement turning ability in this work these two different but related aspects of the manoeuvrability of high speed craft have been investigated in relation to their effect on the inceptions of broaching phenomena in stern quartering waves the elements investigated independently are 5 directional stability and effectiveness of the steering devices both these elements will affect the steering qualities identified above and hence these were varied independently to study their effect on the inception of broaching in stern quartering seas the effectiveness of the steering can be modified by increasing the total steering force provided by the control devices the directional stability of the high speed craft was modified by considering the well known index c principles of naval archi 1988 in equation 24 24 c n r y v y r m n v the investigation was made up of four different designs which originate from the bare hull of the nh 1816 as summarised in table 4 each of the designs had different directional stability and steering ability and these are denoted as follows a the bare hull of the nh 1816 is considered without modification b the directional stability of the nh 1816 was improved by artificially modifying the linear hydrodynamic coefficients due to sway velocity y v n v and due to yaw velocity y r n r c the steering ability of the vessel was improved by artificially increasing the steering side force resulting in greater coefficients y δ k δ and n δ d both the directional stability and steering ability were improved at the same time for designs b and d the coefficients y r and n v were decreased by 25 and the coefficients n r and y v were increased by 25 also the roll coefficients k v and k r were increased by 25 in order to realistically simulate the roll dynamics these percentage changes were chosen to simulate the presence of the skegs i e a condition of bare hull appendages the appendages were not added directly in the simulations in order to avoid the induced effects due to the fluctuations of the forward speed and the presence of the wave in designs c and d the steering coefficients y δ k δ and n δ were increased by 25 these percentages have been chosen to simulate a feasible net increase of steering force available for the ship although present in the numerical simulations the heel induced coefficients y φ and n φ were not considered in this investigation the effect of those terms on the broaching to inception and on the manoeuvring characteristics of fast vessels in calm water has already been discussed in previous work bonci et al 2018 2019 oltmann 1993 hashimoto et al 2011 yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 renilson and tuite 1995 1996 1997 for the purpose of this study only the more classic sway yaw dynamics was taken into consideration to relate the dynamic stability of the high speed craft to its steering qualities it must be noted that the modification of the coefficients was realistic but not physical the hull coefficients were changed without considering a relative change in hull form or an addition of appendages the steering force was increased without considering the effect that this would have on the surge dynamics of the vessel or that an increase in the waterjet steering forces would be achieved only by accelerating and increasing the waterjet impeller rate the surge dynamic of the vessel was not modified so that it was possible to make a net comparison between different steering qualities of the vessel disregarding the induced modifications on the vessel that would have an influence on the ship behaviour at sea a summary of the main aspects of the four designs is given in table 5 simulations in regular waves for the four designs were carried out at constant wave steepness h λ 0 08 for a range of froude numbers from 0 32 and 0 59 and wave lengths from 1 to 3 5 ship lengths the vessel auto pilot was set to maintain the initial heading of 20 degrees to the wave direction in total these amount to 7 8 4 simulations which were ran in the time domain over a time duration which equals the sum the wave ramp up period set to about 60 s and two wave encounter periods the resulting time traces have been analysed to classify the behaviour of the model in each of 4 categories periodic motion surf riding broaching to and capsize the criteria for putting it in one of these categories are defined in table 6 four examples of the occurrence of these dynamic instability events are shown in fig 18 periodic motion is implicitly defined as the non occurrence of the other three phenomena the results of this analysis are presented in fig 19 for the four vessel designs the results are presented in terms of the λ l ratio and the froude number the conditions where a dynamic instability phenomenon occurs highlight a broaching zone this approach was firstly developed by nicholson 1974 and further used in many of the later works on this topic renilson 1981 renilson and driscoll 1982 de jong et al 2013 2015 umeda and hamamoto 2000 renilson and tuite 1998 umeda et al 2008 2016 hashimoto et al 2004 design a is the base condition of the bare hull vessel showing a rather extended broaching zone covering almost the entire range of wave lengths and speeds simulated both the design with the increase in directional stability b and the design with the increased steering ability c show a reduced broaching zone design c has a smaller broaching zone than design b suggesting that in this case increasing the steering ability has a greater effect on reducing the broaching tendency than increasing the directional stability however a greater steering force would induce a roll moment in the same direction of the ship roll during the broaching to inception increasing the risk of capsize this is not counter acted by the auto pilot which keeps into account only the vessel heading the combination the two design d results in a greater improvement this suggests that a design both more steer effective and more directional stable would reduce the tendency of the vessel to broach in a following and stern quartering sea 6 discussion from the results in fig 19 it can be seen that an increase in the directional stability and in the steering ability are both beneficial to reduce the broaching tendency of the high speed craft in following and stern quartering waves increasing the vessel directional stability decreases the tendency to broach but a more steer effective design decreases even further this tendency fig 20 shows the comparison of the simulation time histories in the same condition for the three designs a b and c the initial speed of the vessel corresponds to fr 0 41 and the wavelength to ship length ratio is 1 53 although the broach takes more time to build up for the case with the increased directional stability b than for the original design a the increase in directional stability does not prevent a broach from occurring on the other hand the increase in steering effectiveness c does prevent the broach from occurring for higher initial forward speeds and the longer waves the design with the increased steering ability design c does not show the same benefits which are present at lower speeds and lower wavelengths this is because the waves are longer and higher and so are more powerful and an increase in steering force alone is not capable to fully counteracting the wave induced yawing moment fig 21 shows a comparison of the simulation time histories for the three designs a b and c but this time at a higher initial forward speed corresponding to fr 0 5 and a longer wavelength corresponding to a wavelength to ship length ratio of 3 5 for this higher initial forward speed it is possible to observe that the for original design and the one with enhanced steering a broach occurs whereas this does not happen for the more directional stable design fig 22 shows a comparison of the simulation time histories for design b and design c with both increased directional stability and steering effectiveness the initial forward speed corresponds to fr 0 41 and the wavelength to ship length ratio is 2 51 as with the conditions shown in fig 19 broaching occurs less for design d broaching occurs at both design b and c but not for design d for the results presented above the capabilities of the vessel have been modified assuming a realistic change in directional stability which would be expected due to the addition of skegs to investigate this issue in more detail the effect of directional stability was investigated by modifying the linear coefficients more to increase the vessel s directional stability further fig 23 shows the three different c indexes in calm water as function of froude number these indexes were obtained by modifying the sway and yaw velocity induced coefficients by 25 as done previously and further by 50 the original design corresponding to design a c 0 has negative c index meaning that the vessel is course unstable in calm water unlike the case for a big displacement ship this is not a result of a bad design a negative c index on a high speed craft is not rare because these vessels need to have good manoeuvring and turning ability fig 24 shows a comparison of the broaching to plots for the designs obtained with the progressive changes in the manoeuvring coefficients resulting in the three different directional stability indexes c 0 original design a c 1 design b and c 2 the increase in directional stability significantly decreases the size of the broaching plot at the higher speed the same analysis was carried out for the steering ability this was done by increasing the steering force from the waterjets by up to 50 the results are shown in fig 25 increasing the steering force has a different effect compared to the effect of the more directionally stable design a 50 increase in the steering force reduces the occurrence of broaching to at lower speed whereas broaching still occurs at higher wave length height and forward speed 7 concluding remarks the forces and moments on a high speed hard chine craft in waves were measured by means of captive model tests in following and stern quartering waves at the seakeeping manoeuvring basin of marin in wageningen the results were used to validate the forces and moments predicted using a 3d time domain blended potential flow bem 3d bem used to simulate the behaviour of the craft in following and stern quartering seas it was shown that this 3d bem can be used to predict the wave induced froude krylov force the steering loads are well presented in the simulation program on the other hand the predicted forces and moments induced by the sway velocity need to be corrected in order to match the measured results and a correction method was shown the other manoeuvring forces such as those caused by yaw velocity and heel angle are included in the simulations the yaw velocity induced coefficients are difficult to obtain by means of model tests and further research is required the effect of the heel coupling terms on the behaviour of the vessel sailing in the following sea is important however the heel induced loads were considered in the simulations but their effect on the steering qualities of the vessel was not assessed in this work for details on this topic the reader can refer to bonci et al 2019 matsuda and umeda 2000 oltmann 1993 hashimoto et al 2011 yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 renilson and tuite 1995 1996 1997 the manoeuvring terms were implemented into the 3d bem and their effect on the onset of broaching to of the sar nh 1816 craft was investigated for this particular high speed craft the directional stability and turning ability were varied showing that an increase in directional stability has little effect on the size of the broaching zone below a wavelength to ship length ratio of around 2 5 however it does reduce the size of the broaching zone for longer waves an increase in the steering ability as a result of an increase in steering force available reduces the size of the broaching zone particularly for low speeds and low wavelength to ship length ratios up to 2 5 it was shown that the size of the broaching zone could be reduced compared to the original design by the enhancement of both the directional stability and the steering effectiveness this is preferable because the modifications of the stern appendages configurations aimed to improve the ship manoeuvrability are often limited future research studies must investigate the steering qualities of a fast vessel in realistic irregular following sea states this would widen the validity of the findings of this work another fundamental aspect not touched by this work is the assessment of the vulnerability of a vessel to dynamic instability events this is an important and necessary step to judge in absolute sense the quality of a vessel when sailing in following waves future developments in that sense are foreseen by imo and

22322,small high speed craft are the most vulnerable to the severity of the sea achieving a design which pairs good performance and acceptable levels of safety is not a trivial task the seakeeping and manoeuvrability of these vessels play a crucial role in following sea conditions dynamic instabilities namely broaching to and surf riding are more than a rare eventuality and threaten the survivability of the vessel and the life of the mariners this study investigates the effects of the steering qualities on the broaching to behaviour of a high speed craft when it is sailing in following and stern quartering waves the motions and loads of the vessel are simulated by means of a 3d time domain blended potential flow boundary element method bem validated using captive model tests in regular waves carried out at the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb of marin the hull directional stability and turning ability of the high speed craft were artificially modified showing that an increase in the directional stability as well as in the effectiveness of the steering can be beneficial to avoid the inception of broaching to but they have different consequences on the dynamics of the vessel s loss of control keywords manoeuvrability in waves high speed craft broaching to following sea captive model tests panel method 1 introduction the first research studies on the controllability of ships focused on displacement merchant vessels manoeuvring in calm water the most important aspects of the manoeuvrability of such ships were related to their ability to maintain a straight course with the minimum steering effort and to stop quickly before an obstacle or to avoid it by a safe turn for example these principles are still valid nowadays resolution 2002 and ships are designed according to these safety requirements the studies on the manoeuvrability of displacement vessels are numerous the same cannot be said for high speed craft usually high speed vessels must possess very good steering capabilities in order to be very manoeuvrable but they must also be able to easily maintain their course in a seaway from a technical point of view the controllability of small hard chine fast craft is more complicated because it depends on several factors which are not usually considered for conventional displacement ships forward speed vertical running attitude wave making effects and flow separation on knuckles are decisive factors in the manoeuvring behaviour of small fast vessels the manoeuvring characteristics of high speed craft can be very important in rough seas small vessels are more subjected than big displacement ships to dangerous motions and large fluctuations of forward speed the hazard related to small vessels sailing in the following sea is well known dynamic instability phenomena such as broaching to are events strongly dreaded by mariners a broach or broaching to is the involuntary yawing movement of the vessel caused by the incoming following wave the vessel suddenly turns broadside to the seaway because of the large destabilizing wave yawing moment in this situation the steering is difficult and the vessel continues a turning motion despite the maximum control counter action from the rudder the loss of control of the ship puts the safety of the crew on board in great danger in extreme cases broaching to can lead to the capsize of the vessel the characteristics of the phenomenon of broaching to are well known du cane and goodrich 1962 spyrou 1996 umeda 1999 umeda and matsuda 2000 renilson 1981 2014 renilson and driscoll 1982 according to the definition by cohen and blount 1986 broaching to is a non oscillatory combined yaw roll dynamic instability which occurs at medium high speed typically at a length froude number higher than 0 3 the ships which are more subjected to such dynamic instability are therefore relatively small vessels up to 70 m in length which operate in the pre planing regime high speed craft fishing vessels patrol boats small frigates and destroyers broaching to can be considered as a single wave event it usually occurs when the wave length is between 1 to 3 ship lengths and when the wave height is large enough de jong et al de jong et al 2015 showed that the likelihood of broaching increases with the wave steepness usually a broaching to event is preceded by another known and widely analysed phenomenon surf riding spyrou 2006 maki et al 2010 the vessel is captured by the incoming wave and accelerated to the wave celerity the vessel then spends a lot of time at one longitudinal position in the wave typically the front see the work of renilson 2014 at this longitudinal position the destabilizing wave yawing moment grows larger such that the turning moment on the ship from the wave cannot be compensated for by the steering counter action the dynamics of this phenomenon is usually very quick and violent a broach occurs in few seconds and the vessel s yaw rate can be extremely high the destabilizing yawing moment is greater at a greater heading angle but as shown in de jong et al 2015 this does not necessarily increase the likelihood of a broach the reason for this is that at higher wave incidence angles a surf ride is less likely since there is a larger difference in the relative speed between the ship and the wave surf riding and broaching to are thus strictly connected phenomena a broach occurs shortly after the onset of a surf riding without this precondition in most cases the ship experiences just a periodic motion the research presented in this paper aims to investigate the inception of this dangerous dynamic instability phenomena in following seas designers and researchers are aware of the circumstances in which a broach could occur as well as of the kinematics which characterises it what is still not clear it is the reason why certain ships suffer more than others from broaching to and which aspects determine the likelihood of a vessel to lose control in the following sea this debate is still open and a solution must be sought in order to assess the capabilities of a vessel to manoeuvre at sea which is a problematic task because of its complexity the issue of manoeuvring in waves of fast vessels is rarely investigated during the design process as a result of this lack of knowledge the controllability of small high speed craft is often entrusted to the masters and the helmsmen who operate the vessel this is also motivated by the fact that the skills of the mariners are considered more important than the inherent characteristics of the small vessels for their safety as conolly explained in conolly 1972 referring to the following sea scenarios mariners tend to be philosophical on this subject and to accept the problems of following seas as a natural environmental hazard they rely heavily on individual experiences and would not necessarily all follow the same course of action when confronted by a given set of circumstances however this was written in 1972 and both technology and the expectations of mariners regarding the design of their vessels have changed since then therefore designers must have sufficient certainties regarding the solutions to adopt in order to prevent or at least mitigate the vessel vulnerability to dynamic instabilities this is of vital importance for a reliable safety assessment of a fast craft sailing in rough sea the dutch rescue boat sar nh 1816 operated by the royal netherlands sea rescue institution knrm was chosen in this work as test case for the investigation of the steering qualities of high speed craft in the following sea the nh 1816 is the result of an innovative and versatile design project keuning et al 2011 originating from the upgrade of the rescue vessel arie visser converted to the axe bow concept keuning 2006 the axe bow is designed to improve the response of the ship in head waves the craft is equipped with two water jets which facilitate rescue operations and ensure good manoeuvrability and with two retractable skegs which improve the course stability in the seaway the main parameters of the vessel and its hull lines are shown respectively in table 1 and fig 1 one of the most reliable ways to investigate the manoeuvring characteristics of a vessel is by means of model experiments however for manoeuvring in wave problems experimental techniques are often complicated and expensive since the number of model experiments required to cover an adequate range of conditions would be too extensive experimental studies on the manoeuvrability of high speed craft are rare and often restricted to the calm water case yasukawa et al 2016 de jong et al 2013 bonci et al 2017 2018 in following sea research free sailing model tests are generally preferred nicholson 1974 umeda and hamamoto 2000 renilson and tuite 1998 umeda et al 2008 2016 since it is possible to directly assess the vulnerability of a vessel to the onset of broaching to captive model tests in waves are often limited to very few wave and model speed conditions since they are time consuming and difficult to set up however measuring forces and moments acting on the model in a captive model test generates a deeper understanding into the dynamics of the vessel sailing in the seaway manoeuvring in waves numerical simulations are usually carried out in the time domain since it is possible to describe the high frequency loads in the vertical plane and the low frequency ones in the horizontal plane well in common state of art mathematical tools used for manoeuvring in waves applications the manoeuvrability loads are formulated with calm water models whereas froude krylov and restoring terms are calculated on the actual wavy submerged geometry this is a feasible approach for medium large vessels the waves are smaller than the vessel size and do not influence the characteristics of the submerged geometry nor the manoeuvrability loads this is not applicable for small fast craft the waves in which they operate are comparable with the vessel size therefore the submerged geometry and the hydrodynamic loads change with respect to the position in the waves because of this unified seakeeping and manoeuvrability simulation tools which directly compute the overall loads acting on the hull at each time step are recommended in the study of high speed craft sailing in waves brute force ranse solvers are capable of providing an accurate description of the dynamics of the vessel however due to the great computational effort required their utilization in manoeuvring in waves problems is not practical less accurate potential flow models such as panel methods bem have been demonstrated to be an optimal option between a reliable description of the ship dynamics and a reasonable demand of computational effort in this study captive model tests on the model of the sar nh 1816 were carried out at the smb of marin in following and stern quartering waves the objective was twofold first the analysis of the hull and steering loads acting on the vessel when sailing in waves second the validation of a 3d bem in the prediction of such loads the 3d bem was then used to investigate the inception of dynamic instabilities in the following sea the validation of this model allowed both a qualitative and quantitative prediction of the broaching behaviour of the nh 1816 2 mathematical model unified seakeeping and manoeuvring mathematical models are the state of art tools used for manoeuvring in waves problems bailey et al 1997 fossen 2003 skejic and faltinsen 2008 both the manoeuvrability and the seakeeping of a vessel must be predicted accurately by the numerical simulations the vessel dynamics in the vertical and horizontal planes as well as its propulsive characteristics can interact with each other in a review of the mathematical methods used to study manoeuvrability in waves reed and beck 2018 considered potential flow methods as an optimal compromise between the accuracy of the results and the range of applicability when compared to more sophisticated tools ranse solvers or simpler parametric models in the current study a 3d bem was chosen to simulate the motions of a free sailing high speed craft in stern quartering seas in the time domain in six degrees of freedom dof the tool was developed mainly by van walree van walree 1999 and de jong de jong 2011 for both head de jong and van walree 2009 de jong and van walree 2008 and following waves applications de jong et al 2015 de jong et al 2013 van walree and de jong 2011 solving a potential flow problem the 3d bem evaluates the hydrostatic froude krylov and hydrodynamic radiation and diffraction pressures acting on the ship hull the viscous effects and the propulsive and steering device loads are calculated using semi empirical formulations the hydrodynamic components of the loads are evaluated only on the calm water submerged geometry corresponding to the running equilibrium position of the vessel at the relevant speed this allows for the linearization of the free surface boundary conditions and the definition of a unique influence function reducing the computational time albeit with a slightly lower accuracy the vessel is initially in its running vertical equilibrium condition while the waves are ramped up the propulsion rate is kept constant during the entire simulation the initial heave and pitch the wave ramp up factor the propulsion rate and the other important simulation parameters are chosen in such a way to give the smoothest start and not to alter the final outcomes of the simulations the angle of the steering devices is automatically set by the auto pilot equation given in equation 1 1 δ b δψ r c δψ ψ the auto pilot is meant to keep the initial course direction of the vessel correcting the deviation in heading ψ and its rate of change r the main characteristics of the vessel steering are shown in table 2 all the motions and loads refer to the ship fixed coordinate system in fig 2 with origin at the ship centre of gravity g the motion equations in surge sway roll

and pitch are not considered however the vertical and components of the loads and thus the actual trim and sink rise of the craft in the waves are maintained by the 3d bem in a quasi static manner because the variations in submerged geometry due to the motions in heave and pitch influence the manoeuvring of the vessel the loads acting on the vessel are divided into hull loads both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic subscript h wave loads subscript w and the propulsive and steering forces provided by the waterjets subscript r each of these terms depends on the vessel speed the wave characteristics the longitudinal location of the ship in the waves and its running attitude which defines its submerged geometry in the waves the hull component of the loads acting on the ship can be described using the derivatives of the loads with respect to the motions hydrodynamic coefficients as in equations 6 9 6 x h r t u x vv v 2 7 y h y v v y r m r y φ φ 8 k h k φ m gm t φ k v v k r r 9 n h n v v n r r n

representing the flow momentum due to the impeller suction 3 the prediction of the hull loads in following and stern quartering waves in this section the capability of the 3d bem for prediction of the manoeuvring loads is assessed the calculated loads are compared with the results from captive model tests carried out at the smb of marin both in calm water and in regular following and stern quartering waves a photograph of the ship model used in the tests is shown in fig 3 the bem used for the simulation of the ship motions is a blended method the inflow potential on each of the hull panels is composed of the radiation potential and the froude krylov diffraction potential it is impossible in a free sailing vessel simulation to clearly separate the effects of the loads in waves as written in equations 2 5 in order to investigate the numerical prediction of the manoeuvring forces and moments the same experimental captive model tests were reproduced numerically therefore the single contributions to the total loads can be computed and compared with the experimental data the experiments in regular waves were carried out at constant steepness h λ 0 06 taken as the upper limit to ensure good quality waves and to avoid wave breaking a number of wave lengths and model speeds were chosen in order to realize conditions of following waves at low encounter frequency where the waves slowly overtake the model the experimental set up allowed the model to move in heave and pitch thus assuming its natural vertical position in the wave this is an important requirement of the experimental set up since the loads in the waves also depend on the vertical position of the model in waves the loads measured in this model test campaign refer to the bare hull without skegs the uncertainty of the measured data is expressed by the random errors precision limits evaluated from 12 repetitions of a single run for each case the particulars of the tests are summarised in table 3 fig 4 shows two pictures of a measurement run carried out at the smb three different types of experiments were carried out a tests at wave incidence angle with zero sway velocity the wave induced loads were measured at different wave incidence angles up to 25 degrees at this stage the model had zero sway velocity see fig 4 and hence there was no contribution to the sway force or yaw moment from the sway velocity thus the only loads which were measured were due to the wave b tests at pure sway motion in following waves the sway velocity induced loads were measured while the model was running with constant drift in waves the incidence angle between the direction of the waves and the ship longitudinal axis was zero see fig 4 and hence there was no contribution from the wave to the sway force or yaw moment thus the only loads which were measured were due to the sway velocity c tests with waterjets steering angles the steering loads of the waterjets were measured in waves at different steering angles in this condition the sway motion and the wave incidence angle were zero and hence there was no contribution to the loads from either the sway motion or the wave see fig 4 thus the only loads which were measured were due to the waterjet steering angle fig 5 shows a picture taken during a run in following waves the loads due to the sway velocity and the waterjet steering angle were also evaluated in calm water at the same model speeds as used for the tests in waves in order to make a comparison between the condition in calm water and the one in waves the results obtained from the tests are presented in terms of hydrodynamic coefficients or loads as functions of the position of the longitudinal centre of gravity g of the vessel in the waves denoted using the non dimensional parameter ξ g λ defined in fig 2 the results are presented in non dimensional form as shown in equations 17 20 for the force f moment m sway speed v and yaw velocity r 17 f f 0 5ρu 2 l 2 18 m m 0 5ρu 2 l 3 19 v v u 20 r r l u the coefficients were obtained at each location ξ g λ by the least squares linear fitting of the measured non dimensional values as function of the non dimensional velocity components or the angles expressed in radians fig 6 shows an example of the fitting of the yaw moment due to sway in calm water and in two locations in waves for one condition tested the quality of the fitting is estimated by calculating the uncertainty of each measurement run ittc recommended procedure no 7 5 02 06 04 ittc 2014 and the standard estimation error see of the fitting line coleman and steele 1999 the total coefficient uncertainty is visualized by means of error bars on each coefficients value the same methodology can be found in bonci et al 2019 3 1 empirical description of the manoeuvring forces and moments the experimental results can be used to formulate an empirical description of the forces and moments due to manoeuvring at different combinations of vessel froude number and wave lengths it is important that the 3d bem can also predict the forces and moments acting on the hull in several other conditions different than the cases considered in the model tests the same approach can be found in bonci et al 2019 for this purpose it is useful to express concisely the coefficients in waves using very few parameters i e the amplitude the mean value and the phase of the sinusoidal signal of the relevant quantities as shown in fig 7 this approximation is valid under the hypothesis of linearity between the exciting wave and the output load which fits the forces and moments due to manoeuvring well this method assumes linearity between the wave and the loads acting on the hull this hypothesis approximates reasonably the measured data fig 8 compares the measured data for one condition in waves tested and the respective sinusoidal fitting those terms can be obtained by least square fitting of the sinusoidal signals as functions of the location of the ship in the wave ξ g λ each coefficient can be then expressed as in equation 21 with the term y v taken as example 21 y v a yv cos 2π ξ g λ φ yv η yv the amplitude phase and mean value can be plotted as functions of froude number and wave length for every condition tested the values of amplitude phase and mean of the experimental cases can be fitted using a plane as shown in fig 9 thanks to this plane the coefficients can be expressed using the plane polynomial terms as in equation 22 for the mean value of the coefficient y v 22 η yv p 0 p 1 fr p 2 λ l the terms p 0 p1 and p2 are the coefficients of the plane equation a planar fit was chosen as a first approximation of the coefficients in waves the empirical description was used to correct the numerical prediction of the loads predicted using the 3d bem the captive model tests were reproduced numerically with the 3d bem for the same conditions tested in the experiments as with the model test results the coefficients obtained numerically using the 3d bem can be used to define a numerical description by fitting the data with a plane as shown in fig 9 for the experimental cases the differences between the experimental and numerical plane fits can be calculated for every fr λ l combination and therefore used to correct the 3d bem prediction this correction allows an imperfect but reasonable agreement with the experimental results for a wide range of forward speeds and wave lengths the correction depends on how well the terms are distributed over the plane and on how different the initial numerical coefficients are from the experimental measurements the complete numerical experimental comparisons of amplitude a phase φ and mean value η are shown in the appendix for the coefficients induced by the waves and the sway velocity of the vessel 3 2 test a loads due to the wave the wave loads were computed using the 3d bem considering the froude krylov pressures on the actual wavy submerged geometry since the wave exciting forces are mainly potential the boundary element mathematical methods are expected to predict these loads rather well fig 10 shows the uncorrected numerical and the measured wave loads confirming the initial expectations some discrepancies can still be observed especially in the roll moment however the 3d bem provides a reasonable prediction of the wave excitation therefore the predictions from the 3d bem do not need to be corrected in this case a comparison between the measured and predicted wave loads for a single run is shown in fig 10 a more detailed comparison of the measured and predicted wave surge force x w and wave coefficients y μ k μ and n μ is given in the appendix 3 3 test b loads due to sway velocity it is much more difficult to accurately predict the manoeuvring forces and moments such as the forces caused by the sway velocity using potential methods the forces and moments acting on a hard chine craft due to sway velocity are governed by complex phenomena such as spray generation and flow separation at the chine and at the transom moreover the presence of the wave increases the complexity of the phenomena acting on the hull the results of the predictions obtained using the 3d bem were then corrected as explained in section 3 1 the comparison between the corrected bem and measured sway hydrodynamic coefficients is shown in fig 11 for one case a wider and more detailed comparison is given in appendix when a free running ship is sailing in following waves it is subjected to large fluctuations in its surge velocity in extreme cases the ship is forced to travel at wave speed known as surf riding as discussed above surf riding is a prerequisite of broaching to a good match between the measured and predicted loads from the captive model tests is not enough to judge the behaviour of the vessel when it is freely running in a seaway because in the model tests the vessel forward speed is kept constant whereas it is variable in the free running case the 3d bem accounts for the variation of the loads due to the change in forward speed which gives the correction applied at the initial speed therefore it is of paramount importance that the 3d bem is capable of predicting the change in the hydrodynamic loads due to forward speed fig 12 depicts the comparison between the measured and predicted coefficients y v k v and n v in calm water as a function of froude number over the speed range investigated the comparison shows that the 3d bem can be used to qualitatively predict the trend of the hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to the forward velocity 3 4 test c waterjet steering loads the steering loads generated by the waterjets at different deflection angles δ were measured during the model tests both in calm water and in waves fig 13 shows the waterjet arrangements during the experimental campaign the rpm of the waterjet impellers were set to match the resistance in calm water at speed the results in waves are shown in fig 14 in terms of the derivatives of side force y δ roll and yaw moments k δ and n δ for one experimental case the steering coefficients in the following waves are very similar to the calm water values except for the roll moment however the difference is rather small when compared to the other loads this suggests that the waterjets performance in a seaway are very similar to its performances in calm water this is different to what could happen to a propeller rudder configuration where the orbital velocities can reduce the effectiveness of the rudder and in extreme cases rudder emersion can occur waterjets are less subjected to wave induced inflow velocities components or submergence the coefficients measured in the experiments were compared in fig 15 with the mathematical model of the waterjet loads used during the simulations at different forward speeds as done for the coefficients in sway the waterjets mathematical model summarised by equations 13 16 is adequate in capturing the steering forces the waterjets are however subjected to the variation of surge speed of the vessel when surf riding since the flow speed at the waterjets inlet change while the rpm is kept constant this effect is not highlighted in the captive tests since the forward speed is constant however the surge effect is taken into account by the waterjet model 3 5 loads due to yaw velocity different consideration must be made for the yaw velocity induced coefficients y r k r and n r it is very hard to obtain these coefficients in regular following waves in the past renilson renilson 1981 renilson and driscoll 1982 matsuda and umeda 2000 proposed experimental methodologies to obtain these coefficients in waves the problem is that when a vessel is turning with a yaw velocity r t its heading ψ t is also changing thus modifying the actual wave incidence angle μ t it is therefore hard to separate the wave and yaw velocity effects this is in principle possible as explained by equation 23 which refers to the total yaw moment when the vessel turns in waves in the absence of sway velocity 23 n nμμ t nrr t nμ μ ψ t nrr t n μ μ r t dt n r r t however the most difficult task is to correctly set the longitudinal location of the model in the wave this can be done by moving the carriage at the same speed as the wave crest celerity thus performing pure yaw oscillation tests at the same longitudinal wave location this would require a significant number of model runs and it was not feasible for the present model test campaign as an approximation the values of the yaw velocity coefficients used were those obtained in calm water the prediction of these terms using the current 3d bem technique was validated in the work of de jong et al de jong et al 2013 fig 16 shows the values of the coefficients y r k r and n r as functions of froude number in calm water over the speed range investigated 3 6 wave steepness effect the experimental campaign was carried out at a single wave steepness h λ 0 06 it is known that the occurrences of dynamic instabilities in the following sea are more frequent at steeper waves therefore it is necessary to perform simulations at a steepness higher than 0 06 the 3d bem takes into account the effect of steepness for the computation of the wave and hydrodynamic loads every load in the wave can be seen as a sinusoidal curve function of the term ξ g λ then every sinusoidal curve has its own amplitude mean value and phase with respect to the exciting wave a modification of wave steepness has the effect of changing these parameters this is taken into account also into the correction of the predicted loads due to sway velocity the effect of the wave steepness on the manoeuvring loads can be significant since the change in the submerged geometry is large hence greatly affecting the distribution of the pressure over the hull fig 17 shows the predicted effect of the steepness on the amplitude and mean value of the hydrodynamic coefficient n v a change of wave steepness affects only the amplitude and the mean value of the loads not the phase 4 the inception of broaching to the most important steering qualities of the high speed craft can be summarised by two characteristics 1 the ability to maintain the desired course with the minimum steering effort after a disturbance course keeping ability 2 the ability to change heading quickly and in a limited amount of longitudinal displacement turning ability in this work these two different but related aspects of the manoeuvrability of high speed craft have been investigated in relation to their effect on the inceptions of broaching phenomena in stern quartering waves the elements investigated independently are 5 directional stability and effectiveness of the steering devices both these elements will affect the steering qualities identified above and hence these were varied independently to study their effect on the inception of broaching in stern quartering seas the effectiveness of the steering can be modified by increasing the total steering force provided by the control devices the directional stability of the high speed craft was modified by considering the well known index c principles of naval archi 1988 in equation 24 24 c n r y v y r m n v the investigation was made up of four different designs which originate from the bare hull of the nh 1816 as summarised in table 4 each of the designs had different directional stability and steering ability and these are denoted as follows a the bare hull of the nh 1816 is considered without modification b the directional stability of the nh 1816 was improved by artificially modifying the linear hydrodynamic coefficients due to sway velocity y v n v and due to yaw velocity y r n r c the steering ability of the vessel was improved by artificially increasing the steering side force resulting in greater coefficients y δ k δ and n δ d both the directional stability and steering ability were improved at the same time for designs b and d the coefficients y r and n v were decreased by 25 and the coefficients n r and y v were increased by 25 also the roll coefficients k v and k r were increased by 25 in order to realistically simulate the roll dynamics these percentage changes were chosen to simulate the presence of the skegs i e a condition of bare hull appendages the appendages were not added directly in the simulations in order to avoid the induced effects due to the fluctuations of the forward speed and the presence of the wave in designs c and d the steering coefficients y δ k δ and n δ were increased by 25 these percentages have been chosen to simulate a feasible net increase of steering force available for the ship although present in the numerical simulations the heel induced coefficients y φ and n φ were not considered in this investigation the effect of those terms on the broaching to inception and on the manoeuvring characteristics of fast vessels in calm water has already been discussed in previous work bonci et al 2018 2019 oltmann 1993 hashimoto et al 2011 yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 renilson and tuite 1995 1996 1997 for the purpose of this study only the more classic sway yaw dynamics was taken into consideration to relate the dynamic stability of the high speed craft to its steering qualities it must be noted that the modification of the coefficients was realistic but not physical the hull coefficients were changed without considering a relative change in hull form or an addition of appendages the steering force was increased without considering the effect that this would have on the surge dynamics of the vessel or that an increase in the waterjet steering forces would be achieved only by accelerating and increasing the waterjet impeller rate the surge dynamic of the vessel was not modified so that it was possible to make a net comparison between different steering qualities of the vessel disregarding the induced modifications on the vessel that would have an influence on the ship behaviour at sea a summary of the main aspects of the four designs is given in table 5 simulations in regular waves for the four designs were carried out at constant wave steepness h λ 0 08 for a range of froude numbers from 0 32 and 0 59 and wave lengths from 1 to 3 5 ship lengths the vessel auto pilot was set to maintain the initial heading of 20 degrees to the wave direction in total these amount to 7 8 4 simulations which were ran in the time domain over a time duration which equals the sum the wave ramp up period set to about 60 s and two wave encounter periods the resulting time traces have been analysed to classify the behaviour of the model in each of 4 categories periodic motion surf riding broaching to and capsize the criteria for putting it in one of these categories are defined in table 6 four examples of the occurrence of these dynamic instability events are shown in fig 18 periodic motion is implicitly defined as the non occurrence of the other three phenomena the results of this analysis are presented in fig 19 for the four vessel designs the results are presented in terms of the λ l ratio and the froude number the conditions where a dynamic instability phenomenon occurs highlight a broaching zone this approach was firstly developed by nicholson 1974 and further used in many of the later works on this topic renilson 1981 renilson and driscoll 1982 de jong et al 2013 2015 umeda and hamamoto 2000 renilson and tuite 1998 umeda et al 2008 2016 hashimoto et al 2004 design a is the base condition of the bare hull vessel showing a rather extended broaching zone covering almost the entire range of wave lengths and speeds simulated both the design with the increase in directional stability b and the design with the increased steering ability c show a reduced broaching zone design c has a smaller broaching zone than design b suggesting that in this case increasing the steering ability has a greater effect on reducing the broaching tendency than increasing the directional stability however a greater steering force would induce a roll moment in the same direction of the ship roll during the broaching to inception increasing the risk of capsize this is not counter acted by the auto pilot which keeps into account only the vessel heading the combination the two design d results in a greater improvement this suggests that a design both more steer effective and more directional stable would reduce the tendency of the vessel to broach in a following and stern quartering sea 6 discussion from the results in fig 19 it can be seen that an increase in the directional stability and in the steering ability are both beneficial to reduce the broaching tendency of the high speed craft in following and stern quartering waves increasing the vessel directional stability decreases the tendency to broach but a more steer effective design decreases even further this tendency fig 20 shows the comparison of the simulation time histories in the same condition for the three designs a b and c the initial speed of the vessel corresponds to fr 0 41 and the wavelength to ship length ratio is 1 53 although the broach takes more time to build up for the case with the increased directional stability b than for the original design a the increase in directional stability does not prevent a broach from occurring on the other hand the increase in steering effectiveness c does prevent the broach from occurring for higher initial forward speeds and the longer waves the design with the increased steering ability design c does not show the same benefits which are present at lower speeds and lower wavelengths this is because the waves are longer and higher and so are more powerful and an increase in steering force alone is not capable to fully counteracting the wave induced yawing moment fig 21 shows a comparison of the simulation time histories for the three designs a b and c but this time at a higher initial forward speed corresponding to fr 0 5 and a longer wavelength corresponding to a wavelength to ship length ratio of 3 5 for this higher initial forward speed it is possible to observe that the for original design and the one with enhanced steering a broach occurs whereas this does not happen for the more directional stable design fig 22 shows a comparison of the simulation time histories for design b and design c with both increased directional stability and steering effectiveness the initial forward speed corresponds to fr 0 41 and the wavelength to ship length ratio is 2 51 as with the conditions shown in fig 19 broaching occurs less for design d broaching occurs at both design b and c but not for design d for the results presented above the capabilities of the vessel have been modified assuming a realistic change in directional stability which would be expected due to the addition of skegs to investigate this issue in more detail the effect of directional stability was investigated by modifying the linear coefficients more to increase the vessel s directional stability further fig 23 shows the three different c indexes in calm water as function of froude number these indexes were obtained by modifying the sway and yaw velocity induced coefficients by 25 as done previously and further by 50 the original design corresponding to design a c 0 has negative c index meaning that the vessel is course unstable in calm water unlike the case for a big displacement ship this is not a result of a bad design a negative c index on a high speed craft is not rare because these vessels need to have good manoeuvring and turning ability fig 24 shows a comparison of the broaching to plots for the designs obtained with the progressive changes in the manoeuvring coefficients resulting in the three different directional stability indexes c 0 original design a c 1 design b and c 2 the increase in directional stability significantly decreases the size of the broaching plot at the higher speed the same analysis was carried out for the steering ability this was done by increasing the steering force from the waterjets by up to 50 the results are shown in fig 25 increasing the steering force has a different effect compared to the effect of the more directionally stable design a 50 increase in the steering force reduces the occurrence of broaching to at lower speed whereas broaching still occurs at higher wave length height and forward speed 7 concluding remarks the forces and moments on a high speed hard chine craft in waves were measured by means of captive model tests in following and stern quartering waves at the seakeeping manoeuvring basin of marin in wageningen the results were used to validate the forces and moments predicted using a 3d time domain blended potential flow bem 3d bem used to simulate the behaviour of the craft in following and stern quartering seas it was shown that this 3d bem can be used to predict the wave induced froude krylov force the steering loads are well presented in the simulation program on the other hand the predicted forces and moments induced by the sway velocity need to be corrected in order to match the measured results and a correction method was shown the other manoeuvring forces such as those caused by yaw velocity and heel angle are included in the simulations the yaw velocity induced coefficients are difficult to obtain by means of model tests and further research is required the effect of the heel coupling terms on the behaviour of the vessel sailing in the following sea is important however the heel induced loads were considered in the simulations but their effect on the steering qualities of the vessel was not assessed in this work for details on this topic the reader can refer to bonci et al 2019 matsuda and umeda 2000 oltmann 1993 hashimoto et al 2011 yasukawa and yoshimura 2014 renilson and tuite 1995 1996 1997 the manoeuvring terms were implemented into the 3d bem and their effect on the onset of broaching to of the sar nh 1816 craft was investigated for this particular high speed craft the directional stability and turning ability were varied showing that an increase in directional stability has little effect on the size of the broaching zone below a wavelength to ship length ratio of around 2 5 however it does reduce the size of the broaching zone for longer waves an increase in the steering ability as a result of an increase in steering force available reduces the size of the broaching zone particularly for low speeds and low wavelength to ship length ratios up to 2 5 it was shown that the size of the broaching zone could be reduced compared to the original design by the enhancement of both the directional stability and the steering effectiveness this is preferable because the modifications of the stern appendages configurations aimed to improve the ship manoeuvrability are often limited future research studies must investigate the steering qualities of a fast vessel in realistic irregular following sea states this would widen the validity of the findings of this work another fundamental aspect not touched by this work is the assessment of the vulnerability of a vessel to dynamic instability events this is an important and necessary step to judge in absolute sense the quality of a vessel when sailing in following waves future developments in that sense are foreseen by imo and

analysis using usfos are carried out in the local shell analysis collision scenarios with both decoupled and coupled methods are simulated for several representative impact locations the decoupled model adopts prescribed paths for ship motions while in the coupled model the ship motions are calculated based on hydrodynamic forces from linear potential theory as well as inertia and collision forces in the global beam column analysis in usfos the force deformation curves of the supply vessel from local shell analysis are used as the input the resulting damage and energy absorption are compared with those from local shell simulations the results are discussed with respect to the impact resistance energy absorption and structural damage keywords offshore fish farm ship collision coupled simulation local and global analysis structural damage 1 introduction with the fish farming industry going into more exposed seas the fish cages become larger and much more fish can be accommodated than ever before however harsher environmental loads and frequent aquaculture operations imply risk for accidental actions such as ship collisions where damage potential and possible consequences can be severe like other offshore installations e g jackets and jack ups yu and amdahl 2018b le sourne et al 2016 submersible platforms and wind turbines biehl and lehmann 2006 le sourne et al 2015 fish farms are exposed to the risk of collisions both from service vessels and merchant vessels on erroneous track this may represent major threats to the safety and integrity of the fish farms a major collision may cause extensive structural damage and in extreme cases the fish farm may collapse completely with fish escape as a result escape of farmed fish will cause major economic losses for the fish farming company and is considered to have negative impact on the wild stocks more seriously a collision event may also represent a safety threat for the personnel both on the ship and the fish farm hence this should be avoided by either proper safety measures to reduce the likelihood of collision by direct design or favorably by a combination design aspects of accidental loads from ship collisions are however not included in the present norwegian technical standard for the design of fish farms standard norway ns9415 2009 in addition to resisting the direct actions during collision the damaged structure should maintain sufficient residual strength so that it can resist operational and environmental loads before it can be repaired realistic estimates of the environmental load levels at a given site and structural condition rely on adequate descriptions of the marine environment including the exposure to wind waves and current ship collisions have been considered for decades in the offshore industry in the design against ship collision actions the kinetic energy of the vessel is determined by a risk assessment the design practice in the north sea that has been used for decades was to consider impact from a supply vessel of 5000 tons with a kinetic energy of 11 mj for bow or stern impact and 14 mj for sideway impact considering hydrodynamic effects over the years the experienced collision energy has increased significantly due to increased ship sizes and impact velocities according to kvitrud 2011 who summarized collision accidents in norway in the period 2001 2010 in the latest version norsok n003 2017 displacements of the design supply vessel has increased to 6500 10 000 tons and the design impact velocities has increased to 3 m s for head on collisions and 2 m s for side collisions moan et al 2017 this yields a significantly larger design energy of about 50 mj for head on collisions the norsok standards are developed for offshore structures used for oil and gas production but standard collision actions for offshore fish farm has not been established the intention of this work is to investigate the collision resistance and permanent damage of a selected fish farm as a function of the collision energy no comparison is made with acceptance criteria as they have generally not been established but possible evaluation criteria are discussed with the simulation results it is emphasized that structural damage is investigated only penetration of the net may occur for small impact energies and the potential of fish escape can be large even if integrity of the structure is not put in jeopardy the fish cage structure analyzed is the ocean farming concept ocean farm 1 designed by global maritime and it is considered the world s first offshore fish farm based on world class norwegian aquaculture and offshore technology ocean farm 1 aspires to address central issues related to sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry the idea behind the ocean farming concept is to introduce a design robust enough to be safely installed and operated at exposed coastal sites instead of a traditional gravity type cage using a flexible floating collar and a weight system to support the net it consists of a rigid frame supporting the net and a superstructure wheelhouse containing living quarters and rig controls to avoid drifting off the structure is kept in place by eight mooring lines bore and amdahl 2017 an illustration of the concept is seen in fig 1 we emphasize that the dimensions used in the studies differ slightly from real dimensions of ocean farm 1 the fish farm is a tubular structure consisting of braces and ring stiffened tubes many studies have been carried out on the impact response of tubular structures recent experimental studies on the indentation of tubular members or stiffened tubes are reported in cerik et al 2015 qu et al 2017 firouzsalari et al 2019 and zhu et al 2017 empirical and analytical solutions to the indentation response of tubes were given in wierzbicki and suh 1988 and amdahl 1980 decades ago le sourne et al 2016 and pire et al 2018 further developed the analytical solutions to predict the response of offshore wind turbine jackets to ship impacts the model consisted of analytical solutions for several characteristic deformation modes of tubes and has been verified to be of reasonable accuracy with numerical simulations numerical methods are also used to simulate the impact response of tubular structures such as le sourne et al 2015 travanca and hao 2015 and wang et al 2016 a comprehensive review on the impact response of tubular structures subjected to ship impacts is given in yu and amdahl 2018b numerical simulations are used in this paper for practical reasons the striking vessel selected is a 7500 ton offshore supply vessel which is larger than typical fish harvesting vessels and well boats but it is not out of range thus the analysis results are conservative with respect to safety considerations of the fish cage in section 2 the fish cage model the striking supply vessel model and the collision scenarios are described in detail the analysis is split into two steps i e local deformation in the vicinity of contact using ls dyna hallquist 2007 and global response analysis of the structure using usfos soreide et al 1999 sections 3 and 4 present the decoupled and coupled simulation results respectively with detailed shell modelling in ls dyna section 5 discusses results from global collision analysis using usfos section 6 discusses design considerations and possible evaluation criteria section 7 concludes the paper 2 model descriptions 2 1 the striking supply vessel a modern standard supply vessel bow is used in the study the principal dimensions of the vessel are given in table 1 the bow model is shown in fig 2 the element size is generally 120 mm the plate thickness varies from 7 mm for the decks to 12 5 mm in the bulb the stiffener spacing is approximately 600 mm with ring stiffeners and breast hooks of approximately 250 15 mm in the bulb the bulbous part is almost cylindrical and is relatively strong the forecastle protrudes 1 2 m ahead of the bulb both decoupled and coupled simulations are carried out in the local structural analysis using ls dyna 2 1 1 decoupled ship collision simulation in assessing the responses in ship collisions the traditional approach is to decouple the problem into two parts the external dynamics and the internal mechanics as suggested by minorsky 1958 the external dynamics models simplify the effect of fluid as constant added masses such that the whole collision system is un damped and the principle of conservation of momentum and energy applies this allows for a fast estimation of the dissipated energy and global motions after the collision examples of the external dynamic models are pedersen and zhang 1998 and liu and amdahl 2019 the lost energy will be dissipated by structural deformations and friction in the assessment of internal mechanics based on experiments numerical simulations or analytical methods see e g ohtsubo et al 1994 paik 2007 marinatos and samuelides 2015 cho and lee 2009 where the struck ship is normally fixed in space and the striking ship moves along a prescribed path the final penetration is obtained when the area under the force penetration curve equals the energy loss resulting from the external dynamic calculations the procedure is termed the decoupled method and has been widely used due to its simplicity and reasonable accuracy 2 1 2 coupled ship collision simulation in contrast to the decoupled method where ship motions are prescribed and hydrodynamic loads are much simplified coupled models have been proposed to enable integrated ship collision simulations considering hydrodynamic loads and ship motions in more detail examples of the coupled models are provided by petersen 1982 tabri et al 2010 samuelides and frieze 1989 le sourne et al 2012 pill and tabri 2011 and yu et al 2016 with various simplifications this paper adopts the advanced coupled model by proposed by yu et al 2016 which implements hydrodynamic loads based on linear potential flow theory into the nonlinear finite element code ls dyna by means of user defined load subroutine it is assumed that before collision propeller and rudder forces are in equilibrium with the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull departure from this state due to a sudden change in the external forces causes a change in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull petersen 1982 the governing motion equations are 1 k 1 6 m j k a j k η k 0 t k j k t τ η k τ η k t 0 d τ c j k η k f j t j 1 2 6 where m j k a j k and c j k are components of the generalized ship mass matrix the added mass matrix at infinite frequency and the restoring matrix of the ship the index j 1 6 represents surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively η k t 0 is the velocity component of the striking ship in the k th degree of freedom just before impact and f j t is the generalized collision force in the j th degree of freedom 0 t k t τ η τ d τ is the convolution integral connected with free surface memory effects and k j k t is the so called impulse response or retardation function connected with directions j and k it provides a radiation load in j direction acting on the vessel at the actual time t as a consequence of an impulse speed in k direction experienced by the ship at a previous time instant t τ k j k t is given alternatively by 2 k j k t 2 π 0 b j k ω cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 a j k a j k ω ω sin ω t d ω a j k ω and b j k ω are the frequency dependent added mass and linear wave radiation damping respectively the coupling between nonlinear fea structural solver and the linear hydrodynamic model is made possible by the user defined load subroutine loadud the coupling algorithm between structural and hydrodynamic solvers is shown in fig 3 during the simulation ls dyna first passes information of nodal displacements velocities and accelerations for the current timestep to the user subroutine the selected node is the one at the ship center of gravity cog the velocity histories of cog are then stored through the user common subroutine the time increment is typically in the order of 10 6 s in ship collision simulations for maintaining efficiency without losing accuracy the velocity histories are stored every 10 3 s with the above information the hydrodynamic loads can be calculated in the user load subroutine the obtained hydrodynamic loads are applied on the ship cog and ls dyna s structural solver then calculates structural deformation and ship motions and provides information of ship motions for the next timestep verification has been carried out where the collision forces are extracted from ls dyna simulations and applied to the motion solver simo marintek 2012 considering the resulting ship response based on linear potential flow theory motions measured from ls dyna simulation compared reasonably well with the simo results demonstrating good accuracy of the implementation more detailed description of the procedure is given in yu et al 2016 in the coupled simulations the ship s hull girder is represented by a long rigid beam from the bow back towards the center of gravity of the vessel see fig 4 the rigid beam and the deformable ship bow are connected to a rigid shell plate at the rear of the bow model the beam properties are calibrated to represent correctly the total mass and inertia of the ship with respect to the center of gravity taking into account the contribution of the bow model the 6dof hydrodynamic forces and moments are applied as user defined loads at the cog of the ship because the user defined load subroutine does not allow applying bending moments directly the bending moments have to be transformed into force pairs therefore several small rigid beams are created for applying bending moments in roll pitch and yaw the intersection of the beams is located at the center of gravity see fig 4 2 2 the fish cage model the floating fish cage consists of many ring stiffened tubes and columns that constitute a space frame the cage is slack moored at sea the total displacement is approx 16700 tons with a diameter of 110 m and the cage is designed to accommodate 1 5 million salmons the finite element model of the whole fish cage is illustrated in fig 5 and is used for the global response analysis with usfos usfos soreide et al 1999 is a program aimed at ultimate strength and progressive collapse analysis of framed offshore structures the basic idea of the program is to represent one physical element in the structure by one finite element which is efficient but still preserves good accuracy nonlinear material properties are accounted for by means of yield hinge theory and interaction formulas for stress resultants usfos has been used by many researchers and designers in the analysis of framed structures such as jackets and jack ups yu and amdahl 2018b and floating bridges sha et al 2019 in the global collision analysis with usfos the ship stiffness is modeled by two spring systems representing stiffness of the ship stem on the upper layer and bulb stiffness on the lower layer the two spring systems are rigidly connected by a rigid beam and nodal masses are used to represent the ship mass including hydrodynamic added mass it is important to allow the ship to detach from the fish cage at the end of impact therefore a two spring system is used in each layer as shown in fig 5 spring 1 is the nonlinear spring that is defined by the force deformation curve obtained from the local collision analysis in ls dyna with the detailed ship model spring 2 has an infinite stiffness in compression and zero stiffness in tension to facilitate separation with the used mass spring system the interaction between the ship and the fish cage can be accurately modeled for local strength assessment of the fish cage a detailed shell finite element sub model is made as shown in fig 6 the selected part is indicated by the dashed line in fig 5 the middle column is 35 1 m in height with a column diameter of 2 75 m the column outer shell thickness varies from 23 mm to 40 mm the columns are equipped with ring stiffeners t300 200 10 15 which are arranged every 3 m the connecting transverse tube is 2 25 m in diameter and the tube thickness varies from 19 mm to 40 mm ring stiffeners with dimensions of t300 200 10 15 are arranged every 3 2 m the arrangement of ring stiffeners of the fish cage is shown in fig 7 the four node belytschko lin tsay shell element is used the shell element size for the local cage model is in general 100 mm which is typically adopted in ship collision analysis this preserves good efficiency without losing accuracy this shell element size is consistent with acceptable element size range i e 5 10 times of the shell thickness that gives adequate performance of fracture models with coarsely meshed shell elements storheim 2016 more refined meshes are used for the ring stiffeners and stringers five elements are used for the stiffener web and four elements are used for the stiffener flange this is considered sufficient to develop buckling modes see fig 7 for simplicity the ends of the column the supporting tubes and the supporting braces marked in black in fig 6 are fixed in all degrees of freedom this boundary conditions are later discussed by comparison with global usfos analysis 2 3 material modelling when ship structure interaction is accounted for proper modelling of the material behavior is essential this is because the relative strength of the striking and struck objects are very sensitive to material strength and fracture a rupture of structures can easily turn the strong structure into the weak the steel material properties used for modelling the ship and the fish cage are given in table 2 the power law hardening model is used to model plastic strain hardening for steel where the coefficients k and n are determined form the stress strain curves for the material a yield plateau is defined to delay the onset of hardening and the plateau in the stress strain curve of steel is observed in many uniaxial tensile tests e g noh et al 2018 for the steel used in the fish cage the plateau was specified to be zero and this allowed use of the traditional power law model for the mild steel that is typically used in supply vessels the guaranteed minimum yield strength is 235 mpa however there is no strict requirement for the upper bound of the material strength as the crushing bow represents a load in this context the material is assumed to behave as a nv dw27 material with a yield strength of 275 mpa and significant strain hardening to simulate a more realistic yield strength storheim and amdahl 2014 this is in accordance with the design principles outlined in dnv rp c208 standard dnv rp c208 2016 the state of art rice tracey cockcroft latham rtcl damage criteria tørnqvist 2003 is used to model ductile fracture which combines the model by rice and tracey 1969 for tension dominated damage and the model by cockcroft and latham 1968 for shear dominated damage a cut off value of 1 3 of the stress triaxiality t σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 σ e q was introduced σ i is the i th major principal stress σ e q is the von mises equivalent stress below which the material is dominated by compression and no fracture will occur the damage rate d is defined as 3 d 0 if t 1 3 compression σ 1 σ e q ε e q if 1 3 t 1 3 shear exp 3 t 1 2 ε e q if t 1 3 tension where σ 1 is the major principal stress and ε e q is the rate of equivalent plastic strain an important feature with this criterion is that in uniaxial tension conditions t 1 3 the damage evolution d is exactly matched by the rate of equivalent plastic strain ε e q this is convenient with respect to calibration because the critical damage most easily can be found from uniaxial tensile tests from this a normalized damage criterion can be expressed as 4 d n o r m a l i z e d 1 ε c r d d t where ε c r is the critical equivalent plastic strain in uniaxial tension fracture is triggered when the normalized accumulated damage d n o r m a l i z e d reaches 1 to account for the mesh size effect ε c r is mesh scaled in accordance with the relationship 5 ε c r n ε n n t e l e where ε n is the failure strain in the simulation of uniaxial tension tests with a mesh size of l e t e and n is the power law exponent the adopted solver for the rtcl fracture criterion was implemented by alsos et al 2009 and storheim et al 2015 and has been calibrated and validated to be of good accuracy with plate tearing tests by simonsen and törnqvist 2004 indentation experiments of double sided shell structure by tautz et al 2013 and large scale collision tests by peschmann 2001 2 4 collision scenarios for local structural analysis 2 4 1 decoupled simulations four collision scenarios are analyzed for the decoupled simulations as shown in fig 8 scenario 1 bow collision with the column scenario 2 bow collision with the middle of the transverse supporting tube scenario 3 bow collision with one quarter span of the transverse supporting tube and diagonal braces for scenarios scenario 4 bow collision with the other quarter span of the transverse supporting tube the relative position of the ship and the fish cage is adjusted according to the operational draft of both structures the striking ship is assumed to move with a prescribed velocity of 3 m s the penalty based contact algorithms are used to model the contact between the vessel and the fish cage and the internal contact in the ship and the fish cage itself a friction coefficient of 0 3 is assumed for all the contacts 2 4 2 coupled simulations a scenario 5 is established for the coupled collision analysis in fig 9 the collision angle is α 60 the ends of the column the supporting tubes and the supporting braces are fixed against all degrees of freedom motions the striking ship is given an initial velocity of 3 m s in accordance with the latest version of norsok n003 2017 rather than prescribed trajectories in decoupled simulations 3 local decoupled collision simulation results 3 1 collision scenario 1 bow impact on the middle column in scenario 1 the supply vessel collides with the main column as shown in fig 8 the resulting energy dissipation and collision resistance are shown in fig 10 a total energy of about 31 mj is dissipated for a total ship displacement of 2 8 m where fracture initiates the total displacement of the ship equals the sum of the deformation and motion of the ship bow and the deformation of the cage the collision forces for the stem and bulb attain a peak after a displacement of 1 6 m and then drop drastically the energy dissipation before the drop is around 16 3 mj up to this point the column deformation is generally local the column top with a stiffened plate is quite strong and is able to crush the ship stem as shown in fig 11 at the lower contact point the ship bulb is strong and crushes the column causing only minor bulb deformation while the column undergoes significant local denting see fig 12 design formulations for the indentation resistance of unstiffened tubes are given in norsok n004 2004 the model takes the following form 6 r r c 22 1 2 b d w d d 1 925 3 5 b d 4 3 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 where r is the indentation resistance σ y is the material yield stress b is the contact width d is the tube dimeter and t is the wall thickness r c 1 4 σ y t 2 d t is a characteristic resistance of the tube against local denting n is the axial force applied on the tube and n p is fully plastic axial yield force of the cross section wierzbicki and suh 1988 derived a closed form solution for the indentation resistance of tubes under combined loading in the form of lateral indentation bending moment and axial force the problem was decoupled into bending and stretching of a series of unconnected rings and generators the indentation resistance reads 7 r r c 16 2 π 3 w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 fatt and wierzbicki 1991 extended wierzbicki and suh 1988 s model to consider indentation of ring stiffened columns by using the smeared thickness method the equivalent thickness t e q is found by equating the total bending moment over a characteristic length equal to the spacing between stiffeners of the stiffened shell to that of an unstiffened shell of assumed thickness the resulting indentation resistance of ring stiffened tubes is 8 r r c 16 t e q t 2 π 3 w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 fig 13 compares the force indentation curve from numerical simulations and from the analytical models it shows that the norsok model and the wierzbicki and suh model for unstiffened tubes captured the development of resistance with indentation reasonably well in the initial stage when the ring stiffeners get involved in the deformation and in the late stage when the brace starts global bending the predicted resistance with unstiffened tube models becomes lower with the smeared thickness method for ring stiffened tubes the model predicts much higher resistance than that from numerical simulation this is mainly because the bulb exerts a very concentrated action as shown in fig 14 a while the used analytical models for dent formulations are based on a transverse plane object as shown in fig 14 b anyway the numerical simulation result falls within the analytical resistance curves for stiffened and unstiffened tube models global deformation starts with a sudden drop of forces due to initiation of local buckling as shown in fig 15 this eases the contact between the ship stem and the top column plate considering the high diameter thickness ratio 120 this is expected according to iso 19902 standard for fixed steel offshore structures the ultimate bending moment capacity of the cross section corresponds to first yield only and the cross section is thus not capable of developing a plastic hinge local buckling forms at the junction of shells where the thickness changes from 19 mm to 40 mm the whole structure starts to deflect globally as the local buckle develops the bending moment and collision force drop deformation continues after initial buckling and lateral column deflection increases significantly for a total energy dissipation of 31 mj corresponding to a displacement of 2 8 m the left end of the transverse tube undergoes onset of fracture and the corresponding stress triaxiality distribution is shown in fig 16 a it is interesting to find that the tube is under compression globally but this induces local buckling and material bulging fracture occurs due to the combined local bending and membrane loading caused by global compression loads this is similar to the case of local fracture of square tubes under axial crushing refer fig 16 b costas et al 2019 such fracture pattern does not propagate fast and considerable capacity is maintained after initial fracture 3 2 collision scenario 2 bow impact on the middle of the transverse tube in collision scenario 2 the ship stem hits the middle of the transverse supporting tube the collision resistance and the internal energy are plotted in fig 17 it shows that the structure can absorb about 8 2 mj before initiation of fracture at a displacement of 1 5 m this energy is significantly lower than the value in scenario 1 however because fracture occurs due to progressive buckling as in scenario 1 the crack does not propagate fast and the structure still preserves considerable capacity from the resistance and energy curves in fig 17 final collapse occurs at a total displacement of 7 0 m corresponding to a total energy of 40 mj fig 18 shows that the ship undergoes little damage during collision and most of the energy 36 mj is dissipated through deformation of the cage fig 19 shows deformation of the fish cage at different total displacements for a total displacement of 1 5 m local buckling occurs at the shell connection where the thickness shifts from 19 mm to 40 mm as collision continues additional buckling occurs in other places including the transverse tube on the right side and the main column the buckled cross section is shown in fig 20 buckling at the intersection of the main column and the diagonal braces is induced by torsional moments 3 3 collision scenario 3 4 bow impact on the quarters of the transverse tube in collision scenario 3 the ship crushes both the horizontal tube quarter close to the diagonal brace a significant part of the energy is absorbed by membrane stretching of the braces this effect may be exaggerated because of the fully fixed boundary conditions during collision tubular braces legs deform first by local indentation local denting continuously degrades the plastic bending capacity of the tube when a certain indentation is reached the brace starts to collapse as a beam forming a three hinge mechanism upon further deformation axial membrane forces will occur in the design of such structures one should be careful to rely on the membrane forces to dissipate too much energy because of the sensitivity to the axial flexibility of the boundaries yu and amdahl 2018b for the studied fish cage the diagonal brace of the fish cage has a thickness of 15 mm a diameter of 1 m and a length of about 20 m this gives a large length over diameter ratio of 20 and a diameter over thickness ratio of 66 7 based on the established transition ratio chart from denting to global bending by yu and amdahl 2018a as shown in fig 21 the brace with given dimensions starts global bending immediately in addition the tube has a characteristic resistance for denting r c 1 4 σ y t 2 d t 0 16 mn which is significantly lower than 1 4 mn recommended by the updated dnv rp c204 2016 standard for maintaining cross sections compact this implies that the tube cross section will be significantly dented and the dented cross section loses the capability to dissipate energy by bending consequently the energy that can be dissipated by the braces through local denting and plastic hinges is quite limited and the brace dissipates most energy through membrane stretching provided that the supporting columns acting as boundaries are strong enough against the pull in 2 π r t σ y 33 5 mn this is far larger than the force level in figs 10 and 17 during design it is often not credible to rely on membrane stretching to dissipate a significant amount of energy and are thus not discussed in detail in collision scenario 4 the ship crushes the other quarter of the upper transverse supporting tube away from the diagonal brace the collision resistance and internal energy are shown in fig 22 initial fracture occurs at a displacement of 2 4 m corresponding to an energy dissipation of 14 mj as fracture occurs due to local bending and membrane loading caused by global compression loads the crack does not propagate fast and considerable capacity remains from fig 22 the structure can absorb around 40 mj at a displacement of 8 0 m without complete collapse however such large displacements should be avoided in order not to penetrate into the cage causing fish escape the deformation of the fish cage structure at different total displacements is shown in fig 23 when the ship moves 1 2 m into the fish cage structure initial local buckling occurs on the left side of the transverse tube corresponding to an energy dissipation of 5 5 mj as the collision continues buckling occurs at several similar places as in scenario 2 4 local coupled collision simulation scenario 5 scenario 5 is simulated using the coupled solver considering hydrodynamic loads and ship motions the initial collision angle is 60 the collision force components are plotted in fig 24 the collision lasts for about 7 5 s which is relatively long and comparable to ship natural periods all three force components are significant fig 25 shows both side view and top view of ship motion trajectories at the bow and at the ship center of gravity the temporal variation of the vertical displacement is plotted in fig 26 a these plots show that the pitch and heave motions are significant the ship bow moves a maximum of 1 15 m upwards while the maximum heave displacement at the ship center of gravity is 0 25 m the sway and yaw motions are indicated by the red trajectory lines in fig 26 a the time histories of the roll and yaw motions are plotted in fig 26 b these plots show that the yaw angle is small because the tube deforms and tends to wrap around the ship stem after some time and therefore locks the ship with respect to yaw motion the temporal variation of the internal energy and the friction energy is plotted in fig 27 and is compared with external dynamic models by liu and amdahl 2019 a friction coefficient μ 0 3 is adopted in the simulation the plots show that the 3dof external dynamic model with μ 0 3 underestimates the energy dissipation while energy predicted by the 6dof model is expected to be even lower this is mainly because ship motions are locked to some extent due to tube deformations the collision duration is long with complicated ship trajectories during the process the normal vector of the contact surface changes significantly in this case the simplified external mechanics models may give inaccurate predictions and yield unconservative results however if we give artificially a large friction coefficient to enable a forced sticking case the predicted internal energy becomes close to simulation results but with smaller friction energy this indicates that during the external dynamic calculations the forces in the tangential direction includes not only the friction force but also the tangential deformation resistance also known as the moving loads this is consistent with findings in liu and amdahl 2019 additional information regarding assumptions and limitations of the external dynamic models can be found in yu et al 2019 5 global response simulation in usfos local ls dyna analysis with shell modelling gives significant details of structural deformations in the vicinity of the impacted zone this however yields a large number of elements and requires considerable computational resources in addition the shell model contains only a small part of the fish cage and the boundaries are fixed in all degrees of freedom this neglects the interaction between the cage motion and structural deformation for collision scenarios close to the boundaries the resulting resistance may be exaggerated see e g scenario 3 in order to verify the boundaries of the local shell model and to study the global collision response of the fish cage usfos is a viable tool with efficient beam formulations and with good accuracy the fish cage model used in the usfos analysis is shown in fig 5 it is moored with eight mooring lines the ring stiffeners are not modeled but are smeared onto the associated tube the ship with associated mass 7500 tons displacement plus 10 added mass for head on collisions in accordance with norsok n003 2017 is modeled as a concentrated mass connected to the fish cage model with nonlinear springs one for the contact with the stem at forecastle deck and one for the contact with the bulb the force penetration relationships that are assumed for the bulb and the forecastle are shown in fig 28 left they are based on information given by storheim and amdahl 2014 with the same supply vessel model the ship was given an initial speed of 3 6 m s corresponding to a kinetic energy of 53 5 mj after 0 1 s when the gravity and buoyancy forces have been applied the good agreement of the input resistance curve and the resistance obtained from simulations indicates correct implementation notably the bulb has a high resistance to deformation each deformation spring is connected to an elastic spring that allows the contact to unload completely towards the end of the collision the force time histories from the simulation are plotted in fig 28 right the peak force at the forecastle deck and at the bulb location is almost equal but the bulb force has a somewhat longer duration the actual deformations of the bulb and the forecastle are indicated in fig 28 left it is noticed that the deformation of the bulb is only 0 3 m while the stem at forecastle deck undergoes 0 7 m deformation for this force level hence the bulb dissipates only about 1 2 mj while the stem at forecastle deck dissipates approximately 4 8 mj the diagrams show that the bulb and forecastle have spent a considerable time on the elastic unloading part of the deformation curve so accurate modelling of unloading may be essential while the bulb undergoes very little damage the vertical column is subjected to a significant local indentation of 0 75 m approximately 27 of the column diameter as shown in fig 29 left the associated denting energy calculated by usfos is around 4 9 mj and is based on the denting curve given in norsok n004 2004 see fig 29 right according to norsok n004 2004 the dent reduces the plastic moment capacity by 60 this reduction is also realized in the usfos simulations by creating a plastic hinge at the location of the bulb contact from the simulations the total plastic energy dissipated by the ship and local denting is about 11 mj at the time of the maximum impact force for the bulb i e after 1 25 s the fish cage has dissipated 29 mj energy mainly by structural deformation of the column in the hit area the total kinetic energy has been reduced from 53 5 mj to 13 5 mj where the ship contributes with 7 5 mj and the kinetic energy of the fish cage is 6 mj at this stage and is dominated by motion of the hit framework and fish farm rotations while the translational speed of the whole cage is still small 0 15 m s the impulse for the bulb and the forecastle for the entire impact calculated from the force histories in fig 28 right amounts to 18 3 mns and 13 mns respectively thus the impulse should give the vessel a change of velocity equal to roughly 3 8 m s i e the vessel should move with a speed of about 0 2 m s in the opposite direction after collision the plot in fig 30 left confirms this the mass and added mass of the fish farm is 33400 tons hence the fish farm should get a speed of 1 m s which agrees well with the simulated speed at the end of contact the displacement of the cage center column at the end of collision is virtually zero and confirms that the impact is highly impulsive thus the local model will provide reliable information of the collision damage it is interesting to notice that a simple rigid body model would predict the remaining kinetic energy to be 10 6 mj at the end of the first impact period before any partial restitution this is close to the actual value after 2 8 s in fig 30 but it should be recognized that the two bodies do move in opposite direction and not as one body the collision forces for the bulb and the forecastle are plotted versus total vessel displacement in fig 30 right the curves resemble those from local ls dyna simulations in fig 10 fig 31 illustrates the plastic deformations in the fish cage the overall picture resembles that of the local analysis of scenario 1 most of the damage has been absorbed in the locally modeled region the supporting columns connected to transverse tubes act as supporting boundaries and their stress states are far from yielding this shows that it is reasonable to assume clamped conditions at the boundaries members outside the direct contact area are seen to be affected to some extent but the associated energy is negligible compared to the total energy usfos predicts that the thin walled frame at the top center joint undergoes local buckling amounting to approximately 10 of the brace diameter during plastic rotations 6 discussion local shell analysis and global beam analysis have been used to investigate the structural response of the fish farm cage under supply vessel impacts as there is no direct design standard for offshore fish farms against ship impacts established standards and researches for offshore oil and gas may be useful the design of offshore platforms against ship impacts may be carried out in the ductile shared energy or strength design domain dnv rp c204 2016 see fig 32 strength design the installation is strong enough to resist collision forces with minor deformation so that the ship is forced to deform and dissipate the major part of the energy ductility design the installation undergoes large plastic deformation and dissipates the major part of the collision energy shared energy design both the installation and the ship contribute significantly to energy dissipation from the above local and global analysis the relative strength of the ship and the offshore fish cage falls predominantly within the ductile design domain where the fish farm dissipates most of the impact energy through structural deformations in the design of offshore installations against collisions structural damage can be allowed provided that it does not impair the main safety functions and does not lead to progressive collapse of the structure or sinking due to puncturing and flooding of buoyancy compartments further the structure should have sufficient residual strength in damaged condition to resist waves and current loads with a certain return period say 1 year before it can be repaired for fish farms it may also be relevant to introduce a requirement related to net penetration and damage in order to avoid or limit fish escape 7 conclusions this paper presents a combined local and global analysis procedure of supply vessel collisions with an offshore fish farm the striking ship was selected to be a standard offshore supply vessel with a displacement of 7500 tons energy absorption capacity and collapse patterns of the offshore fish farm and the relative strength of the supply vessel and the fish cage were investigated in the local collision analysis the decoupled simulations show that the fish farm is capable of absorbing considerable energy through structural deformations before complete collapse in general the resistance of the fish cage is smaller than that of the striking vessel especially the bulbous bulb and most of the impact energy is dissipated by the fish cage however the column top with a stiffened plate represents a hard spot of the fish farm and is capable of crushing the ship stem significantly the middle column and the transverse tubes are very thin walled with large diameter thickness ratios and are thus susceptible to local buckling and denting this limits the energy that the tubes can dissipate by plastic bending or by crushing the ship bow a single scenario was also analyzed using coupled simulations where ship motions in 6 degrees of freedom were accurately predicted based on potential flow theory for the hydrodynamic loads the analyses showed the striking ship undergoes significant pitch motions in addition the deformed transverse tube is observed to warp around the ship bow and thus constraints further ship motions external dynamic models do not capture the motion locking effect and predicts lower energy than that from the coupled simulation from the global analysis using usfos structural damage of the fish cage mainly concentrates on the impacted region with less damage outside the direct contact area the analysis confirms the major conclusions for energy absorption and structural damage from the local shell analysis possible acceptance criteria for designing offshore fish farms against ship collisions are discussed in view of those adopted for offshore oil and gas structures

22323,due to limited nearshore areas and great impact to local ecosystems the aquaculture industry is moving the fish farms into more exposed sea regions where the environmental conditions are much more severe like other offshore installations operating at sea fish cages are also exposed to the risk of collisions from attendant or visiting vessels this paper evaluates the structural strength of the world s first offshore fish farm operating in norway subjected to supply vessel collisions by the use of nonlinear finite element simulations the fish cage is a semi submersible floating structure consisting of ring stiffened columns connected by braces a standard 7500 ton supply vessel is used as the striking vessel both local shell deformation analysis using ls dyna and beam deformation analysis using usfos are carried out in the local shell analysis collision scenarios with both decoupled and coupled methods are simulated for several representative impact locations the decoupled model adopts prescribed paths for ship motions while in the coupled model the ship motions are calculated based on hydrodynamic forces from linear potential theory as well as inertia and collision forces in the global beam column analysis in usfos the force deformation curves of the supply vessel from local shell analysis are used as the input the resulting damage and energy absorption are compared with those from local shell simulations the results are discussed with respect to the impact resistance energy absorption and structural damage keywords offshore fish farm ship collision coupled simulation local and global analysis structural damage 1 introduction with the fish farming industry going into more exposed seas the fish cages become larger and much more fish can be accommodated than ever before however harsher environmental loads and frequent aquaculture operations imply risk for accidental actions such as ship collisions where damage potential and possible consequences can be severe like other offshore installations e g jackets and jack ups yu and amdahl 2018b le sourne et al 2016 submersible platforms and wind turbines biehl and lehmann 2006 le sourne et al 2015 fish farms are exposed to the risk of collisions both from service vessels and merchant vessels on erroneous track this may represent major threats to the safety and integrity of the fish farms a major collision may cause extensive structural damage and in extreme cases the fish farm may collapse completely with fish escape as a result escape of farmed fish will cause major economic losses for the fish farming company and is considered to have negative impact on the wild stocks more seriously a collision event may also represent a safety threat for the personnel both on the ship and the fish farm hence this should be avoided by either proper safety measures to reduce the likelihood of collision by direct design or favorably by a combination design aspects of accidental loads from ship collisions are however not included in the present norwegian technical standard for the design of fish farms standard norway ns9415 2009 in addition to resisting the direct actions during collision the damaged structure should maintain sufficient residual strength so that it can resist operational and environmental loads before it can be repaired realistic estimates of the environmental load levels at a given site and structural condition rely on adequate descriptions of the marine environment including the exposure to wind waves and current ship collisions have been considered for decades in the offshore industry in the design against ship collision actions the kinetic energy of the vessel is determined by a risk assessment the design practice in the north sea that has been used for decades was to consider impact from a supply vessel of 5000 tons with a kinetic energy of 11 mj for bow or stern impact and 14 mj for sideway impact considering hydrodynamic effects over the years the experienced collision energy has increased significantly due to increased ship sizes and impact velocities according to kvitrud 2011 who summarized collision accidents in norway in the period 2001 2010 in the latest version norsok n003 2017 displacements of the design supply vessel has increased to 6500 10 000 tons and the design impact velocities has increased to 3 m s for head on collisions and 2 m s for side collisions moan et al 2017 this yields a significantly larger design energy of about 50 mj for head on collisions the norsok standards are developed for offshore structures used for oil and gas production but standard collision actions for offshore fish farm has not been established the intention of this work is to investigate the collision resistance and permanent damage of a selected fish farm as a function of the collision energy no comparison is made with acceptance criteria as they have generally not been established but possible evaluation criteria are discussed with the simulation results it is emphasized that structural damage is investigated only penetration of the net may occur for small impact energies and the potential of fish escape can be large even if integrity of the structure is not put in jeopardy the fish cage structure analyzed is the ocean farming concept ocean farm 1 designed by global maritime and it is considered the world s first offshore fish farm based on world class norwegian aquaculture and offshore technology ocean farm 1 aspires to address central issues related to sustainable growth in the aquaculture industry the idea behind the ocean farming concept is to introduce a design robust enough to be safely installed and operated at exposed coastal sites instead of a traditional gravity type cage using a flexible floating collar and a weight system to support the net it consists of a rigid frame supporting the net and a superstructure wheelhouse containing living quarters and rig controls to avoid drifting off the structure is kept in place by eight mooring lines bore and amdahl 2017 an illustration of the concept is seen in fig 1 we emphasize that the dimensions used in the studies differ slightly from real dimensions of ocean farm 1 the fish farm is a tubular structure consisting of braces and ring stiffened tubes many studies have been carried out on the impact response of tubular structures recent experimental studies on the indentation of tubular members or stiffened tubes are reported in cerik et al 2015 qu et al 2017 firouzsalari et al 2019 and zhu et al 2017 empirical and analytical solutions to the indentation response of tubes were given in wierzbicki and suh 1988 and amdahl 1980 decades ago le sourne et al 2016 and pire et al 2018 further developed the analytical solutions to predict the response of offshore wind turbine jackets to ship impacts the model consisted of analytical solutions for several characteristic deformation modes of tubes and has been verified to be of reasonable accuracy with numerical simulations numerical methods are also used to simulate the impact response of tubular structures such as le sourne et al 2015 travanca and hao 2015 and wang et al 2016 a comprehensive review on the impact response of tubular structures subjected to ship impacts is given in yu and amdahl 2018b numerical simulations are used in this paper for practical reasons the striking vessel selected is a 7500 ton offshore supply vessel which is larger than typical fish harvesting vessels and well boats but it is not out of range thus the analysis results are conservative with respect to safety considerations of the fish cage in section 2 the fish cage model the striking supply vessel model and the collision scenarios are described in detail the analysis is split into two steps i e local deformation in the vicinity of contact using ls dyna hallquist 2007 and global response analysis of the structure using usfos soreide et al 1999 sections 3 and 4 present the decoupled and coupled simulation results respectively with detailed shell modelling in ls dyna section 5 discusses results from global collision analysis using usfos section 6 discusses design considerations and possible evaluation criteria section 7 concludes the paper 2 model descriptions 2 1 the striking supply vessel a modern standard supply vessel bow is used in the study the principal dimensions of the vessel are given in table 1 the bow model is shown in fig 2 the element size is generally 120 mm the plate thickness varies from 7 mm for the decks to 12 5 mm in the bulb the stiffener spacing is approximately 600 mm with ring stiffeners and breast hooks of approximately 250 15 mm in the bulb the bulbous part is almost cylindrical and is relatively strong the forecastle protrudes 1 2 m ahead of the bulb both decoupled and coupled simulations are carried out in the local structural analysis using ls dyna 2 1 1 decoupled ship collision simulation in assessing the responses in ship collisions the traditional approach is to decouple the problem into two parts the external dynamics and the internal mechanics as suggested by minorsky 1958 the external dynamics models simplify the effect of fluid as constant added masses such that the whole collision system is un damped and the principle of conservation of momentum and energy applies this allows for a fast estimation of the dissipated energy and global motions after the collision examples of the external dynamic models are pedersen and zhang 1998 and liu and amdahl 2019 the lost energy will be dissipated by structural deformations and friction in the assessment of internal mechanics based on experiments numerical simulations or analytical methods see e g ohtsubo et al 1994 paik 2007 marinatos and samuelides 2015 cho and lee 2009 where the struck ship is normally fixed in space and the striking ship moves along a prescribed path the final penetration is obtained when the area under the force penetration curve equals the energy loss resulting from the external dynamic calculations the procedure is termed the decoupled method and has been widely used due to its simplicity and reasonable accuracy 2 1 2 coupled ship collision simulation in contrast to the decoupled method where ship motions are prescribed and hydrodynamic loads are much simplified coupled models have been proposed to enable integrated ship collision simulations considering hydrodynamic loads and ship motions in more detail examples of the coupled models are provided by petersen 1982 tabri et al 2010 samuelides and frieze 1989 le sourne et al 2012 pill and tabri 2011 and yu et al 2016 with various simplifications this paper adopts the advanced coupled model by proposed by yu et al 2016 which implements hydrodynamic loads based on linear potential flow theory into the nonlinear finite element code ls dyna by means of user defined load subroutine it is assumed that before collision propeller and rudder forces are in equilibrium with the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull departure from this state due to a sudden change in the external forces causes a change in the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull petersen 1982 the governing motion equations are 1 k 1 6 m j k a j k η k 0 t k j k t τ η k τ η k t 0 d τ c j k η k f j t j 1 2 6 where m j k a j k and c j k are components of the generalized ship mass matrix the added mass matrix at infinite frequency and the restoring matrix of the ship the index j 1 6 represents surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively η k t 0 is the velocity component of the striking ship in the k th degree of freedom just before impact and f j t is the generalized collision force in the j th degree of freedom 0 t k t τ η τ d τ is the convolution integral connected with free surface memory effects and k j k t is the so called impulse response or retardation function connected with directions j and k it provides a radiation load in j direction acting on the vessel at the actual time t as a consequence of an impulse speed in k direction experienced by the ship at a previous time instant t τ k j k t is given alternatively by 2 k j k t 2 π 0 b j k ω cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 a j k a j k ω ω sin ω t d ω a j k ω and b j k ω are the frequency dependent added mass and linear wave radiation damping respectively the coupling between nonlinear fea structural solver and the linear hydrodynamic model is made possible by the user defined load subroutine loadud the coupling algorithm between structural and hydrodynamic solvers is shown in fig 3 during the simulation ls dyna first passes information of nodal displacements velocities and accelerations for the current timestep to the user subroutine the selected node is the one at the ship center of gravity cog the velocity histories of cog are then stored through the user common subroutine the time increment is typically in the order of 10 6 s in ship collision simulations for maintaining efficiency without losing accuracy the velocity histories are stored every 10 3 s with the above information the hydrodynamic loads can be calculated in the user load subroutine the obtained hydrodynamic loads are applied on the ship cog and ls dyna s structural solver then calculates structural deformation and ship motions and provides information of ship motions for the next timestep verification has been carried out where the collision forces are extracted from ls dyna simulations and applied to the motion solver simo marintek 2012 considering the resulting ship response based on linear potential flow theory motions measured from ls dyna simulation compared reasonably well with the simo results demonstrating good accuracy of the implementation more detailed description of the procedure is given in yu et al 2016 in the coupled simulations the ship s hull girder is represented by a long rigid beam from the bow back towards the center of gravity of the vessel see fig 4 the rigid beam and the deformable ship bow are connected to a rigid shell plate at the rear of the bow model the beam properties are calibrated to represent correctly the total mass and inertia of the ship with respect to the center of gravity taking into account the contribution of the bow model the 6dof hydrodynamic forces and moments are applied as user defined loads at the cog of the ship because the user defined load subroutine does not allow applying bending moments directly the bending moments have to be transformed into force pairs therefore several small rigid beams are created for applying bending moments in roll pitch and yaw the intersection of the beams is located at the center of gravity see fig 4 2 2 the fish cage model the floating fish cage consists of many ring stiffened tubes and columns that constitute a space frame the cage is slack moored at sea the total displacement is approx 16700 tons with a diameter of 110 m and the cage is designed to accommodate 1 5 million salmons the finite element model of the whole fish cage is illustrated in fig 5 and is used for the global response analysis with usfos usfos soreide et al 1999 is a program aimed at ultimate strength and progressive collapse analysis of framed offshore structures the basic idea of the program is to represent one physical element in the structure by one finite element which is efficient but still preserves good accuracy nonlinear material properties are accounted for by means of yield hinge theory and interaction formulas for stress resultants usfos has been used by many researchers and designers in the analysis of framed structures such as jackets and jack ups yu and amdahl 2018b and floating bridges sha et al 2019 in the global collision analysis with usfos the ship stiffness is modeled by two spring systems representing stiffness of the ship stem on the upper layer and bulb stiffness on the lower layer the two spring systems are rigidly connected by a rigid beam and nodal masses are used to represent the ship mass including hydrodynamic added mass it is important to allow the ship to detach from the fish cage at the end of impact therefore a two spring system is used in each layer as shown in fig 5 spring 1 is the nonlinear spring that is defined by the force deformation curve obtained from the local collision analysis in ls dyna with the detailed ship model spring 2 has an infinite stiffness in compression and zero stiffness in tension to facilitate separation with the used mass spring system the interaction between the ship and the fish cage can be accurately modeled for local strength assessment of the fish cage a detailed shell finite element sub model is made as shown in fig 6 the selected part is indicated by the dashed line in fig 5 the middle column is 35 1 m in height with a column diameter of 2 75 m the column outer shell thickness varies from 23 mm to 40 mm the columns are equipped with ring stiffeners t300 200 10 15 which are arranged every 3 m the connecting transverse tube is 2 25 m in diameter and the tube thickness varies from 19 mm to 40 mm ring stiffeners with dimensions of t300 200 10 15 are arranged every 3 2 m the arrangement of ring stiffeners of the fish cage is shown in fig 7 the four node belytschko lin tsay shell element is used the shell element size for the local cage model is in general 100 mm which is typically adopted in ship collision analysis this preserves good efficiency without losing accuracy this shell element size is consistent with acceptable element size range i e 5 10 times of the shell thickness that gives adequate performance of fracture models with coarsely meshed shell elements storheim 2016 more refined meshes are used for the ring stiffeners and stringers five elements are used for the stiffener web and four elements are used for the stiffener flange this is considered sufficient to develop buckling modes see fig 7 for simplicity the ends of the column the supporting tubes and the supporting braces marked in black in fig 6 are fixed in all degrees of freedom this boundary conditions are later discussed by comparison with global usfos analysis 2 3 material modelling when ship structure interaction is accounted for proper modelling of the material behavior is essential this is because the relative strength of the striking and struck objects are very sensitive to material strength and fracture a rupture of structures can easily turn the strong structure into the weak the steel material properties used for modelling the ship and the fish cage are given in table 2 the power law hardening model is used to model plastic strain hardening for steel where the coefficients k and n are determined form the stress strain curves for the material a yield plateau is defined to delay the onset of hardening and the plateau in the stress strain curve of steel is observed in many uniaxial tensile tests e g noh et al 2018 for the steel used in the fish cage the plateau was specified to be zero and this allowed use of the traditional power law model for the mild steel that is typically used in supply vessels the guaranteed minimum yield strength is 235 mpa however there is no strict requirement for the upper bound of the material strength as the crushing bow represents a load in this context the material is assumed to behave as a nv dw27 material with a yield strength of 275 mpa and significant strain hardening to simulate a more realistic yield strength storheim and amdahl 2014 this is in accordance with the design principles outlined in dnv rp c208 standard dnv rp c208 2016 the state of art rice tracey cockcroft latham rtcl damage criteria tørnqvist 2003 is used to model ductile fracture which combines the model by rice and tracey 1969 for tension dominated damage and the model by cockcroft and latham 1968 for shear dominated damage a cut off value of 1 3 of the stress triaxiality t σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 σ e q was introduced σ i is the i th major principal stress σ e q is the von mises equivalent stress below which the material is dominated by compression and no fracture will occur the damage rate d is defined as 3 d 0 if t 1 3 compression σ 1 σ e q ε e q if 1 3 t 1 3 shear exp 3 t 1 2 ε e q if t 1 3 tension where σ 1 is the major principal stress and ε e q is the rate of equivalent plastic strain an important feature with this criterion is that in uniaxial tension conditions t 1 3 the damage evolution d is exactly matched by the rate of equivalent plastic strain ε e q this is convenient with respect to calibration because the critical damage most easily can be found from uniaxial tensile tests from this a normalized damage criterion can be expressed as 4 d n o r m a l i z e d 1 ε c r d d t where ε c r is the critical equivalent plastic strain in uniaxial tension fracture is triggered when the normalized accumulated damage d n o r m a l i z e d reaches 1 to account for the mesh size effect ε c r is mesh scaled in accordance with the relationship 5 ε c r n ε n n t e l e where ε n is the failure strain in the simulation of uniaxial tension tests with a mesh size of l e t e and n is the power law exponent the adopted solver for the rtcl fracture criterion was implemented by alsos et al 2009 and storheim et al 2015 and has been calibrated and validated to be of good accuracy with plate tearing tests by simonsen and törnqvist 2004 indentation experiments of double sided shell structure by tautz et al 2013 and large scale collision tests by peschmann 2001 2 4 collision scenarios for local structural analysis 2 4 1 decoupled simulations four collision scenarios are analyzed for the decoupled simulations as shown in fig 8 scenario 1 bow collision with the column scenario 2 bow collision with the middle of the transverse supporting tube scenario 3 bow collision with one quarter span of the transverse supporting tube and diagonal braces for scenarios scenario 4 bow collision with the other quarter span of the transverse supporting tube the relative position of the ship and the fish cage is adjusted according to the operational draft of both structures the striking ship is assumed to move with a prescribed velocity of 3 m s the penalty based contact algorithms are used to model the contact between the vessel and the fish cage and the internal contact in the ship and the fish cage itself a friction coefficient of 0 3 is assumed for all the contacts 2 4 2 coupled simulations a scenario 5 is established for the coupled collision analysis in fig 9 the collision angle is α 60 the ends of the column the supporting tubes and the supporting braces are fixed against all degrees of freedom motions the striking ship is given an initial velocity of 3 m s in accordance with the latest version of norsok n003 2017 rather than prescribed trajectories in decoupled simulations 3 local decoupled collision simulation results 3 1 collision scenario 1 bow impact on the middle column in scenario 1 the supply vessel collides with the main column as shown in fig 8 the resulting energy dissipation and collision resistance are shown in fig 10 a total energy of about 31 mj is dissipated for a total ship displacement of 2 8 m where fracture initiates the total displacement of the ship equals the sum of the deformation and motion of the ship bow and the deformation of the cage the collision forces for the stem and bulb attain a peak after a displacement of 1 6 m and then drop drastically the energy dissipation before the drop is around 16 3 mj up to this point the column deformation is generally local the column top with a stiffened plate is quite strong and is able to crush the ship stem as shown in fig 11 at the lower contact point the ship bulb is strong and crushes the column causing only minor bulb deformation while the column undergoes significant local denting see fig 12 design formulations for the indentation resistance of unstiffened tubes are given in norsok n004 2004 the model takes the following form 6 r r c 22 1 2 b d w d d 1 925 3 5 b d 4 3 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 where r is the indentation resistance σ y is the material yield stress b is the contact width d is the tube dimeter and t is the wall thickness r c 1 4 σ y t 2 d t is a characteristic resistance of the tube against local denting n is the axial force applied on the tube and n p is fully plastic axial yield force of the cross section wierzbicki and suh 1988 derived a closed form solution for the indentation resistance of tubes under combined loading in the form of lateral indentation bending moment and axial force the problem was decoupled into bending and stretching of a series of unconnected rings and generators the indentation resistance reads 7 r r c 16 2 π 3 w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 fatt and wierzbicki 1991 extended wierzbicki and suh 1988 s model to consider indentation of ring stiffened columns by using the smeared thickness method the equivalent thickness t e q is found by equating the total bending moment over a characteristic length equal to the spacing between stiffeners of the stiffened shell to that of an unstiffened shell of assumed thickness the resulting indentation resistance of ring stiffened tubes is 8 r r c 16 t e q t 2 π 3 w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 fig 13 compares the force indentation curve from numerical simulations and from the analytical models it shows that the norsok model and the wierzbicki and suh model for unstiffened tubes captured the development of resistance with indentation reasonably well in the initial stage when the ring stiffeners get involved in the deformation and in the late stage when the brace starts global bending the predicted resistance with unstiffened tube models becomes lower with the smeared thickness method for ring stiffened tubes the model predicts much higher resistance than that from numerical simulation this is mainly because the bulb exerts a very concentrated action as shown in fig 14 a while the used analytical models for dent formulations are based on a transverse plane object as shown in fig 14 b anyway the numerical simulation result falls within the analytical resistance curves for stiffened and unstiffened tube models global deformation starts with a sudden drop of forces due to initiation of local buckling as shown in fig 15 this eases the contact between the ship stem and the top column plate considering the high diameter thickness ratio 120 this is expected according to iso 19902 standard for fixed steel offshore structures the ultimate bending moment capacity of the cross section corresponds to first yield only and the cross section is thus not capable of developing a plastic hinge local buckling forms at the junction of shells where the thickness changes from 19 mm to 40 mm the whole structure starts to deflect globally as the local buckle develops the bending moment and collision force drop deformation continues after initial buckling and lateral column deflection increases significantly for a total energy dissipation of 31 mj corresponding to a displacement of 2 8 m the left end of the transverse tube undergoes onset of fracture and the corresponding stress triaxiality distribution is shown in fig 16 a it is interesting to find that the tube is under compression globally but this induces local buckling and material bulging fracture occurs due to the combined local bending and membrane loading caused by global compression loads this is similar to the case of local fracture of square tubes under axial crushing refer fig 16 b costas et al 2019 such fracture pattern does not propagate fast and considerable capacity is maintained after initial fracture 3 2 collision scenario 2 bow impact on the middle of the transverse tube in collision scenario 2 the ship stem hits the middle of the transverse supporting tube the collision resistance and the internal energy are plotted in fig 17 it shows that the structure can absorb about 8 2 mj before initiation of fracture at a displacement of 1 5 m this energy is significantly lower than the value in scenario 1 however because fracture occurs due to progressive buckling as in scenario 1 the crack does not propagate fast and the structure still preserves considerable capacity from the resistance and energy curves in fig 17 final collapse occurs at a total displacement of 7 0 m corresponding to a total energy of 40 mj fig 18 shows that the ship undergoes little damage during collision and most of the energy 36 mj is dissipated through deformation of the cage fig 19 shows deformation of the fish cage at different total displacements for a total displacement of 1 5 m local buckling occurs at the shell connection where the thickness shifts from 19 mm to 40 mm as collision continues additional buckling occurs in other places including the transverse tube on the right side and the main column the buckled cross section is shown in fig 20 buckling at the intersection of the main column and the diagonal braces is induced by torsional moments 3 3 collision scenario 3 4 bow impact on the quarters of the transverse tube in collision scenario 3 the ship crushes both the horizontal tube quarter close to the diagonal brace a significant part of the energy is absorbed by membrane stretching of the braces this effect may be exaggerated because of the fully fixed boundary conditions during collision tubular braces legs deform first by local indentation local denting continuously degrades the plastic bending capacity of the tube when a certain indentation is reached the brace starts to collapse as a beam forming a three hinge mechanism upon further deformation axial membrane forces will occur in the design of such structures one should be careful to rely on the membrane forces to dissipate too much energy because of the sensitivity to the axial flexibility of the boundaries yu and amdahl 2018b for the studied fish cage the diagonal brace of the fish cage has a thickness of 15 mm a diameter of 1 m and a length of about 20 m this gives a large length over diameter ratio of 20 and a diameter over thickness ratio of 66 7 based on the established transition ratio chart from denting to global bending by yu and amdahl 2018a as shown in fig 21 the brace with given dimensions starts global bending immediately in addition the tube has a characteristic resistance for denting r c 1 4 σ y t 2 d t 0 16 mn which is significantly lower than 1 4 mn recommended by the updated dnv rp c204 2016 standard for maintaining cross sections compact this implies that the tube cross section will be significantly dented and the dented cross section loses the capability to dissipate energy by bending consequently the energy that can be dissipated by the braces through local denting and plastic hinges is quite limited and the brace dissipates most energy through membrane stretching provided that the supporting columns acting as boundaries are strong enough against the pull in 2 π r t σ y 33 5 mn this is far larger than the force level in figs 10 and 17 during design it is often not credible to rely on membrane stretching to dissipate a significant amount of energy and are thus not discussed in detail in collision scenario 4 the ship crushes the other quarter of the upper transverse supporting tube away from the diagonal brace the collision resistance and internal energy are shown in fig 22 initial fracture occurs at a displacement of 2 4 m corresponding to an energy dissipation of 14 mj as fracture occurs due to local bending and membrane loading caused by global compression loads the crack does not propagate fast and considerable capacity remains from fig 22 the structure can absorb around 40 mj at a displacement of 8 0 m without complete collapse however such large displacements should be avoided in order not to penetrate into the cage causing fish escape the deformation of the fish cage structure at different total displacements is shown in fig 23 when the ship moves 1 2 m into the fish cage structure initial local buckling occurs on the left side of the transverse tube corresponding to an energy dissipation of 5 5 mj as the collision continues buckling occurs at several similar places as in scenario 2 4 local coupled collision simulation scenario 5 scenario 5 is simulated using the coupled solver considering hydrodynamic loads and ship motions the initial collision angle is 60 the collision force components are plotted in fig 24 the collision lasts for about 7 5 s which is relatively long and comparable to ship natural periods all three force components are significant fig 25 shows both side view and top view of ship motion trajectories at the bow and at the ship center of gravity the temporal variation of the vertical displacement is plotted in fig 26 a these plots show that the pitch and heave motions are significant the ship bow moves a maximum of 1 15 m upwards while the maximum heave displacement at the ship center of gravity is 0 25 m the sway and yaw motions are indicated by the red trajectory lines in fig 26 a the time histories of the roll and yaw motions are plotted in fig 26 b these plots show that the yaw angle is small because the tube deforms and tends to wrap around the ship stem after some time and therefore locks the ship with respect to yaw motion the temporal variation of the internal energy and the friction energy is plotted in fig 27 and is compared with external dynamic models by liu and amdahl 2019 a friction coefficient μ 0 3 is adopted in the simulation the plots show that the 3dof external dynamic model with μ 0 3 underestimates the energy dissipation while energy predicted by the 6dof model is expected to be even lower this is mainly because ship motions are locked to some extent due to tube deformations the collision duration is long with complicated ship trajectories during the process the normal vector of the contact surface changes significantly in this case the simplified external mechanics models may give inaccurate predictions and yield unconservative results however if we give artificially a large friction coefficient to enable a forced sticking case the predicted internal energy becomes close to simulation results but with smaller friction energy this indicates that during the external dynamic calculations the forces in the tangential direction includes not only the friction force but also the tangential deformation resistance also known as the moving loads this is consistent with findings in liu and amdahl 2019 additional information regarding assumptions and limitations of the external dynamic models can be found in yu et al 2019 5 global response simulation in usfos local ls dyna analysis with shell modelling gives significant details of structural deformations in the vicinity of the impacted zone this however yields a large number of elements and requires considerable computational resources in addition the shell model contains only a small part of the fish cage and the boundaries are fixed in all degrees of freedom this neglects the interaction between the cage motion and structural deformation for collision scenarios close to the boundaries the resulting resistance may be exaggerated see e g scenario 3 in order to verify the boundaries of the local shell model and to study the global collision response of the fish cage usfos is a viable tool with efficient beam formulations and with good accuracy the fish cage model used in the usfos analysis is shown in fig 5 it is moored with eight mooring lines the ring stiffeners are not modeled but are smeared onto the associated tube the ship with associated mass 7500 tons displacement plus 10 added mass for head on collisions in accordance with norsok n003 2017 is modeled as a concentrated mass connected to the fish cage model with nonlinear springs one for the contact with the stem at forecastle deck and one for the contact with the bulb the force penetration relationships that are assumed for the bulb and the forecastle are shown in fig 28 left they are based on information given by storheim and amdahl 2014 with the same supply vessel model the ship was given an initial speed of 3 6 m s corresponding to a kinetic energy of 53 5 mj after 0 1 s when the gravity and buoyancy forces have been applied the good agreement of the input resistance curve and the resistance obtained from simulations indicates correct implementation notably the bulb has a high resistance to deformation each deformation spring is connected to an elastic spring that allows the contact to unload completely towards the end of the collision the force time histories from the simulation are plotted in fig 28 right the peak force at the forecastle deck and at the bulb location is almost equal but the bulb force has a somewhat longer duration the actual deformations of the bulb and the forecastle are indicated in fig 28 left it is noticed that the deformation of the bulb is only 0 3 m while the stem at forecastle deck undergoes 0 7 m deformation for this force level hence the bulb dissipates only about 1 2 mj while the stem at forecastle deck dissipates approximately 4 8 mj the diagrams show that the bulb and forecastle have spent a considerable time on the elastic unloading part of the deformation curve so accurate modelling of unloading may be essential while the bulb undergoes very little damage the vertical column is subjected to a significant local indentation of 0 75 m approximately 27 of the column diameter as shown in fig 29 left the associated denting energy calculated by usfos is around 4 9 mj and is based on the denting curve given in norsok n004 2004 see fig 29 right according to norsok n004 2004 the dent reduces the plastic moment capacity by 60 this reduction is also realized in the usfos simulations by creating a plastic hinge at the location of the bulb contact from the simulations the total plastic energy dissipated by the ship and local denting is about 11 mj at the time of the maximum impact force for the bulb i e after 1 25 s the fish cage has dissipated 29 mj energy mainly by structural deformation of the column in the hit area the total kinetic energy has been reduced from 53 5 mj to 13 5 mj where the ship contributes with 7 5 mj and the kinetic energy of the fish cage is 6 mj at this stage and is dominated by motion of the hit framework and fish farm rotations while the translational speed of the whole cage is still small 0 15 m s the impulse for the bulb and the forecastle for the entire impact calculated from the force histories in fig 28 right amounts to 18 3 mns and 13 mns respectively thus the impulse should give the vessel a change of velocity equal to roughly 3 8 m s i e the vessel should move with a speed of about 0 2 m s in the opposite direction after collision the plot in fig 30 left confirms this the mass and added mass of the fish farm is 33400 tons hence the fish farm should get a speed of 1 m s which agrees well with the simulated speed at the end of contact the displacement of the cage center column at the end of collision is virtually zero and confirms that the impact is highly impulsive thus the local model will provide reliable information of the collision damage it is interesting to notice that a simple rigid body model would predict the remaining kinetic energy to be 10 6 mj at the end of the first impact period before any partial restitution this is close to the actual value after 2 8 s in fig 30 but it should be recognized that the two bodies do move in opposite direction and not as one body the collision forces for the bulb and the forecastle are plotted versus total vessel displacement in fig 30 right the curves resemble those from local ls dyna simulations in fig 10 fig 31 illustrates the plastic deformations in the fish cage the overall picture resembles that of the local analysis of scenario 1 most of the damage has been absorbed in the locally modeled region the supporting columns connected to transverse tubes act as supporting boundaries and their stress states are far from yielding this shows that it is reasonable to assume clamped conditions at the boundaries members outside the direct contact area are seen to be affected to some extent but the associated energy is negligible compared to the total energy usfos predicts that the thin walled frame at the top center joint undergoes local buckling amounting to approximately 10 of the brace diameter during plastic rotations 6 discussion local shell analysis and global beam analysis have been used to investigate the structural response of the fish farm cage under supply vessel impacts as there is no direct design standard for offshore fish farms against ship impacts established standards and researches for offshore oil and gas may be useful the design of offshore platforms against ship impacts may be carried out in the ductile shared energy or strength design domain dnv rp c204 2016 see fig 32 strength design the installation is strong enough to resist collision forces with minor deformation so that the ship is forced to deform and dissipate the major part of the energy ductility design the installation undergoes large plastic deformation and dissipates the major part of the collision energy shared energy design both the installation and the ship contribute significantly to energy dissipation from the above local and global analysis the relative strength of the ship and the offshore fish cage falls predominantly within the ductile design domain where the fish farm dissipates most of the impact energy through structural deformations in the design of offshore installations against collisions structural damage can be allowed provided that it does not impair the main safety functions and does not lead to progressive collapse of the structure or sinking due to puncturing and flooding of buoyancy compartments further the structure should have sufficient residual strength in damaged condition to resist waves and current loads with a certain return period say 1 year before it can be repaired for fish farms it may also be relevant to introduce a requirement related to net penetration and damage in order to avoid or limit fish escape 7 conclusions this paper presents a combined local and global analysis procedure of supply vessel collisions with an offshore fish farm the striking ship was selected to be a standard offshore supply vessel with a displacement of 7500 tons energy absorption capacity and collapse patterns of the offshore fish farm and the relative strength of the supply vessel and the fish cage were investigated in the local collision analysis the decoupled simulations show that the fish farm is capable of absorbing considerable energy through structural deformations before complete collapse in general the resistance of the fish cage is smaller than that of the striking vessel especially the bulbous bulb and most of the impact energy is dissipated by the fish cage however the column top with a stiffened plate represents a hard spot of the fish farm and is capable of crushing the ship stem significantly the middle column and the transverse tubes are very thin walled with large diameter thickness ratios and are thus susceptible to local buckling and denting this limits the energy that the tubes can dissipate by plastic bending or by crushing the ship bow a single scenario was also analyzed using coupled simulations where ship motions in 6 degrees of freedom were accurately predicted based on potential flow theory for the hydrodynamic loads the analyses showed the striking ship undergoes significant pitch motions in addition the deformed transverse tube is observed to warp around the ship bow and thus constraints further ship motions external dynamic models do not capture the motion locking effect and predicts lower energy than that from the coupled simulation from the global analysis using usfos structural damage of the fish cage mainly concentrates on the impacted region with less damage outside the direct contact area the analysis confirms the major conclusions for energy absorption and structural damage from the local shell analysis possible acceptance criteria for designing offshore fish farms against ship collisions are discussed in view of those adopted for offshore oil and gas structures

introduction deformation of an array shape can affect the performance of beamforming and may degrade the source localization performance of matched field processing kim et al 2009 and array invariant cho and song 2017 additionally acoustic tracking using the time difference of arrival is affected by the inclination angle of the towed array thode 2005 to overcome these limitations the tilt angle of vertical line array vla has been considered as a parameter for matched field processing kim et al 2009 and robust matched field processing methods such as ones based on the frequency difference have been proposed cho and song 2017 worthmann et al 2015 furthermore various acoustic methods have been developed for estimating and compensating for array shape deformation byun et al 2018 cho and song 2017 lee et al 2017 nichols and bradley 2017 rockah and schultheiss 1987 sabra et al 2005 weiss and friedlander 1989 most studies on array shape estimation have focused on towed horizontal arrays lee et al 2017 nichols and bradley 2017 rockah and schultheiss 1987 sabra et al 2005 weiss and friedlander 1989 some studies on vlas have demonstrated the time dependent variation of array tilt byun et al 2018 cho and song 2017 yuan et al 2018 these studies suggest that this variation occurs owing to changes in environmental variability such as ocean surface waves cho and song 2017 and currents byun et al 2018 ocean surface waves induce subsurface buoy motions which can result in an array tilt in the kauai acomms muri 2011 kam11 experiment the array tilt angle of vla was estimated by using an active source cho and song 2017 this study confirmed that the tilt angle is related to the ocean surface waves based on the period of estimated change in array tilt corresponding to the period of the surface waves cho and song 2017 the ocean current not only induces a nonreciprocal effect roux et al 2004 sabra and dowling 2003 wang et al 2003 worcester 1977 worcester et al 1985 zheng et al 1997 but induces a drag force that can be imposed on the array to change the position of the bottom moored array nichols and bradley 2017 in the shallow water acoustic variability experiment 2015 savex 15 the current was assumed to induce array tilt byun et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 according to the estimated tilt direction which corresponded to the measured current trend in other time however the analyzed acoustic data were insufficient to demonstrate the acoustically estimated time varying currents that may match to the measured current variation e g primarily tidal currents varying at semidiurnal tidal period nam et al 2018 hence previous results of studies byun et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 are insufficient to confirm a link between the array tilt and time varying tidal current in the savex 15 we investigated the time varying horizontal current induced array tilt and determine the ground truth by using the current measurements during the savex 15 from year day yd 140 141 because both active acoustic source and ship mounted acoustic doppler current profiler adcp were used simultaneously during this time the relation between the current and array tilt can be obtained by using the acoustic measurements the acoustic data show that the arrival structure in the channel impulse response cir varies with semidiurnal period we assumed that the drag force induced by the current causes the array to tilt under this assumption the ray tracing model results showed a trend similar to the variation in the measured arrival structure the measured acoustic variability was compared with the mean current speed projected with the acoustic path source to receiver array this result supports the hypothesis that the tidal current which dominates the time varying horizontal current has a significant effect on the array tilt in the savex 15 the paper is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the savex 15 section 3 describes the measured acoustic variability section 4 analyzes the relation between acoustic variability and the horizontal current by the arrival time difference section 5 describes the relation between acoustic variability and the time varying current by the time domain beamforming method section 6 concludes the paper 2 savex 15 2 1 experimental description the savex 15 was conducted in the northeastern east china sea during 14 28 may 2015 to collect the acoustic and environmental data and study the coupling of acoustics oceanography and underwater communication in the region the bathymetry of the experimental site was nearly flat around 100 m depth environmental data were measured during the experiment including temperature salinity and density as well as the direction and speed of wind and current vectors the two kinds of active acoustic source towed and moored arrays are used with transmission frequency in the range of 0 5 32 khz byun et al 2018 song et al 2017 2018 yuan et al 2018 park et al 2019 in yearday yd 140 141 the horizontal current vector both speed and direction was measured in a sampling interval of 5 min and depth cell bin size of 8 m for the full water column by using the 150 khz adcp mounted on the r v onnuri the acoustic source was also operated for this time interval fig 1 a depicts the savex 15 experimental region and locations of measurement devices of interest in this study fig 1 b shows the sound speed profile at yd 141 which was measured by a vertical profiling of sea bird electronics 9 11 plus standard conductivity temperature and depth ctd sensor cast 21 two vlas were moored at stations 2 vla1 and 4 vla2 each vla consisted of 16 hydrophones hti 94 ssq at 3 75 m spacing from 24 00 to 80 25 m depth as shown in fig 1 b at the same time a ship tethered source receiver array sra was deployed at station 1 the sra functioned as a source and consisted of 8 transducers itc 1001 in this study we focus on a source at 72 5 m as shown in fig 1 b the horizontal range was approximately 5 88 km between sra and vla1 and approximately 4 82 km between sra and vla2 the linear frequency modulation lfm chirp probe signal was emitted during this time the center frequency of the source signal was 22 khz and its bandwidth was 20 khz the source level was approximately 180 db along the bandwidth the lfm probe signal was repeated 457 times during each transmission each pulse had 60 ms pulse length and a burst period of 120 ms the total transmission time was 54 84 s the lfm signal was transmitted every 37 min past the hour the horizontal current data u zonal and v meridional components in fig 2 a collected using the ship adcp were vertically averaged over water depth ranging from around 20 to 70 m 7 depth cell bins each component is moving averaged over 2 h with 50 overlapping the semidiurnal period is shown distinctly during yd 140 141 this dominant current fluctuations at the semidiurnal tidal principal lunar semidiurnal period and the tidal ellipse are consistent with the results reported in the savex 15 region during yd 135 141 nam et al 2018 and previously hu et al 2016 kang et al 2002 yanagi et al 1997 the trajectory of the horizontal current vector fig 2 b forms the tidal ellipse more aligned into the northwest southeast direction which is consistent with previously known tidal currents in the region hu et al 2016 kang et al 2002 yanagi et al 1997 3 qualitative analysis using acoustic data and ray tracing modeling 3 1 preprocessing for the channel impulse response the cir is employed to show the variation in the arrival time structure with the depth every cir is obtained after matched filter processing on the recorded data before calculating the mean cir per minute at each transmission cycle delay compensation was applied on the measured data at every ping because the sra was tethered to the research vessel which leads to significant arrival time shifts since the research vessel drifted van walree 2013 fig 3 a shows a sample of the cir demonstrating a significant quadratic arrival time fast time shift fig 3 b shows the delay compensated cir for the same time and location as in fig 3 a once this significant delay shift was compensated the acoustic intensity from each ping was averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio which is given by 1 p z h t 1 n i 1 n p i 2 z h t where z is the receiver depth h is the index for hour n is the number of repetitions during the transmission interval is the time series of the matched filtered acoustic pressure at the depth z received at the hth hour slow time and t second fast time delay after gathering p z h t from each receiver at every hour the cir per hour can be obtained 3 2 channel impulse response fig 4 a c and e provide an example of the measured cir after arrival time delay compensation in these figures the structure of measured cir at vla1 changes over time the acoustic intensity of rays with a positive shooting angle toward the sea surface direction is sometimes weaker than that of rays with a negative shooting angle toward the bottom direction and rays with a positive shooting angle are seldom observed in the measured cir because the first bottom reflected signal was strong and the arrival time was easily analyzed we focused on the first bottom reflected signal that is the earliest to arrive at the vla this bottom reflected signal arrives at the vla in a sequence from the element near the seafloor to the element near the surface in fig 4 a the signal which arrives at the element near the 60 m depth seems to be the earliest the curvature of the arrival structure formed by the first bottom reflected signal increases compared to that observed in fig 4 c however when more time has lapsed fig 4 e shows that the arrival time of the first bottom reflected signal is delayed more when the array element is closer to the surface the delayed arrival time decreases the curvature of the arrival structure at the same time the curvature of the arrival structure at vla2 demonstrates a similar period but a different phase compared with that of vla1 at each time not shown in the paper the cir is modeled assuming that the vla tilting direction follows the direction of the current fig 4 b d and f depict the cir modeling results obtained by using ray tracing to model the cir range independent bathymetry was applied and the sound speed profile as shown in fig 1 b was used the ray model calculates each ray tracing under the assumption that the sound speed profile is a piecewise linear function medwin and clay 1997 the color denotes the shooting angle of each ray in degrees in this model the relative sound speed variation induced by the current is neglected because signal strength of rays with a positive shooting angle appear quite weak in the measured data only refracted rays and rays with a negative shooting angle are considered to compare the measured data and modeling results the estimated array tilt angles from other days during the savex 15 byun et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 are used to model the variation in the vla element location the blue circle and the red triangles shown in fig 4 b d and f denote the source depth and relative vla location with the array tilt respectively the vertical array tilt diagrams in fig 4 b d and f show that the change in receiver location in the horizontal direction is more significant than that in the vertical direction to analyze the arrival structure variation of cir we focus on the first bottom arrival ray that have 1 2 shooting angle because these rays show significant similarity between the measured data and the modeled results the modeled cir in fig 4 b represents the case in which the array elements are tilted toward the source i e opposite to the direction of acoustic propagation the curvature of the cir structure in this case is similar to that observed in fig 4 a in case the array elements are tilted away from the source the modeled cir as shown in fig 4 f resembles the results depicted in fig 4 e although there is a slight difference between the modeling results and the measured data which mainly arises owing to the time dependent variations in the sound speed profile the modeling result can qualitatively demonstrate the arrival structure of the cir the eigenray tracing results toward the bottom are shown in fig 5 the receiver depths are 27 75 m 2nd element in figs 5 a 42 75 m 6th element in figs 5 b 69 m 13th element in figs 5 c and 80 25 m 16th element in fig 5 d respectively the number of boundary interactions of each eigenray is limited for easy comparison with the measured data and the array does not tilt in this case the white dashed lines in fig 5 denote the first bottom reflected rays shooting angle of 1 5 in fig 4 d and the arrival time of the first bottom reflected rays is the earliest in this geometry as the boundary interaction including surface and bottom increases the ray path becomes longer lastly the trapped rays with relatively long ray paths in the channel region also reach the receiver the eigenray tracing results according to the receiver depths are entirely consistent with the cir modeling and those would help to understand the acoustic propagation in this region 4 quantitative analysis using parameter and current measurements 4 1 parameter for representing curvature of cir arrival structure to represent the curvature of the cir arrival structure and its variation quantitatively the first arrival first bottom reflected ray time difference between the two receivers is used the 2nd order differentiation of a curve is the usual method to calculate the curvature of the curve however it is difficult to apply the 2nd order differentiation to calculate the curvature in our data because the data from receivers near the surface often do not show distinct arrival owing to the low signal to noise ratio instead the first arrival time difference is effective to show the vertical array tilt effect to simplify the analysis the sound speed profile is set to be constant along depth fig 6 a shows the schematic diagram of the first bottom reflected ray path when the receiver array is not tilted the first bottom reflected rays can be a sample of rays with a negative shooting angle in this case the arrival time difference between two receivers is given by 2 δ t i j l i l j c 1 2 r c z i z j 4 h 2 z s z i z j l i r 2 2 h z s z i 2 where l i is the ray trajectory length between the source and the ith receiver z s is the source depth z i is the depth of the ith receiver r is the range between the source and the receiver and h is the waveguide depth measured from the sea surface to bottom when z j is fixed δ t i j shows a quadratic curve as a function of z i with monotonic behavior when the array is tilted and its angle is θ t fig 6 b which is assumed to be small the variation for every receiver depth can be ignored in this case the arrival time difference between two receivers can be approximated by the taylor series expansion and is given by 3 δ t i j l i l j c δ t i j h z i l i h z j l j r θ δ t i j θ t z j z i c where l i r i 2 2 h z s z i 2 and r i r θ t h z i the final approximation is valid when r l i l j this equation shows that the arrival time varies with the array tilt angle from this analysis the array tilt can be represented by using the arrival time variation which is consistent with the variation in cir arrival structure for instance when the array tilt angle is 3 z i 69 m z j 80 25 m and c 1500 m s then δ t i j δ t i j θ t z j z i c 0 39 ms to calculate the arrival time difference using acoustic data we first obtain the arrival time of rays with a negative shooting angle at the 16th element satisfying a certain threshold since the arrival pattern at the 16th element is usually more apparent than the arrival pattern at other vla elements the arrival time of the signal at the 16th receiver can be easily obtained and it is used as a reference time of signal arrival using this reference value the relative arrival time of the first bottom reflected ray at each receiver is obtained by measuring the time lag between the time windowed data 5 ms this value is used as the parameter for the curvature of cir arrival structure the blue dashed lines with circles in fig 7 indicate the relative arrival time at the 13th element from two vlas if the parameter moves toward a negative value the curvature of the cir arrival structure increases as shown in fig 4 a and b if the parameter moves toward a positive value the curvature of the cir arrival structure decreases as shown in fig 4 e and f the curves in fig 7 show semidiurnal period during the 23 h which are consistent with the measured cir arrival structure trend the results from other receivers 12th 15th also show similar semidiurnal periodicity 4 2 time varying currents projected to the acoustic paths the effects of the ocean current on the acoustic propagation is related to the acoustic path between source and receiver and horizontal direction of the current in previous papers acoustic methods for estimating direction and speed of horizontal current were used to provide the projected values of the acoustic path wang et al 2003 worcester 1977 worcester et al 1985 zheng et al 1997 the curvature variation of cir arrival structure is also affected by current speed in the direction projected to the acoustic path which is given by 5 u p u d where u denotes the horizontal current vector and d denotes the direction of the acoustic path between the source and vla time series of horizontal current speed projected to the acoustic path as a function of time toward the receiver positive or source negative show correlated variations with the cir arrival structure curvature fig 7 proving that our modeling assumption is valid comparing the results of fig 7 a and b the maximum projected mean current speed at vla2 is greater than that at vla1 because the drag is related positively to the current speed the projected current speed could be correlated to the array tilt angle in the acoustic path direction this can be confirmed by comparing parameters for the curvature of the cir arrival structure i e the maximum parameter value for the curvature of the cir arrival structure at vla2 is larger than that at vla1 5 time domain beamforming to represent the effect of time varying current to the acoustic data concretely this section shows the variation in arrival angle of a specific ray using beamforming as shown in fig 6 the arrival angle of the first bottom reflected ray increases with the array tilt angle θ t when array is tilted away from the source hence the array tilt variation represents the arrival angle yuan et al 2018 we use time domain delay and sum beamforming jensen et al 2011 because the analyzed acoustic data are obtained from high frequency broadband signals to calculate time domain beamforming we obtain first bottom reflected rays by appropriate windowing we select a rectangular window and its length is 20 ms the window center is selected as the arrival time of the first bottom reflected ray at the 16th receiver using the first bottom reflected signal the ambiguity surface of the time domain beamforming result b t θ a is obtained by 6 b t θ a i 1 16 s i t τ i θ a 7 τ i θ a z i z 16 sin θ a c where s i t is the windowed signal measured at ith vertical array element and τ i θ a is time delay under a plane wave assumption this assumption is valid when the range between the source and receiver is far enough the acoustic data sampled at 100 khz is upsampled to 400 khz for the time domain beamforming examples of b t θ a are shown in fig 8 a c and the data obtained are identical to those shown in fig 4 a c and e respectively the peak of ambiguity function is marked by the red circle which represents the estimated relative delay and arrival angle of the first bottom reflected ray the estimated arrival angle changes over time and corresponds to the curvature variation of the cir arrival structure hence the arrival angle trend also represents the array tilt effect curvature variation of cir arrival structure for instance the arrival angle of the first bottom reflected ray increases in figs 8 c and fig 4 e shows that the curvature of cir arrival structure decreases at the same time both results represent the array tilt away from the source the time series of estimated arrival angles of the first bottom reflected rays at vla 1 and 2 are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively with the projected mean current speed the variation in the arrival angles are consistent with the projected mean current speed trend which shows that the vertical array tilt induces the variation of arrival angle of specific rays as shown in fig 8 a and b this result is consistent with the comparison between the cir arrival structure variation and horizontal current direction shown in fig 7 a and b from the beamforming result we conclude that the vertical array tilt can be induced by the current 6 conclusion the relation between the array tilt and time varying primarily semidiurnal tidal currents is shown by using active acoustic data the results prove that the curvature of cir arrival structure varies at semidiurnal tidal period under the assumption that the array tilt direction is same with the current flow direction the modeling result using ray tracing shows curvature of cir arrival structure changes with vertical array tilt to parameterize the curvature of cir arrival structure arrival time difference of first bottom reflected ray path measured at the receivers near the bottom is utilized for validation of the assumption the measured currents which are vertically averaged over depth are projected to the direction of acoustic path time series of the projected depth averaged current are consistent with acoustic parameters the parameter for curvature of cir arrival structure and arrival angle of first bottom reflected ray the comparison result of acoustic data and projected currents provides the significant effect of time varying ocean currents such as tidal currents on the acoustic arrival data contributing to field of

2018 cho and song 2017 yuan et al 2018 these studies suggest that this variation occurs owing to changes in environmental variability such as ocean surface waves cho and song 2017 and currents byun et al 2018 ocean surface waves induce subsurface buoy motions which can result in an array tilt in the kauai acomms muri 2011 kam11 experiment the array tilt angle of vla was estimated by using an active source cho and song 2017 this study confirmed that the tilt angle is related to the ocean surface waves based on the period of estimated change in array tilt corresponding to the period of the surface waves cho and song 2017 the ocean current not only induces a nonreciprocal effect roux et al 2004 sabra and dowling 2003 wang et al 2003 worcester 1977 worcester et al 1985 zheng et al 1997 but induces a drag force that can be imposed on the array to change the position of the bottom moored array nichols and bradley 2017 in the shallow water acoustic variability experiment 2015 savex 15 the current was assumed to induce array tilt byun et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 according to the estimated tilt direction which corresponded to the measured current trend in other time however the analyzed acoustic data were insufficient to demonstrate the acoustically estimated time varying currents that may match to the measured current variation e g primarily tidal currents varying at semidiurnal tidal period nam et al 2018 hence previous results of studies byun et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 are insufficient to confirm a link between the array tilt and time varying tidal current in the savex 15 we investigated the time varying horizontal current induced array tilt and determine the ground truth by using the current measurements during the savex 15 from year day yd 140 141 because both active acoustic source and ship mounted acoustic doppler current profiler adcp were used simultaneously during this time the relation between the current and array tilt can be obtained by using the acoustic measurements the acoustic data show that the arrival structure in the channel impulse response cir varies with semidiurnal period we assumed that the drag force induced by the current causes the array to tilt under this assumption the ray tracing model results showed a trend similar to the variation in the measured arrival structure the measured acoustic variability was compared with the mean current speed projected with the acoustic path source to receiver array this result supports the hypothesis that the tidal current which dominates the time varying horizontal current has a significant effect on the array tilt in the savex 15 the paper is organized as follows section 2 summarizes the savex 15 section 3 describes the measured acoustic variability section 4 analyzes the relation between acoustic variability and the horizontal current by the arrival time difference section 5 describes the relation between acoustic variability and the time varying current by the time domain beamforming method section 6 concludes the paper 2 savex 15 2 1 experimental description the savex 15 was conducted in the northeastern east china sea during 14 28 may 2015 to collect the acoustic and environmental data and study the coupling of acoustics oceanography and underwater communication in the region the bathymetry of the experimental site was nearly flat around 100 m depth environmental data were measured during the experiment including temperature salinity and density as well as the direction and speed of wind and current vectors the two kinds of active acoustic source towed and moored arrays are used with transmission frequency in the range of 0 5 32 khz byun et al 2018 song et al 2017 2018 yuan et al 2018 park et al 2019 in yearday yd 140 141 the horizontal current vector both speed and direction was measured in a sampling interval of 5 min and depth cell bin size of 8 m for the full water column by using the 150 khz adcp mounted on the r v onnuri the acoustic source was also operated for this time interval fig 1 a depicts the savex 15 experimental region and locations of measurement devices of interest in this study fig 1 b shows the sound speed profile at yd 141 which was measured by a vertical profiling of sea bird electronics 9 11 plus standard conductivity temperature and depth ctd sensor cast 21 two vlas were moored at stations 2 vla1 and 4 vla2 each vla consisted of 16 hydrophones hti 94 ssq at 3 75 m spacing from 24 00 to 80 25 m depth as shown in fig 1 b at the same time a ship tethered source receiver array sra was deployed at station 1 the sra functioned as a source and consisted of 8 transducers itc 1001 in this study we focus on a source at 72 5 m as shown in fig 1 b the horizontal range was approximately 5 88 km between sra and vla1 and approximately 4 82 km between sra and vla2 the linear frequency modulation lfm chirp probe signal was emitted during this time the center frequency of the source signal was 22 khz and its bandwidth was 20 khz the source level was approximately 180 db along the bandwidth the lfm probe signal was repeated 457 times during each transmission each pulse had 60 ms pulse length and a burst period of 120 ms the total transmission time was 54 84 s the lfm signal was transmitted every 37 min past the hour the horizontal current data u zonal and v meridional components in fig 2 a collected using the ship adcp were vertically averaged over water depth ranging from around 20 to 70 m 7 depth cell bins each component is moving averaged over 2 h with 50 overlapping the semidiurnal period is shown distinctly during yd 140 141 this dominant current fluctuations at the semidiurnal tidal principal lunar semidiurnal period and the tidal ellipse are consistent with the results reported in the savex 15 region during yd 135 141 nam et al 2018 and previously hu et al 2016 kang et al 2002 yanagi et al 1997 the trajectory of the horizontal current vector fig 2 b forms the tidal ellipse more aligned into the northwest southeast direction which is consistent with previously known tidal currents in the region hu et al 2016 kang et al 2002 yanagi et al 1997 3 qualitative analysis using acoustic data and ray tracing modeling 3 1 preprocessing for the channel impulse response the cir is employed to show the variation in the arrival time structure with the depth every cir is obtained after matched filter processing on the recorded data before calculating the mean cir per minute at each transmission cycle delay compensation was applied on the measured data at every ping because the sra was tethered to the research vessel which leads to significant arrival time shifts since the research vessel drifted van walree 2013 fig 3 a shows a sample of the cir demonstrating a significant quadratic arrival time fast time shift fig 3 b shows the delay compensated cir for the same time and location as in fig 3 a once this significant delay shift was compensated the acoustic intensity from each ping was averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio which is given by 1 p z h t 1 n i 1 n p i 2 z h t where z is the receiver depth h is the index for hour n is the number of repetitions during the transmission interval is the time series of the matched filtered acoustic pressure at the depth z received at the hth hour slow time and t second fast time delay after gathering p z h t from each receiver at every hour the cir per hour can be obtained 3 2 channel impulse response fig 4 a c and e provide an example of the measured cir after arrival time delay compensation in these figures the structure of measured cir at vla1 changes over time the acoustic intensity of rays with a positive shooting angle toward the sea surface direction is sometimes weaker than that of rays with a negative shooting angle toward the bottom direction and rays with a positive shooting angle are seldom observed in the measured cir because the first bottom reflected signal was strong and the arrival time was easily analyzed we focused on the first bottom reflected signal that is the earliest to arrive at the vla this bottom reflected signal arrives at the vla in a sequence from the element near the seafloor to the element near the surface in fig 4 a the signal which arrives at the element near the 60 m depth seems to be the earliest the curvature of the arrival structure formed by the first bottom reflected signal increases compared to that observed in fig 4 c however when more time has lapsed fig 4 e shows that the arrival time of the first bottom reflected signal is delayed more when the array element is closer to the surface the delayed arrival time decreases the curvature of the arrival structure at the same time the curvature of the arrival structure at vla2 demonstrates a similar period but a different phase compared with that of vla1 at each time not shown in the paper the cir is modeled assuming that the vla tilting direction follows the direction of the current fig 4 b d and f depict the cir modeling results obtained by using ray tracing to model the cir range independent bathymetry was applied and the sound speed profile as shown in fig 1 b was used the ray model calculates each ray tracing under the assumption that the sound speed profile is a piecewise linear function medwin and clay 1997 the color denotes the shooting angle of each ray in degrees in this model the relative sound speed variation induced by the current is neglected because signal strength of rays with a positive shooting angle appear quite weak in the measured data only refracted rays and rays with a negative shooting angle are considered to compare the measured data and modeling results the estimated array tilt angles from other days during the savex 15 byun et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 are used to model the variation in the vla element location the blue circle and the red triangles shown in fig 4 b d and f denote the source depth and relative vla location with the array tilt respectively the vertical array tilt diagrams in fig 4 b d and f show that the change in receiver location in the horizontal direction is more significant than that in the vertical direction to analyze the arrival structure variation of cir we focus on the first bottom arrival ray that have 1 2 shooting angle because these rays show significant similarity between the measured data and the modeled results the modeled cir in fig 4 b represents the case in which the array elements are tilted toward the source i e opposite to the direction of acoustic propagation the curvature of the cir structure in this case is similar to that observed in fig 4 a in case the array elements are tilted away from the source the modeled cir as shown in fig 4 f resembles the results depicted in fig 4 e although there is a slight difference between the modeling results and the measured data which mainly arises owing to the time dependent variations in the sound speed profile the modeling result can qualitatively demonstrate the arrival structure of the cir the eigenray tracing results toward the bottom are shown in fig 5 the receiver depths are 27 75 m 2nd element in figs 5 a 42 75 m 6th element in figs 5 b 69 m 13th element in figs 5 c and 80 25 m 16th element in fig 5 d respectively the number of boundary interactions of each eigenray is limited for easy comparison with the measured data and the array does not tilt in this case the white dashed lines in fig 5 denote the first bottom reflected rays shooting angle of 1 5 in fig 4 d and the arrival time of the first bottom reflected rays is the earliest in this geometry as the boundary interaction including surface and bottom increases the ray path becomes longer lastly the trapped rays with relatively long ray paths in the channel region also reach the receiver the eigenray tracing results according to the receiver depths are entirely consistent with the cir modeling and those would help to understand the acoustic propagation in this region 4 quantitative analysis using parameter and current measurements 4 1 parameter for representing curvature of cir arrival structure to represent the curvature of the cir arrival structure and its variation quantitatively the first arrival first bottom reflected ray time difference between the two receivers is used the 2nd order differentiation of a curve is the usual method to calculate the curvature of the curve however it is difficult to apply the 2nd order differentiation to calculate the curvature in our data because the data from receivers near the surface often do not show distinct arrival owing to the low signal to noise ratio instead the first arrival time difference is effective to show the vertical array tilt effect to simplify the analysis the sound speed profile is set to be constant along depth fig 6 a shows the schematic diagram of the first bottom reflected ray path when the receiver array is not tilted the first bottom reflected rays can be a sample of rays with a negative shooting angle in this case the arrival time difference between two receivers is given by 2 δ t i j l i l j c 1 2 r c z i z j 4 h 2 z s z i z j l i r 2 2 h z s z i 2 where l i is the ray trajectory length between the source and the ith receiver z s is the source depth z i is the depth of the ith receiver r is the range between the source and the receiver and h is the waveguide depth measured from the sea surface to bottom when z j is fixed δ t i j shows a quadratic curve as a function of z i with monotonic behavior when the array is tilted and its angle is θ t fig 6 b which is assumed to be small the variation for every receiver depth can be ignored in this case the arrival time difference between two receivers can be approximated by the taylor series expansion and is given by 3 δ t i j l i l j c δ t i j h z i l i h z j l j r θ δ t i j θ t z j z i c where l i r i 2 2 h z s z i 2 and r i r θ t h z i the final approximation is valid when r l i l j this equation shows that the arrival time varies with the array tilt angle from this analysis the array tilt can be represented by using the arrival time variation which is consistent with the variation in cir arrival structure for instance when the array tilt angle is 3 z i 69 m z j 80 25 m and c 1500 m s then δ t i j δ t i j θ t z j z i c 0 39 ms to calculate the arrival time difference using acoustic data we first obtain the arrival time of rays with a negative shooting angle at the 16th element satisfying a certain threshold since the arrival pattern at the 16th element is usually more apparent than the arrival pattern at other vla elements the arrival time of the signal at the 16th receiver can be easily obtained and it is used as a reference time of signal arrival using this reference value the relative arrival time of the first bottom reflected ray at each receiver is obtained by measuring the time lag between the time windowed data 5 ms this value is used as the parameter for the curvature of cir arrival structure the blue dashed lines with circles in fig 7 indicate the relative arrival time at the 13th element from two vlas if the parameter moves toward a negative value the curvature of the cir arrival structure increases as shown in fig 4 a and b if the parameter moves toward a positive value the curvature of the cir arrival structure decreases as shown in fig 4 e and f the curves in fig 7 show semidiurnal period during the 23 h which are consistent with the measured cir arrival structure trend the results from other receivers 12th 15th also show similar semidiurnal periodicity 4 2 time varying currents projected to the acoustic paths the effects of the ocean current on the acoustic propagation is related to the acoustic path between source and receiver and horizontal direction of the current in previous papers acoustic methods for estimating direction and speed of horizontal current were used to provide the projected values of the acoustic path wang et al 2003 worcester 1977 worcester et al 1985 zheng et al 1997 the curvature variation of cir arrival structure is also affected by current speed in the direction projected to the acoustic path which is given by 5 u p u d where u denotes the horizontal current vector and d denotes the direction of the acoustic path between the source and vla time series of horizontal current speed projected to the acoustic path as a function of time toward the receiver positive or source negative show correlated variations with the cir arrival structure curvature fig 7 proving that our modeling assumption is valid comparing the results of fig 7 a and b the maximum projected mean current speed at vla2 is greater than that at vla1 because the drag is related positively to the current speed the projected current speed could be correlated to the array tilt angle in the acoustic path direction this can be confirmed by comparing parameters for the curvature of the cir arrival structure i e the maximum parameter value for the curvature of the cir arrival structure at vla2 is larger than that at vla1 5 time domain beamforming to represent the effect of time varying current to the acoustic data concretely this section shows the variation in arrival angle of a specific ray using beamforming as shown in fig 6 the arrival angle of the first bottom reflected ray increases with the array tilt angle θ t when array is tilted away from the source hence the array tilt variation represents the arrival angle yuan et al 2018 we use time domain delay and sum beamforming jensen et al 2011 because the analyzed acoustic data are obtained from high frequency broadband signals to calculate time domain beamforming we obtain first bottom reflected rays by appropriate windowing we select a rectangular window and its length is 20 ms the window center is selected as the arrival time of the first bottom reflected ray at the 16th receiver using the first bottom reflected signal the ambiguity surface of the time domain beamforming result b t θ a is obtained by 6 b t θ a i 1 16 s i t τ i θ a 7 τ i θ a z i z 16 sin θ a c where s i t is the windowed signal measured at ith vertical array element and τ i θ a is time delay under a plane wave assumption this assumption is valid when the range between the source and receiver is far enough the acoustic data sampled at 100 khz is upsampled to 400 khz for the time domain beamforming examples of b t θ a are shown in fig 8 a c and the data obtained are identical to those shown in fig 4 a c and e respectively the peak of ambiguity function is marked by the red circle which represents the estimated relative delay and arrival angle of the first bottom reflected ray the estimated arrival angle changes over time and corresponds to the curvature variation of the cir arrival structure hence the arrival angle trend also represents the array tilt effect curvature variation of cir arrival structure for instance the arrival angle of the first bottom reflected ray increases in figs 8 c and fig 4 e shows that the curvature of cir arrival structure decreases at the same time both results represent the array tilt away from the source the time series of estimated arrival angles of the first bottom reflected rays at vla 1 and 2 are shown in fig 9 a and b respectively with the projected mean current speed the variation in the arrival angles are consistent with the projected mean current speed trend which shows that the vertical array tilt induces the variation of arrival angle of specific rays as shown in fig 8 a and b this result is consistent with the comparison between the cir arrival structure variation and horizontal current direction shown in fig 7 a and b from the beamforming result we conclude that the vertical array tilt can be induced by the current 6 conclusion the relation between the array tilt and time varying primarily semidiurnal tidal currents is shown by using active acoustic data the results prove that the curvature of cir arrival structure varies at semidiurnal tidal period under the assumption that the array tilt direction is same with the current flow direction the modeling result using ray tracing shows curvature of cir arrival structure changes with vertical array tilt to parameterize the curvature of cir arrival structure arrival time difference of first bottom reflected ray path measured at the receivers near the bottom is utilized for validation of the assumption the measured currents which are vertically averaged over depth are projected to the direction of acoustic path time series of the projected depth averaged current are consistent with acoustic parameters the parameter for curvature of cir arrival structure and arrival angle of first bottom reflected ray the comparison result of acoustic data and projected currents provides the significant effect of time varying ocean currents such as tidal currents on the acoustic arrival data contributing to field of
